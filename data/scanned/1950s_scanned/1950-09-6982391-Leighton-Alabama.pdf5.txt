LEIGHTON, ALABAMA

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT - SEPTEMBER 6, 1952

On 6 September 1952, at approximately 2020 hours, Mr. James Leighton, of Leighton, Alabama, reported that he and his family observed a bright, metallic, disc-shaped object in the sky. 

Mr. Leighton stated that he was outside his home when he observed the object approaching from the northwest. The object was described as being approximately 50 feet in diameter and moving at a high rate of speed. It was reported to have hovered momentarily, then accelerated and made a sharp turn, disappearing from sight to the southeast.

The object was observed by Mr. Leighton, his wife, and three children. No sound was reported. Mr. Leighton attempted to photograph the object, but was unsuccessful due to the rapid movement of the object.
