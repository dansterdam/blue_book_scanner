If you saw a row of yellow lights as you looked up from your house, would you take it to be a blimp?
No. You might see some light in a blimp, but it would be pretty dim.
Did you have a blimp out that night?
No.
Any other blimp base in the general area?
Not that I know. We used to have one in Detroit last year.
Would that blimp be required to carry red and green lights as standard equipment?
Yes. It also had a sign on the side - we have these advertising frames; if you have 30 lights in a row, you can get, such, a view of 30 lights in a row.
Would green and red lights be required and usable?
Yes - these distance (long) you might not see them.
