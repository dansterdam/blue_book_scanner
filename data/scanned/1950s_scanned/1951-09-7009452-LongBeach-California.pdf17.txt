At the time this matter was referred to this office, the 27th Air Division had published an Intelligence Report which sets forth the following information:
On 23 September 1951, at 16:02, an object was sighted and reported over Long Beach, California, at an altitude of 50,000 feet. Four (4) F-86 were dispatched to investigate the object but were unable to reach it because of its high speed and altitude. The object was described as round, silver in color, with a constant steady rate in the vicinity. No trails or exhaust were observed, indicating that it was not a swept-wing, fighter-type aircraft.
Weather balloons in the vicinity were at 30,000 feet altitude, and the object's altitude was estimated to be 20,000 feet above them, or approximately 50,000 feet.
The incident that was sighted was observed by Captain J. R. STEELE, Chief Controller, ADCC, from Mojave, and verified by Major MEILZE, Operations Officer, 732nd AC&W Squadron.
Major MEILZER checked towards ATC for any known flights in the area at that time, and no conventional aircraft had been confirmed that could be this object. Captains IOYEM, UYEOKA, and George AFB Operations had been alerted and reported that no flights were in the area.
Major MANUSSEIER, OIC of the 729th AC&W Squadron, located at Edwards AFB, whose squadrons cover the area, stated that no activity till 2000 hours had been experienced with T-33 and X-F6 N.A.D.C. The Boeing with the D-558, and Northrop with the X-3, had been grounded for the day.
