Gentlemen:

Enclosed is a copy of a sight picture that I took of the Washington, D.C. area. I am sending the print as you requested, but have no idea what this object is. Since the picture is a time exposure, it could not be a reflection or streaks of light, would appear on the print similar to those made by cars on the roads.

The picture was made on the evening of April 8, 1952 at approximately 2330 hours. During the entire exposure time I noted nothing moving in the sky.

Exposure data: 20 minutes at f 4.5, Eastman Super XX film. Camera: Leica with a 1.5 f/2 lens, Poster tans.

Any information you can give me on this would be appreciated. I would prefer that you do not publish this picture as I have plans to do so myself. If I do not receive word from you to the contrary within 10 days I shall assume that you have no objection to such publication and go ahead with my plans.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
