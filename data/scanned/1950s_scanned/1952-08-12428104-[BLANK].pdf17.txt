VII PRE-1947 UAO REPORTS
Early-morning pre-1947--reports are rich and varied, and fall consistently, like modern sightings, into three categories: luminous balls; saucer-shaped objects; cigar-shaped objects.

AVIATION NOTES: TIME. In a recent article, mentioned the celebrated "airship" reported seen in 1896-97 by thousands of people from Oakland, Calif., to Chicago, and printed part of a clipping about it from the New York HERALD of 11 April 1897. READERS DIGEST, in an article in its July 1952 issue, "Flying Saucers Are Few in Name Only," mentioned reported UAO sightings in 1913, 1904, 1897 (the same one mentioned by TIME), 1962, and 1970. These references give a substantial impression that LIFE and READERS DIGEST had extensively researched the subject of early UAO sightings. These eminent magazines, however, for all their reputations for thoroughness and their large research staffs, barely scratched the surface of this rich and extraordinarily interesting subject.

It is rather widely believed that the now-famous "Arnold Report" of 24 June 1947* was the first UAO report. Actually, reported UAO sightings go back-well over a century and possibly to old testament days. Almost all "early sightings," as they have been short-titled by the Air Force, fall into the same main categories that the modern sightings fall into: luminous balls, saucer-shaped objects, or cigar-shaped objects.

The AIR INTELLIGENCE DIGEST requests its readers to make their own evaluations of these early reports. Were they - as many modern sightings have turned out to be - illusions, mistaken identifications, or hoaxes?
