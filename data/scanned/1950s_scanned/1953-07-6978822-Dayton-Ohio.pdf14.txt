The image does not contain any photographs, only a handwritten document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Penny
f. Half dollar
g. Silver dollar
h. Basketball
i. Grapefruit
j. Baseball
k. Other

22.1 (Circle One of the following that indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
1. Fairly certain 
2. Not very sure
3. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Slowly, rapidly, suddenly, behind something, etc.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what material would you have to make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it take? In fact, go into as much detail as you can in describing how you would construct the object if you had the opportunity to do so.

I would have to be a circular object, slightly larger than a basketball, with no vapor trails. I can't think of any other materials or details to construct it precisely. There were no other visual cues that I could use to make a accurate representation of what I saw. It appeared and disappeared rapidly, and left no other visible signs.
