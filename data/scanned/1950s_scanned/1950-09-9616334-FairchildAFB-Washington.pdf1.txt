11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was a brilliant white light approaching the car from the Northeast. The light was moving at "high speed" and came at the car directly as though it was going to hit. According to observers, the light increased in size (from that of an auto headlight) to a very large size, making a fiery trail appearing in various color other than bluish-white which is what it was initially.
