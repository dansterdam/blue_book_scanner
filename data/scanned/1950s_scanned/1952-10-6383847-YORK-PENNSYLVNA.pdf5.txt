SUMMARY: Civilian observer reported observing an unidentified flying object. The object was described as bright silver in color and moved at a high rate of speed. It was visible for approximately 1-2 minutes.

The observer stated that he heard no sound from the object. The object followed a level flight path, but appeared to accelerate rapidly as it climbed and disappeared from view. According to the observer, the object was not a balloon, airplane, or other known aerial vehicle.

This case offers no definite explanation of the sighting. The observer appears to be a credible witness, but without additional information, a positive identification of the object cannot be made.
