TEXT:
LCDR J. T. DUIS, JR., USN, OFFICER ATTACHED TO USNTF-57 AND RESIDING IN THE QUARTERS AT THE NAVAL AUXILIARY AIR STATION, IMPERIAL BEACH, CALIFORNIA, REPORTED THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 1930, 16 NOV '52, HE OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT OVER IMPERIAL BEACH. 
LCDR DUIS STATED THAT HE WAS STANDING OUTSIDE HIS QUARTERS WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY A PECULIAR ORANGE DISCOLORATION OF THE EVENING SKY TO THE SOUTHEAST. HE THEN OBSERVED A BRIGHT ORANGE DISK OF LIGHT, SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN THE FULL MOON AND SURROUNDED BY A BLUISH-GREEN HALO, MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE IN A NORTHWESTERLY DIRECTION AT A FAIRLY SLOW RATE OF SPEED. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 2000 TO 3000 FEET AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AFTER TRAVELING FOR ABOUT 7 TO 50 SECONDS. NO SOUND WAS HEARD.
LCDR DUIS STATES THAT THE OBJECT WAS DEFINITELY NOT AN AIRCRAFT, JET OR OTHERWISE, AND THAT HE IS FAMILIAR WITH ALL TYPES OF AIRCRAFT BOTH COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY. HE FURTHER STATED THAT HE IS NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON TO BECOME EXCITED OVER NATURAL PHENOMENA OR TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS REGARDING UNUSUAL AERIAL OBJECTS. LCDR DUIS IMPRESSED THIS OFFICER AS A CAREFUL AND RELIABLE OBSERVER.
IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS OFFICE THAT LCDR DUIS' SIGHTING CONSTITUTES A BONA FIDE REPORT OF AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT.
