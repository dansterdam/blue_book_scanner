REPORT OF INTERVIEW WITH MR. _____

The purpose of this report is to describe the results and impressions obtained by the undersigned during an interview on 26 March 1958 with Mr. _____ of Dallas, Texas, and his nephew, Mr. _____. 

Mr. _____ also of Dallas, The interview was concerned with the subject of an unidentified flying object reported by the two gentlemen on 6 January 1958.

The witness stated that initially as they were driving along the field, their attention was attracted toward the sky in the general direction of the object. It is also stated at the outset that Mr. _____ recently suffered a nervous breakdown and may not have been at peak mental condition during the interview.

However, Mr. _____ appeared perfectly sound in every respect. 

The general impression obtained from the interview was that the reliability of the initial sighting should be reconsidered in the light of the facts that was stated in this report.

At the time of the initial report, both men stated that they had "seen" the object. However, when asked at this interview what they had seen they replied that they could not be sure. "We may have been an illusion, we are not sure." Though they reported initially the the object had fallen "straight down", it is also stated that they admitted to they could not tell for certain what they had seen that day.

As to the size of the object, which was initially reported as being "24 inches in diameter", they stated that it was impossible to estimate the size with any accuracy, saying that it could have been "as big as a television set" or much smaller.

In conclusion, it would appear that the initial sighting by these two gentlemen, who reportedly were in an excited state, requires further and more detailed study before any definite conclusions can be drawn. The irregularity in shape and that it was glowing only on the underside, both aspects that the observer stated they noticed, are irregular phenomena requiring more explanation. But the matter was a thing of the past, that they were not particularly concerned about it, either only, and that they were not particularly interested in the disposition of their reports.
