Text transcribed from the document:

AFFIDAVIT

This is to certify that I, [redacted], of the right of free press do hereby swear that on the night of January 9, 1953, I saw an object which in my knowledge was a flying saucer. I was riding in Warrren Anderson's car between 7:30 and 8 pm. The object was in sight for about 15 to 20 seconds. It was five miles away, and it came right at us, and when it was too 500 feet over the top and directly opposite me, it started to climb at a tremendous speed. It continued to climb until out of sight. It was approximately 50 to 100 feet above the ground. The object was silver in color with a bright light from the bottom.

The weather conditions were clear, a bright moonlight night, with a slight wind.

The object appeared from the south-east and headed towards the north-west. It was in sight for approximately 15 to 20 seconds. I estimate that it was in my sight for approximately 5 miles away from me. I estimate that it was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, therefore I estimate the speed at 3600 miles per hour.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 7 day of January, 1953.
