RE: Prime Source in Levelland UFO Case
During the course of the investigation at Levelland, all witnesses possible were made to locate the truck driver and identify him. Newspaper reports, sources did not live in Levelland and could not be contacted by the sheriff or Hockley County to be contacted by them.
