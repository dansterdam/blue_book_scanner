Sergeant. UFO REPORT (INITIAL CIR6 181 -H6)
To: AFOJS-3
Attn: Maj. Teeter,
The following findings and conclusions of this case are submitted for your consideration:

A. THIS REPORT OF ANY UFO IS UNIDENTIFIED WHATSOEVER
B. MANY FEATURES FROM GUAM ON A NIGHTLY REPORT BACK TO OCTOBER OF THAT YEAR.
C. THE OBJECT 600-1000 FEET IN DIAMETER WAS ILLUMINATED WITHIN AND CONTAINED MANY DARK AREAS SHAPED LIKE WINDOWS AND ENTRY-EXITS
D. ATTEMPTS OF AIR FORCE PERSONNEL TO LOCATE THE OBJECT WERE FRUITLESS. TWO YEARS OF INVESTIGATION OF THESE REPORTS HAVE YIELDED NOTHING CONCLUSIVE
E. FLIGHT INDICATED ONLY THAT IT MAINTAINED A CONSTANT COURSE AT VARYING SPEEDS WHICH EXCEED PRESENT JET ENGINED AIRCRAFT
F. BASED ON NUMEROUS EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS AND EXACT MEASUREMENTS WHICH COULD BE DETERMINED, WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THESE SIGHTINGS REPRESENT SOMETHING OF AN ORDER COMPLETELY UNFAMILIAR TO PRESENT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
