NO Case (Information Only)       18 June 1957
                                off San Francisco, California

THREE LIGHTS IN FORMATION SEEN
Investigation  of this Incident

They were large, round objects, flying in a formation of three, the crew of a hoeing Line freighter, returning to San Francisco International Airport, first sighted at approximately 11:30 p.m. PS.T. on June 18, 1957. 

Capt. C. C. Martin, skipper of the freighter, reported that the objects were brilliantly lighted, moving faster than jets, and about 3,000 feet higher than his aircraft at that time. He estimated their speed at about 800 mph.

Chief Pilot Roy Mallon, who sighted the objects through the cockpit windows, described them as enormous, diffusing a cold, white light, and maneuvering in formation until they disappeared from view.

NCAP has asked for detailed reports from the United Air Lines and other commercial airlines which may have had similar observations. Military and commercial aviation officials have been requested to report any such sightings.
