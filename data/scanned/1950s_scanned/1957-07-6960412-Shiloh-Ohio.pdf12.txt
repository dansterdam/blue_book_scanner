The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a "Disposition Form" related to the examination of a meteorite.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.                   SUBJECT: Examination of Meteorite
TO     AFCIN-4E4  ATTN: Capt. Gregory    FROM   AFCIN-4E2
1. Reference is made to discussions between Captain Gregory relative to the meteorite sample in the possession of your organization.
2. The sample in our possession is unquestionably a meteorite, but appears to be somewhat identifiable. An examination in this case would have no scientific value from the standpoint of UFO.
3. Although there has been a bit of study of meteorites in connection with heat-transfer as applied to guided missiles, these studies have been made on general meteoroid problems and not specifically on this meteorite. For this reason this sample will be submitted to White Stork.
4. Disposition analysis does not appear warranted, since all of the story categories fall into the same category. The Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., can furnish the general analysis of all story type meteorites.
5. Dr. H.H. Nininger, Assistant Meteorite Museum, Denver, Colorado, could make full assessment to assure the monetary value of this meteorite.
6. A full report will be furnished your office on receipt from White Stork.
