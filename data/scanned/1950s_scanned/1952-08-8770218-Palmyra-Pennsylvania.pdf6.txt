On 25 August 1952 at 2210 hours, John L. Spitsbergen, Palmyra, Pennsylvania, reported sighting an unidentified flying object. Spitsbergen stated that he and three other persons observed a "mysterious object" which appeared to be cigar-shaped, with a white light attached and a red flashing light on the rear. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes and was estimated to be about 1,500 feet in the air. 

Three other witnesses also reported seeing the object. The investigator concluded that the object was most likely a weather balloon, but could not definitely identify it. The weather at the time was clear with 15 mile visibility.

This office can offer no definite explanation as to the identity of the object. It would appear that a weather balloon is still a strong possibility.
