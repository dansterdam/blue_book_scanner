Capt. February 14, 1952

I think it is highly unlikely that your sighting represents a non-terrestrial UFO, merely because the sighting fits the generally accepted pattern of the now familiar phenomenon. There is no certainty in reaching this conclusion. This is essentially a matter of opinion, based on the reasons for disbelief in this case which are as follows:

I do not think it was usefully commented on your description of a saucer-like object which was about the size of a basketball, moving at a high rate of speed with a number of oscillations or pulsations. One thing that it does not imply is that inertia can be nullified or overcome by some mechanism not subject to severe acceleration, in one direction would be only momentarily. Such mechanism would seem to require a departure from the laws of physics as we know them. Any rapid acceleration or deceleration in this direction would undoubtedly impose severe physiological stresses on any living creatures aboard. If you contend that there were no such effects this would cause the occupants to be thrown against one side of the interior, it would seem to me that such an effect would be highly improbable, if not physically impossible.

With respect to your question about charge of a single sizer, this is a very disperse. Only in the distant narrow sense, as in a vacuum tube, and usually only for the presence of a passing charged body, can you get a beam of charges of a single kind. The repulsive forces of these charges usually cancel out, so that no beam would be the normal result.
