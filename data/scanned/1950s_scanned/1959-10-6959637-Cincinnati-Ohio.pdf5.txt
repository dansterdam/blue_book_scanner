The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marked on it, and a "B" on the same curved line. This sketch is meant to illustrate how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it, and how high the object was above the horizon.

The second and third sketches are larger and depict a landscape scene. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road, with a curved horizon line and mountains or other structures in the background. The third sketch shows a similar landscape, but from a different perspective, with a person standing in the foreground and the horizon and landscape features in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
