The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with two points labeled "A" and "B" to illustrate how high an object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second and third sketches show larger scenes, including a person standing on a road and a landscape view, with instructions on how to use the smaller sketches as examples to complete the larger ones.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
