bit unfortunate for me sometimes that I can see so much but un under the
circumstances uh uh it may have been very fortunate for the part.
then this Gyro lab and guidance lab now there could have
been serious delay further details of the Atlas and I feel personally that this
may have been the case. I feel even personally that the uh uh this whole thing
may have been played as a prize piece of sabotage.
These things uh over a period of time can grind big projects to a

Now, when I worked for RCA some of the things that happened to me
when I was on Ascension, I received calls trying to get me to take uh test
leads and other things from the G Pan American Supply that have been turned

things thrown away. This was some old bait in getting a man to take some
salvaged government property and of course you are not going to catch an
older soldier on a gag like that. These are some of the gags and tricks xxx
that were tried on me and it seems like some xxxxxxx way or another or another in uh
times like this that there always been some little inner thought or something
