CALCULATIONS (CONT.)

FIG. 1
ALTITUDE = a
CA = b = a 
DISTANCE TO OBJECT = c = 5312/737' = a
a2 - c2 = 2a2 = 5312/737' 
a = 3756'/563.5'

y = SPEED = 5312' PER 2 SECONDS = 2656'
y = 3.656' PER SECOND
y = 218.10 MPH
y = 271 MPH

FIG. 2
The calculated speed is 218.0 mph, assuming that the object in the distance was 5312 feet in diameter - a commonly acceptable altitude. The distance to the object would be 3756 feet. The diameter of the object was 30 feet. So, the object was only 30 feet in diameter but the distance from the observer was 3756 feet, and the altitude 563.5 feet. According to this data, the object was traveling at 271 mph at an altitude of only 563.5 feet. In my mind this report based on eyewitness testimony seems to prove that there are some reports that cannot be explained. While the most of the unexplained reports may not prove the existence of visitants from other planets, this particular case seems to point in that direction.

An Air Force captain--radar specialist--stated on the program "Unidentified Flying Objects" on the American Broadcasting Company network that "Unidentified flying objects have been sighted and tracked on the radar screens of the United States and her allies in many parts of the world, and positively identified as such by competent and experienced personnel. Similarly... of the extra-territorial research organization into to co-operate fully with the U.S. Air Force in its studies."
