Case 164. Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, July 19, 1956----Two Cincinnati witnesses observed a circular object "it up like a lantern" pacing an air transport plane heading over Kenton County Airport, Kentucky. They said the object was bigger than the plane. It performed a series of turns and flights shown by the aircraft, and when the plane landed the object continued its course. Both sighters had been skeptical of saucers, but were changing their minds.
