"33. If you may add a touch of levity to this discussion of UFO cases, we have knowledge of a rather fantastic case that has never been reported to us. UFO writers and clubs refer to it as the "Hopkinsville Case". Briefly, as the story goes, in 1955 a family near Hopkinsville, Kentucky was subjected to an all-night attack by green-goblin-like creatures which emerged from a "flying saucer" nearby. Shot-guns and rifles proved ineffective against these creatures who tried to enter the family's cabin. They left upon the break of dawn. This is a reproduction of the creatures, as allegedly sworn to by all 12 members of the family. We have been informed by a reliable contact that a book is being written on the case, and that the Air Force will be asked to officially comment, before the book is released."
