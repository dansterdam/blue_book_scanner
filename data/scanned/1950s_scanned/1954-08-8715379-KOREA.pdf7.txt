The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The document is an "Air Intelligence Information Report" dated August 8, 1954, and it provides details about an observation of an unidentified aerial object over Korea in 1954.

Text from the document:

ON 31 AUGUST 1954, A REPORT WAS RECEIVED FROM KOREA THAT ON 15 AUGUST 1954, AT APPROXIMATELY 1930 HOURS, A BRIGHT UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS OBSERVED IN THE SKY OVER PYONGYANG, KOREA. THIS OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL WITNESSES FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 AND 1/2 MINUTES. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHT ROUND LIGHT ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL, TRAVELING AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND MAKING SEVERAL SHARP TURNS AND CHANGES IN ALTITUDE. ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE OBJECT, BUT IT MOVED TOO FAST TO OBTAIN RECOGNIZABLE PICTURES. THE OBJECT EVENTUALLY APPEARED TO MOVE OUT OF SIGHT.
