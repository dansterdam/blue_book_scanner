UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT REPORT

The time was 18 minutes till 4:00 P.M., Monday, 25 August 1952. I was coming from the stock room to the Draft Room. Just as we made the door toward I looked north of the watch tower, and I noticed two objects in the sky, and it was going too fast. I stopped the truck and took a good look at it, I told it was about three or four times and looked to see what it was it was no balloon because a balloon floats in the air real slow. This thing in the way that thing was going. As I called my pal, and then it pointed its out to him. It was circling the whole area. The thing than a jet and the sun was real low. The thing was going faster than a jet and was silhouetted by the setting sun. The object looked round and flat compared to the body of an army airplane or anything like that.
