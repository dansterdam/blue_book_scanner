Case 231, Springdale, Ohio, Oct. 9, 1956 - By phone Mrs. James Posey reported the following in brief: For approximately 15 minutes she and her husband, James, stood at their kitchen window watching a strange object in the sky. It was difficult to watch them all, she said, as they started up and then came side to side. Strange colors of red and green were observed in the object. When it finally disappeared behind some trees, it was an astounding sight, said Mrs. Posey.

Later, to the surprise of the witness, a countless number of red objects, swarming like bees, came in from the east. Flying in a straight horizontal line, the objects soon disappeared behind some trees. It was an astounding sight, said Mrs. Posey.
