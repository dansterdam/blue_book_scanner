Sir:
Late in the afternoon I seen
an object over "L.B.I." I don't
know if this is important or
not. But, in 1953, June, three miles
west of here, I seen an oblong
object, like a cigar, white, standing
dead in a altitude of 500 ft. at
the speed of a one-engine airplane its
shape (shown below).

Sincerely yours,

P.S. I am 12 years old and have no reason
