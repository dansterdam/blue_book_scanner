SAPIS-3/Maj. Tacker/ t/55524

4 June 1958

Dear Mr.

We are returning your film of an unidentified object submitted to the Air Force for analysis and/or evaluation.

The current definitive analysis of this incident, as an astronomical check reveals, there was a full moon on the night of 7-9 December 1957.

A check with radar units and GCA units that cover the area in question discloses nothing unusual, and our reporting within a three week period of the incident discloses no activity or events.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
