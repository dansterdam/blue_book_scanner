The first object I saw was circular shape, round and flat like a pie tin or plate. It was very bright; a brilliant silver-white color. I watched it for about 2 minutes. The object seemed to wobble in the sky and then streaked off at a tremendous speed. It crossed the sky in 3 or 4 seconds. The object held about 15 or 20 feet away. I judged it was about 20 to 30 miles distant. The object was hovering at about 500 feet above the ground. The objects were not in formation. They left no trail or exhaust. All three objects were of the same general type. One object passed in front of the other. It appeared to be a disc, about 30 feet in diameter, 10 to 12 feet thick. The speed was over 500 knots. There was a brief red glow. The incidents occurred at about 10:35 PM on 9 December 1952. The objects were estimated to be 5 in the area of Matherfield, California. The weather was clear - there were no clouds or wind. I have no idea what these objects were, but I am convinced they are not any known type of aircraft. I was a Captain, Flight Surgeon, working in the Aeromedical Training Center.
