The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

The saucer is the darkened area within the geometric construction lines Moore used to draw Mr. Moore's signature in the bottom of this photo. This was taken in the fall of 1962, and has never been published before. It was among the first to interview him after his sighting in November 1957. And he mentioned not being able to bring some of the matters pertaining to UFO's before his sighting; but from that time on, he was quite outspoken. Continued investigation 5 was made with him in his home. He wanted to be very careful in his statements and to allow 'I don't know' answers. He just wasn't the kind to make up fanciful stories of any sort. He was very active in observation work and reported more sightings in that matter than I cared to check.He had been flown to Washington and interviewed there for two days and returned home on the third day. He said that Captain Nicholas had told them that they had a lot about it and gave them to me. Naturally, these would have been assumed names. In any case, if they couldn't identify him, I wasn't going to give them the true information. This particular approach in my efforts to authenticate Moore's story. However, Doerge said Budinger's building in Washington - one of the two stops for gas were made by the Air Force car in which he was being driven around New York - for a small building. When I showed the pictures to Gillian later, he quickly identified the State Police station and said that was where he had been remembered stopping in that town and got a Coke. It turned out to be opposite the Ease Station where we were waiting for him. The United States Coast House where I had some other officials came out of the building, and we didn't see the gentleman at all. The Ease station in question is right across the street.
