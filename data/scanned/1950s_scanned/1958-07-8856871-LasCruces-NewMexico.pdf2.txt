Report of Unidentified Objects
Sighted in Neighborhood of Berenda on July 15, 1958.
(per U.S.A.F. Headquarters wire of July 15)

These objects were quite possibly fireballs or some other natural phenomena (but the descriptions do not indicate this). The objects were large, close, and moving in curious ways which suggest something other than natural explanations - it is hard to say just what the objects were.

The varied and erratic directions would, of course, rule out any chance of the being connected with any single guided aircraft or missile. It is interesting to note that we have there somewhat similar incidents.

Location: Las Cruces, N.M.
July 25: 03:27 U.T.
Chapel Hill, N.C. August 4: 01:15

Object changed from white to yellow and was almost one-fourth the size of the moon. The object in Las Cruces apparently disappeared suddenly at this time. All were travelling in a more or less easterly direction.

It is the fact that the two time intervals between the "first" and "last" sightings, as given in the report, indicate some possible relationship, although the Chapel Hill sighting came about 10 days later. The Chapel Hill sighting can also be considered as being of the same general type reported from Las Cruces, although the time interval and direction of travel preclude the possibility of the same object being observed at both places. The Chapel Hill sighting, which lasted only three minutes, also seems to correspond with other such "short duration" UFO reports.
