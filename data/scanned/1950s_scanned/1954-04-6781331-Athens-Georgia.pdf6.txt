S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T
Athens, Georgia
27 April 1954

In addition to the information contained in the letter from the Assistant Director of Scientific University of Georgia, dated 27 April 1954, I would like to add that this was not an airplane or satellite. The trail seemed to disappear and reappear, and it seemed to emit a "haze" or "mist" which couldn't be estimated. The smoothness and the soundless effect was remarkable. A few seconds after it went directly overhead, coming directly from the trail, they had this object which appeared to be about the size of an object which appeared to be about the size of a basketball. It went through scattered clouds and disappeared into the southwest. It was at a tremendous height and was a brilliant white light.
