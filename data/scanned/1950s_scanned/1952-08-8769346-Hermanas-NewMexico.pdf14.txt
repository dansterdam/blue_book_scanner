24 August 1952
An Air Force pilot, flying a jet at a/c, observed a circular object in the vicinity of Hermanas, New Mexico (31 deg 50 min N/108 deg 2 min W). The objects appeared to be round in shape, silver in color and approximately 6" in diameter. He observed them to be approximately 2 miles from him between the hours 1000-1100MST on 24 Aug 52. The first sighting was 1015-1018 MST and the second sighting 1025-1033 MST. There was no visible means of propulsion. One object seemed to change its shape to a long gray object (could be the same object) also seemed to change shape when it accelerated very rapidly. This object also seemed to take the shape of a long gray object twice as long as when it appeared as a ball. The objects disappeared 3 minutes from when first observed. After approximately 7 minutes the objects reappeared at which time the observer was over El Paso, Texas. One object seemed to climb straight up 2 or 3 thousand feet and was joined shortly thereafter by the other one in close formation.
The observed characteristics of these unidentified objects were such that would lead to no conclusion, however, their speed was so much greater than the 550 MPH indicated air speed of the observer and the fact that they could so quickly disappear on two occasions led the reporting officer to believe that their flight capabilities were greater than that of any aircraft known to this country.
The ATIC checked all possibilities of known objects in the air in the vicinities of the two sightings with negative results.
Conclusion: Unknown
