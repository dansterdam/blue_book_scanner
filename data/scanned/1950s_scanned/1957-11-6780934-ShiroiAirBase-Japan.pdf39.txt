The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

DATE: 15 Nov 1950

At approximately 1930 hours on 7 Nov 1950 while driving south on U.S. Route 95, approximately 6 miles south of Caliente, Nevada, I observed a bright light in the sky. This light was at about 15 degrees above the horizon and was moving in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed, estimated at around 1000 mph. The light was a pale blue-white color and was round in shape, approximately the size of a large star. The light did not leave any trail or exhaust, and there was no sound associated with it. The light remained visible for approximately 15 seconds before disappearing from sight. The weather at the time was clear and the visibility was good. I am a pilot with considerable experience and I can state that this was not any conventional aircraft that I have seen. The motion and speed of the object was unlike anything I have ever observed in the sky.
