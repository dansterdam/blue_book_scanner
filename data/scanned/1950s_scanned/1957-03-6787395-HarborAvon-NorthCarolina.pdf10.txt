38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
In a clear night, I have seen flying objects, hovering and moving quickly on straight course a bit over a mile high. They were completely silent without visible means of propulsion. They were neither planes nor stars. Some seemed of elongated shape rather than circular or spherical as commonly depicted. My best guess is that they are somehow operating technology unknown to the average person. Speculating on what they are or where they come from would lead to wild imaginings. But I do believe they are real and were actually observed by myself and others.
