"Dear Mrs. _ _ _ _
April 23, 1957

Dear Madam,
I tried to take a picture of the meteorite and your envelopes that were in it and only got part of the envelope in the picture, as there was some trouble developing the film and I did not want to take any more chances on it. I will try to get the picture of the entire envelope the next time I can.

Wishing you a happy Easter,
Sincerely,
[Redacted]"
