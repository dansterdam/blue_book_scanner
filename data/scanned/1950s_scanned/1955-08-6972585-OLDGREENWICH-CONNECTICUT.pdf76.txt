Dear Captain:

I had hoped until the last minute that you would be able to make a date for conferences since now it appears that you cannot. I did hope to get down but the present state of affairs here makes that impossible, but the rest will have to wait until next month. I leave for California temporarily, and I have a lot of things to see off.

First, I had been meaning to tell you for a long while that shortly after I saw the same thing on the station, suddenly I got the impression that I had been studying the thing at the same time that somebody else was filming it. It seems to me most peculiar that if the object is brilliant in the sky would not have had to seen truly spectacular. This would have been noticed by a great many people and perhaps with binoculars. Its brilliance would suggest in the sky would have been truly spectacular. This would have been noticed by a great many people and perhaps with binoculars. Its brilliance would suggest in the sky would have been truly spectacular. This would have been noticed by a great many people and perhaps with binoculars.

I strongly leaned to the latter hypothesis, and just yesterday I learned from Miss Hoover that you had also come to the conclusion by other means that the thing was a hoax. Why will people persist in being lackeys? What can they hope to gain?
