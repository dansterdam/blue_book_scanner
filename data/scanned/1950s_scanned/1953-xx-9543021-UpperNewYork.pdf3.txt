Dear Sir:

I would like to tell about a U.F.O. I saw.
Back in 1953 I was at Ten Mile River camp, in upstate New York, where I was attending boy scout camp. About two hundred boys and myself were sitting on a hill watching the sunset when suddenly, all of a sudden, an object came across the sky. At first, this thing was flying so fast that it looked like a flying saucer. It made sharp right angle turns as fast as you can close your eyes. Then, as I kept watching it, I could see there was a tail to it, and it looked like a falling star, only this one didn't fall it went straight on flying. Well the whole night we were on the hill we saw falling stars, this one didn't fall it went straight on flying. I would say it was flying about 2,000 feet up. Now I am twenty years of age, and I still believe in flying objects. I have a theory of what kind of fuel they use; I think they use some gravity within the saucer, or they some gravity from the pull of the earth, by a means of a certain type of engine. The metal they are made of would be of a very light alloy or steel, that would act strange very hot temperatures, at fast speeds. I think there was some operation going on where they hide either on some dark side of the moon. Or maybe the nearest star to earth which is Centuri 6. I don't know if that is the closest star to earth. It is 4 1/2 light years away from the earth. If you would figure at a speed of 186,000 miles per second, if you would travel 186,000 by 4 1/3 light years, it would be a great distance. Over.
