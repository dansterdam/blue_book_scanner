OUR INFORMATION REPORT ITEM ID: ... HIS LOCATION. UNDER COVER OF"DARKNESS ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 27,1955, HE SAW WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHT LIGHT... CROSS THE SKY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH APPARENTLY MOVING AT A HIGH SPEED. HE SAID IT DISAPPEARED AS IF IT WENT BEHIND A CLOUD. HE SAID IT WAS NOT A SATELLITE, METEOR, NOR A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT WITH WHICH HE WAS FAMILIAR. HE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS SOME SORT OF UNCONVENTIONAL AERIAL OBJECT. HIS INVESTIGATION, THROUGH CONVERSATION WITH NEIGHBORS, DISCLOSED THAT THEY HAD ALSO OBSERVED THE SAME PHENOMENA. FURTHER THEY SEEMED AVERSE TO DISCUSSING THE MATTER OPENLY. THEY APPARENTLY WOULD FIRE THROUGH THE WINDOW...IT WOULD FLIP OVER OR FALL BACK AND DISAPPEAR FOR A FEW MINUTES. HOWEVER THEY KEPT COMING BACK...THIS AFTER TIME SOMEONE DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE ADVERSE TO LIGHT...THEIR ACTIONS WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY WERE OBSERVING SOME KIND OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. THEIR CURIOSITY AND THE EVENTS WOULD ONLY BE TERMINATED BY THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY.
