Major Friend

I find your UFO Panel, 7 April 1960 report most interesting. I share your concern about "scientific potential" of sightings. I have the following guidelines:

a. My policy is still to divest 4D of responsibility as rapidly as possible.

b. Reference I-B investigations must be within the current limited TDY funds available to 4D2.

c. Reference I-G determine with 4D if this is within current equipment and manpower resources available to them, if not see me before commitment.
