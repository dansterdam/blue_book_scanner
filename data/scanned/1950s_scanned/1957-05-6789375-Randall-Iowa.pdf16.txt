While was in my car with my family on a clear Sunday morning in April of 1957, we noticed an unidentified object, black and slightly greenish, coming toward us. As I drove slowly forward, I approached on an apparently straight course with unrelativey swift speed, overhead or in a southerly direction, above cloud level In a clear plastic canopy, we could make out a group of five or six very plunging white lights in circular form and we could see the summit of this cone as I slowed down. Initially, the object was almost entirely hidden behind the landscape. I stopped the car and kept watching this object after a few minutes I noticed there following a long and narrow oval- shaped part, apparently motionless with black color, was cleaning wind. We watched while the object seemed coming slower as the steadily in its travel compass it seemed to be about a mile and a half to two miles away and above the road obstruction it moved further in this object disappeared.
Approximately 20 feet had elapsed. In the meantime, I noticed a small diminutive aircraft following with a slightly small white colored object. 
Soon sighting disappeared, three seconds were no more than 15 seconds.

As the object disappeared more of five sequences were moved right and this seemed flying in a released corner, I donâ€™t know whatever this object had fun onwards.

NOTE: Forly reseavi yt word, we had to mov fom the carcraft to the objects.
