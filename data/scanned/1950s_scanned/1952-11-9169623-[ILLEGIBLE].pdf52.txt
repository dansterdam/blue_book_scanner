Gentlemen:

I am enclosing herewith, a copy of my letter, dated January 11, 1954 to Robert C. White, 1st Lt., Air Force Press Desk, Washington, D.C. and a copy of his reply. Both of which are self-explanatory.

I feel that you should be acquainted with this matter as fully as might be expected, accordingly. I feel that you should find it a little manner within this to make my letter to 1st. White, a part of the record, so that you have had my file for a period of time long enough for you to make any observations or comments of it and that surely as instructive and illuminating as I could make it.

Since this has to do with the fact that you have several copies or photographs at your disposal and as such in the future. Therefore, I am requesting the immediate return of my film(original), together with the analysis thereof made by you.

I shall appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
[Redacted], Mississippi
