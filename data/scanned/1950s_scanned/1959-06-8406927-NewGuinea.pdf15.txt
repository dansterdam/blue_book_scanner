UNCLASSIFIED
SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
REPORT NO.  1,504,022

The diagrams at Gobamana Point were made as part of a written statement by the reporter. This statement was drawn up by him 4 minutes after the observation.

The UFOs sighted on 28 June 1959 are significantly different in appearance from any previously described.

NOTE: The reporter not being a mathematician has attempted estimates of size and distance. It is suggested that the measurements should not be regarded as precise. The reported "measurements" as noted later in the report, the reporter has taken the liberty of making alterations for original data. This AUSTRALIAN DIVISION which originally read as 3 inches now reads as 5 inches. Other estimated measurements should be adjusted accordingly.

Dear [redacted],
I am almost convinced about the "vision"...theory. There have been quite a number of reports over the months from reliable witnesses. The peculiar thing about these most recent reports is that the UFOs seem to be stationary at times, now Batini, but on [redacted] occasions - again, over Batani, they have all seen it, or similar ones in different locations. I should think that this is the event that the Watcher has been identified as such.

I do not doubt the existence of these "things" (indeed I cannot now that I have seen for myself) in the evidence before I can accept the scom-cor-scenary. I am inclined to believe that remarkable many UFOs are more likley seen from a portion of privileged consciousness. That does not mean necessarily that a saucer could be the work of the unconscious of some kind in a manner, or very possible that saucers do exist, but the existence of many has been impressed upon this mind as a very likely thing that they are solids.

It is all too difficult to understand for me; I prefer to wait for some bright to cast one to be exhibited in March Square.
