PAGE: FIVE JJEAN 3:A

OFFICE, TYNDALL AFB, FLORIDA: IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS PREPARING NCO THAT SINCE THERE WERE TWENTY SIX (26) AIRCRAFT IN THE LOCAL AREA AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING, THAT VISIBILITY WAS SOMEWHAT POOR, (TD) MILES AND THAT BOTH SOURCES ADMITTED BEING POOR JUDGES OF ALTITUDE DISTANCES, THAT THE SIGHTING COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN A LOCAL AIRCRAFT.

NOTE: AFTER THIS MSG HAD BEEN PREPARED, THE PREPARING NCO HEARD A NEWSCAST OVER THE LOCAL RADIO STATION. THE NEWSCAST STATED THAT A THYRALLIS PILOT HAD CONTACTED THE RADAR STATION AND STATED THAT HE (THE PILOT) HAD OBSERVED A LARGE FLOCK OF BIRDS JUST SHORTLY BEFORE 1233 HRS 6 MAR 54, IN THE VICINITY OF THIS AIRBASE. THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE FROM AN AIRCRAFT. THIS OFFICE CONTACTED THE RADIO STATION AND THE NEWS HERALD OFFICE IN AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN THE PILOTS NAME, HOWEVER NEITHER OF THE ABOVE HAD ANY PERMANENT RECORD.
