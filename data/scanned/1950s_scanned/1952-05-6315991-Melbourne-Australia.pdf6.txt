Employed by East-West Airlines, was travelling and he said "At about 0210 hours on May 4th, I was in a taxi with my driver on the Nepean Highway, and the driver spotted an unusual object in the sky over-head". The object appeared to be travelling at a high speed and was reported to be at an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. It was dark in colour and seemed to have a phosphorescent glow around it. The object travelled rapidly, heading in a south-easterly direction. It lasted in view for about a minute.

Mr. - came in as an eye-witness, a Mr. Lancaster, the pilot who is now a regular captain with Trans-Australia Airlines. He said that he and his crew, comprising 5 persons, travelling southb in a Dakotatransport aircraft, sighted the same object independently at about the same time as the taxi-driver saw it. He said that it was pear-shaped, dark in colour and that it left a trail as it moved across the sky. It then appeared to change direction and to accelerate as it headed in a south-easterly direction.

"At approximately 0215 hours, I noticed a bright object in the sky on my right. It appeared to be travelling at a high rate of speed and seemed to be at an altitude of between 1,000 and 2,000 feet. The object was dark in colour, but appeared to have a phosphorescent glow around it. It seemed to be travelling in a south-easterly direction and lasted in view for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. After it disappeared, I again noticed a light in the sky travelling across my field of vision, but at a much lower altitude".

So two independent eye-witnesses were sighting the same unusual object at approximately the same time. The pilot's report would seem to confirm and substantiate the taxi-driver's account.
