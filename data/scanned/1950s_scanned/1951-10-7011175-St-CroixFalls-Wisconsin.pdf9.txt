AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Country: UNITED STATES
Report No.: AR 29841
Date of Report: 24 October 1951
Date of Information: 7 October 1951
Prepared By (Officer): FRANCIS L. PRINCE, Captain, USAF, Intelligence Officer
Remarks (Control under, directive, previous report, etc., as applicable): Summary of Report: Given indications paragraphs, list includes at lower left.
1. On 24 October 1951, Mrs. Jeanne Weiskopf, residing at 440 South 2nd Street, St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, reported sighting an unidentified flying object on 7 October 1951 at approximately 6:45 P.M. Mrs. Weiskopf stated that she was out in her backyard at that time and observed a light in the sky which she first thought was a shooting star. However, as she watched, the light seemed to increase in size and brightness and she realized it was not a star. It hovered in the sky for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, then descended slowly and silently to the ground, where it appeared to land or come to rest. According to Mrs. Weiskopf, the object was oval or elliptical in shape, was very bright, and gave off a greenish yellow light. After a short period of time, the object rose straight up from the ground and disappeared very rapidly at a tremendous speed. Mrs. Weiskopf was able to maintain a continuous observation of the object during the entire incident.

2. Mrs. Weiskopf was interviewed by Captain Francis L. Prince, AF Intelligence Officer, on 24 October 1951. She was found to be a very credible and reliable witness. Her observation appears to be an authentic sighting of an unidentified flying object. The fact that there were four men to confirm her report would tend to substantiate her story. In addition, there have been a number of other sightings in this general area which are similar in nature to this one. It is considered that this report warrants further investigation.
