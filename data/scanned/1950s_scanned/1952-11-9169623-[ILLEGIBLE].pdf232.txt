The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with a handwritten comment that takes up most of the page. The text in the comment discusses something the observer thought was strange or unusual, mentioning that it "was simple & harmless" and that the observer "never saw it before".

Text from the document:

At first I thought it was simple & harmless & shape and formation & movement, but suddenly I was reminded that I had never seen an object so fast - never seen before.
