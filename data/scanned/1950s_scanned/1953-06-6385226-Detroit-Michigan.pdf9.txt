At approximately 10:15 PM EST on the above date, a parking lot at the northwest corner of Grand River and Woodward in Detroit, Michigan, was the location of an extremely unusual celestial phenomenon.

A parking lot attendant reported that he was refueling his car when he noticed a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be about five or six times the size of a normal star, and it was hovering or stationary. But it didn't take so long to realize that it wasn't a star - it was this object that first caught his attention.

The object also seemed to be a meteor. It appeared to be about five or six times the size of a normal star and was a bright whitish or light blue color, brighter than a star. The light was steady, not flickering like stars do.

This time was within a few minutes of 2310 hours.

The object also fell too slow to be a meteor. It would judge the object to be a meteorite under 1000 m.p.h. The object remained stationary and did not move for several minutes before it disappeared over the horizon. The sky was perfectly clear and the air cool, but there was none except the few cars on Grand River a block away.
