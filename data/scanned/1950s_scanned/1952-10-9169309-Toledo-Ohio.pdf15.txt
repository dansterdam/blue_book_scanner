CASE HISTORY
23 October 1952 - Toledo, Ohio - July 1955

I. PERTINENT BACKGROUND INFORMATION
A. Delay in receipt of report - On 8 July 1955, Capt Jen T. Matsuo, OIC 5-12, OECU AISS, visited ATAS-2 and presented the undersigned airman with a letter and one 35 mm color slide. The letter, dated 2 December 1954, was from Mr. _____ in Gradeuhulton, Ohio and addressed to T/Sgt Harold Jenkins, Flt 3-B, 46204 AISS. Sgt Jenkins had been introduced to Mr. _____ in Columbus, Ohio and Mr. _____ had informed the Sgt that his son had taken some pictures of UFO's while on his honeymoon in October 1952. An agreement was reached whereby Mr. _____ would forward one of his son's slides to Sgt Jenkins for official examination. This was accomplished by the above mentioned letter.

Sgt. Jenkins, after receiving the letter, failed to act upon it. A few months later, Sgt Jenkins was assigned o/s and his files were turned over to his replacement who gave the letter to Capt. Matsuo.

B. Follow-up Action Initiated by ATAS-5
Upon receipt of the letter and the slide, the undersigned airman called Mr. _____ on 11 July 55 and requested him to forward the additional slides mentioned in his letter of 2 December 1954. He informed the reporting airman that his son, who had since enlisted in the Air, was presently home on leave until 1 July 55, and that we could obtain any additional details of the incident from him.

On 11 July 1955, the reporting airman sent, via Special Delivery, a USAF Technical Information Sheet (for completion by source), along with a request to forward any additional slides or information regarding the incident.
