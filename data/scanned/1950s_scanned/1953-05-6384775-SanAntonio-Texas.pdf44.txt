The image does not appear to contain a photograph. Instead, it shows a simple line drawing depicting the motion of an unidentified object. The drawing shows the object's path with an "A" at the beginning and a "B" at the end. The text above the drawing instructs the viewer to "Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an 'A' at the beginning of its path and a 'B' at the end of its path."
