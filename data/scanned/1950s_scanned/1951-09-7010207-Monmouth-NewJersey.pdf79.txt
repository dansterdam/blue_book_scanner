There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

Object was always on their left and that they did not or did assume a parallel trajectory. The pilot particularly pointed this is to say that the object was going in the same direction as the aircraft was turning; and that the object is following "the same direction as the T-33 aircraft" was turning; and that the object is following "the same direction as the T-33 aircraft" was turning. 

The pilots said that it is always leading the aircraft, that is, out of phase with it, or that the object is traveling in phase inside the circle of the aircraft and indeed that if may even be stationary inside the circle of the aircraft.

It is also pointed out that the interpretation that the object always any on the left or that the pilots may be that, the object was a balloon stationary inside their turning circle. It is also to be noted that the pilots are not sufficiently sure if this ground radar to engage this and a calculation concerning what the altitude of a balloon that we are necessary and impossible to give.

In fact, there is indication that the object did not follow the allowed ground track of the balloon and that it was observed to move ten nautical miles in two minutes, or five nautical miles per minute or 300 knots per hour, if one takes the extreme factor between the two observations of ground track. A point of similarity is that balloons are always painted for radar purposes when released from balloons. So it is reported by the pilot. A point of significance is the shape viewed under proper circumstances that the balloon might have a quite erratic spatial shape. In the light of this information, it is considered that there is strong possibility that the sighting was that of a balloon.
