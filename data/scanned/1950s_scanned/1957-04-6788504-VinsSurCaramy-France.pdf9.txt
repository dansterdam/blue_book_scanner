Conclusions.
These are the first indications of an investigation that took place during a period of 18 hours on Saturday and Sunday the 18 and 19 of May. This was only 8 days after the occurrences. Some things must still be cleared up as we have already indicated and therefore all that really remains is that we commence on the magnetic investigations that were conducted on the metallic pieces that were located near the observation points. This is given later as a simple indication because a systematic study was begun after the set of phenomenons that were reported, referring to those that took place in Vins, Palalda and Beaucourt. We will draw attention to the reader of the note and the magnetic measurements that follow.
The only place that is lacking now is that we have confirmed that would eventually deal with the vibrations that were confirmed both in Vins and Palalda. These can be supported as new and important elements for the solution of lift and support elements of the propulsion of Non-Identified Flying Objects. We continue our study of this subject.
Note.
If by some chance this article should fall into the hands of that person or persons whose automobile passed on Miramont highway the 19 of May at approximately 11:00 P.M., and if they possibly did observe the "small men" on the path of the hill, we would be very appreciative if they would place themselves in contact with us even if they should want to remain anonymous.
