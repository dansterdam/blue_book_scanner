DF COMMENT /1 to AFOIN-4E26
SUBJECT: (C) Analysis of Material Allegedly from "Flying Saucers".

1. "Angel's-hair". This odd term requires some explanation to those unscientists who are now giving this term some publicity. "Angel's-hair" purports to be the solidified or propulsive by-product of some unknown flying machine or "saucer" which, according to the "Paniter's Theory", so-called, after the French officer who published this in the military, progresses with a pulsing, vibrating motion transforming it into nuclear, thermal, thenco kinetic energy. 

2. In August of this year, the staff of TV Hour, among others, gave this so-called "angel's-hair" nationwide attention in a science fiction drama whereby the substance is shown vanishing before the eyes of ATIC chiefs.

h. The investigator in this case reports that upon surveying the area in question he found a small amount of this substance in the street near the individual's residence, and is dissolved in the handle.
