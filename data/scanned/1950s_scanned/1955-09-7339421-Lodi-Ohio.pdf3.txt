I saw this object while staying at my mothers - My two grandmothers were al-
so there. I saw this object which looked like a large grapefruit in the sky -
and then it seemed to explode like a large rocket or firecrackers - there were
two explosions - I never saw anything like it before and hope I never do again
It was terrifying ----.
