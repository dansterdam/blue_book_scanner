AF FORM 112 - PART II 
APPROVED 9 JUNE 1948 

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT  UNCLASSIFIED

FROM: USAFR 

264 FTB 
25 AUG 53-5134 PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. The flight was reported to be traveling on a heading of 170Â°, perpendicular to the military base.

2. The speed of the flight was estimated to be at least 500 knots at an undetermined altitude but it disappeared abruptly.

COMMENTS or FINDINGS OFFICER:

The factual reports stressed pertinent to the unidentified object are well-documented characteristics of the flight. The object, since the first pass seemed to be maneuvering, gives the impression that it is entirely possible that this is an extremely high performance vehicle capable of high speeds, high altitude and abrupt disappearance, with the characteristics that tend to identify this as something apart from conventional aircraft.
