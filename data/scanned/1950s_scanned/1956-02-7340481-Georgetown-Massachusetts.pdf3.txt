It is one of the greatest mystries that the world has ever known and could be
reatiled as far more important than atom bomb reserch since it involves the 
existance of life outside of the world. The object I saw was about 30 feet in
diameter, round and revolving. I could see the top and bottom of the object as
it rotated at a high rate of speed and it seemed to be on the or quite near the
ground when I first saw it. The object was a dull metalic color and there were
no lights on it. As I watched it, it suddenly accellerated at a phenomenal
rate of speed and in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds was out of sight traveling in
a northerly direction. I am a World War II veteran and have had some air-
plane experience and I have never seen anything like this before. I would
appreciate your investigating this matter further and let me have some information
on the results of your investigation.
