2. On Saturday, 15 November 1952 at 0210 hours, Captain *****[redacted]* of the 4th District OSI and a pilot with approximately 1,000 hours including combat time, along with his wife, observed an unidentified aerial object. The object passed over their house at about 5,000 feet, estimating its speed to be slightly to the east. The object, which was very low altitude, however, on observing the position of this unidentified object, the witness was convinced that the object was moving in a southerly direction. All that could be observed was a white or pale blue light, having a pulsating motion. Captain *****[redacted]* and his wife reported this unidentified aerial sighting to the Director of Intelligence.

3. The weather at the time of observation was clear at point of observation with an overcast moving in from the west.
