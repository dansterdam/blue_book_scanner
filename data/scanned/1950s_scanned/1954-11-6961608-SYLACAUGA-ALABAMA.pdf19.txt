"Swindle said Mayor Ed J. Howard has assured Dr. Jones the meteorite will be placed in the state museum at the University of Alabama when it is returned by the Air Force.

"Sylacauga police rushed to the Hodges home when the object crashed through the roof about 1 p.m.
"Mrs. Hodges said she was lying on a couch in the living room of the frame house when the meteorite smashed a three-foot wide hole in the room and came tumbling through the ceiling.

"'It hit our radio at one end of the couch and bounced off on me. It hit me on the arm and hip,' she said.

"Police summoned a doctor when they arrived and Mrs. _____  was treated for bruises. She was reported in good condition tonight.

"'We had a little excitement around here today,' she told her husband when he came home from work.

"'A meteorite fell through the roof.'

"He is a tree surgeon and knew nothing of the incident until he came home from work. He had been trimming trees for the telephone company.

"'If don't believe I want to talk to anybody else for a while,' said Mrs. _____."

"'She said there must have been several hundred,' he added.

"He said he had no insurance on the house, and didn't estimate the damage.

"Swindle said the meteorite was about six inches in diameter. He said the inside was a metallic, grey granular substance, which resembled to tests given for ensilpinde. The outside casing was a black shiny appearing substance.

"'Dr. Jones said tonight he would welcome the meteorite, since the University museum does not have such an object from Alabama.'"
