1. Attached letter was forwarded to this Center by NRL.

2. The following are submitted to assist you in replying to Mr. Rous, observer
   of the UFO:

   a. The very careful attention to details essisted us in determining the
      identty of the object.

   b. For example, the description of the object "red glowing space in the
      head" and that the "place was lit bright as day" are typical characteristics of
      a true bollde or "Fireball."

3. A large number of bolides (a very brilliant-fiery specie of meteorite) have
   been reported during the last nine (9) months from throughout the U.S.
