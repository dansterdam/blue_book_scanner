The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and instructions to imagine that the object seen at the horizon was moving along this curved line. The second and third sketches show more detailed landscape scenes, with instructions to place an "A" at the position where the object was first seen, and a "B" at the position where it was last seen.

Text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. If the object continued to move, place a "B" on the same line to show the highest point to which it rose.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
