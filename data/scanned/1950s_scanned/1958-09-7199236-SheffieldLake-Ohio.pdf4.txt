From First Page
From that point on, his account of the incident agreed substantially with that of his wife.
Both are said that the "saucer" made a whirring noise. Then, as it left, the noise took on a muffled, whining sound.
John demonstrated with how the "saucer" increasing in pitch, together with a hum.
The "saucer" was described as round from a top or bottom view and oval from a side view. It was about eight feet in diameter, they said, and about three feet high.
It had two openings on both sides in which she saw a series of small tubes like small exhaust pipes, the Sheffield Lake Police Chief said.
