EVALUATION OF AIR DEFENSE INCIDENT OF 20 SEPTEMBER 1957

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
The objective of this study is to evaluate the circumstances associated with the detection and reporting of high-speed radar tracks on 20 September 1957. Specifically, the evaluation was aimed at determining whether or not the tracks were caused by airborne objects and to determine, if possible, the nature of the airborne vehicles or other phenomena which caused the tracks.

RESUME OF EVENTS
1. On 20 September 1957 at 1906Z, the 7734 ACWRON, located at the Montauk AFS, New York, established an initial plot on a high speed unidentified object southeast of the station at a range of 190 nautical miles, and tracking toward the station at an estimated speed of 3600 knots. Track information was forward told to the 26th CONAD Division, OPER, and to NORAD COC. In addition, it was passed laterally to adjacent radars: the 646th ACWRON at Highlands AFS, N.Y. and the 752d ACWRON at North Truro, Massachusetts. These radars were not able to establish contact with the target.
2. The unknown track was lost at a range of 50 miles southeast of Montauk at 1907.45Z. The track was dead-reckoned by Montauk AFS and passed by the 26th CONAD Division to the 643rd ACWRON at Benton AFS, Pennsylvania, as heading west at a speed of 2,000 knots and an estimated altitude of 50,000 feet.
