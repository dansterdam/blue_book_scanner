The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing observations of lights seen from a church in Virginia, facing west. The document provides details about the observers' reluctance to estimate the height of the lights, their observations of neighbors chasing the lights in their automobiles, and lists several "other known observers" from the New Church.

Location: Lights seen from New Church, Virginia, facing West.
Observer extremely reluctant to estimate height due to having no experience in such or related matters. Says could be any height from a few hundred feet on up. But does say that some of neighbors who saw lights chased them in automobiles which indicates some of the observers thought them to be quite low.
