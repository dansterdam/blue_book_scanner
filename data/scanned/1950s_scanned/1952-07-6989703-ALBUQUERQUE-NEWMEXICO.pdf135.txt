The text on the document is as follows:

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
The object appeared to be very bright, whitish in color and changing in 3-D as it moved. Observers say that it was definitely round and that it was surrounded by a grayish halo or ring. The angular size of the object seemed to be a little larger than that of a star. The object was observed for a period of over an hour and a half. 
DURATION OF OBSERVATION: Object sighted at 12:35 hours. Object in sight approximately 1.5 hours.
METHOD OF OBSERVATION: Visually from the ground. No optical or electronic equipment used.
TIME AND CONDITIONS OF OBSERVATION: Each observer was located at 37°38'N - 97°26'W. They were watching the object in relation to the adjacent buildings of the Kirtland Air Force Base.
CHARACTERISTICS OF OBJECT(S): The object seemed to be stationary, and at times moved very slowly. Sometimes it seemed to give off a red glow. The object was observed to be at an estimated altitude of 20,000-25,000 feet. The temperature was 88 degrees Fahrenheit, and the wind velocity was 9-12 mph from the southwest.
IDENTIFYING OF OBJECT: According to the observers, the object did not resemble any conventional aircraft or known celestial object. They work near the Municipal Airport Terminal and are thoroughly familiar with all types of aircraft and celestial phenomena which they say should now be apparent. They indicated that the object was unlike anything they had ever seen before.
