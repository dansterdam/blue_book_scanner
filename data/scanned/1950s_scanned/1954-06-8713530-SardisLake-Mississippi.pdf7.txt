Dear Colonel Simpson:

Thank you very much for your letter of October 5th containing a complete report of the fallen object at Sardis Lake, Mississippi.

As you are probably aware, for the past several years the Air Force has had a major scientific research program in this area, and reports such as yours are greatly appreciated.

For your convenience I am attaching a copy of the "U. S. Air Force Manual of Standardized Procedures for the Unified Flying Object Program" which compiles all of the latest facts which have been established by the Air Force in this program.

Thank you again for your interest in keeping the Air Force informed.

Very truly yours,

Signed
JOSEPH A. BLODGER
Lt Colonel, USAF
Directorate of Intelligence
