Little Rock Air Force Base
Little Rock, Arkansas

Dear Sir:

I do not know to whom I should write this letter but the air base seemed the best place. This morning around four o'clock my mother saw what at first glance looked like a star, but when we looked closer we could tell that it was not. It was much brighter and larger than a star and was giving off rays. It stayed stationary in the east from our house until around five we noticed it had moved farther east and a little south. 

This is the third time we have seen such an object in the early hours of morning although I don't remember the other giving off rays or light as brightly as this one.
