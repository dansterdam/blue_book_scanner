STATEMENT

At approximately 2240 hours, on 21 July 1952, I was returning from observing the southern sky when I observed a bright light moving south at a speed of approximately 10 miles per hour. Suddenly, a solid white circle of light appeared, maintaining a straight course at approximately the same altitude as the one I had been observing. The light was about the size of a soft ball, and seemed to be pulsating. As the light got nearer, I could see a halo around it, but the light itself was so bright that I could not see through. The object was traveling smoothly at an indicated altitude of 30,000 to 40,000 feet as measured against a nearby peak. The light suddenly went off. I was then in a cloud bank, through which occasional glimpses of the object could be seen. The object was traveling in a straight, level course off either side. The light went off suddenly like it was shut off or went in a cloud bank, though for only very briefly. The contour was smooth (extremely or perfectly so). No jagged edges or tails were visible, or colors of other expressions were noticeable. I was this G. D. at the time.
