REFERENCE RADNOTS 1951-1-7006098: EVALUATION
OF UNKNOWN AIRCRAFT OR TARGETS REPORTED WITHOUT
COMPLETE DATA AVAILABLE.

REFERENCE: RADNOTS 1951-1-7006098. THIS IS AN EVALUATION
OF UNKNOWN AIRCRAFT OR TARGETS REPORTED WITHOUT
COMPLETE DATA AVAILABLE.

IN THE COMPLETE REPORT WHICH YOUR RADNOTS INDICATES
CONTAINS THE OBSERVATIONS OF RADAR TARGETS, POSSIBLY COULD
INDICATE THAT THE RADAR TARGETS POSSIBLY COULD
HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA.

(1) INTERFERENCE FROM THE DETECTING RADAR
SET. (2) ECHANI SM AND LEAKAGE, AND LEAST LIKELY
(3) AIRBORNE TARGET OR TARGETS OF UNKNOWN
ORIGIN.

EVERY CONSIDERATION REQUIRED FOR CAREFUL
EVALUATION INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:

1. WHAT TYPES RADAR DETECTED THE TARGETS.
2. FREQUENCY OF RADAR. PULSE RATE.
3. MODULATION (GAIN) USED. (TIME CONSTANT)
4. ALTITUDE OF AIRCRAFT WHEN TARGETS STEADY
WERE OBSERVED OR WHEN THEY WERE UNSTEADY
OF UNEQUAL AMPLITUDE. TO WHAT IS MEANT BY
THIS IS THE ELONGATION IN RANGE OR AZIMUTH.
5. SIZE AND ELEVATION CORRESPONDING TARGETS.
6. NUMBER AND LOCATION OF THE TARGETS DETECTED
AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS.

RADAR THE TARGETS SEEN BY MORE THAN
ONE AIRBORNE RADAR. TO WERE ANY RADAR SETS
OPERATING ON THE GROUNDALLUDES AND WHAT WERE
THEIR TARGETS.

REGULAR RADAR DETECTS ON TRANSIENT TARGETS DETECTED
DURING THE TIME OF DETECTION OF UNKNOWN 
TARGETS. IF THERE ANY OTHER AIRBORNE
AIRCRAFT DURING THE RUNS OF DETECTION
OF UNKNOWN TARGETS AND THEY HAVE RADAR
ONBOARD, IT SHOULD BE DETERMINED IF THEY 
HAD SIMILAR TRACKS OR TARGETS. OTHER
INFORMATION THAT CAN BE ADDED TO THIS REPORT.

IT SHOULD BE REALIZED THAT EVALUATION
OF VERY SCANT AND OFTEN HASTILY PREPARED
GROUND OBSERVATIONS OF RADAR PHENOMENA
CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED BY PERSONAL INTERROGATION
OF THE PERSONNEL OPERATING THE RADAR SET INVOLVED.
