SIGHTING REPORTS

November 16, 1956 - CSIL has received a confirmation of the observation by Miss -- of New Rochelle, that was reported in News Release #10. of 14 November 1956. The object seen is described as a large, shiny white object which appeared after 10 p.m. that night, hovering about a mile northeast, and moving "up and down and in other directions." It disappeared behind trees to the southeast, then came into view again for about 30 seconds. The object "was in view for about 10 seconds, changed color to yellowish-orange, maneuvered very slowly, and went out of sight again." The object appeared to have a dome on top and a row of lights around the bottom. Its size was sharply defined, the rear edge fuzzy, with a greenish-blue tail of light behind it. The object moved "in a fantastic manner", not like normal aircraft usually fly. She watched the object about 10:30 p.m., and her daughters also observed it. Undoubtedly these are the same objects that were described by Miss -- in the direction reported by Miss --, and the report by Miss -- appears to fit in quite well with the details.
