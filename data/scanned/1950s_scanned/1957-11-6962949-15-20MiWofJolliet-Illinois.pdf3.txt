The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a silhouetted object above the horizon line, and instructions to indicate the position of the object when it was first seen ("Place an 'A'") and when it was last seen ("Place a 'B'"). 

The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with a person standing in the foreground. There is also a smaller sketch in the corner showing a single silhouetted figure against a landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
