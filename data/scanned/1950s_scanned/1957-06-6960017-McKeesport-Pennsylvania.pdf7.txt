3-I-A-L-e-z-S-I-M

I was sitting on the porch in back of the house. I glanced
up and saw one round white object. It looked very unusual because
it was large and round and I could see it clearly. It didn't look
like anything I had ever seen before. It looked like what I had
seen in the movie,"UFO". I said jokingly "Look a flying saucer."
I stood up Ìµand saw two more in back of it and I become excited and
said to my mother-in-law, "What are they?" I said this several
times. My mother-in-law saw them and couldn't recognize them either.
She said she didn't know what they were. I ran out in the yard to
see them better and saw a reddish burst of light from one of them.
It was as red as lipstick. Then I saw a silver or metallic gleam.
That's what made me get so interested. Then I thought I'd better
get a picture of them and I ran into the house for a camera. When
I came out they were still there but I couldn't get the camera
focused. I dropped the camera because I wanted to keep watching
them. Then we watched them until they were out of sight.

I was sure they weren't airplanes because I see many planes
every day. I know what jets look like and I'm sure these weren't
jets. I saw them very clearly and very sharply. They looked about
the size of an orange or a grapefruit.
