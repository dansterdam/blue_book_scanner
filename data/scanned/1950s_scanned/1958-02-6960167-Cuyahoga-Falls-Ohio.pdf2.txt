There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document describing a UFO sighting over Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

The text in the document is as follows:

FROM THE WEATHER STATION AT VANDALIA
READ THE FOLLOWING TELETYPE TO HE GAVE THE PHONE 
THE TELETYPE CAME FROM CANTON, OHIO
ADDRESSED TO OPERATION BLUEBOOK
"HAVE GOTTEN SEVERAL PHONE CALLS FROM RELIABLE 
SOURCES OF A SIGHTING OF A STRANGE OBJECT 
IN THE SKY OVER CUYAHOGA FALLS,OHIO. 
TIME OF THE SIGHTING WAS BETWEEN 2:20 - 2:26 
EASTERN STANDARD TIME. THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT 
WAS CIGAR-LIKE, SILVER IN COLOR WITH A BRIGHT 
GLOW. IT WAS TRAVELING AT TREMENDOUS SPEEDS 
IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. NO APPEARANCE OF

I CHECKED TO FIND OUT WHO THE SOURCES WERE 
BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND OUT.
I CALLED CAPT. GREGORY AND HE TOLD ME TO
LEAVE IT GO UNTIL MONDAY.
