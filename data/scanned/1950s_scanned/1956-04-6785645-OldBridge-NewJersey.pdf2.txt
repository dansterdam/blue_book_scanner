23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, would you like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Perhaps a huge electric globe would look something like it, varying in brilliance at first, then gradually becoming dimmer until it all but disappeared. Or would it be more like a brilliant star-like initial brilliant then gradually fading?
