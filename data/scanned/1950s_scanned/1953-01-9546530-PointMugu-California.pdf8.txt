SEARCH AND RESCUE

Search and Rescue Service is a life saving service provided through the combined efforts of the CAA, Air Force, and Coast Guard who are assisted by other organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Sheriff Air Patrol, State Police, and such other agencies as may be available. It provides search, survival aid, and rescue of personnel of missing or crashed aircraft.

All you need to remember to obtain this valuable protection is:
1. File a Flight Plan with a CAA Airway Communications Station in person or by telephone or radio.
2. File an Arrival Report.
3. If you land at a location other than intended destination, report the landing to the nearest CAA Communications Station.
4. If you land enroute and are delayed more than an hour, report this information to the nearest communications station.
-Remember that if you fail to report within one hour after your E.T.A., a search will be started to locate you. If you fail to report within three hours after your E.T.A., the full facilities of the Search and Rescue Service will be activated.

Searches are expensive, they inconvenience other people, and on numerous occasions the lives of other pilots are sacrificed when searching for lost or overdue pilots. SO, FILE AN ARRIVAL REPORT!

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Lay out symbols by using strips of fabric or parachutes, pieces of wood, stones, or any available material.
2. Provide as much color contrast as possible between material used for symbols and background against which symbols are exposed.
3. Symbols should be at least 10 feet high or larger, if possible. Care should be taken to lay out symbols exactly as shown to avoid confusion with other symbols.
4. In addition to using symbols, every effort is to be made to attract attention by means of radio, flares, smoke, or other available means.
5. When ground is covered with snow, signals can be made by dragging, shoveling or tramping the snow. The depressed areas forming the symbols will appear to be black from the air.
6. Pilot should acknowledge message by rocking wings from side to side.
