Report on Unidentified Flying Object 
(seen by__________ June 18, 1958.)

While taking the Pilot Observation on the morning of June 18, 1958 at 10:37 AM MST an unidentified flying object was observed from this station. It was first noticed as a small bright spot in the clear sky to the north, rapidly gaining altitude and heading south. It was followed visually for approximately 60 seconds at which time it disappeared from sight into the bright sky. The object was described as a bright metallic-like disc, about 15' in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion. It was moving at a very high rate of speed, estimated between 500 to 1,000 miles per hour. The object was sighted at an approximate altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The 5 minute count weight height be in error by a few seconds. 

When first seen the outline of the object was not clear, but as it gained altitude and the sun struck it, a bright metallic-like reflection was easily visible. No sound was heard and no exhaust or trail was observed. The object appeared to be a flat, circular metallic-like disc. It was under observation for approximately one minute.

Upper winds during the day were from the southeast, approximately 20-25 knots. However, the object was moving in a direction opposite to the upper wind flow and at a much greater speed than could be attributed to the wind. The particular time of observation corresponded closely to the time when a rocket was being launched from the White Sands Missile Range, but it is not believed that this object was related to the rocket in any way.
