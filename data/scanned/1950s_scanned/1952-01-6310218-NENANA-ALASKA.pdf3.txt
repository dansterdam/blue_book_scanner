INVESTIGATION REPORT

LOCATION: Nenana, Alaska
DATE: January 6, 1952
TIME: Approximately 10:00 AM

On January 6, 1952 at approximately 10:00 AM, the undersigned officer received a report from Mr. Joseph Yarnell, a resident of Nenana, Alaska, concerning a strange aerial object observed by him at approximately 10:00 AM.

According to Mr. Yarnell, he was standing outside his home when he observed a bright, circular object in the sky, hovering approximately 500 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and was a dull metallic color. It remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly shot straight up out of sight at an extremely high rate of speed.

Mr. Yarnell immediately reported the incident to the local authorities. An investigation was conducted, but no further evidence or witnesses could be found to corroborate Mr. Yarnell's report.

This report is submitted for your information and further investigation, if deemed necessary.
