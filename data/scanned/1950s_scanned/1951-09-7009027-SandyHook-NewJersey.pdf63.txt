Cummings accompanied by Mr. Deysrmond went to the Electronics Branch and learned that the stated telecon had arrived some yards in length and it was being discussed by Electronics Branch and Mr. Zimmerman. The decision was made soon after that meeting was broke up that we had been delayed already two hours and we might as well get into the field because information necessary for evaluation was not present in the communication from TCB, and that other information seemed likely to be had. The decision was then submitted by a request in the subject telecon for ATIC to make an evaluation of these incidents and to recommend a full investigation to obtain a complete report of the incident and related circumstances. Evaluation and conclusions should be forwarded to this HQ by teleconference. Immediate investigation must be made. Findings must be related immediately to this HQ not later than Monday, 1 October 1951, following information concerning these instances is quoted for preliminary analysis to be made immediately for Gen Cabell and then EADS, Hq, Stewart Air Force Base interrogations concerning radar and visual sightings are quoted. Now Col Kirkland was contacted and travel orders were written at a late hour in the evening so that Col Rouenjarter could proceed to 1st AF Command headquarters & TWA terminals New York at about 11:30 that night. About 10 o'clock on Saturday morning Lt Cummings and Col Rouenjarter reached Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, and contacted their C-2 of the Signal Corps station, Ft. Monmouth.
