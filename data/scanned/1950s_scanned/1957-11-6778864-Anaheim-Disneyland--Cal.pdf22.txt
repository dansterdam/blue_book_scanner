The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a saucer-shaped UFO. The caption below the photograph states that the photo was taken at 12:10 p.m. on November 6, 1957, by a witness whose name is redacted. The object is described as "pinkish-red in color" and "looked like a circular mass" that "appeared to be drifting northwest over Disneyland, California." The document expresses some skepticism about the authenticity of the photograph, stating that it "is probably genuine" but that the witness's "flying saucer" comment "doesn't even believe in flying saucers."

Extracted text from the document:

This photo was taken at 12:10 p.m. on November 6, 1957, by [witness name redacted]. The object, which was pinkish-red in color, looked like a circular mass, and appeared to be drifting northwest over Disneyland, California. The photograph, in our opinion, is probably genuine. However, the witness's comment that "it looked like a flying saucer" doesn't even believe in flying saucers.
