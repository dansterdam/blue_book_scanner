The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Additional radar data is needed to evaluate this target. It would be of much value to know if unidentified target(s) was on the exact same line of sight as the wind finding target. If on the same line of sight, a possible explanation would be a malfunction of the radar set.
