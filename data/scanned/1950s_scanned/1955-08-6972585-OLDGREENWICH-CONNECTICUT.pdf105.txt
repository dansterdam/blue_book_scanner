I ASKED HIM THEN INTO THE NEXT ROOM....AND BY OURSELVES HE STARTED 
TO DRAW PICTURE NUMBER TWO...USING THE FIRST AS A BASIS. AGAIN, I 
DID NOT PROMPT HIM, BUT LET HIM LEAD ME IN THE DRAWING. THE CORRECTIONS 
WERE MINOR...(HE EXPERIMENTED WITH EARPHONES AND ANTENNAE'S PROTRUDING FROM THE HEAD. WAS VERY POSITIVE ABOUT A MUSCULAR BODY, AND EVEN THOUGH HE WASN'T AN ARTIST, ATTEMPTED TO DRAW IN SEVERAL FEATURES HE HAD ME SAW...MY OBSERVATIONS: I BELIEVE HE HAS ELABORATING CONSIDERABLY.) HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS SURE HE HAD SEEN A NOSE, BUT COULD NOT HIS OBSERVATION SAY...AFTER THE SECOND DRAWING WAS COMPLETED...WE SITE FED OUTSIDE FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR...NO AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THE LAST THREE LITTLE MEN TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE NIGHT BEFORE. WE HAD ONLY BEEN OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE...WHEN A THUNDERSHOWER DOUSED EVERYONE WHO COULDN'T FIND SHELTER. WE WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WE MIGHT REMIND YOU AT THIS POINT THAT THE FAMILY HAD NOW BEEN UP FOR MORE THAN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS...AND IT WAS BRINGING TO SHOW. THEY SEEMED TO BE EXHAUSTED. IN PARTICULAR WAS UNHAPPY, AND WENT TO THE DOOR SEVERAL TIMES TO ASK THE LIGHTSEER'S TO PLEASE GO AWAY. THE SHOWER, AS HE SAID, DID END ALL CUIRTING FOR THEIR CARS, BUT IT WAS SHORT-LIVED...AND THEY CAME RIGHT BACK. THIS WAS THE SCENE AND TEMPO OF THE PEOPLE WHEN RECORDED AT 8:30. HE'S WELL BUILT, STRONG, HAS DARK BLACK HAIR, AND WASN'T AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE HOMECOMING HE RECEIVED. CARS WERE LINED UP FOR A FURTHER INVESTIGATION, AND HIS FRONT YARD WAS FULL OF CURIOUS.
