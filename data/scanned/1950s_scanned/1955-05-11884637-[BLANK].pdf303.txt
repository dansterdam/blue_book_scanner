Case IX (Serial 0066.00)
A man and his two sons, aged 8 and 10, were at his fishing camp on August 13, 1947. At about 1300 hours, he went to look for the boys. Having sent them to the river for some, he noticed an object some 300 feet away, 75 feet above the ground. He watched it for about 2 minutes as it made a hedge hopping, following the contour of the ground. It was sky blue, about 20 feet in diameter and 10 feet thick, and had pods on the side from which flames were shooting out. It made a hissing sound. The observer stated that the trees were highly agitated by the craft as it passed over. His two sons also observed the object. No one saw the object for more than a few seconds.
