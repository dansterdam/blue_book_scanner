1. SYNOPSIS: Mrs. Interviewing was interviewed 18 August 1957, stated that while looking up from her residence hill, Pa., she noticed a bright light, approximately 2 miles away, hovering and then moving very rapidly at an extreme altitude.

After 3 to 4 seconds of rapid movement, the object came to an abrupt halt, remained stationary for a moment, and then moved too quickly to be seen.
