I was with Sgt Ruffin and Pfc Hobbs - had just left a meeting, one of Sgt Ruffin's Sgt Calls (Co M). I noticed that as we left, they got a call on their radio (Sgt Hobbs got the call). They claimed that the radar station (Samdong-ni) had picked up an unidentified flying object. They said the object came down very close to the station, and then shot up again at a terrific speed. You just missed it they said, but it looked very interesting. I asked them what it looked like, but they couldn't describe it very well. They said it was unlike anything they had seen before, and was moving at a fantastic speed - much faster than anything they had ever observed. That's all the information I could get from them. They seemed quite upset and disturbed by the incident, even though they hadn't actually seen the object itself. The report was made to the CO and the I & E Section.
