COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1.  When being interviewed, the SOURCE had difficulty in expressing himself in regard to questions pertaining to the maneuvers of the objects.  There was doubt in his mind whether he actually observed five (5) individual objects or the same object on each occasion.  He could not give the altitude or distance of each object.
