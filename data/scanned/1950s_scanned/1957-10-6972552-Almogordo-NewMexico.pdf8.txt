Flying Objects Real, Psychologist Insists
ALAMOGORDO, N. M., July 6 (AP)--Dr. Carl Jung, noted Swiss psychologist, said he believes the recent reports of analytical psychologists have valid material behind them, contrary to the Air Force's "creating panic" charge.
Jung's statements were made in the monthly bulletin issued by the Civilian Saucer Intelligence in New York, a small clipping center.
In the course of years, Jung has become a recognized authority on the subject of UFO's. He believes, he said, that certain there phenomenon are real and have psychic aspects that cannot be explained completely with existing knowledge.
The Swiss psychologist stated that he is convinced that the observations have proven unaccountable in psychological sense and must be received in good faith as reports about something that has been seen. 
"The data, reports, indicate, do not show that there have been sighted only dreams or illusions. They show signs of intelligent behavior," Jung stated. These observations "are such that no normal human projection into the unknown can reasonably account for them." 
The phenomenon, he continued, is so strange that one cannot dismiss them as mere products of imagination.
Jung is reported to work with the rather close circle of psychologists interested in UFO observations and that the research has indicated not only good mental stability of some of the witnesses, but also their thorough sincerity in reporting what they have seen.
What astonishes me most, Jung told the persons who interviewed him, is the frequent observation that the information is not limited to the visual senses alone. Sooner or later, we have what they call "fear-creating panic" among people who in the moment of sighting are usually calm and collected. The phenomenon, he said, stands apart from normal human experience and cannot be grasped in scientific concepts yet evolved. That is whey, he added, they have published an authentic report under the title "Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky."
