Dear Mr. Johnson:

Thank you for the two photograph copies. I shall be interested in the microdensitoizeter records if Sacramento Peak is able to furnish them.

My TV appearance on "Today" did not go too well. Mr. Keyhoe showed the show and I had difficulty getting a word in edgewise. I felt rather disgusted about the whole thing. Incidentally, since Dave Garroway himself turned out to be something of a "believer" and joined with Mr. Keyhoe in attacking me.

Again many thanks for your interesting information.

Cordially yours,
