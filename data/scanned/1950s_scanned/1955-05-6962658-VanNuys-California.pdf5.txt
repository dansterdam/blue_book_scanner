STATEMENT OF WITNESS 
NAME: GEORGE L. SAULISH
ADDRESS: VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA
OCCUPATION: ELECTRICIAN

STATEMENT:
ON MAY 6, 1955, AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30 P.M., I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ALONG SEPUL VEDA BLVD. IN VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA. AS I WAS DRIVING, I NOTICED AN OBJECT IN THE SKY WHICH APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR, AND TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE OBJECT MADE A SUDDEN 90 DEGREE TURN AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. I WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS BEFORE IT VANISHED.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE, AND I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE OBJECT I OBSERVED WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT OR ANY OTHER KNOWN AERIAL VEHICLE. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND STOPPED MY CAR TO GET A BETTER LOOK AT THE OBJECT, BUT BY THE TIME I WAS ABLE TO STOP, IT HAD VANISHED.

THE OBJECT MADE NO SOUND AND LEFT NO TRAIL OF ANY KIND. IT SIMPLY APPEARED TO CHANGE DIRECTION ABRUPTLY AND THEN DISAPPEAR FROM SIGHT.

THIS IS A TRUE STATEMENT OF WHAT I OBSERVED ON THE EVENING OF MAY 6, 1955 IN VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA.
