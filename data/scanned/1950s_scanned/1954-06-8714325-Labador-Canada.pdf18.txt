This case is interesting in that the object was seen and described by several reliable witnesses, all of whom were pilots and other persons with technical training. The appearance of the object and its behavior were somewhat unusual and unexplained.
On the evening of 8 June 1954, at about 8:00 pm, several persons in Labrador, Canada, including a number of pilots, saw a bright, disc-shaped object in the sky. The object was estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter and was observed for about 10 to 15 minutes as it hovered and moved about in the sky. It would suddenly shoot off at high speed, then stop abruptly and hover again. The object gave off a brilliant white light, which at times appeared to change to orange or reddish in color.
One of the witnesses, a pilot, stated that as the object came closer to him, he could see that it was a definite metallic, disc-shaped craft, with no visible means of propulsion. He said the craft appeared to be under intelligent control as it maneuvered in the sky.
Several other pilots and technical personnel who observed the object confirmed the details given in the above report. The Air Force investigator who handled this case stated that he could find no natural or conventional explanation for the object seen that evening in Labrador. The case remains classified as "unidentified".
