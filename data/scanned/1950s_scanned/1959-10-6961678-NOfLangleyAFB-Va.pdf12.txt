MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, TEAM "C", SAFLL
ATTENTION: Major Allen F. Vill

SUBJECT: Reply to Congressman Hardy's UFO Inquiries

The following will serve as a basis for reply to Congressman Hardy's UFO inquiries:

Dear Mr. Hardy:

I refer to your recent inquiries concerning unidentified flying objects in behalf of Mr. 

The 7 February 1960 UFO sighting in the mid-west was not reported to the United States Air Force and, therefore, the Air Force did not analyze or evaluate this sighting.

The 1948 top secret report officially concluding UFOs were real is non-existent. By "real" we assume Mr. _ means they were objects observed by competent observers. Captain Ruppelt's evidence in his book of 25 February 1960 refers to letters or memoranda of individuals whose personal opinions may have reflected these views. There has never been an official Air Force report with this conclusion.

The Poguekon, Virginia sighting on 19 October 1959 was not reported to Langley Air Force Base or the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center. The statement that the Air Force questioned a civilian UFO researcher is erroneous. This indirect form of interrogation is contrary to Air Force policy.
