The sane are an apparent "air funnel" or "ring formation" hovering over the road about a mile north of DeBorgia, Montana at approximately 4:00 P.M. MST on August 7, 1952. The ring formed and floated for about five minutes before disappearing. It was grayish-white in color and was quite solid and definite in outline. It was reported to be about 50 feet in diameter and appeared to rotate slowly as it floated. It was not a normal cloud formation.

Than one other person may have seen this occurrence, as it was allegedly seen by several people in the DeBorgia area at that time. 

I was very cautious to observe this phenomenon objectively, as I was not sure if "flying saucers" were real or not. However, after seeing this definite object which did not fit any conventional description, I am now convinced that such things do exist and are worthy of serious investigation.
