STATEMENT

At approximately 0215 hours 22 August 1953, the undersigned sighted, west of my house, a reddish brown light without reflector or sound moving south in an erratic up and down motion across the sky, at approximately 1500 to 2000 feet altitude.

The natural speed is unknown, but it seemed to move fairly slowly. It appeared to be larger than a star and resembled a star.

About 5 seconds after I sighted this object, I called my wife, Irene Poley, for an observation, and we both had a visual observation of the object for approximately 4 seconds longer when it slowly disappeared behind the houses across the street, moving from south to east.

About 10 minutes later an aircraft was sighted flying a southwest path. He turned on his landing light which were easy to distinguish as landing lights. Also, he made the normal aircraft noises. About 5 minutes after this aircraft was sighted, another one was sighted flying from north to south, and this aircraft passed in front of houses, and was also heard.
