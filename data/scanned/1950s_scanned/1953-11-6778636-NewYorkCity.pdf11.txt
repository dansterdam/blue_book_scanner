20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was, in its longest dimension.
22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
(Circle One): a. Head of a pin b. Nickel c. Dime d. Nickel e. Quarter f. Half dollar g. Silver dollar
22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22:) a. Certain b. Fairly certain c. Uncertain
23. How did the object or objects first become visible to you? How did they disappear from view?
24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would you give it? How would the same appearance as the object which you saw?

I HAVE GIVEN THE VERY BEST DRAWING I CAN OF THE MOTION OF THE OBJECT. IT WAS MOVING IN SOME KIND OF FLIGHT PATTERN WHICH I WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE DEFINITELY. IT WAS MAKING QUITE RAPID BUT ERRATIC MOTIONS AND I COULDN'T DRAW ANY CONSISTENT LINE OF TRAVEL. AT ONE POINT IT APPEARED TO GO INTO A VERTICAL CLIMB, BUT I AM NOT SURE.

Feet: APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET

23. How did the object or objects first become visible to you? How did they disappear from view?
The object first became visible to me as a small bright spot in the sky. It then began to grow larger and I could see it was some form of aircraft, but I am unable to describe it definitely. It then made a series of rapid, erratic motions and then appeared to go into a vertical climb and disappeared from view.

24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would you give it? How would the same appearance as the object which you saw?
I would not know just what kind of material to use to construct an object like the one I saw. It did not appear to be of any known aircraft design or construction that I am familiar with. It was approximately 30 feet in size and seemed to be a circular or disc-shaped object, though I could not be certain of the exact shape. It appeared to be metallic in nature, but I have no idea what kind of metal might have been used. The surface seemed to reflect light, giving it a shiny or luminous appearance at times.
