The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of UFO reports and investigations conducted by the United States Air Force in the 1950s.

The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or form for reporting UFO sightings. It contains sections for the observer to provide information about the object, such as its sound, color, and shape. There is also a section for the observer to draw a picture of the object, but no drawing is visible in this image.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system would output it:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

a. Sound -
b. Color -

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, body, tail, etc. Place an arrow under the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The shape of the object was:
(Circle One): 1. Round or oval
2. Elongated
3. Sharply outlined
4. Dont remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Give a picture of how they were arranged, and say an arrow to show in what direction they were traveling.
