Strangely enough, one very strange thing happened last night - there was a bright light in the sky and there was a swishing noise as it came down and went into the house to get my mother who was asleep on the porch. I did not go outside and it did not come out again. The object was the size of a plane but round and about 30-40 yards away. It seemed to stop about 100 yards off the ground and was there only 20/13 secs. reflected my fear. I had a hard look at it for 3 secs. As it turned and came a little closer it seemed bigger and I felt I was being watched. Then with all the power it shot straight up and was gone. Could not hear any motor or sound, just a swishing noise as it came down and went up. I only saw a round, bright object, no lights or anything, and it did not touch the ground. I felt a little shaken afterwards as I don't think you would come in contact with something strange like that every day. We said very little to anyone about it until recently.

It did no one any harm.
