Personal of their/philosophy and here's the key to the individual - Now, getting back to this space business, and the and the seemingly start of some of these things uh and one correction here uh I said in maceric in 1953 previously for listening excexpcxxx back over this particular tape it was 1943 I'll correct that date.

Speaking of this space situation some of the religious leaders, particularly the Catholics, uh positively do not want to concede the fact that people exist on other planets and other planes until they are forced to do so! A pope will have to come up with some new answers. Now Catholicism or any ism or religion should have no place in considering the military aspects of trips into outer space or space craft of various types coming here to reckon order the ex earth. And I think that these sky jockeys besides all the other training they need they need training in the metaphysical field and even beyond.

So that the situations/s sksk they might find themselves they will have the mentality the personal philosophy the understanding of man's true nature, his reason for being here, and this would sustain these people in moments of confusion and xxx fear.

It is something to have a man's wool philosophy of life, the very thing which upon which he has built his entire life shaken out from under him.
