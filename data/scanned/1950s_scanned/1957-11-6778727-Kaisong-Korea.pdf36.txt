At approximately 5:00 A.M., 6 November 1957, 19 men located in the demilitarized zone of Korea saw a brilliant flash of light in the Western sky. The flash was described as blue-white, developing into a red-orange trail of flame, size ranging from 1 inch to 12 inches when held at arms length. The flash was visible for from 1 second to 3 minutes, varying with observers. A trail of smoke, which was similar to a jet vapor trail, was seen behind the flash, or trail of flame, and was visible for as long as 30 minutes.
