The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR system and output the text found in the document:

On March 12, 1958, at about 8:00 PM, I was out in my backyard in Trenton, N.J. looking up at the sky. I observed an object that appeared to be approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter and about 15 to 20 feet thick. The object was whitish in color and had a reddish light on the bottom. It was moving at a slow speed and seemed to be under intelligent control. The object hovered for a few minutes and then shot off at a very high speed to the northeast.
