AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO: 30-1T/09-25-56
PART 2 OF 34 PAGES

I. SOURCE:  L.2and, Michigan
Age: 22 years
Occupation: Student  
Education: 1.3 years college
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: This investigator, Sheriff Bob White, said the source "is the kind of guy who sees something like a flying saucer."  He said the source did strike him as being sincere, but the sighting as described seemed to be rather unusual.

III. DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION: The witness was playing golf, when he saw an object at about 6:00 o'clock high and at about 3 miles distance. At first it seemed to be small, but it rapidly increased in size as it approached. It was oval or disc-shaped, and as it neared the witness, it appeared to tilt and changed to a darker color. After it passed the witness, it disappeared.
