"8 April 1952
To: Captain, USAF
Brownwood, Texas

1. Referring to a special service ON 6 APRIL 1952, at approximately 8:32 p.m., CST, Mrs. Ethel M. Newmark of Brownwood, Texas, phoned to report that her husband, Mr. Andrew Newmark, had sighted an unidentified flying object.

2. According to information received, Mr. Newmark first observed the object at approximately 8:10 p.m., CST, on 6 April 1952. The object was described as being white in color with a long, tapered tail. It appeared to be at a high altitude and moving in a north to south direction at a high rate of speed. After observing the object for several minutes, it disappeared from sight.

3. To the best of my knowledge, this is correct.
