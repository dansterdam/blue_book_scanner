Dear [Redacted],

Thank you for your letter of 4 August 1958 in which you 
reported the sighting of an aerial phenomenon.  A check of our 
records does not show any other reports from that area for the 
time mentioned.  We are, however, recording your report for use 
in our continuing study of aerial phenomena, and we appreciate 
your interest in the matter. 

Sincerely yours,

DWIGHT R. DINSMORE
