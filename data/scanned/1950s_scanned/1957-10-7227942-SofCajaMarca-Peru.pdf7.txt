ASTRONOMY

Venus Most Prominent

Venus, it is again the evening star, will be at its brightest and most prominent in the sky and will soon be joined by the brilliant object in the sky of "shooting stars".

By JAMES STOKLEY

THAT brilliantly shining object in the evening sky is the planet Venus, now at its best for observation this year.

Venus has been known since ancient times, of course, as one of the brightest objects in the sky. But this year it is especially prominent, far outshining every other celestial body, except the moon.

This is because the planet is in a particularly favorable position for observation in the evening sky of late 1957. It reaches greatest elongation, or greatest angular distance from the sun, on Dec. 7, and until that time it will be visible for a longer period after sunset than will any other planet.

Shining steadily at an apparent magnitude of -4.3, Venus now dominates the evening sky. It can be seen from the time the sun goes down until it in turn sets, some five hours later.
VENUS GROWS BRIGHTER

As 1957 draws to a close, Venus has been gradually drawing closer to the earth, and this increasing proximity has made it appear even brighter. Early in the year, its magnitude was only -3.9, but by now it has brightened to -4.3. This means it appears about 2 1/2 times as bright as it did in January.

This also means that Venus is now bigger in the telescope, and shows a larger, gibbous phase. When it was farther from the earth, its illuminated portion appeared smaller, but as it approached us, this portion has grown larger.

By Dec. 7, Venus will be about 47 million miles from the earth. After that date, it will start to draw away and become less prominent in the evening sky. Throughout November, however, it will dominate the landscape, and will remain a brilliant object until it disappears in the sun's glare early in 1958.

BRIGHT BIRDS IN THE SKY

These maps do, however, show the stars that are visible, and from them you can easily trace out the constellations. Cygnus, the swan, is in the north, with the head represented by the star Deneb. Below it is Aquila, the eagle, with its bright star Altair and two fairly bright companions.

Toward the west, faint Delphinus, the dolphin, can be seen. Above it is the prominent diamond-shaped figure of Pegasus, the winged horse. In the east, brilliant Arcturus glitters as the brightest star of Bootes, the herdsman.

So for stargazers, November brings a veritable "bird show" in the sky. Venus, the brilliant "evening star", dominates everything in sight, but the fainter birds, the stars of Cygnus, Aquila and Delphinus, are also well displayed as added attractions.

This is the 1957 version of what the ancients of old so long ago were watching as they gazed wonderingly at the stars.
