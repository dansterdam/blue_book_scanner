AIR SERVICES
It is hereby certified that the following statement is true. I was on the southern outskirts of Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the time indicated. I saw a light in the sky which at first appeared to be a very small, bright star. The color was a whitish-yellow, and it seemed to have a dim reddish hue. There was no aerial trail or vapor or anything of that nature which would indicate an aircraft. It was at a very high altitude. The object was in view for approximately 1 minute to 1 1/2 minutes and did not seem to change either in size or color during this period. There was no sound. The object then disappeared from view, not because it went below the horizon but because it seemed to simply vanish. I have between ten and twelve thousand hours in the air, and am quite familiar with aircraft of all types, including jet aircraft. I have no idea what this object was, but I am certain it was not an aircraft of any kind.
Sworn to and subscribed before me this 31st day of July 1952.
