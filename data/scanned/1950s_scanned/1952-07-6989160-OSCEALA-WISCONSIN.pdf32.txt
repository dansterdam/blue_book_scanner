AT 0703Z, 29 July 1952, the undersigned began to run stacks
with scope radarscope signals thicker than in cities. We had six
sill statbuff, five B-29's, lots of small track and no report of air- 
craft. Then things began to go up. We noticed a large group of strange 
radar reflections forming into groups of 10 objects per group moving
from west to east at approximately 200 miles. It would appear to go too
close on the American continent sometimes waiting at a cough like a dog. 
Sometimes these group objects would stop and would be replaced by 
others, but altogether they composed six groups appearing on repeated 
track of the same signals. Some were making turns and banks while 
others hold the air while others were bobbing up waiting on signal 
scopes and had come to the rest. 

A 727h,large formation of lights passing over radar signals 
more than a luminous object which appeared against the moon luminous shadowing.
corner of radar we made an exact and exact spotting to return awaiting for 
more spots but there were none then and awaiting over 600 yards they moved 
off radar without a track, thus leading to meditation. Signals were clear
and although conditions were hot, dewiness did not appear great quietness in
reflection though ace.

At 768Z, JJ's employed approach of eight, lights were observed by me and 
pilot. Observed many, appeared to be shooting lights were comprehended well, 
on several occasions when vectored toward the target. Much heat were on 
screen. There were so many targets in air that the plainness of their
material were not noted. All had sightings heading radar 678 and held many 
hundreds of yards. Observed surfacing and appeared to bear VVL or A/CU. 
Altitude between 27,000 feet and thousand feet
