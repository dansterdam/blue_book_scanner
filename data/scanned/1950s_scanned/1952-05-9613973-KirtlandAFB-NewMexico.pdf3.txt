SWORN STATEMENT

I, [redacted], Lt. USAF, 135th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn statement:

At 1600 MST, Friday 23 May 1952, an object was sighted approximately 260 degrees, West of Building T-1420, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.

Object was light in color reflecting the sunlight intermittently. Bright for periods varying from 3 seconds to 2 or 3 minutes. Remaining dark for like periods of time as though slowly circling. Object did not vary it's position horizontally more than 5 degrees.

Object was under constant surveillance from 1605 MST to 1625 MST. Object was viewed through a pair of 7 X 50 binoculars and the telescope of a transit but due to the distance which was approximately 12 to 20 miles recognition was impossible.

Toward the end of the observing period the object slowly decended below the horizon and out of sight.

Interception was attempted with negative results.
