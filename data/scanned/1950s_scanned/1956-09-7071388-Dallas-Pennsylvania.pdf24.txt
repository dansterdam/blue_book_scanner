There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text contained in the document:

Case 235, Cincinnati, Ohio, Sept. 27, 1956--said a local businessman's wife and Northern Ohio physician and wife, saw 3 unusual objects in the sky at a time when the wife said she was first attracted to them by their motion as they approached a window. She called her husband to look. The couple said they were startled at what they saw. The couple said the objects were "round, about the size of a full moon, with a slight yellow and purple coloring. They seemed to be hovering, moving very slowly across the sky." The objects then suddenly picked up speed and disappeared. The observer said they were visible for about 30 seconds. The husband, a physician, stated he had never seen anything like this before.
