On Monday, October 13, 1958, approximately at 6:40 PM Central European Time, a phenomenon was observed in the sky southeast of Kleinstheim near Ascherburg. Although I was with him, I did not see the appearance. Perhaps it was a shooting star. Since that time, this phenomenon in the sky was the "Pioneer". If you are interested in my cousin's observations, please list the questions you are interested in especially, for example, time and place of the observation, direction in the sky, direction of the movement in the sky, form and color of the phenomenon, etc.

Yours truly,
