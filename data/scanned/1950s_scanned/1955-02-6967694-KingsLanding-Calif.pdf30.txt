Text from the document:

Mr. Dwight Eisenhower
President of the United States
The White House
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. President,

I am writing to you about an aircraft penetration of the territorial air space of the Continental United States of America. This incident occurred in early February of 1955. I personally observed several minutes of this particular penetration.

This sighting was near Kingley Landing, California - which is near Sacramento, California. The years of almost futile efforts on my part has brought almost zero cooperation from the air force. After our five years the first effective interest and action was taken in December 1954, and a degree by which I have reproduced this one page 26. This Department of the Air Force letter is a detailed and careful report. A file included, on AF 1-C, a sheet of the legal under discussion follows.
