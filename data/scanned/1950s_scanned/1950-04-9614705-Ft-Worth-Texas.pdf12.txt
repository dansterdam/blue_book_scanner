AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
RCS: A-2-79
REPORT NO.: 
PAGE: 5 
DATE: 9 APRIL 1950
Director of Intelligence, Headquarters US Air Force
SUBJECT: Study in Interpretation of Negative and Photographic Information
1. One negative of the picture appearing in the past with the general outline obscured by white material. The material is not a masking, but is believed to be a normal condition of the development of this negative.
2. The positives resulting from the negative were fogged or blotched, which made detailed examination impossible.
3. Detailed technical analysis of the film itself could not be accomplished because the negatives were not available, but the effects described indicate that the film has physical characteristics attributable to normal photography operation and development. The film itself was not forwarded to the Intelligence Division of Headquarters US Air Force.
4. This film, when they received it, was attributed as strange occurrences to them.
5. Study in Interpretation of Negative and Photographic Information:
a. The negative characteristics revealed indicate that the positive prints submitted were probably the result of normal technical photographic difficulties rather than any abnormal or unusual photographic process.
b. The density and quality of the negative, as well as the nature of the fogging or blotching, reveal that the processing was not of the highest technical quality but nevertheless produced the positive prints submitted.
c. It is a thorough study of the negatives revealed that "You" could have been more leading than into the real or at least better development and printing that could possibly have substituted for good photographic techniques.
(1) The density of the film where it is completely clear or positive, leads one to believe it was a normal print and not abnormally dense.
(2) The second photograph (Fig. 1) reveals a similar density characteristic as the first, with some evidence of fogging on the edges, which is typical of normal processing difficulties.
6. Other Evidence:
a. Mr. claims to have seen the last object that could be seen.
b. Local radar installations report no unusual returns at that time.
c. Relative weather conditions at the time are not indicative of any unusual factors.
7. Evaluation of Findings:
The first North Star-Telegram" is from Fort Worth, Texas, and reveals that there is no evidence of any extravagant or unusual phenomena in the negatives submitted. All Air Force investigation and research by highly qualified personnel indicate that there is no evidence to support any claim of unusual celestial, aeronautical or physical occurrences. There are no indications of any sightings or events in the negatives.
