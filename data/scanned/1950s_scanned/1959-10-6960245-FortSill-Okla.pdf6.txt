Description: "A light was observed by two observers movining/traveling west to east at a high rate of speed, disappearing behind a wooded area" 
Direction of Motion: SE
Satellites: (ARGON-4&3, Phone 69219)

Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): Nil
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: Nil

Evaluation of Source Reliability: Reliable, good
Analysis and Conclusions: "THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS MOST LIKELY A WEATHER BALLOON AS THE DESCRIPTION OF LOCATION AND DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IS CONSISTENT WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF UPPER AIR WEATHER BALLOONS IN THE AREA. THE OBSERVERS WERE FAMILIAR WITH SUCH PHENOMENA AND COULD DISTINGUISH IT FROM NORMAL AIRCRAFT. WHILE THE SPEED APPEARS UNUSUAL, IT IS CONSISTENT WITH A WEATHER BALLOON AT THAT ALTITUDE AND LOCATION. THEREFORE, THE SIGHTING IS CONSIDERED DUE TO A WEATHER BALLOON, AND NO EXTRAORDINARY EXPLANATION IS WARRANTED."
