CONCLUDED BY LT. DUNLAY: Pilot C-47 aircraft:
"There was a flight of very high-speed, high altitude aircraft. I estimate the speed to be somewhere between 600-800 M.P.H. I was flying at 5,000 feet when I called Grand Island and requested clearance to change my course and climb as I was unable to maintain position to observe these aircraft. The time was about 22:00 local time. The object appeared to be illuminated as they were much brighter than the average star. I estimate the size of these objects to be between 30-50 ft. in diameter. The objects maneuver when I called Grand Island and received clearance to climb. When I reached 10,500 ft. the objects had disappeared from my sight. My mind was only a pilot flying that much higher would not be able to observe the objects if they were to appear, as they seemed to disappear almost instantly. I can say with certainty that these objects were not any known type of aircraft or satellite, and they were maneuvering in an unexplained manner. The objects appeared to be circular in shape and seemed to be illuminated within as there was no outer shell or boundary that one could observe. The subject appeared to be very strange and unconventional and does not compare to any known type of aircraft or satellite."
AT THAT TIME, I CONTACTED GRAND ISLAND AGAIN AND ASKED THEM AT WHAT POINTS THEY HAD AIRCRAFT IN THE AIR BUT THEY HAD NO INFORMATION ON ANY AIRCRAFT FLYING AT THAT TIME. I ASKED HIM TO CHECK OUTSIDE AND CHECK A LIGHT THAT WAS OVER GRAND ISLAND. HE STATED HE WOULD CHECK AND GET BACK TO ME BUT HE NEVER DID. THIS WAS SOMETIMES LATER, AFTER 3-5 MINUTES LATER, THE OBJECTS HAD DISAPPEARED FROM MY SIGHT. THIS CONCLUDES MY OFFICIAL REPORT ON THIS INCIDENT. I HAVE GONE OVER IT CAREFULLY AND IT IS MY HONEST AND SINCERE OPINION THAT WHAT I SAW WERE OBJECTS OR VEHICLES OF SOME KIND THAT ARE UNCONVENTIONAL IN THEIR METHOD OF FLIGHT AND PERFORMANCE AND CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.
