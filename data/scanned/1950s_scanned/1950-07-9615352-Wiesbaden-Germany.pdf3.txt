PLANE SAFE WHEN HIT BY "FLYING SAUSAGE"
The pilot of a plane reported that he was hit by a "flying sausage" over Springfield, Illinois. The pilot stated that the object was about the size and shape of a football, and that it hit the plane and then bounced off without doing any appreciable damage. One woman reported seeing the object, describing it as a "flying saucer". The pilot said he did not see the object until it had already hit the plane.
