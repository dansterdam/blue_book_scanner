Glowing hummed - moving toward car - peering down -
Saw Orange Star - huge - never stopped -
We moving in a South of direction.
Turned car around to the east - out watched for 
five minutes.

Turned car a head south - peered through windows - heard 
a sound like a ball bearing rolling in a metal container - 
no one near by to cause this - this happened as we watched
the object - it appeared straight up - then changed direction
as movement - gave only the affect - not aminal - the
left light traveled - bend as if Broke away to the right-hand
turned in not at all traces.

They was the glow to gather to the eyeing - up
of it was. If the gland was really kept - the light would
not be as bright as it was.

I all time watch the town small.
