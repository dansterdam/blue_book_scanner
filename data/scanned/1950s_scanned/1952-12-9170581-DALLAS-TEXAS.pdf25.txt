CONFIDENTIAL
SECURITY INFORMATION
SUBJECT: INVESTIGATION REPORT
1. GENERAL:
A total of 37,428 persons participated in the retrieval of 11 badly burned objects. It appears that these objects were a part of a meteor shower or the dispersal of an artificial satellite.
2. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS:
The objects, when retrieved, were extremely hot and in a deteriorated condition. The objects were dark in color, irregularly shaped, and seem to be composed of a light, brittle material. No positive identification of the material has been made.
3. LOCATION OF OBJECTS:
All other bases were notified to be on the alert for any other similar objects. No additional objects were located.
4. EXAMINATION OF OBJECT FRAGMENTS:
The object fragments were examined on an immediate basis to determine if they were of extraterrestrial origin. The examination was negative. There was no evidence to indicate that the objects were of anything other than natural origin.
RECOMMENDATION: Discontinue further investigation. The incident appears to have been the result of a natural phenomenon and does not warrant any further action.
