STATEMENT OF xxxxxx ADDRESDD:
PLACE OF SIGHTING: West Palm Beach, Fla. 
TIME OF SIGHTING: 2:30 P.M., 25 July 1952

I had just about the object that objects had been sited in other areas, we were looking for them. It was quite similar to I saw them after a while. About 10 to 12 very gole from my to SE. They appeared to be about 20 to 25 feet in diameter. Some of them seemed to be a little larger than the others. At first I thought they were airplanes, but after observing them for a while I was quite sure that they were not. The things were a silver-white color, and had a rather high rate of speed. They did not seem to be as large as aircraft, and they did not give off any sort of smoke-trail. They appeared to be skimming along a couple of hundred feet off the ground at a very high rate of speed. When I first saw them they seemed to be going from NW to SE. When I last saw them they seemed to be going from W to E. I estimate that they were in sight for around 2 or 3 minutes. As soon as I saw them I called my wife to come and see them, but before she got out they seemed to have disappeared. At no time did I see any sign of their slowing down or stopping. As a matter of fact, when I last saw them they were still going at a high rate of speed. They did not zig-zag or make any other erratic motions, but just kept going in a straight line. I am quite sure they were not airplanes, jets, or any other known type of aircraft.
