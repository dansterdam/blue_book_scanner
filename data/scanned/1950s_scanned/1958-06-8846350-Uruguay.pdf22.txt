All I remember is that it was night, in the summer of 1953, we were arriving home from my grandparents who lived in Chicago. It was 10:30 because we always got home at 10:30 every time we went to Chicago. There were absolutely no lights in the sky or for that matter anywhere around. The nearest house around then was about a block away. The lights in our house were out because we had not reached the house yet. My mother and I got out of our car and in the full moon we saw at tremendous lights, the shape of a circle. We observed it for about 10 seconds and then turned on the car for a very small amount of time to kind of tell my dad. But when we looked over, where we saw it, it was gone.
