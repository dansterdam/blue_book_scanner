The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

it had stripped the timing belt and had stopped time.
My Interpretation of what was seen:
1. According to the Air Almanac the moon rose just about the time of sighting.
2. A full moon or almost full moon looks coppery or even fiery when low to the horizon.
3. It was cloudy, almost a complete coverage. That made the nights very dark so the object was distinctly seen.
4. The appearance of the object to move was an optical illusion, due to the clouds moving down on the horizon and the moon shining through a small hole in the clouds.
5. The moon rose on the exact bearing where the object disappeared.
When I first saw the object I thought it was a flying saucer but after collecting my wits I can assure it was the moon I saw.
