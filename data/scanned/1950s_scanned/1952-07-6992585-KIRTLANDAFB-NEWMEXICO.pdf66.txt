112—PART II '
26 JUNE 1949
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO. [RESTRICTED]-SC 
73rd Air Base Squadron                                                         PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

       At 3:19 pm on Wednesday, July 30, 1952, I was sitting at a table by a 
picture window and my little five year old daughter called my attention to 
something in the sky at about a 50° angle toward the southwest which appeared 
to be coming directly down from the clouds, bluish sky above. The sky beneath 
appeared blue and the movement seemed very steady or even. The trail it left 
behind appeared white, thick, like fleecy white clouds, and not over four 
inches wide. Then, going straight down, disappeared into a large white cloud,
sort of greyish, toward the east.
 
       We watched to see if something would oust into this cloud but it did not 
appear in the blue sky between the cloud but instead, after a short time, about 
two minutes, we saw the movement with a sort of "twisty" appearance going hori-
zontally instead of straight down and behind it left, or only the appearance of 
thick, fleecy solid white, the width to the eye now only about like a clothes 
line line and going into the blue sky toward south a little but much more toward 
the east. We went outside in front of our house which is south facing on East
Mantato Street. 

       Then, because of trees across the street, it was lost to sight toward 
the southeast at an angle of about 35° at 3:26.

       The white trail did not seem to widen as it disappeared but rather faded 
out slowly from top part of rear end as trail moved southward.
