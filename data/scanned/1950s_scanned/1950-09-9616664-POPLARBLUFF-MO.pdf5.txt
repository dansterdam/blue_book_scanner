Rosebud, Tennessee Area

Meteor Blast
In Sky Rocks 
2-State Area

NASHVILLE, Sept 30 (AP) - Hundreds of residents in the area were awakened early today and apparently frightened by a brilliant flash of light in the sky.
The Highway Central Railroad agent in Lewisburg, Tenn., 40 miles from Memphis, Tenn., said an explosion occurred at 3:00 AM. This was felt over an area some 25 miles away. The report was not confirmed.

EX-PILOTS SAY IT WAS "FLASH"
A report of the gas flash was given to Memphis by American Airlines pilots from Washington. This was estimated to be about 175 miles long and 15 miles wide, flying at 15,000 feet. They said it lasted five to seven seconds.
The blast was heard from Western Kentucky to Memphis, Tenn. Housewives, farmers and others were roused by the explosion which was described as orange, yellow and blue flames shooting up in the sky.
There were no reports of damage or injuries. The CAA operator at the Nashville Airport said the blast came only five miles away.

The American Meteorite Society, whose members specialize in the study of meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good reports they can mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant--the point in the heavens from which it seems to come. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an MNS number. The data were published in Meteoritics, the journal of the society, and thus made available.
