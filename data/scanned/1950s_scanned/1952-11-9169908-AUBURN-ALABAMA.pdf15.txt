IN RR: STUDENT SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT, AUBURN, ALABAMA, 9 NOVEMBER 1952
On 9 November 1952, R. L. C., a student at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, was returning to his apartment in Auburn, Alabama, at approximately 7:30 PM when he saw a bright light in the northwest sky. The light appeared to change color and move in a circular fashion. He watched the object for about five minutes and then saw it disappear 
R. L. C. reported this incident to the authorities at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute and the incident was reported to the Air Force Investigator. 
The Air Force Investigator interviewed R. L. C. and was informed that the object was a bright light, approximately the size of a dime held at arm's length, that changed color from white to orange and back again as it moved in a circular fashion. The object disappeared suddenly, straight up and out of sight. 
The Air Force Investigator checked the area for any known aircraft activity, military or civilian, and was unable to determine the nature of the object. There were no other reports of the sighting from the area.
The Air Force Investigator concludes that, based on the information available, the object sighted could not be identified as any known type of aircraft or other explainable phenomenon. The incident is classified as an "unidentified" object.
