Sir:

I wish to thank you for the copy of blue book report which I requested. however, I noticed on page 5 last paragraph, that it indicated that this sighting was mentioned in reports from October 8, 1957 - November 7, 1959, and attempted to determine if any other reports were included in files. I find 33 days of massive sightings that this element was almost air years ago but my friend and I had not it the original report as we expected. Our reason or interest in retracing it.
