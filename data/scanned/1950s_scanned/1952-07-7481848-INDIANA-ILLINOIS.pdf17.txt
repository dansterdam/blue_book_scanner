While flying westbound (250 degrees) 25 minutes North of Dayton, Ohio at 6000 feet, I observed at 2105 hours CST an object first presumed to be a "falling star". It traveled in an arc approximately 10 degrees above the horizon from the left to the right. It appeared to be traveling from SE to NW about 1500 to 2000 M.P.H. The intense brilliance of the object plus its abrupt disappearance leads me to believe it was not a meteorite or "falling star". If so, it behaved as I've never seen one do before.
