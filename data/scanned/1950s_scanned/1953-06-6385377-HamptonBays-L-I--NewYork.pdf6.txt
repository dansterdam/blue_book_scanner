Subject: Small Flying Torpedo-like Craft.
Date of Occurrence: October 6th, 1952.
Place Investigated:

On Tuesday evening, October 7th, 1952, shortly after dusk, my six year old son James and I were on the front porch of our home, when we both noticed a small torpedo-like craft directly over us. It was, on the west side of Smith's creek. We watched it for several minutes, and it seemed to be maneuvering, hovering, and darting about, and it made a slightly humming sound. I finally had to admit to myself that I had never seen anything like it before. 

I must admit that I felt rather silly, when I was finally connected to the "police". It was just on an impulse to call them. I didn't mention about the voices or other craft heard the night before. 

However, I explained to the police about the lights, so they said they would send a car down. The police car had a hard time finding the exact location, but he finally got there. One of the officers said he didn't see anything unusual. The other officer was more concerned, and said he had seen similar objects before, and he wasn't sure what to make of it.

I should like to say that the small craft seen that evening was particularly maneuverable and gave the impression of being under intelligent control. I could see no projections or openings. It was solid in appearance, and dark in color.

And I have been told that similar objects have been observed on several occasions, so I must admit the only one watching now is myself.
