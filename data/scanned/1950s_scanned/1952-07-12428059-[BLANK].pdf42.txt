We have one instance in which a night fighter with
radar is reported to have locked on, as they say, to an object
in flight, which, after he'd followed it beyond this curve,
found that he was locked on to the ground and he had only a
very few minutes to recover because the ground target had
gone up and then misplaced by some phenomena, and he locked on
to it in a position where he wasn't, but, following it, he
eventually found himself directed toward the ground.

Now, the conditions that seem to produce these
temperature inversions and possibly the same kind of thing
for ground targets being misplaced in altitude -- I don't
know that it is worded that they're misplaced in azimuth --
is somewhat typical of the kind of hot humid weather that we've
been having here in the last three or four weeks. There's no
reason to relate those phenomena to those atmospheric condi-
tions positively, but it is a possibility.

Yes, sir?

THE PRESS: Did interceptors go up on any of the
three occasions?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Here?

THE PRESS: Yes.

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Yes, sir.

THE PRESS: What did they see on their radarscopes?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I don't recall that they
saw anything. Do you remember, Roger, whether anything was
sighted on their radarscopes?

MAJOR GENERAL RAMEY: There have been no radar
sightings. One or two reported (inaudible).

THE PRESS: There have been no airborne radar
sightings, General Ramey? Is that --

MAJOR GENERAL RAMEY: That's correct.

THE PRESS: On what did they report sightings?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Lights.
