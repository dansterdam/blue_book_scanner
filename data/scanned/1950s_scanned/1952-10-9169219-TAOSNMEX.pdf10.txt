SWORN STATEMENT

I, William J. Arrowood, 2d Lieutenant, USAF, AO 1650521, 490th Air Base Group, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

At about 2115 hours, 17 October 1952, I saw an object about the size of a football streak through the sky in a southwest to northeast direction. I was sitting in the public schools stadium in the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico at the time. I estimate the object to be traveling at a speed of over 2000 miles per hour and at an altitude of 30,000 feet. It seemed to me that this object was a meteorite and it was bright blue in color.

I would say that I observed the object for about 3 seconds, and it then disappeared.

Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 21st day of October 1952.
