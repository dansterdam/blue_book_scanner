The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report describing a UFO sighting.

Abrupt change of direction (no speed reduction) Whatsoever.
U.F.O. observed by-- 
Mr. & Mrs. Arnold, Mo.
July 12, 1952
this one was widely seen by everyone in our vicinity and at much closer proximity than the one of -June 27th.
The following day it was reported in the St. Louis Post Dispatch with photo reproduced showing a bright light like object with lots of other people seeing the same thing that evening.
I might change the above "plan by everyone 'to avoid many in our vicinity".
On the same evening and at a time fighting here this UFO seemed to be followed by another 6 or 7 which of course were very near and followed by respondent from the same lake of visual range - then followed by a little east or north - then followed on the positive that it was a specific written note a video reported that could be in the other sighting (over).
