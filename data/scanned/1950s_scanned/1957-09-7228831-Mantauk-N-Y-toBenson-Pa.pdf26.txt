having a non-rotating UPPER ASCIFIEDB causes, the former is considered the more likely.

c. The most probable cause of track BE-6 and BE-11 carried by Benton is believed to be equipment malfunction. External interference is not considered a probable cause. 

d. Estimates of the altitude of BE-111 and the portion of BE-6 carried by Benton are highly questionable. Estimates of the altitude of BE-6 carried by Montauk are totally without basis.

e. It is considered highly improbable that any of the track segments were caused by either meteors or auroral effects.

f. Although weather phenomena cannot be completely discounted, it is believed improbable that the tracks observed at Benton were a result of any known weather or atmospheric conditions.

g. Since weather data are not available from areas over the ocean, it is possible that unknown weather conditions could have caused the track observed at Montauk. On the basis of available data, however, weather is not considered a probable cause of the first segment of track BE-6.

h. On the basis of known missile capabilities, it is possible that a ballistic missile could simulate the trajectory of BE-6 as observed at Montauk and that the trajectory of a cruise missile could resemble BE-111 or the second portion of BE-6. Neither of these are considered probable causes.

i. Operational functions of the BOAR system were within established time criteria and in accordance with existing directives.
