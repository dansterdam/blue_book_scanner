Residents in the Mazabuka district were awakened at 4:15 a.m. on Thursday morning by a loud explosion which shook several buildings. At first it was feared that a dynamite truck in the railway goods yard had exploded, but a thorough search of the area revealed that no trace was found of anything which could explain the explosion. Reports were received from several Africans, said that the explosion was heard in a radius of 50 miles and that it lasted about 10 seconds and the noise was heard at Kafue, fifty miles away.

An official at the meteorological station said that it may have been a large meteorite which disintegrated before reaching the ground. There may have been many instances of meteorites breaking up in flight and leaving no trace. Meteorites vary in size and the after variety/velocity fallen noted in diameter as a table 6 in. can be heard up to a radius of over 50 miles that the explosion was in fact caused by a meteorite of fairly substantial size.
