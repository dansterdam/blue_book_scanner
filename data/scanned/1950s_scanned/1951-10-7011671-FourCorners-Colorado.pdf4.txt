13 November 1951

On 30 October 1951 while in Littleton, Colorado, we were in the Four Corners area, and inspected what appeared to be the remnants of an explosion and Colorado. In the Summitville Valley just outside of Colorado Springs, we have an estimated 30 degrees in the south, 25 degrees in the southwest, and 90 degrees in the east.

At about 1930 I first observed, and finally saw it disappear, a tight pattern of three objects to the northeast, in the exact south of ninety degrees at an estimated 5000 feet. They were hovering, and remained so for about three minutes.

It first appeared as white, and then as it descended into a green tint. It then just seemed to disappear.

We are convinced on her brilliant and what appeared to have been a fact. It had been, and then seemed to the light of making camp. I never gave it much further thought as the object may have attracted any other sighting and received consideration in a paper for your day.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
