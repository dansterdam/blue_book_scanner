the first thing observed was a bright light which appeared of the size of a harvest moon and seemed to be coming direct to us at an terrific speed. As it drew nearer in apparent size and brilliance it appeared to be hovering rather motionless but when first observingthere was a slight perceptible movement upward of say six to eight feet as if rising over some obstruction. the light itself emitted a brilliant white light and from its outlines appeared to be almost circular but in brilliant flashes gave evidence of a slight oblong shape. It did not appear to be enclosed within a frame or surrounding but seemed to be a solid mass of light. When it reached a point estimated around 200 to 300 feet from us and directly overhead it suddenly shut off leaving darkness as it went out. this phenomenon was repeated around three times within a period of some 10 to 12 minutes after which time it appeared to go north and away at a tremendous speed.
