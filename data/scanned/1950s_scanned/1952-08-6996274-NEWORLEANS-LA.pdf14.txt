AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
28 AD, Roswell AAF, NM
TR-33-52
PAGE 2 OF 2

At 1815 MST, identified as 2 UFOB's, spherical in shape. They were tarnish-gray, elliptical in shape. They were about 25-30 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of 10,000-11,000 feet. They flew straight and level at a speed estimated at 500-600 mph. Observed through binoculars. The two objects then began a very fast, vertical climb and disappeared from sight. 

The observers were located at their homes on Hamilton AFB, Calif. 

The information provided is inconclusive to the preparing officer concerning the unidentified objects observed in this report. However, it indicates the possibility that the objects sighted were of unconventional design.
