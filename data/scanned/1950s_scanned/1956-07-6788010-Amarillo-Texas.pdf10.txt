Case 178 between Port Austin and Bad Axe, Mich.
July 30, 1956 - We quote from The Saginaw News, in referring to this case: "Deputy Sheriff Earl N. Bird and Deputy Sheriff Louis Fadie reported seeing a luminous object about 500 ft. in the air traveling very fast. They said their car's lights dimmed momentarily when the object passed over them. The sheriff later said the object was a "brilliant light" between 8:25 and 9:35 p.m., moving in a zig-zag pattern. A deputy from Bay County, who was driving near the location, saw the object and said its "light was too large and seemed too fast to be an ordinary aircraft." The object was reported in Saginaw, Gratiot, Midland and Clare Counties. The Buick 4-90 cc reported the light shone "just like a Brock lamp flashlight." The object finally disappeared behind some trees.
