The image contains a photograph depicting a series of objects in the sky, which appear to be described as "sparks from a large exhaust" in the text. The text indicates that the observer, Colonel Roland W. Finger, saw this "cone" or object while driving home from the Greek Theater and describes its movement and characteristics.

COLONEL ROLAND W. FINGER 53 Tunnel Road Berkeley 5, California
U.S.A. RETIRED
Feb. 9, 1959
Memo for Intelligence Officer
Hamilton Field, Cal.
I saw this "Cone", also, and pointed it out to three University of California students (names unknown) who had called at the University to drive me home.
From the roadway just west of the Greek Theater it appeared like this:
[Sketch of objects]
looked like sparks from a large exhaust
Without changing its angle with the vertical it drifted southward, diminishing in intensity and size, and presently it faded away. I did not look at my watch, but I must have observed it for at least five minutes. The time was about 5:30 p.m.
When first observed I also saw an airplane just a little to the right of the cone, proceeding north. The plane seemed to be at an altitude of about 20Â°. It was bright red against the darkening sky.

COLONEL, U.S.A. (Retired)
P.S.
My theory is that the plane emitted a cone of exhaust vapor before I saw it. This straightened out and drifted away. The sun, just set or about to do so (I did not observe) threw light upon the cone in such a way that it appeared red to me, but possibly gray or illuminated to others observing from other directions.
