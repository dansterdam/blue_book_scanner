having difficulty. He took a realistic approach and had done some logi-
cal reasoning. He was worried about the fact that the light moved
relative to the stars.

By eliminating doubtful sightings, the only thing that can be rea-
sonably assured is that a GOC post observed a light. This could be a
balloon or star. Radar picked up something in the general area of the
GOC post and vectored an aircraft toward it. The pilot saw a light and
chased it. He got a radar lock on it, but this could have been a mal-

the north and the pilot could have seen this. Pending further study,
this incident is carried as Unsolved.

Conclusion

Unsolved.
