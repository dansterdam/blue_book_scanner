SUBJECT FLUORBRPT

In accordance with AFI 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLUORBRPT), the following, report of unidentified flying objects is submitted:

On 29 July 1952 + 2302 MST, 1st Lt. George E. Funk, Duty Controller, 135th AC&W Squadron, Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, N.M., observed a strange light in the western sky. In company with several airmen, Lt. Funk watched this light for approximately three minutes through a transit. He still was able to see and follow the light as it moved in the sky for about ten (10) minutes and gradually seemed to fade away. No radar contacts were made with the object by this squadron.

At approximately 0015 MST 30 July 1952, the 769th AC&W Squadron, Continental Divide, New Mexico was notified by Lt. Funk that an unconventional flying object had been sighted. This unit made electronic contact with the object and several people went outside of the building to look for it. The object was soon hovering under a cloud to the east. It hovered nearly motionless for a few minutes, and then, it traveled slowly a flat circle. The object appeared to be approximately 25 miles away and resembled a large light. When the object reached a speed of approximately 200-knots, the light went out, and it disappeared toward the north. The time of observations by observers at the 769th AC&W Squadron was approximately ten (10) minutes.

A fighter (F-86) from the 93rd Fighter Interceptor Squadron was scrambled in an attempt to intercept the object; however, no sighting was made by the fighter.

The reliability of the observers making the above sightings is considered good.
