Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

I refer to your recent letter to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center regarding the sighting of a UFO you reported to the authorities on [REDACTED]. You did not include any other information (such as data and place), so we ask that you forward the data and file concerning where it occurred.

In the event you did not fill out the Air Force Questionnaire, I am enclosing one which I request you fill out to the best of your memory and forward the completed document to the Technical Information Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

For your information I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense facts sheet on UFOs which clearly state the position of the Air Force and the Department of Defense on this subject.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt Colonel, USAF
