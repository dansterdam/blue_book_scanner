Description
Two civilians who work in the Aero Maintenance Section at Nellis AF Base, Nevada, saw an unknown object over Deer Creek Springs, Nevada, which they estimate to be 100 feet in diameter and at an altitude of 70,000 feet. The object was silvery metallic in color and reflected the sun brilliantly at times. The object was observed for a period of one hour with both men power and seven power binoculars.
Discussion
Reporting officer stated in his report that there was no weather balloons or aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. A check was made with the upper air research balloon tracks received from Lowry AF Base to determine if there was a balloon over that area. The tracks showed that there was no balloon over that area.
Conclusion
Probably balloon (upper air research).
