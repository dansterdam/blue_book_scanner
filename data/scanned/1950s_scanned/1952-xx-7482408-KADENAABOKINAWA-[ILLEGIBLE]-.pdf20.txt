KADENA AB OKINAWA [ILLEGIBLE] This report is in response to [ILLEGIBLE] message requesting information concerning a radar observation of an unidentified flying object. The following details are the result of an investigation conducted by this headquarters:

On 7 September 1952, approximately 1130 hours, radar operators at the Kadena Air Force Base radar site observed an unidentified target on their radar scopes. The object was tracked for approximately 3 minutes and was estimated to be traveling at an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet and at a speed of 300 to 400 knots. The object was intermittently tracked until it disappeared from the radar screen.

Visual observation of the object was not possible due to overcast weather conditions at the time. No other confirming radar or visual contacts were reported in the area.

After careful analysis of the radar data and a thorough investigation, no conclusive explanation for the unidentified target could be determined. The observation was reported through channels in accordance with current directives.
