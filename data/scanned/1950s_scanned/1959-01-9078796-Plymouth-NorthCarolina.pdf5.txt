2 February 1959

Your letter of 14 January 1959 concerning unidentified flying objects sightings in Plymouth, North Carolina, contained insufficient information to allow a valid conclusion.

In this regard, I will not place the details of the closed questionnaire and forward it as direct to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Evaluation of the data and a determination of the cause will be advised of their conclusions.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
