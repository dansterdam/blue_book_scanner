INFO: AF HQ USAF WASH DC 171312 FEB 53
FROM: APWI-STAN-5-8 FOR 171215Z AIR TRANS NO. HQ
AFIC has been advised by D/I 19 USAF that your organization has received 3 separate reports on 25 Feb 53 and 5 and 6 Mar 53 of an unidentified aerial object sighted at Great Falls by one of your observers. AFIC advises the following in handling the incidents: 1) Advise Mr. Lee to determine the approximate altitude and elevation readings in each case, or at least its general position in the sky. 2) Were there other observers or witnesses? 3) Check local radar facilities to determine if they recorded anything unusual at the dates and times of sightings. 4) Check local weather balloon launches as a possible cause for one or more of the sightings. Although 2 out of the 3 sightings are in the daytime, briefs indicate there are sometimes visible during the day. AFIC has caused many incidents in the USAF and AFIC advises that a local astronomer be contacted on this possibility.
