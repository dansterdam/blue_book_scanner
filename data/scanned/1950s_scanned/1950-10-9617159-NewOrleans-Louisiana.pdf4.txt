AIR INTELLIGENCE REPORT. DO #9, 7 NOV 60, SUBJ: REPORTS OF UNCOVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT

"I have kept quiet about it all this time, but now I feel I must make and tell you about it." Signed

1. The New Orleans Item of 17 October 1950, editorially speculated concerning the sighting on the preceding Sunday, of four "silver and shiny spheres" by "several persons" in the New Orleans area. This was concluded by Commander USSI, and it is possible that the three groups of experts observing the Air Force which claim the sighted object was not an Air Force or a Naval missile are borne out by this official statement in the press by a USS Missile Expert, and concluding that these sightings have been due to errors and mistaken identity of actual and authorized US Air Force missile tests and that no so-called "flying saucers" are involved.

2. ACTION: None contemplated by this headquarters.
