CASE NO. 17
22 DEC 1952
MISHAP, JAPAN

At 1720 hours 22 December 1952 an unidentified object was observed approximately 30 miles south of MISAWA AFB. This sighting was reported by pilot flying a T-33 jet aircraft. This T-33 was traveling at 6,000* altitude on a heading of 0 degrees at 130 knots. At the time of sighting, 2 F-94s were making practice runs on the T-33. The object was sighted to the left rear of the T-33 and was described as a fast moving luminous object. The object had a reddish glow and disappeared to the northwest. The object that was had reflected the sunlight was a small shiny disc-shaped object. The object then appeared to make a pass at the T-33 at an estimated 800-900 mph in excess of the T-33's airspeed. It circled rapidly and just before flying into his aircraft, the pilot deliberately put his aircraft into a maneuver. It dived on the edge at approximately a 45 degree bank. It then fluttered within 20 feet of his fuselage for 2 or 3 seconds, and pulled away around his starboard wing where it disappeared behind the sunlight. When it passed in front of him and pulled away abruptly, appearing to accelerate, and shot out of sight in a steep almost verticle climb. The pilot of the F-94 didn't observe this sighting.
