The image does not contain any photograph. It is a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically a "DISPOSITION FORM" dated 13 Dec 58.

The text in the document is as follows:

FILE NO.               SUBJECT (U) Evaluation of UFO Report No. IP-5004-58  
TO AFCIN-4b4          FROM AFCIN-431                     DATE 13 Dec 58 
COMMENT NO. 1

Since no confirming data such as physical evidence exists it is assumed that the radar "targets" may have been aircraft.
