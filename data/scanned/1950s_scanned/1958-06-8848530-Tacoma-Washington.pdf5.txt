First observed in the east early on the morning of April 14, 1958, appearing as a group of 14 bright reddish-orange lights or objects in a tight formation, traveling from west to east, and disappearing shortly after. Objects were observed by several people, including US Army and Air Force personnel stationed at the Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Washington. Witnesses stated that the objects appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground and were moving at a high rate of speed. No sound was heard. Some witnesses claimed that the objects appeared to change in color and shape. The Air Force Radar at Fairchild Air Force Base did not pick up any unidentified objects at the time."
