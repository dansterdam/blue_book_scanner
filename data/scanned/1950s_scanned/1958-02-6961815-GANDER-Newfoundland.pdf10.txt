At 10:45 A.M., 27 February 1958, a ground party left Glenwood with Mr. [REDACTED] to locate the clearing he claimed to have found, with no success.

Two officials of the Bowaters Woods Department, Glenwood, who knew Mr. [REDACTED] for some time, were interviewed. It was learned that Mr. [REDACTED] has a reputation - to put it mildly - of [REDACTED]. This is borne out by the fact that during the search, he made several inquiries as to whether this incident could receive any publicity. When he was informed that it probably would not, his assurance that he could find the clearing again became less vehement.

Further search was not recommended due to the snow and brush conditions. If the clearing could be located, aerial photos could be taken and studied.

Because Mr. [REDACTED] cannot furnish more details or locate the clearing, this is carried as an unknown [REDACTED].
