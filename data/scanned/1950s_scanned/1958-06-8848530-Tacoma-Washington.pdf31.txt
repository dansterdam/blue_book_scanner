The image does not contain a photograph, but rather is a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text in the image describes the observed object, stating that it "came together. A joining 3 => me". The edges of the object were described as "blurry" or "sharply outlined", and there were multiple objects observed that appeared to be traveling in the same direction.

The transcribed text from the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None
b. Color - Very of color

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc. and anything else that will help describe the object.

Go home and think - two objects came together. A joining 3 => me

18. The edges of the object were: 
(Circle One) a. Blurry b. Clearly outlined c. Other

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? two Show a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
