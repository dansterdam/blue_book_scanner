NO CASE (INVESTIGATION ONLY)
3 NOV 1953 (ENGLAND)

THREE MESSAGES RECEIVED 19 NOVEMBER 1953 REGARDING SIGHTING IN ENGLAND:

1. A British sergeant and four assistants were testing a radar set in a London suburb. They observed on their screens something which seemed larger than ordinary planes. The signal came from an object which seemed circular or spherical in color.
The five radar men knew they were dealing with a mysterious metallic object about 60,000 feet in altitude. It appeared and disappeared intermittently, the strange signal persisted.
The object was seen by the civilians to be about the size of a silver pound coin at 60,000 feet. It disappeared behind cloud at this altitude.

2. The British War Office and the Royal Air Force Fighter Command are said to have been investigating this phenomenon. They said the huge spheroid was giving off or reflecting a fierce light and "had paralyzed their plans as it manoeuvred".

3. The British War Office and Air Ministry confirmed this morning that a "strange object" had been tracked on November 3rd by RAmy radar. The object - a metallic phenomenon - was also seen by two Royal Air Force men who watched it through 6x30 binoculars the same day and again the following day and night for over an hour.
