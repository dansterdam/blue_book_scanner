SUMMARY:

On 16 April 1952, Cpt John R W Cambell, senior controller on duty, received a call from 176th Fighter Squadron Operations, Truax Field, Madison, Wisconsin, that a Mr.  had observed 5 or 6 objects in the sky, almost straight up and slightly to the east. The time: 20:15 CST. They were semi-circular in shape and formation, glowing with a yellowish - white light. Neither ground nor exhaust was noted. They were on a heading of approximately 090° traveling at a high rate of speed; altitude not determined.

After a few seconds the object(s) made a sharp left turn in a North NW direction and gained altitude rapidly, as they disappeared the lights seemed to fuse or come together.

The sighting was verified by his friend, Mr. . Both observations were made by the naked eye.

At the time Capt Cambell received the call (20:25) our radar station A1/CPS-6B was off temporarily due to preventive maintenance, but Capt Cambell brought it operational in about three minutes to obtain radar observation, with negative results. There were some F-80 type aircraft in the vicinity which he directed to investigate, with no results. He then took a flight of F-86 'type aircraft at 30,000 ft over area; shift de nothing.

The weather by teletype was: VHB, clear and better than 15 miles visibility, temp 53°, dew point 35°, wind WNW at 4 MPH, barometric pressure 30.22.

A check with the local airlines placed a Northwest Airlines Flight 423, of that date, enroute from Chicago to Minneapolis, Over Loina Rock, Wisconsin at 20:05 CST, and again by LaCrosse, Wisconsin at 20:30 CST, therefore this flight could not have been the object sighted. No other airline flights in the vicinity.

In checking with the Yerkes Observatory, Williams Bay, Wisconsin, and with the Washburn Observatory at the University of Wisconsin, Madison for any meteorological display, there was nothing unusual recorded.
