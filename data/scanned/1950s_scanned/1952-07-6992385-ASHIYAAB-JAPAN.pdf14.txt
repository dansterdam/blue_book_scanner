There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Air Intelligence Information Report document related to a UFO sighting in Ashiyaab, Japan in 1952.

The text in the document is as follows:

AT APPROXIMATELY 21:29 ON 29 JULY 1952, UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FROM ASHIYAAB AIR BASE, JAPAN. THE OBJECTS WERE FIRST OBSERVED APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES EAST OF ASHIYAAB. INITIAL OBSERVATION WAS OF A SINGLE BRIGHT LIGHT WHICH MOVED IN A CIRCULAR PATTERN AND GRADUALLY DROPPED IN ALTITUDE UNTIL IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 1500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL.

AFTER REMAINING STATIONARY FOR A FEW MINUTES, THE LIGHT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND REACHED A SPEED ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 600 MILES PER HOUR. IT THEN REMAINED VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 2-3 MINUTES BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE LIGHT INCREASED IN INTENSITY AND BRIGHTNESS CONSIDERABLY.

AFTER FAMILIAR OVERHEAD, THE LIGHT RETURNED TO THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF INITIAL OBSERVATION AND HOVERED AGAIN FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES. IT THEN ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. ALL MOVEMENTS AT THIS TIME WERE ESTIMATED TO BE AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 600 MILES PER HOUR.

INITIAL INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE BASE WAS NOT COMPLETE, AND THE REPORT WAS NOT TURNED IN UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY. THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH ANY PORTION OF THIS OBSERVATION.
