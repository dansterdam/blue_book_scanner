Text extracted from the document:

Lbr hj PEAR apo 525, 3 jct: Unidentified Air Contact, to 2/1 pt USAF.

(4) Contact:
Heading -   Approximately same as planes 4500 jt.  
Altitude -  
Course -    270o (approximate)  
Distance -  12 miles (by radar)

c. Summary of events:
A flight gunner, on lookout duty at an open waist hatch, sighted a light on the port side and notified the FD. The FD saw the light and brought the contact to the attention of the CO. The radioman confirmed the contact, reporting the distance as 12 miles. The speed of the target was observed to be 200 knots (approximate). The color of the planes seemed to vary during the period of observation, changing from yellow-white to reddish-orange. The color changes were apparently connected to the changes in the speed of the planes, with a reddish-orange color associated with the higher speeds. Radar contact was lost, but visual contact was maintained until the target disappeared over the horizon, at a distance estimated to be approximately 25 miles. During the period it was observed, the target traveled an estimated distance of forty-five miles. No evasive action was taken and no countermeasures were employed.

d. Patrol Plane Commander's Narrative:
At 0235Z on the date of 23 October 1951, as spotted station 33-32, at position 38-16N 123-16E, Yellow Sea, a contact approximately 12 miles distant was observed on radar.
