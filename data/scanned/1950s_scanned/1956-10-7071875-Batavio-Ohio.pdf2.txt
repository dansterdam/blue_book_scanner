Dear Captain Gregory,

Enclosed herewith are three photographs and five negatives obtained by the writer. These photographs were taken by two reliable citizens of Cincinnati, Ohio, which may be of interest to your command. This photograph shows a bright light object which appeared to be hovering over the local city power plant. The photographer stated that the object remained stationary for several minutes and then suddenly disappeared. The photographer is present, interested in astronomy, particularly lunar studies. He is in possession of this photograph (which I have marked #3) with partial ovoid light censor. He stated that he has taken several other photographs of similar objects on previous occasions, and that he knows of several other people in this area who have obtained similar photographs. However, a thorough investigation of the above-mentioned reports should be made.

Mr. Harrell told the writer that he photographed the "object" while taking a series of shots of the moon. He has many times photographed the moon, and I feel certain that the photograph in question was taken at that time and refers to an object of interest in the moon, and I feel certain that the photograph in question was taken at that time and refers to an object of interest in the moon, and I feel certain that the photograph in question was taken at that time and refers to an object of interest in the moon. He also gave me permission to contact your command regarding the photographs or, if you prefer, I will send whatever additional information you may desire.

The photographs taken by Mr. Harrell were taken on Sunday, October 14, 1956. This was during the night-time sightings of UFO's from three separate groups of witnesses in the greater Cincinnati area. Names are as follows:

Fort Covington, Kentucky about 9 p.m. - Mrs. Cloyd told the sky was deep blue, while descending an invisible light about quarter the size of the full moon. The object was stationary, according to her statement, by the time she had reached the front door of her residence and observed the phenomenon for several minutes.
