This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a cover sheet for an analysis of a 35mm color slide, likely part of Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

ALMOGORDO
COVER SHEET
DATE: 13 SEPT 1957
SUBJECT: Analysis of 35mm Color Slide
ROUTING: 
TO: SAFIS-3, Major Tucker
AFOIN-4/WS:
1. ATIC comment based on its review and analysis of 35mm color slide.
2. Please advise our findings.
BRANCH: It is this office's conclusion, supported by that of ATIC Photo Analysis, that this object was a rare form of ice crystal. The so-called "circular type" formation was also common. At Holloman AFB, who reviewed the material, parallels those of this office's. Note should also be taken of the investigators' determination on the individual who took this photograph.
This office has no record of other UFO sightings from this area on purported data of this photograph.
