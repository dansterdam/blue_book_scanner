The image contains a photograph of a "day lead balloon" which appears to be the subject of a report. The text in the document discusses the characteristics and behavior of this balloon, including that it was tracked by radar and telescopes, and that it crumpled into a 30-inch container after reaching high altitudes. The text also mentions that such balloons could be used for scientific research purposes, but discusses concerns about their size and low weight.

WASHINGTON, OCT. 30--(UP)--PUZZLED SCIENTISTS SOUGHT AN EXPLANATION TODAY FOR A STRANGE BALLOON LAUNCHED HERE SATURDAY NIGHT.

THE BALLOON, ABOUT 30 FEET IN DIAMETER, WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING SPOTTED ABOUT 9,000 FEET ABOVE THE DISTRICT SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT SUNDAY. IT THEN ROSE AT A STEADY RATE TO AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 60,000 FEET.

ACCORDING TO REPORTS, THE BALLOON WAS TRACKED BY RADAR AND TELESCOPES AND WAS OBSERVED TO CRUMPLE INTO A 30-INCH CONTAINER.

THE TEST, PRONOUNCED A COMPLETE SUCCESS, PAVES THE WAY FOR AN ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH A SIMILAR BALLOON AT CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA., ON MONDAY. 

SUCH SATELLITE SCIENTISTS SAY SHOULD MAKE AN IDEAL REFLECTOR FOR USE IN LONG-DERANGE COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE OF ITS LARGE SIZE AND LOW WEIGHT. ABOUT 15 POUNDS, THE BALLOON ALSO COULD BE USEFUL IN STUDYING THE CONDITION OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

HOWEVER, THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF WHETHER SUCH BALLOONS, SHOT UP TO 60,000 FEET, COULD WITHSTAND THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE. THIS WOULD BE DETERMINED IN THE TEST.
