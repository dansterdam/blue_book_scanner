U.P.O. DATA BOTANAEI

Large UFO first sighted by a number of people at 6 p.m. in an apparently same position as the first one, and several others and we stood in the driving rain for the following 15 minutes. We watched figures appear on top - four of them - no doubt that last night a smaller one was over the hills. Another overhead. On the large one two of the figures bending over and raising their arms as though adjusting or testing something. One figure seemed to be adjusting looking down, as (a group of about a dozen). I stretched my arm above my head and waved to our mysterious visitors.
