30 JANUARY 1956
CALVIN, OKLAHOMA

A BALL OF FIRE WAS REPORTED OVER OKLAHOMA TOWN. A MYSTERIOUS BALL OF FIRE WAS REPORTED ON THE NIGHT OF 7 JAN: BY SHERMAN J. McDONALD, A SERGEANT OF CALVIN, OKLAHOMA. McDONALD SAID THAT HE AND TWO OTHER PERSONS WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND A HILL. "THE LONGER WE WATCHED, THE BRIGHTER THE LIGHT APPEARED TO WATCH IT." MY WIFE WAS ASLEEP IN THE BACK SEAT WHEN SHE STOPPED, AND I TOLD HER ABOUT IT. SHE SAID SHE DID NOT SEE IT. MY SISTER-IN-LAW AND I SAT THERE AND WATCHED, AND IT KEPT GETTING CLOSER. IT WAS MADE UP OF FIRE, AND IT SEEMED TO BE GOING UP AND DOWN. JUST BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE HILL, IT SEEMED TO BE GOING STRAIGHT UP. AFTER IT WENT BEHIND THE HILL, THE TOP WAS STILL VISIBLE, AND THEN IT WAS JUST A STEADY GLOW. HE ADDED, "WE STAYED THERE FOR SOME TIME, BUT COULDN'T SEE IT ANY MORE, BUT THERE WAS STILL A STEADY GLOW WHERE IT WENT BEHIND THE HILL."
