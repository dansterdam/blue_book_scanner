LIGHTS: INTERCEPTED ONE AMERICAN AIR LINES CONVAIR, FLIGHT 422, WHICH LANDED AT WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. FLT 422 WAS INTERCEPTED AT 1910Z JAN 54. FLT 422 WAS 7 MILES SOUTHEAST OF WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT AT TIME OF INTERCEPTION.
11. CHECKED WITH ALL ADJACENT AGENCIES. OTHER THAN FLT 422, NO OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF SIGHTING.
12. COL. U.S.A.F. DIRECTOR AND RATED AIRCRAFT OBSERVER: MY ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE UNKNOWN OBJECTS COULD POSSIBLE BE AIRCRAFT LANDING TO THE NORTH AT WASHINGTON, MAKING A PATTERN THAT WOULD TAKE THEM PAST THE SOUTH OF A POINT AT RADAR-55 WEST LONGITUDE 77.49' AND NORTH LATITUDE 38.45', THEIR GOING IN A QUARTER CIRCLE PATTERN TOWARDS WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. IN THIS PATTERN THE RED PART NAVIGATION LIGHT WOULD BE TOWARDS OBSERVER UNTIL PASSING OUT OF SITE ON HORIZON. IN REFERENCE TO ITEM 12 ON COMPLETION OF THE INTERCEPT I CHECKED WITH WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL AND THEY STATED THAT IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS A RED FLASHING ANTI COLLISION LIGHT HAS BEEN INSTALLED ON SEVERAL CIVILIAN PASSENGER AIRCRAFT. I BELIEVE THAT THESE LIGHTS COULD POSSIBLY BE CAUSING THE SIGHTINGS OF THE RED FLASHING OBJECT.
