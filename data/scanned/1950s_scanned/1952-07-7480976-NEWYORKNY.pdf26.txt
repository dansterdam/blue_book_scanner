STATEMENT
On 7 July at approximately 1030 hours the undersigned was driving his car about 2 miles east of Sherman (92-01). The sky was overcast with scattered clouds and blue openings. At approximately 1045 hours his attention was drawn to a bright object descending from the southwest (approximately 225-230 degrees) to the left (northwest side) of his line of sight (approximately 280-285 degrees). This object was descending at a very high rate of speed and its motion was almost vertical. At no time was it noted to follow the path of descent. The flaming column reminded the undersigned of an emergency flare launched from a plane in distress and at first impression he felt it was a flare. However, as the object descended it became less corpulent and lighter in color and appeared to have a transparent glow or mist envelop the column to the earth's surface. The time of passage from initial sighting to disappearance was estimated to be approximately 15 to 20 seconds.
The undersigned saw no fireball or object, but did note the sudden disappearance of the bright column which seemed to blend into the surrounding conditions. This event or occurrence had an elongated "V" (V-type) shape with small particles or sparks trailing from the head of the column. It appeared to be approximately ¼ to ½ the apparent size of a star. The undersigned offered no explanation as to the nature of the object seen.
