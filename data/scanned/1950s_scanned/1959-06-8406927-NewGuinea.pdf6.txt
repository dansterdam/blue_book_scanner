APPENDIX TO REPORT

Dogura, 9th July 1959
Last night I went out of my house between 11:30 and midnight and saw a bright beam of light shining across the sea near the shore and parallel to the beach.
The light was white and it lit up waves of the sea. I thought it was coming from a boat and so I returned to the house. I heard no noise.
Signed:             - Teacher, Dogura
