The shared image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report and does not contain any photographs. The text on the page describes a UFO sighting incident, including details about the object's trajectory, speed, and disappearance. The text also mentions that various tests were conducted to check for known aerial phenomena, but the results were negative.

CASE #25 (CONT'D)
TO WHOM THIS MAY CONCERN: Contact was broken off at 0235 after a group of the blips merged into a 3 inch curved arc about 30 miles from our e/e at 330 deg and proceeded across the scope and off it at a computed speed of over 9000 mph. At all times during the contact the e/e was level and stable, the weather was clear, not a cloud in the sky and visibility was excellent. There was a full moon giving excellent water reflections. The e/e was flying long range cruise at the time. Radar checked the blips as nil and angle full up and down. One group of blips after the scope was observed were noted, after moving from 330 deg to 150 deg across the scope, to are about 3 and dving in behind us at approximately 30 miles and maintain speed and distance for approximately 10 seconds and then disappear.
ATIC Comment:
All possibilities were checked for known aerial phenomena with negative results.
Conclusion:
