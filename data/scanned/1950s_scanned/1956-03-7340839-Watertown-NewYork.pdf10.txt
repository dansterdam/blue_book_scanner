AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
CONTROL SYMBOL 30-UFOM-3-50 PAGE TWO
SUBJECT: 3-30, 4603d AISS
CONTENTS OF Preparing Officer:
a. This Preparing Officer concludes that this sighting was probably caused by the 
planet Venus. All observers stated that it was visible in the western sky and seemed 
to be stationary. From reports, it appears that Venus was quite low on the horizon 
and must have seemed very bright and steady at that time of the evening. Venus is 
sometimes mistaken for a UFO object, due to its brillance and steady position in the 
sky.
b. All observatory personnel observed this object, through glass, and did not 
see it as a blinking or rapidly moving object. Although the object appeared brighter 
and closer than a star would be, nobody lost sight or control of the object. Under 
these conditions, it seems to fit the description of the planet Venus.
c. Each observer was either vague or contradicted the other in their statements. 
No evidence to the contrary that the object was Venus was presented.
d. Radar paintings of the object were negative as attempted by the 623rd ACAW 
Squadron.
e. A check with CIW Routing and Control Station at Watertown Airport 
revealed that no unusual phenomena were observed on their scope at the time of sighting.
The weather was described as clear, 20,000 feet ceiling, clouds broken. Time of 
observation as stated by SOURCES, ranged from ten minutes to thirty minutes. 
All observers were certain of their statements.
