The image appears to contain a diagram and text discussing radar and the formation of ducts under certain atmospheric conditions. The diagram shows a radar pulse traveling through a duct formed by a warmer air mass overlaying cooler air, which can cause the radar pulse to travel farther than it would normally. The text explains that under these abnormal conditions, the radar scope may show targets at greater distances than they actually are.

The text also discusses the importance of carefully studying unusual radar sightings, as they can provide the operator with the ability to recognize most unusual phenomena that may occur. However, the text notes that a verification of meteorological or astronomical data may be necessary to substantiate the validity of what an unusual flying object might be considered.

OCR OUTPUT:

Under abnormal conditions, with cool air overlaid by a warmer air mass, a duct is formed through which the radar pulse travels and reflects Target "C" at a much greater distance.
The radarscope will show Targets "A" and "B" at normal ranges, but distant Target "C" closer ranges than it actually is.
Difference may cause the appearance of one or even two targets on the radar screen. It can generally be recognized quite easily.
A careful study of unusual radar sightings will almost always disclose that the display is explainable. Experience in the operation of radar will provide the operator with the ability to recognize most unusual phenomena when they occur. However, occasionally a verification of meteorological or astronomical data may be necessary to substantiate the validity of what an unusual flying object might be considered an unfamiliar flying object.
