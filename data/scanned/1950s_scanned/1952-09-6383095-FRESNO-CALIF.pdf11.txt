IR-150-52
9 Sep. 5, 1952, 3:40 A.M.

Air, was there an unidentified or known aerial object over the area south of Fresno and northeast of Coalinga? Yes, there was.

At about 7:05 a.m. (or 4 hrs if we westward (a little watch of west?), an object which seemed to be slowly descending from "centers" appeared. It appeared to be round, nearly the same brightness as the surrounding sky, and was estimated to be about 15 degrees in diameter. It could not be identified as a star, planet, balloon, or any conventional aircraft. It was in this position for about 10 minutes.

Incidentally the object appeared to be at least 50 degrees above the horizon. The reporting witness stated that the object turned northward, increased in brightness, and at about 7:20 a.m. disappeared in a little less than a minute. This unusually rapid disappearance led the witness to assume the object must have accelerated to an extremely high speed.

The object was not seen by another witness, but it was seen and described by two other individuals who live about 7.5 miles from the scene. Their description agrees closely with the report received. The object seemed to become a little larger and brighter as it disappeared.

So, my analysis, don't 5 eye olds, also observed that the object seemed to go "too slow for a jet" and the trail wasn't there as they watch.

No sound was heard (here).

I thought that newsworthy (from Fresno's KMJ or KST?) this morning might report to public this incident, but there were no reports to my knowledge.
