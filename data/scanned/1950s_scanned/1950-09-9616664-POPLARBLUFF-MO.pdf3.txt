Pilot Views Flying Saucer And Calls It a Balloon
Revered Over Poplar Bluff for 5 Hours

Yesterday: "Like Silver Marble"

Poplar Bluff, Mo., Sept. 8 - A pilot flying over Poplar Bluff reported yesterday that he saw a large "silver marble" suspended in the sky and called it a flying saucer. 

The object, which the pilot said appeared to be about the size of a weather balloon, was visible for some five hours yesterday, according to residents of the area. 

Clay Greenwalt, local airport manager, said the pilot reported that the object was hovering over Poplar Bluff at a high altitude and did not appear to be moving. 

The pilot, whose name was not disclosed, said he first saw the object about 1:30 p.m. and watched it until about 6:30 p.m.

During that time, Greenwalt said, the pilot reported that the object remained stationary in the sky. It appeared to be a large silver disk, according to the pilot's description.

Greenwalt said that after the pilot reported the sighting, officials checked and found that no experimental balloons or aircraft had been released in that area yesterday.

He said the officials believed the object was probably a weather balloon, although the pilot insisted he had seen a flying saucer.
