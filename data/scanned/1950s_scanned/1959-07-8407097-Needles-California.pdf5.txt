Memo, AFCIN-4E4E, 24 July 59 (U) Unidentified Objects South China Seas

1st Ind (AFCIN-4E1a/Capt. Keriakou/lcm/74201)                    26 August 1959

TO: AFCIN-4B4E

1. Inspection of radar returns of the suspected UFO's on KD-2 film for mission FJ-056 reveal no unusual or distinguishing factors that would afford data for an analysis. Radar returns seem to be normal scope paints.

2. However, as a comment on Report #1264291, the UFO's could possibly be:

a. Submarine activity, to include a refueling operation.

b. Chinese fishing sampans off the China coast.

c. Giant Manta Rays (known to exist up to 25-30 ft. in wing span), floating on top of the sea or swimming just below surface. Color features indicated in basic report correlate with this theory; however, do rays reflect radar energy?
