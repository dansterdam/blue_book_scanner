The photograph in this scanned document appears to show a blurry image of what looks like two unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or other anomalous aerial phenomena. The image shows a large, circular object with a darker, shadowy outline on the left side of the frame, and a smaller, similarly shaped object on the right side. The image is out of focus, giving it a somewhat ethereal and indistinct quality.
