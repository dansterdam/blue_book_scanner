STATEMENT

I, John T. Larkins, 1st Lt., AO 663284, assigned to the 64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, as a Radar Observer.

At 2120Z, 21 July 1952, while on a routine radar gunnery mission, radar contact was established on an unidentified target at 13,000 yards.

The target was locked-on at 12,000 yards and as the pilot could not get his guns on the unidentified target, a second pass was made at a slightly higher speed. Again the pilot could not lock-on and the target disappeared. The pilot then made an over-taking speed run of about 600 knots but was unable to get on to the target. As the target would look like on the scope, it would disappear and contact could not be re-established. The target disappeared in a north-westerly direction at an altitude of 13,500 feet.

After chasing out on two other unidentified contacts, the pilot suggested that I attempt to pick up the target again. I headed in the easterly direction at 12,000 yards. The target was again picked up at 12,000 yards. The pilot then made another pass but again was unable to lock-on as the target would disappear from the scope. This was repeated approximately 4 times, each time with the same results.

A 270Â° turn was made and again contact was made at 5,000 yards. Another interception was attempted. The target was held for about 30 seconds and was brought in to a range of 2,500 yards, at which time it again disappeared at a very rapid rate, and contact could not be re-established.

The radar set in this ship would be classed all smalli, and both pilot and radar observer were thoroughly experienced. 

The weather was exceptionally clear with a practically cloudless sky. 

At no time did pilot obtain visual contact with any object.
