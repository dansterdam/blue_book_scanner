27 January 53

At 1320 hrs., 26 January 53, I observed a luminous object about one hundred eighty feet long and twelve feet wide traveling through the sky from east to west at what appeared to be between seven and ten thousand feet. Both the front and rear of the object seemed to have a hazy appearance, but the lengthy body was clearly outlined. It also gave off the sound of a high-pitched hum, similar to that of an electric motor. After a minute, the object seemed to gain altitude very rapidly and it slowly faded away. I could still hear the sound for a few seconds after it was completely gone, then the sound stopped abruptly. One witness, a man from my barracks, heard the sound after the light was gone. This all took place in front of Barracks G31.
