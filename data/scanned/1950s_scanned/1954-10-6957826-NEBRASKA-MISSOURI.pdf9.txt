FOREIGN SIGHTINGS                                   7 Dec 54

France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Switzerland

Report No. ATIC 201592 (IR-271-54) dated 27 October contains
various comments extracted from newspapers throughout Europe on
various UFO sightings. Descriptions include:

Flying cigars
Flying saucers
Translucent ellipses
Balls of fire
Illuminous fish trays
Immense greenish cigar

COMMENTS: ATIC attributed two major causes of the recent (Sep, Oct,
Nov 54) outbreak of sightings in Europe. Mr. Keyhoe's book
has recently been translated into various languages and is now
selling in Europe. Also, a current increase of meteoric activity
might account for a portion of the observations.
