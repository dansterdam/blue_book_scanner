DATE 15 August 1957

15 August 1957 7;27 PM EDT My wife and I were eating at next door neighbor's house and were called out by the children to observe a star in the sky. We saw a V shaped string of separate blue white luminous objects moving thru the bright blue sky. At first I thought it might be a group of parachute jumpers but I could see blue sky was visible between each of the seven luminous bodies. The formation moved at a steady rate toward almost due North from a point overhead. We called all the neighbors out, one of which had a pair of binoculars. I viewed the formation thru the binoculars and there did not appear to be anything additional. I did check the size of the "V" which due to my point of a cliff cast against the sky had to be at beginning sight and able to be observed after sighting in.
