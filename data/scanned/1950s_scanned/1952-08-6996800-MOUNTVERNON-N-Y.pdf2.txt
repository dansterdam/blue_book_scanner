The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photographs. The document appears to be a written eyewitness account describing a sighting of a light coming from overhead and disappearing after a few seconds. The text is as follows:

At 0310 hours I saw a light coming from overhead and going in a northwest direction. I saw it for about 5 seconds, disappear for another 5 seconds, going in the same straight line and then disappearing completely.

At approximately every five minute interval after that until 0330 hours I saw similar objects, seemingly to the same methods - appearing and disappearing but the sky was obscured by clouds and the Oregon Mountains.
