New Madison, Ohio 
Wednesday
May 20, 1959

Dear Sirs:

Observed in the West last night, Tuesday, May 19, 1959 at approximately 10:45 p.m. a strange looking object moving in a northerly direction. It was flying from Madison from Ansonia, Ohio. I watched this object for over half an hour as it moved in a straight line position as we could discern, and faded away until we could no longer distinguish it in the sky.

My description would be that it gave appearances of a moon behind a cloud, except that the object seemed to give off a strange glow from within - with no definite shape as at times. The phenomena shall be interrupted by objects disappearing and reappearing, which leads me to believe it might be some sort of a research plan.

On both occasions there seemed to be a fraction of a second when the mass seemed to leave the present position and take on a slightly different position. This light would be so faded as to be no longer distinguishable in the sky. Stars were visible along side the object.

In regards to this report it is of importance and interest. However, it should not be considered a factual investigation for the flight path or speed of the object. It should be reported to any agency you see fit.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
New Madison, Ohio
