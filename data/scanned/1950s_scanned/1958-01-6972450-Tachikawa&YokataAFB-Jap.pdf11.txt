TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:
I'm charged with looking something like my way for air force. one of the two planes turned directly toward as the thing we had started to come closer now they look only about half a mile away I say I don't believe my eyes it look like a large silver ball with an extremely bright light in the center rotating (skyline) about twenty feet across maybe more. It kept getting closer and closer to the plane so the pilot turned the plane directly into it when he got within a mile or so the object appeared to stop instantly and hover motionless in the air. It seemed to have a ring around it or something glowing brightly which would shoot out little sticks of light over twenty feet long then it would suck them back in. We continued to observe this for maybe two or three minutes the thing seemed at just about our altitude. Then all of a sudden it took off at a speed I have never seen anything move before. It appeared to just accelerate and zoom straight up into the clouds and that was all we saw of it.
