Bloomington, Indians

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

I phoned in this report to the Officer of the Day the date of this letter. I will try to explain what I saw.

The three of us were on our way to Terre Haute on April the 1st, we were traveling directly west, our location was about eight miles east of Bloomington, Indiana.

We saw a long streak of constant light in the sky in the west, right above the eastern horizon. The streak was about the width of a man's hand held at arm's length. At first thought it was just part of the sun coming through sparse clouds because there were a lot of clouds around the sun. But we realized shortly that it was moving at a high rate of speed. It moved out of sight in about 3 to 5 minutes. The light did not flicker or pulsate like an airplane could be seen at that distance (it was 6:25). When it went out of sight behind some higher clouds, the light seemed to expand and disappear in four minutes from the time we first saw the saucer-like object. When it reappeared directly in line with it was just a point of light was found. But the height it could not determine nor could I tell how far it was going. It just seemed to lose it.

My address is 1010 S. Grant Street, Bloomington, Indiana.

Sincerely

WILLIAM E. FOCCOCI, JR. Colonel, USAF
