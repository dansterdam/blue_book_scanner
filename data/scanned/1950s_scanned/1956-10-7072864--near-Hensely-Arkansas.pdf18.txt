Life are so marvelous, Delightful and beautiful case of object seen in the sky the night of October 7, 1956 near Hendley, Arkansas. At about 6:50 P.M. a round object with a bright red light in the middle, was observed approaching from the southwest. It appeared to slow down, make a circle and then resumed its course to the northeast. It was observed for at least 10 minutes and then disappeared. The object did not cast any light on the ground and made no sound. It appeared to be from 100 to 200 feet in diameter and was closer than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. Its speed was much less than a jet plane and it was completely silent. Solex says that I didn't get off the right foot there, but I had a feeling that I must report this unusual observation, so I called the Air Force on the next day. They were very interested and said they would investigate. I am not given to pranks or imagining things, but this was very unusual and worth reporting to the proper authorities. I cannot explain it, but I am convinced it was not any conventional aircraft. So, there it is about what I saw that evening. Let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions.
