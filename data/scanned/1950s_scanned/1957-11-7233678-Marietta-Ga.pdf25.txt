(12) The object was seen apparently stationary for a short time, then accelerating and leaving at a tremendous rate of speed, so fast it was gone from sight in a matter of seconds. The shape was circular, white or silver in color. Possibly a satellite or meteor, but with very rapid acceleration and disappearance not normal for these objects.
