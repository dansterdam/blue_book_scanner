LARSON AFB, WASHINGTON - 26 AUGUST 1951

On 26 August 1951, at approximately 0205 hours, an AN/CPS-1 radar set picked up an unidentified object. The object was described as a source of "Al" (interference) on the radar scope, and was estimated to be at a range of 12,000 to 13,000 yards, and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The object was tracked for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, after which it disappeared. The conclusion was that the target was observed on only the low frequency end of the AN/CPS-1 radar set.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: At the time of sighting, the weather conditions were not favorable for anomalous propagation.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION:
Review of this incident by the electronics section of ATIC concluded that the return was possibly due to interference, and it was concluded that the anomalous reflection was probably due to aircraft or other flying objects in the area at the time.
