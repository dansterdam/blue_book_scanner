STATEMENT

At about 2830 hours, 6 August 1953, a person was called to view a certain object in the sky. This object was the moon, but it changed color and shape rapidly. The object was definitely not the moon. It hovered for 30 minutes and disappeared for a few seconds. Then it reappeared for 30 to 35 minutes and disappeared. The object gave off color, was round, and looked like a piece of plate. The sky conditions were clear. I saw no clouds and no stars.
