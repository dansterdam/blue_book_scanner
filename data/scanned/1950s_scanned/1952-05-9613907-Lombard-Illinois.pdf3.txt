1. 1/7008 Defense Line, Inel 000-9 Subject: Recovery of Unidentified
Flying Object.

Inel 000-9 (31 May 52)

AIR TECHNICAL INTGLLICECCE CENTER, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

TO: Commanding Officer, 1st 1/7006th Defense Line, O'Hare International
Airport, Franks Philip, Illinois

1. Reference is made to your Report 1/7006th-42 dated 22 May 52
and basis letter, Inel 000-9 dated 31 May 1952 - Analysis of this object
shows it to be a large glass container similar to those used for floats and
buoys in marine work. The characteristics of the float recovered have
precluded any definite conclusions which can be made as to the
object, and about the only conclusions which can be made are that the
object had undoubtedly flown and probably caused the witness to believe
he had sighted and observed the floating object which in actuality and in
our opinion was merely floating, as is common with such probabs wind
blown or other naturally occurring floats.

2. Your cooperation is appreciated.
