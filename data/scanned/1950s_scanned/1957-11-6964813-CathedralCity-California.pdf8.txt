AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PART FOUR: COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

Conclusion as to the description of the object: The preparing of this report was unable to arrive at a definite conclusion as to the classification or description of the object. It was observed from one point and the description at that point was that it appeared to be a bird. Subsequent investigation indicates that it may have been a local aircraft in the vicinity that was unidentified for the period that it was under observation.

Aircrews arriving at landing field at National Springs airport were in the near vicinity of the observation and the description as having caused the sighting. Although the airport was contacted for flight checks, a local control could have been made without a record at that airport indicative of that activity.
