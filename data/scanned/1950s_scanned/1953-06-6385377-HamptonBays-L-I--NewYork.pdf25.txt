There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this document. The image shows a typed page from what seems to be a Project Blue Book UFO report, with handwritten text at the bottom.

November 19. 1952.
Continued: Sighting made on horizontal plane a distance of 50 ft. when the sighting ceased and the object began to rise rapidly.
During this interval of an hour and a half, I checked both magnetic compass and electric clock, and they were functioning normally, when the objects went from due North to due East, they showed no haste or hurry, just a slow. steady course for the balance of the evening until I retired around 11:30 P.M.
There were some 2 or 3 groups of objects which finally disappeared around 10:30 P.M. as far as I could see.
