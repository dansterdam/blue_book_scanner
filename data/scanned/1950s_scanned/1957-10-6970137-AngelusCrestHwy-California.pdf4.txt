The text of the Disposition Form describes the following information:
- A Bendix Radio employee named Van Nuys, California reported seeing an object in the mountains near Angelus Crest Highway. The object was described as saucer-shaped and shiny.
- At this point, the Air Force Office of Public Information was called to assist. The object was easily identified as being locally built and ATIC was so informed.
- Unfortunately, a vast amount of publicity accompanied this series of events, and ATIC felt obligated to comply with requests from the press to rectify the situation, as they were "getting out of hand".
- The Air Force PIO in Hollywood promised Mr. Van Nuys that ATIC would not release any information to the press, in order to avoid further embarrassment.
- The object has been shipped to ATIC, Attention: Major Smith, AFCIN-11a.
