Atom Test Rocks Nevada Desert
Long-Postponed Explosion Dashes Blimp to Ground
ATOMIC TEST SITE, Nev., Aug. 7 (AP)-The first of a series of atomic tests scheduled for today over the Nevada desert was postponed again.
The explosion, postponed once yesterday, was expected to take place this morning at about 4 a.m. but never occurred. Instead, witnesses reported, a blimp over the area was dashed to the ground with a bright orange flash and a thundering roar.
The blast, expected to be in the kiloton range, was nearly 12 years to the day after the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima.
