"Police summoned a doctor who took x-rays. He did not find any broken bones and sent her home.

"Her husband did not know of any of this until he arrived home from work. 

"'We had a little excitement around here today', she told him in a wife-like fashion. 'A meteor fell through the roof.'

"The home is one of the oldest houses in the Sylacauga area. It is a rambling wooden house set among groves of old trees.

"One witness to the explosion said that before it exploded, the meteor appeared to blaze on fire.

"'It was a blaze of fire with a lot of smoke', said Miss XXXXX, 22, a waitress at the Depot Grill near Sylacauga. 

"She was standing outside waiting for a bus with two other women.

"'One of them said to look at the plane on fire', Miss XXXXX said. 'We looked and there it was.'

"Just at that moment, she said, it blew up in a blinding flash and a lot of noise.

"'It appeared to come out of the southeast.'

"Several other persons in Sylacauga thought it was a burning plane also, and a search with some 30 or 40 airplanes got under way shortly to look for the crash. 

"There were variances in the descriptions of the smoke from the explosions.

"In Sylacauga, it appeared black.

"In Birmingham and in other places at a distance, it appeared white.

"There was immediate reaction to the meteors story from over the nation.

"Experts agreed unanimously that XXXXXXXXX was the first person known to have been struck by a meteorite.

"'The curious astronomer and registrar at Birmingham-Southern College, said he never had heard of it before.'

"Dr. XXXXX, head of the astronomy department at Agnes Scott College, at Atlanta, said that the injury to XXXXXXXXX could be attributed to a meteor."
