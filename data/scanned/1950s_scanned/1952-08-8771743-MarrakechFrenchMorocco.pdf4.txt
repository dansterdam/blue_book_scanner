The image contains a sketch or illustration of an aircraft. The sketch shows an aircraft with the following notable features:

1. Nacelles protruded far to the rear
2. Wings slightly swept back
3. Very large vertical stabilizer

The text below the sketch provides additional details about the observed aircraft, including the observer's name (Capt. Santiago) and location (AD 33 3030).

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:
