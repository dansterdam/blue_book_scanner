Memorandum for Record
SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952
On 17 May 1952, Lt. E. J. Ruppelt called Major Vincent Morath, Wing Intelligence Officer of the 116th Fighter Bomber Wing at George AFB, Calif. Major Morath stated that according to recent sightings of unidentified objects, it was very desirable to send someone from ATIC to George AFB. Lt. Ruppelt had orders cut and departed by commercial air on 20 May 1952 arriving at George AFB later on the evening of the 20th.
On 21 May 1952, Lt. Ruppelt contacted Major Morath who reviewed sightings reported to him since 18 May 1952. Several of these sightings from a T-6 seemed to be representative and plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 21 May.
Lt. Ruppelt, who had piloted the T-6 during previous observations, was considered the best man to pilot the T-6 in this observation. Both the Ground Control Intercept and Fighter Interceptor Squadron of the Air Defense Command were contacted and briefed on the sightings and plans to observe from a T-6. They agreed to attend if all personnel necessary could be mustered.
At 1330 PST, the T-6 was airborne. Lt. Ruppelt had a lens with a 135 mm telephoto lens in case photos could be taken. The ground observation stations were alerted to keep a lookout for the object being observed by the T-6. The serial search was discontinued and the T-6 landed.
It Ruppelt concluded that the object was this balloon.
On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It will be noted that although some of the reports were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.
Lt. Ruppelt returned to W-P AFB on 23 May.
The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.
