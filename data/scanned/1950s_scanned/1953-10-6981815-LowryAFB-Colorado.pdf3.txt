SYNOPSIS: Investigation initiated by District Commander. Four airmen reported unidentified balloon-shaped object at approximately 1955 hours, 19 October 1953. Statements obtained from airmen indicate that a light-colored, balloon-shaped object was observed slowly drifting in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. Object appeared to be about 75 feet in diameter, and was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes, after which it disappeared from view. Weather balloon released by Lowry Air Force Base at 2000 hours, 19 October 1953, was observed and considered to be another light-colored, balloon-shaped object. It was concluded that the object sighted was the weather balloon released by Lowry Air Force Base.
