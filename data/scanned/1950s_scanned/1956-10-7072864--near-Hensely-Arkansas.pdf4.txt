17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound very strange, like a swarm of bees
b. Shape roughly round, as if several lights joined together
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
about 1-3 inches of the match stick
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as color, number, propulsion, etc. Label and identify the drawing.

I observed a strange object in the sky which appeared to be comprised of several lights joined together, with a sound like a swarm of bees. The object was roughly round in shape and covered about 1-3 inches of a match stick held at arm's length. I have included a sketch of the object.
