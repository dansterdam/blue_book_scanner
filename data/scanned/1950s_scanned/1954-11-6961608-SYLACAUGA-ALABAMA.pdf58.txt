Ltr, ATIC, SUBJ: (U) Unidentified Flying Object Recovered at Sylacauga, Alabama

Through a penetrate all the earth's atmosphere actually hit the earth, and these are called "meteors." Velocity of a meteor plays an important part on whether or not it hits the ground. At the time a meteor hits the earth's atmosphere--100 miles high, say--its velocity will range between 9 miles per second and 26 miles per second. Since the earth's motion around the sun gives it a velocity of 18 miles per second, one therefore finds velocities between 26-18 and 26+18 miles per second.

If one knows the exact direction from which it came and the time of the day, the data evidences seem to indicate. However, this the Alabama meteorite was a member of the Andromedid shower, occurring between November 7- December 7. These come from the north, but the exact direction depends on the time of day they are seen. Ordinarily they would travel either higher or lower than 9 miles per second. If it is a member of this shower, it is from the debris of Biela and cones which disintegratedafter 1852. Fragment. At this time, it was spherical, perhaps being a stone weighing 260 pounds which fell in Alsace, November 15, 1492.

4. Arrangements have been made for the meteorite to be returned directly to its owner from the Smithsonian Institute.
