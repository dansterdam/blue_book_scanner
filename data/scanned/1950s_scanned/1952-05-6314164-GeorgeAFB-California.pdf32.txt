Text from the document:

Dear Lieutenant,

This letter was written to announce the findings of the N.I.C.A.P. which is having difficulty in establishing the location and findings of the aerial object which was seen on May 3rd. 

The investigation was carried out by a special team and this work was very extensive in order to gather all necessary facts and data. I assure you that any information will be furnished in due time.

It transpires that the object was seen at 1932 on May 3rd and from its luminous appearance and behavior, it appears that the object was an unconventional type of aircraft. While its direction and velocity were not accurately measured, the apparent size, color, and luminosity were sufficiently defined for the purposes of identification.

I decided to go to Wylie, a town up the highway, to investigate here in this area. I was on another mission before and still am not satisfied that I wanted to go into this matter which seems very confusing. Nothing seemed to fit into the picture. Nothing seemed accurate and I would hesitate to say anything concrete until all details are investigated.
