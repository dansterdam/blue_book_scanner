6th Bomb Wing, Medium Intelligence IR-22-52 PAGE 1

1. The object at first appeared to be a "star", but after a few minutes Sgt. Bare noticed that it was moving. The object pursued a definite course which it repeated three times while Sgt. Bare was watching. The object changed its course at random intervals, one, a zig-zagging movement from South to North, the other, the South to North track turning sharply to the West. Sgt. Bare estimated the speed to be between 40,000 and 50,000 feet, and then descended at an angle of 25° degrees. The color of the object was yellowish and was travelling in a straight level, and then climbing or descending. The speed could not be precisely estimated. Sgt. Bare could not estimate the length of the object or time it was under observation, or its altitude. The color of the object was a blue-green while travelling straight and level, and changed to a reddish color while climbing or descending.

2. The object was first sighted at 20:45 LW and remained under observation for about 25 minutes. 

3. The object was observed visually by Sgt. Bare from the ground. He had no type of lenses or glasses for aid.

4. At the time of the observation Sgt. Bare was standing at the corner of 5th Street and Pavillion Avenue in Roswell, New Mexico. The object was first sighted about 40 or 50 miles due west of Roswell at 20,000 or 30,000 feet over the mountains at Bauldosa. Roswell coordinates 33° 20' N/104° 30' W.

5. T/Sgt. Bare is considered to be a reliable and intelligent individual by his Commanding Officer and others. T/Sgt. Bare has eight years service in the USAAF and is a Maintenance Specialist.
