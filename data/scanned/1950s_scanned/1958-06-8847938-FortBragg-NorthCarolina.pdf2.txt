UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
LOCATION: Fort Bragg, North Carolina
DATE: 23 June 1958
SYNOPSIS: An Unidentified Flying Object was observed by Capt. M.S. Pope, USA, Group Center Wing (M), Pope AFB NO. An detailed description of the object is provided.
DETAILS: On 23 June 1958 at approximately 0052 Z, M/Sgt. LOU G. GLYNN, Capt. US Intelligence Officer, was performing routine duties in the control tower at Pope AFB, NO. Suddenly he observed an unidentified flying object at approximately 0045 Z over the countryside near Fort Bragg, North Carolina. After a careful visual and radar observation, it was determined that the object was oval-shaped, about 50 feet in diameter, and travel led at an estimated speed of 360 knots. The object then moved at great speed on a course of 360 degrees until it faded from sight. Weather at the time of the sighting was clear with good visibility.
It appears at this time that a phenomenon occurred.
