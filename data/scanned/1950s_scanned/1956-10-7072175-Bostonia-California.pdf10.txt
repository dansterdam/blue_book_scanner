Dear Colonel Tacker,

I am in receipt of your letter of 9 December, and the two glossy prints of the AVRO car. Thank you for these; any additional material you can send will be much appreciated, including any press release which accompanies or enlarges on these photographs and the general subject of the air car.

I understand you are not to release UFO case photos as they are returned to the owner. I find this difficult to reconcile with two distinct cases which have now come to my attention, and on which I would appreciate any comments or conclusions.

First, you note you are not familiar with the name of _li_s_s_e_ took a photograph on 16 January 1957, and it appears on page 48 of your book, clearly labeled as a hoax. I quite agree, as I pointed out in my earlier letter, although our analysis was not so complete as the Air Force one, and did not include the ceiling lines, etc. What puzzles me is how you can include this photo without even knowing the owner and, incidentally, copyright holder of the photograph. If you didnâ€™t know this, how could the photograph be "returned to the original owner as soon as the analysis has been completed"?

My second case refers to that photograph taken by of Denville, New Jersey, and which we sent to ATIC in May 1959. To date I have received neither results of any study, nor photograph, nor anything else from ATIC or your office, and neither has Dr. Wilson. How does this fit in with your statement about photographs, which I note is repeated often in our past correspondence?

I also know of several other cases where prints taken from their owners by Air Force representatives have never been seen again. One is local; others are not. I find your current protestations, therefore, somewhat enigmatic.
