Dear Mr. **********,
Your letter of 13 October 1958 addressed to Air Technical Intelligence Center has been referred to this office for reply.
The sample you submitted in your letter is "chaff" made of aluminum foil. It is used by the Air Force in training for defense against enemy radar. When dropped from an aircraft it affects and confuses radar. It is frequently found in areas of the United States where military training is conducted.
Thank you for your interest in this matter.
Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
