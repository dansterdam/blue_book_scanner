Text transcription:

THE TIME OF THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS AT 2:00 P.M. AND THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED FROM THE GROUND BY SEVERAL CIVILIAN OBSERVERS WHO MAINTAINED A VISUAL CONTACT, BUT UNEXPLAINED MANEUVERS, BEFORE DISAPPEARING INTO THE CLOUDS. THE OBJECT EMPLOYED RADIO CONTACT WITH A GOOSE AFB RADAR BUT NO OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA COULD MAKE RADAR CONTACT WITH IT BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE OF THE OBJECT FLIGHT AND ITS APPARENT SPEED. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR WITH ONLY A FEW HIGH SCATTERED CLOUDS. THERE WAS NO LOG EXHAUST OR ANY CHANGE IN COLOR OF THE OBJECT AS IT MOVED. DETAILS OF SPEED AND APPARENT SIZE WHEN COMPARED TO THE BACKGROUND BY THE OBSERVERS AND PILOT WERE UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED ACCURATELY EXCEPT THAT IT WAS MOVING AT A SPEED MUCH GREATER THAN ANY JET AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. THERE WAS NO SOUND COMING FROM THE OBJECT. THAT LOOKED LIKE AN F-84 WITH AFTER BURNERS TURNED ON. AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES THE OBJECT MADE A RADAR CONTACT, WHICH LASTED FOR A BRIEF PERIOD BEFORE DISAPPEARING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN DIRECTION.
