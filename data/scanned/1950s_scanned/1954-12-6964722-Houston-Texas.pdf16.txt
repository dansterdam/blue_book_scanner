Transcription of the text in the document:

UNDER MY REQUEST.  IT WAS SEEN UNDER WRAPS BECAUSE THE NAME OF PROFESSOR CHARLES HENRY MANLY WAS INVOLVED.  NOW I HAVE HIS PERMISSION TO DISCLOSE THE FACTS.  SOMETIME BETWEEN NOVEMBER 20, 1954, IN CAMBRIDGE, MASSAHUSETTS, I BELIEVE A CURIOUS MATERIAL FALLEN FROM A UFO-LIKE THING.  IT WAS LATER ANALYZED BY PROFESSOR MANLY IN HIS LABORATORY AT M.I.T.  IT PROVED TO BE A VERY UNUSUAL MATERIAL, MORE THAN 12 MONTHS AGO.  I THINK THE STORY YOU PRINTED WAS MEANT ONLY TO DECEIVE, FOR I AM PERSONALLY CONVINCED THAT THE MATERIAL WAS REAL AND THE STRANGE AERIAL VISABLE MANLY HAD SAID THAT THE MATERIAL WAS A PART OF HIGH-INTENSITY BEAM, WHICH HE FELT PROVED THAT IT WAS A PHYSICAL SAMPLE FROM A METALLIC UFO.  I AM QUOTING FROM HIS LETTER.  IF GENTLEMAN WISHES TO GO ON THE BIT OF NON-FERROUS METAL WHICH YOU SO KINDLY SENT TO ME FOR EXAMINATION.  I OBSERVED THAT METAL BALLS AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE OF MR. CHRISTIAN IN CAMBRIDGE IT CONTAINS TRACES OF COPPER OR MANGANESE.  IT TASTE INDICATED VERY PURE TIN WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF TIN.  THE SURFACE IS VERY SMOOTH AND POLISHED.  IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT IS PROBABLY A PART OF SOME ELABORATE MECHANISM WHICH WAS USED IN PLACING ON A ROTATING STAND AS THOSE USED IN PLACING SMALL SAMPLES FOR EXAMINATION UNDER MICROSCOPE. IT WAS RETURNED TO YOUR GOVERNMENT, I CANNOT GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT.
DR. MANLY'S PROFESSOR LETTER DOES NOT INDICATE ANY TRACE OF ANTIMONY.  AND FOUND IT TO BE A VERY RARE SPECIMEN OF ITS KIND.  THIS DIFFERENCE IN ANALYSIS IS NOT EXPLAINABLE FROM THE ANALYSIS GIVEN. 
I HAVE A LETTER DATED APRIL 2, 1956 FROM OUR MUTUAL FRIEND JOSE ESCOBAR FARIA.  HE SAYS AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT HIS CHEMICAL EXAMINATION, ANALYTICAL BY DR. MANLY, OF THE FRAGMENTS RECEIVED FROM ME, PARIS, INDICATES THAT THERE IS NO TRACE OF ANTIMONY IN THE SAMPLE AT ALL.  THUS DR. MANLY'S FINDINGS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CORROBORATED BY THIS INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS.  THERE IS NOTHING UNUSUAL IN THIS FINDING, BECAUSE DR. MANLY IS A PROFESSOR AT M.I.T.  HE HAS NOT YET REPORTED TO ME THAT THE SAMPLE CONTAINED ANY ANTIMONY. 
I WILL NOTE THAT BOTH UNUSUAL FOR THIS PROFESSOR MEISS FOUND NO TRACE OF ANTIMONY, AS DID PROFESSOR MANLY.
AT THE BEGINNING, WHEN THE PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NON-FERROUS MATERIAL WERE KNOWN, IT SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN FROM UFO'S, MIGHT PROVE TO BE ONE OF THE RAREST SPECIMENTS OF THIS KIND, PROFESSOR MANLEY'S LETTER GOES ON REQUESTING FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS YEAR-OLD AFFAIR, AS I UNDERSTAND.  I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE.  I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PERSUADE DR. VISVALDIS MARIS SALPETER OF THE M.I.T. TO BE FURTHER RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDYING THAT MATERIAL.  BUT I THINK THE WHOLE AFFAIR WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY INVESTIGATED TO PRODUCE SOME TANGIBLE RESULTS.
I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE INFORMATION I HAVE, AND CALLED A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PERSONS, REQUESTING THEM TO GIVE ME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS PECULIAR PROBLEM, OR ACCOUNT OF WHAT THEY COULD AND COULD NOT DO.
1. DR. GERALD HEUERMAN, MAY 1, 1956, SAN PAOLO, BRAZIL.
