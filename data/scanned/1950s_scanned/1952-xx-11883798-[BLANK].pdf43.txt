FACTUAL DATA

An estimated 15 percent of the reports received by ATIC are evaluated as probably hoaxes. It is highly probable that if more positive information could be obtained on ballistic indications in the United States, the percentage would increase and more positive identification could be made.

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES

It is recommended that the attached proposal be forwarded through channels to Air Weather Service and that, if the proposal is concurred upon by ATIC, action be taken to initiate a transfer of funds.
