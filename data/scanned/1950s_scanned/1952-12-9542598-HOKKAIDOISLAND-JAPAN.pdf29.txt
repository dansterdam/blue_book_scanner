AF FORM 112 - PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

2/Lt. 39th Air Division, APO 925

16-M-53

SUBJECT:

I want you to be the tower and I intend to the observer between the 24th pilots who saw the object. The object was first seen about 10:42 p.m. by the pilots of the 24th fighters. The pilots, who were in the air on routine training missions, stated that they saw a bright round object giving off a white light, apparently hovering over the town called Chitose, which is about 20 minutes flying time from their base. According to the pilots, the object maintained a fairly constant position in relation to the town and was estimated to be at an altitude of about 20,000 feet. The pilots stated that the object was about 3 times the size of a B-29 bomber. At one point, the object appeared to change its position, moving away from the town and then back again. This maneuver was observed by 4 pilots. The object was under observation for about 20 minutes. At 11:02 p.m., the object suddenly disappeared from view. Weather conditions at the time were 10/10 undercast, with no breaks in the clouds to be observed.

I am forwarding this report in accordance with existing directives. It is requested that the details of this incident be further investigated. There are no photographs or other physical evidence available. This is all the information I have on this incident.
