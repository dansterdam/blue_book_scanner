Case 174, San Bernardino, CA., July 10, 1956 - In San Bernardino, California, W. L. George, an aircraft engine mechanic, saw an unidentified flying object. According to the report, George was driving to work when he saw a bright object in the sky. He stopped his car, grabbed his camera, and took a photograph of the object. The AP carried a wirephoto of the photo, which was printed in the Los Angeles Mirror and The Times, but the story is centered around George's story as relayed to the Daily Sun. Michael's story tells of the object flying in a northerly direction at a terrific speed, moving so rapidly it was hardly visible. George attempted to photograph the object, but due to its rapid speed, was only able to capture a brief image before it disappeared.
