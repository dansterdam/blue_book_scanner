NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
6 November 1957
Connecticut Valley & Leominster, Massachusetts

Mr. X also mentioned briefly three other reports he has recently received mention them more precisely, with fuller accounts later if possible:

1) November 6, 1957, 6 p.m.: a "very large, silver, cigar-shaped object" seen moving slowly over the Connecticut Valley; it had no wings, and was like nothing ever seen before. Possibly corroborated from N. Leominster, Mass, 40 mi. east of Greenfield, where a silvery cigar-shaped object was reported seen at 6 p.m.
