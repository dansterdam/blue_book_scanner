STATEMENT OF
MRS. C.A.
29 August 1952

As approached at 9:32 p.m. on the night of 29 August, I went to watch our brightest object which I saw in the southland low and seemed like the planet Venus. However, they called Me. C.A. to come and see what it was. We watched it a few minutes and then it went down. The object was very low and I could see bright lights on it. Then it came up again. It just drifted off to the south. Another object came in the south. We watched this one for quite a while. It seemed to hover and it just drifted out of sight. We then saw a third object which was dim and really couldn't tell the shape. They were dim and really couldn't tell the shape. They seemed higher. The first object was bright and the other four were dim. It this time a Mr. Robinson also came out and we could not tell just where the objects went. They first seemed higher then lower, then they were out of sight. We observed these objects for more than five minutes, but they didn't seem to change in appearance. The second object was higher in the sky than the first one.

I know these objects were real because I could see them clearly and they would change in color and then it would completely vanish. We could not return in sight again. The objects were in a relatively close position, which meant the top one and the bottom one were just about the same distance. We could not see behind them or see any wings.

The objects, to my mind, were real. Something like a star but still red and blue and you could tell it was moving. It lost altitude and then started the first object which lasted above five (5) minutes or a little longer. It then and I have seen these objects before but varied duration.
