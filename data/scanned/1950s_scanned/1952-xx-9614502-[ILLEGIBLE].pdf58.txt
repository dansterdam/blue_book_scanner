The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a scanned page from a report or document. The page has handwritten text that describes what seems to be an observation of some kind of celestial objects, possibly UFOs. The text mentions "sighted objects" and "varying speed from slow to fast" but does not provide any further details about the observed phenomena.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text visible in the image is:

"Sighted objects showing varying speed from slow to fast. Observed. Space period from slow to fast."
