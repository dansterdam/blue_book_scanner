FIERY OBJECT LIGHTS
SKY OVER MICHIGAN

EAST LANSING, MICH., Feb. 24-UPI - A flaming "blush
green" object streaked over Michigan about 6:30 a.m. today,
traveling from east to west. Radio stations had calls from
excited citizens who also saw the object.

Two operators in the control tower of the Grand Rapids
airport in western Michigan said they believed it was a
meteorite. The operators, John Moore and Boyan Boylan, said
"it (the object) also was sighted at airport control towers in Chicago
and Madison, Wis.

"It was a dandy," Moore and Boylan agreed. "The best
we could see, it must have been a good-sized one. When we first
saw it, it looked like it was just northwest of Grand Rapids
and was shooting off sparks before it appeared to disintegrate."

The sky was clear and before dawn and observers got a
good look at the object, radio station WKAR in Houghton Lake in north central
Michigan received a call from a man at nearby Roscommon
who said, "It scared hell out of me."
