According to the image, the text reads:

"A report was made by a Sgt. regarding our directive advice as to what the object now, whatever it may have been. That the USAF show of "hydrogen balloons" will not fit in so as to exactly explain the object in question. If you could please give any explanation as to why it would be very much appreciated as I am apparently unable as to why that this object was seen.

Yours very truly, [Redacted]"
