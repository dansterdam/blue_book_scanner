The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memorandum addressed to Captain Gregory on October 18, 1957 regarding radar information and propagation. The text discusses the need for good scope photos and samples of interference from radars, returns from clouds, etc. to be more informative than diagrams and scope sketches. It also mentions that there will usually be many times this many - hundreds of them, in fact, referring to the number of instances where an interfering radar will give one or two returns on the scope. The memorandum is signed by V. D. Bryant, AFCIN-4E13.

MEMORANDUM TO CAPTAIN GREGORY
18 Oct 1957

The data included in the radar portion is correct (with one exception). There is a great deal of information which should be included but which is not ------- Some explanation regarding returning echoes and anomalous propagation which appear as very fast moving targets should be included, since this is one of the principal types of radar reports received.

It should be emphasized that this task would require a respectable effort, and could be dashed off as a matter of a few minutes to meet a short deadline. Some good scope photos of actual anomalous propagation and samples of interference from other radars, returns from clouds, etc., would appear to be more informative than the diagrams and scope sketches showing normal and abnormal propagation which are in the article.

The exception noted in the first paragraph is to the statement that an interfering radar will give one or two returns on the scope. Actually there will usually be many times this many - hundreds of them, in fact. It is true that they are usually easily recognizable.
