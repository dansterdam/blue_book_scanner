December 4, 1958

My husband and I had just retired at 11:30 P.M. It was raining. Our home faces north and three bedroom windows are on the north facing the front yard. One window is on the west. Cafe curtains cover the lower half of the windows and the upper parts are exposed. A bright yellow flash dazzled me as I glanced through the west window and thought of lightning although there was no sound. Soon, there was a second flash accompanied by a muffled report, and my husband realized that it was not lightning, but some kind of an explosion or "explosions" as he reached the window before I did. I had the impression that the light was more intense than the first time. He says that he saw an "explosion" in the west. By the time I reached the window a fourth time, the front window saw a great flash of light - orange-yellow with pink at the extremity. Since I looked north, I did not see the object in the west. This had "exploded" again when I saw the flash and orange sphere about the size of a grapefruit in (or beyond) the area of the Paul Welch home. The object was above the trees and house tops but not rising. When the light and window brightness was brighter, it showed dark branes in color between "explosions". After the fourth flash, or "explosion", it glowed three or four seconds, then disappeared. It did not move away or grow dim, but it's size could not remain off as electric light. The object did not change size except during the "explosions" -- then the brilliance extended it's size about ten fold. The terrain falls sharply in the west beyond our house and the flash seems to be either all borne, or be seen on the top of some object in the Welch area. I could not see a path of light from the object to our yard. It seemed like light being near the object and exploding in the yard.
