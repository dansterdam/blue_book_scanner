Science News Letter for November 23, 1957

Like the moon, it has no light of its own but shines by reflected sunlight. That is why it is brightest when a crescent. Although less than half of the bright side is visible, the part we see is fully illumined and so makes up for this, and the part we cannot see is the largest and most brilliant.

Winter Arrives

On Dec. 21 comes the winter solstice, which has apparently been discovered in all civilized lands since very remote antiquity. It is the date when the sun reaches its farthest point south of the equator, and marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
