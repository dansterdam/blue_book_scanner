The document describes the objects as they disappeared in the South West. The objects hovered in the south for about an hour, not covering much area of the sky. One object would remain stationary and the other two would circle around it, then one of the circling ones would assume the central position and the other two would circle (a game of "ring around the saucer" no doubt). At approximately midnight, the objects streaked off suddenly to the south-west, disappearing because of fading and distance, apparently, and becoming smaller as they disappeared.

Officer [redacted] drove back to the police station, where he next went to his point of observation. Figure C shows the three objects as he observed them, looking due south out of the top window of the police station. The distances was the same as the ones he had previously. His observations were intermittent, as he was on desk duty that night and had to keep running back and forth to answer phone calls, some of which were from people wanting to know what "those lights" were.

The longest time anyone saw the objects from Toms River was an hour and a half, which is what the police chief said was his total time. Actually, no new evidence was uncovered in talking to these people, except that it was definitely brought out that these things could not have been searchlights. Mr. [redacted] has had a great deal of experience with searchlights in WW2 a/a work. There was general agreement that if there had been any cloud cover, these objects could have been likened to a searchlight beam reflected off a cloud base. However, the night was perfectly clear and starry, with no cloud whatsoever. The objects were round or oval, they were a "pale red color", diminishing, with no apparent structure.
