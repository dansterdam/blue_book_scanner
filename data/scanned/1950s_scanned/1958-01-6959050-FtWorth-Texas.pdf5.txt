Transcription of the text in the document:

"The article of 26 Feb mentions a sighting made by eight observers in Fort Worth, Texas on 24 February 1958 of two circular objects 50 to 75 feet in diameter, traveling at an estimated speed of 300 to 500 mph. The objects were brown in color and were under intelligent control. They made a sharp turn and then disappeared from view.

My conclusion of this sighting is a high-altitude research project vehicle of some kind. Your current (airfoil) problems indicate that you are very much concerned about such sightings. I have assembled some data which may be of interest. It shows many Air Research and Development Command (ARDC) contracts which I think would be of importance to you. The total contract figures amount to $36,000,000 (1949-1954 period) which was handled by the Air Research and Development Command. These indicate the heavy development of high-altitude research projects, aircraft and vehicles which may be the cause of many sightings. I would appreciate an acknowledgment of this report.

Sincerely yours,
D.G. Major"
