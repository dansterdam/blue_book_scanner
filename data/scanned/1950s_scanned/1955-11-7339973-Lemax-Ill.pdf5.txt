MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE
ATTN: Lt Col T. Johnson, AFCIN-X

SUBJECT: (U) 35MM Color Slide

1. No foreign objects are visiable on the slide. The few specks appear to be development flaws.

2. If anything unusual was visible to the observer, it was most likely reflection of the setting sun or "sun dog".
