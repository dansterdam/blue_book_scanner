The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing various topics related to the American people and their ability to deal with security issues and information.

Put again I say time has grown short.
And these considerations must enter into any evaluation. The American people have a right to be posted so that they will not be scared to death. An Army security man once remarked to me in the early phases of this thing "What was I trying to do, scare the American people to death." Well I wonder what Sputnik I did and all these other things. The American people are intelligent and they can take what comes, what has to be handed out to them straight cold.
I hope that somehow or another that some of this difficulty can be resolved. And that my ability to make a living to be a good American is no longer interfered with, in any way if this does not happen. With much more information than what is on these tapes will be kicked into the political arena. And well let it come out where ever it will.
I thank you for your time in listening. I hope that you will see fit to send someone to talk to me. I thank you. Voluntary licensing program in/Kentucky.
