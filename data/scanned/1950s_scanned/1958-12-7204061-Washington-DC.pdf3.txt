The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically Project Blue Book. There is no photograph visible in this image, only text. The text states "PHOTOGRAPHS OF UFO 1 DEC 38 WASHINGTON, D.C. HOAX" and is marked as "UNCLASSIFIED".

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED
