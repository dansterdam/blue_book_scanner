SUBJECT: Report for Analysis - UFO Reports from CINCUSAFE, Wiesbaden, Germany
TO: AFOIN-EI
ITEM: Capt. Gregory

From the information submitted, it is impossible to ascertain a determination of the sources of these sightings. Certain facts which are available, however, are indicative that the sightings were not any conventional type example, the fact that a number of ships appeared and disappeared simultaneously seems to indicate the possibility of a control or guidance and their characteristics of weather patterns is the disappearance of all of the objects in question at about the same time which would indicate a possible guided propagation. This also tends to preclude the possibility of the targets being material targets.

3. A more thorough analysis of these UFO sightings would be desirable, which would permit determination of actual conditions prevailing, such as temperature inversions, moisture data, and an accurate comparison related to known weather patterns. This could provide valuable clues to the actual causes of the sightings which were reported, which may have been natural phenomena and not necessarily anything unusual.
