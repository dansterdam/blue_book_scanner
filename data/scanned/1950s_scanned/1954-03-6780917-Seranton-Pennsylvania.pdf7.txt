The text of the document reads as follows:

"The following is a copy of a letter, undated and unsigned, received by the 26 District CIC (G2) Headquarters, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and addressed to the Chief of the United States Air Force, Washington, D.C., postmarked Scranton, Pa., 12 March 1952:

"Sir:

I do not know whether or not it's writing to you proper party as this matter in my opinion concerns only me. But I figure you'll at least get it, read it and give it proper attention.

I was employed as a night watchman here in Scranton and a few nights ago I saw what I would term a flying saucer. You know how reports and descriptions of these saucers have been made and I will not bore you with the details except to say that what I saw was identical with those reports. It came up from behind the buildings, hovered directly over me, and I had a clear view of it for at least 30 minutes. 

Now here is the part that concerns only me. This thing, whatever it was, had me paralyzed. I was standing there looking up at it and could not move a muscle. I was not frightened, just couldn't move. And when it finally took off and disappeared, the paralysis wore off immediately.

What I want to know is this: Was there anything in that flying thing that could have had me paralyzed like that? I know I'm not a crackpot and I know what I saw. It really happened and I can't get over it. I would appreciate it very much if you could give me some information or explanation as to why I was paralyzed. Thank you."
