The UFO was so high that it glowed in the sunlight long after dark on the earth's surface. There were some cirrus clouds in the upper air about 7:00 P.M., and it was far above them. I also guessed their height to be 11,000 feet. My rough calculations may have been far off, of course, and I think they possibly were. I am inclined to belive the UFO was at least 100 miles high, as I have talked to observers as far east as 100 miles and north 50, and all them say it appeared overhead to them.

I have contacted the Weather Bureau, the Air Force bases at Carswell Base and Perrin Field and all of them say they do not have any information on the UFO--don't know what it was. It was gone on the morning of April 5.

So much for that. Now another:

On April 16, two days after the above-mentioned UFO was seen, Mmr. ____, living five miles east of McKinney saw a silvery object, five to eight feet in diameter, alight down in a field 100 yards. from here. They stopped the car and the UFO took off at terrific speed and disappeared. They thought it resembled a balloon.

Another: On the night of April 13, nine days after the UFO was sighted over the city, I was at Mr. ___'s house looking at stars with him through his telescope. Starting to leave up:15 P.M. I saw several lights shoot low over the house tope to the south. I at first took them to be jets, but by the time I realized they could not possibly be, they had disappeared to the west. I could not ascertain how far away they were, so said nothing, save to ask Mr. ____ if he had seen them or heard and planes. He had not. A* few days later a local man called my Mr. ____ __ __

_____ called and asked if I had seen any strange lights over the city at the time and date named above. I asked him without leading him to believe I had seen them, just what they looked like, and their directions6. He said they were pale blue and traveling east overhead. He said there were three of them, and they made no sound, as far as he could hear. With the UFO I triangulated om, I could estimate their height and speeda They were about 150 feet above the ground and as they traveled over an area of about 40 degreen, in the estimate two seconds that I observed them, they were making somewhere in tn. vicinity of I, I 00 mp. " Mr.... viewing them from below said there were four of them mad two glowed pale bluea wh9y arr two ml tames.

I addition to all above I would like to state that I am no balloon--if ring succeeds b=re submitting this for what it my be worth I rid idea of the datebau already have can hand concerning UFOe
