31 July 1952

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Object

1. Observation was made by the undersigned at approximately 2310 hours on 30 July 1952, from the west side of Maxwell tower, seventy-five (75) feet above ground level.

2. Object was seen west of Maxwell Field and appeared to be at a distance of more than twenty-five (25) miles and at an altitude of more than twenty (20) thousand feet.

3. Close observation through the use of binoculars revealed that this phenomenon was a revolving spherical mass similar to, but larger than, a star whose colors alternately changed from light blue to amber and red. There was no sound coming from that direction and no trails were observed. The object, definitely not a conventional type of aircraft, had a slight swaying motion similar to the one of a pendulum. Its motion covered an angle of approximately fifteen (15) degrees. It was still in the same location at 2345 hours, the time at which I left my post.

4. The above facts are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
