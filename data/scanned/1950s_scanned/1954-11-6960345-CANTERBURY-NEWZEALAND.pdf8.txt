APOLOGIES.
3 Jan 1955. 
An informal letter, confidentially, sent by yourself to 7 Jan 1955. Dear Sir,
United States of America.

Dear Sir,
Today I have received your letter of 23rd inst. I am sorry to say that it was not accompanied with any negatives of the photograph which I desired and mentioned in my previous letter of 27th Jan 1955, and so I have been deprived of the chance to inspect the photograph of which I thought so highly.
I am hoping that you will be kind enough to send the negatives and prints of the photograph mentioned in your letter, as I am most anxious to inspect them. It is of great importance to me to have these in order to make further investigations and research into this matter which I am sure will be of mutual benefit.
I am not a visualist and cannot accurately describe the fine details of my large findings, and I feel it would greatly assist me to assist you if I had the negatives and prints to study.
I look forward to hearing from you with these in the near future, and remain,
Yours faithfully,
