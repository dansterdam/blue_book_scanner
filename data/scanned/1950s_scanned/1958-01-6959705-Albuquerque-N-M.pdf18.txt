The Trinidade Island Saucer

The most famous of all purported photographs of a UFO, the so-called "Trinidade Island Saucer", was published in Brazilian newspapers on February 22, 1958. The pictures showed what appeared to be a flying saucer over the island of Trinidade, some 500 miles off the east coast of Brazil. 

According to the accompanying news stories, the UFO had flown over the island of Trinidade, and being photographed by a photographer on board, had been examined and supposedly pronounced genuine by navy experts before being released by the Brazilian Navy.

The affair which rocked the Brazilian Government and excited a world-wide science uproar, was merely an incident that came to light when a major world government thus seemed to accept the photographs as authentic. 

Although subject to some adverse criticism, careful study of the facts strongly suggests that this case, which rocked the Brazilian Government and excited a world-wide science uproar, was merely an incident.

At first glance, the circumstances of the sighting seemed to be impressive, that Trinidade Island is a barren, mountainous island of about six square miles, some 500 miles from the coast of Brazil. The island remained deserted except by a few men until October 1957, when the Brazilian Navy established an oceanographic post and a meteorological station there to carry out its research for the International Geophysical Year. Studies, the Navy also converted a training ship, the Almirante Saldanha, into a floating laboratory equipped with scientific instruments and photographic darkroom. With a crew of about 50, the ship routinely traveled between Rio de Janeiro and Trinidade Island.

The major function of the meteorological station was the launching of weather balloons, their wind velocities and directions being studied. This was carried out daily with small transmitters launched each opening. In addition, they were tracked by radio and optical devices to show the movements of the winds in the upper atmosphere. At a certain point (April 16, 1958) the balloons seemed to have a strange object appear and hover above them. Startled, the scientists on board released a bag of scientific instruments which, attached to a parachute, descended to be retrieved.

The Trinidade station began operation in November 1957. Almost immediately, UFO's were reported over the island. (Until this epidemic, the island had been virtually uninhabited).
