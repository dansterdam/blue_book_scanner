UNCLASSIFIED
This Message in 5 Parts.

PART I. Reference Air Force Regulation 200-2, dated 5 February 1958, 
Subject: "Unidentified Flying Objects," as amended by AFR 200-2A, dated 
3 July 1958.

PART II. In spite of the fact that the USAF has yet to uncover specific
evidence of Unidentified Flying Objects that represent a threat from outer
space, considerable public interest and pressure on this particular program continues. At the present time some 49 UFO organizations and many 
self-proclaimed experts are actively engaged in exploiting UFO sightings 
for their own, and in some cases, questionable interests. For reasons 
known best to them they all seem intent upon discrediting the job the USAF
is doing in this program. In spite of this we must maintain a positive
approach to uncover specific information of scientific or technical interest
to the nation.

PART III. To insure understanding and compliance with the existing provisions of AFR 200-2 as amended, the following elements of that directive are re-emphasized and clarified:
a. Prompt reporting and investigation of all UFO sightings by
the AF installation nearest to the point of sighting is the responsibility
of the commander of that installation. Such reporting and investigation
includes those cases publicized in the press or on radio and television
in the vicinity of that installation even though no report of the incident has been otherwise received. In all cases copies of reports will
be referred directly and expeditiously to ATIC.
