At the very line of vision of the sighting point, tho first appearance of the first object appeared to be about the size of an ordinary star. As it approached closer it increased in size and appeared to be changing shape and color. Its path of motion was weaving or oscillating from side to side as it approached nearer and nearer the observer, it being about the size of the head of a match by the time it passed the zenith overhead. The object appeared to be a glowing, silvery-white in color with a reddish orange hue at times. The motion of the object was at a terrific speed, apparently accelerating at times and then decelerating again as it approached nearer the observer's position. The object was observed through holes in the clouds which rapidly closed in, obscuring the object from further view.
