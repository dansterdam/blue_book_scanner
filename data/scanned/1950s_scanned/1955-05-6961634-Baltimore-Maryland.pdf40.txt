The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

According to the OCR output, the text found in the document is as follows:

1520 hrs. 16 May 1955 - Visited the 
property of Mr. S___, Arlington, Ohio.
The objects under investigation were reported as discs or saucer-shaped, metallic in appearance, hovering close to the ground, and apparently under intelligent control. The objects were 13 3/4 and 5 1/2 ft. in diameter, respectively, and were observed through field glasses from a distance of about 1,000 yards. They were bright white in color, and appeared to be rotating slowly on a vertical axis. The objects were observed for about 15 minutes and then ascended rapidly in a vertical direction, disappearing from sight.
The witness appeared to be a very well educated gentleman, and was having the practical background experience which enabled him to express himself fluently and thoroughly when asked specific questions by this investigator.
4. 1555 hrs. 16 May 1955 - Phoned in above information to Capt. Hardin, Project Monitor.
CONCLUSION
1. After reviewing the aforementioned statements and opinions together with the report, it is felt by this investigator that the incident can be summed up as follows:
A. Characteristics of the Objects
(1) The two objects, weighing 13 3/4 and 5 1/2 lbs., are definitely a good quality cast iron.
(2) From close examination it was found that the casting is of an old variety and traces of corrosion indicate it had been installed near water or in some other damp location.
(3) The objects are probably from a former valve control wheel.
(4) The hole located at the "break" on the 13-3/4-inch piece was found to contain a handle-type assembly which was once installed there. This was very similar to a handle used to remove such handles to lessen the possibility of accidental injury.
