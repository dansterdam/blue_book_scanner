REMARKS: (General description of what you saw) (Use back if necessary)
This object was seen from the roof of the aforementioned building.
Even though we could not determine the exact altitude of the object, we assumed it to be at a rather high elevation because it reflected a silver-like color rather than a brighter one. We assumed the maneuver pattern to be an attempt by the object to avoid observation.
The object was sighted for only a short time. The color was a bright silvery-like metallic. The shape was round and no smoke or trail was visible.
