Been made in regard to an object being seen on 22 February at 2000 hours.
The next stop was Brookings, Minnesota. There was only one cafe located in that town. The owner stated that to his knowledge no one had mentioned seeing an object during the evening of 22 February 1958. The next stop was made at the Police Station at Lake City, Minnesota. Time was 0945.
The Police Chief stated that he had heard nothing until the morning of 1 March 1958 when a Mr. [REDACTED] called him from long distance and informed him to collect any information available as there would be people from the Air Force checking on the report. He then (the Police Chief), called the sheriff of Wabasha, Minnesota, and made inquiries as to any reports being received there. Answer was negative.
The Lake City Police Chief then called the Game Warden for Lake Pepin and made the same inquiries. Game Warden's answer was negative.
Lt. Col. Schumacher and myself then proceeded to Maiden Rock, Wisconsin, where we made inquiries of the cafe owner and [REDACTED]. In both cases Mr. [REDACTED] had called and made the incident known to these individuals. This was the only report they had of the incident. Our next stop was Stockholm, Wisconsin where we made inquiries at [REDACTED]. She stated that a friend of hers had arrived there unexpectedly and after approximately an hour had departed for home. She further stated that Mr. [REDACTED] had mentioned that he was feeling ill and would not be able to stop and see her husband at Maiden Rock, Wisconsin. Also, that she had known Mr. [REDACTED] for approximately 20 years. Time was now 1300.
