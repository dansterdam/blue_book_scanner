Both Mrs. Gardinier and a neighbor, Mrs. Lovell Allen, observed the third object as it climbed and disappeared toward FAFD. Major Gardinier described the objects as flying at an estimated 20 to 50 feet across, 2 to 6 feet in depth. When first sighted they appeared a khaki tan in color but through the binoculars looked somewhat metallic. Observation was difficult due to the air currents. They were capable of abrupt changes of direction and speed, yet no sounds were heard. The weather was CAVU. Neither Mrs. Gardinier nor the neighbor could identify the object. They appeared from the hazy the Spokane-Ritz Theater and proceeded generally toward the east for approximately five minutes and then proceeding SE, almost directly toward FAFD. All three objects appeared to have a high rate of speed, difficult to estimate because of lack of reference as to size and distance. No further observations were reported.
