One or about 6:45 P.M. on the 9th of November, 1952, a witness observed some thing in the vicinity of MONTVILLE, NEW JERSEY, about 1/2 mile north of the Pequannock River, and just west of Route 23.

The witness stated that the object he observed was approximately the size of a large automobile, and shaped somewhat like a dirigible. The object appeared to be traveling in a straight line at a fairly rapid rate of speed, and was estimated to have been at an altitude of 200 to 300 yards. The witness stated he observed the object for about a minute.

The object was a distinctive color, possibly a silverish-gray. The surface appeared to have a high degree of polish, and seemed to reflect the light from the moon. The object gave off no exhaust or vapor trail, and made no noise.

The witness stated that the object either passed behind or in front of a cloud, disappearing for a brief period of time. The object was next observed continuing on its course, and finally disappeared from sight.

The witness is a highly respected individual, and has a reputation as a reliable observer. Their statement has been highly corroborated by persons in the area, and they stand firmly by their report.

They are a chemist and work for a prominent industry in the vicinity. They have served in both the Army and Navy, and have had a long experience in making aerial observations.

The incident was reported immediately to the State Police, and the Air Force has been informed. They have expressed a desire to have the same thoroughly investigated.
