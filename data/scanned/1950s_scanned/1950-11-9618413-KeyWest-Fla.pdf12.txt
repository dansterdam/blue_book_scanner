1. Reference is made to the attached letter.
2. The radar information regarding the detection of unidentified aircraft on the nights of 14 and 15 November 1951 appears to be possibly correct. However, there are the indications of possible effects regarding the detection of radar targets.
3. In general, insufficient information is contained in the attached report to allow a well-rounded evaluation to be made. It is suggested that the source of the basic report be asked to submit another more complete and coordinated report and to make it clear as to the source radar target information, which MCAP-9 pilots obtained visual sightings, and what were the subsequent results. In summary, a more complete and coordinated report is desired.
