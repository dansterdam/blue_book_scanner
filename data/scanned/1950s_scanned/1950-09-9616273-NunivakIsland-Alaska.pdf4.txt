At about 10:20 P.M. on the night of 9 September 1950, a report was received from the Alaska Air Command indicating that an unidentified flying object had been sighted near Nunivak Island, Alaska.

It was reported that the object was first observed at about 9:15 P.M. on that date by a CAA airway communications station operator at Nunivak Island. The object was described as a bluish-white, spherical-shaped object, approximately 30 feet in diameter, that appeared to be glowing.

It was stated that the object hovered a few feet above the ground for approximately 15 minutes, then suddenly shot straight up at a terrific rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

A military aircraft was immediately dispatched to the area to investigate, but no trace of the object could be found. All attempts to locate the object or obtain further information proved fruitless.

The report was forwarded to this Headquarters for information and evaluation. No further details are available at this time.
