The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document describing an incident at Griffiss Air Force Base.

The text in the document reads:

"a landing at Griffiss Air Force Base.

As the pilot started a descent, he noted that the cockpit temperature increased abruptly. The increase in temperature caused the pilot to seam the instruments. The fire warning light was on and the pilot informed the radar observer of this fact. The fire warning light remained on after the throttle was placed in "idle" so the engine was shut down and both crew members ejected successfully."
