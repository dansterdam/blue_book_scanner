I. SOURCE: Address: ------ (male), Kansas City, Missouri
Age: Adult
Occupation: CAA control tower operator

II. RELIABILITY: Source offered little information on his own, answered only the questions put directly to him. Investigator considered him the source for an article which appeared in the Kansas City Star of 18 December 55. Source was evidently one of the persons quoted in that story. 

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Object flared up in the WNW of the tower about 18/30/1952 Dec 55. It was of unusual brightness; it was source "took it for granted that the sighting was a falling star." It seemed to him that it burned out before reaching the horizon.

Source turned in no report of the incident, but did talk about it with "several" air traffic control people regarding its unusual brightness. 

Source stated the object fell almost straight down.
