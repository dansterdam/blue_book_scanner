The image does not contain any photograph, but rather an old report document from Project Blue Book. As requested, I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Captain Fritz - Suggested that periods of extreme public anxieties be correlated with UFO sightings. These periods of anxieties may be politically, economically, religiously, etc.

Capt. ---------- further pointed out that people are generally fallible, particularly in matters of religion.

Mr. Handsoher - Suggested that the sighting may be an extension of the "cold war" - He also indicated that the A.V.C. (this name is illegible) may be an air defense search for foreign airings.

Summary:
It was concluded that the Aerial Phenomena Group would immediately give consideration to the major suggestion of a time line analysis using the "Frank Edwards" talk as an initial event. 
The other suggestions would be shelved until the next meeting of the Panel 1 which all numbers would be more familiar with special reports.

Mr. Heiast is to show the moving pictures of the UFOs shown which was on the Armstrong Circle Theater TV program.
