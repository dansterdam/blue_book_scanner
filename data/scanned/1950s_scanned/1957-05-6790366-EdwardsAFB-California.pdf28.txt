BABIS-30/1943 Spence/jm1/55809
To: Commanding General, Air Materiel Command, Wright Field, Ohio

Subject: UNIDENTIFIED SIGHTING OF FLYING OBJECTS
RECEIVED BY THE AIR FORCE

These are typical of similar reports received by the Air Force, which upon investigation were found to be balloons, aircraft, astronomical phenomena, and several unidentified.

It is the opinion of the Air Force that any attempt to attribute the sightings is unwarranted and not supported by the facts.

Sincerely,
