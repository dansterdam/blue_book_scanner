Dear Sir:

On February 6, 1959, while on Flagstaff Mt. a 7000' foothil NW of Boulder, I took what I thought would be a remarkable picture of a "flying saucer". It wasn't anything like my brother's Brownie Holiday, which is a small black blob under a considerable enlargement or a well-known cosmic ray reminiscent of a "flying saucer".

The enclosed picture is an enlargement from a small negative presumably from a normal commercial 1/2:2 speed filr. The development was normal commercial.

Absolutely nothing was seen in the area with the naked eye. The picture above others has no known explanation. I have gone to Washington to research up a copy of the Project Blue Book flight data - but they will not give any kind of explanation. I should be willing to offer an explanation, but I do not remember the weather conditions or anything of that sort. But I could find them out for you. I will send the original negative if you wish.

The picture was taken at about 5 P.M. and the directions of view is approximately southeast.

Yours truly,
