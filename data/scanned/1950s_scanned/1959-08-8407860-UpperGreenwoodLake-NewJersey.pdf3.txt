The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document describing a sighting of a group of "teen-agers" who witnessed an object that "wasn't a plane." The document mentions that the object had white lights and a red light. It also states that the witness did not see any effects on life here, but they have a "uranium mine a few miles away."

The text in the document is as follows:

"The stars I saw. We were with a group of teen-agers at a beach party and they saw an object that wasn't a plane. He said what they saw had red on the tips. The one I saw had only white lights. It was as high, maybe the red was blocked out.

He flunked me and no one even saw any effects life here, till they put in the Mike-bases - and we also have a uranium mine a few miles away.

We're up in the mountains here and I always feel safe when I hear a jet over 24,000. It had none of these things they looked at with the binoculars when they first came."
