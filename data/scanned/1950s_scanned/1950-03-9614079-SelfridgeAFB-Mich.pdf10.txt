Harris, Operations Officer, 57th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Selfridge AFB, Michigan, observed an unidentified flying object at approximately 1855 hours on 10 March 1950.

2. Lt. Harris was performing a routine training flight in a P-51 type aircraft at an altitude of approximately 18,000 feet. At approximately 1855 hours, about 20 miles NW of Selfridge AFB, Lt. Harris observed a bright "fireball" type object pass his aircraft at an approximate speed of 4-500 knots. The object was described as round, brilliantly illuminated, and apparently metallic in appearance. It passed in front of the aircraft from right to left, disappearing in the distance in a few seconds. Lt. Harris stated that the size of the object appeared to be approximately 20-30 feet in diameter and that it left no trail or exhaust.

3. Both PARKER and HATCOCK are agreed that the appearance and disappearance of this unidentified "fireball" type object to be of considerable interest. Apparently such sightings could be of major importance in view of the increasing interest and concern regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. It is requested that this report be forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Material Command, for appropriate action.
