The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically an "Air Intelligence Information Report" regarding an unidentified flying object sighting.

The text in the document reads as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

LOCATION: Near Bakersfield, California

DATE OF INFORMATION: 27 September 1950

SOURCE: Pilot, Civil Air Patrol, Bakersfield, California

SUMMARY: 
1. Following information of an unidentified flying object was received at the March Air Force Base Flight Service Center on 27 September 1950, from the pilot of a CAP aircraft:

"Possibility of object being a star, planet, meteor, or balloon is ruled out because it neither diminished a fixed position nor followed a constant course. Speed, remarkable maneuvering, and brilliant light of object seemed to indicate to the witness that it was not a conventional aircraft. Brilliance of object prevented its silhouette."

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
