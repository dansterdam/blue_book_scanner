1. Attached for your information and whatever action deemed necessary, is a summary of the background of the case covered by NICAP Information Bulletin #10, which was a response to an article appearing in Look Magazine based upon an interview with Capt G.T. Carlston of the Oxnard Air Force Base.
2. Reference is made to a recent briefing given to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, as to this serious issue of which NICAP was apprised as a courtesy organized. The charges brought up against the Air Force regarding the Oxnard incident are considered unfounded as a result of his persistent inquiries to General Kelty and the Commander of Oxnard AFB, and the NCOIC investigation that was presented in some detail.
3. With respect to a radar report allegedly given by a CAA control tower operator while NICAP in receipt by the radar unit at Oxnard. However, is there the possibility of a more tangible evidence, the matter is obvious: the property of a member staff of a Government agency and confidential, which should be reported to the proper authorities.
