Transcription of the text in the document:

"What it may have been known is a matter of opinion. The unknown object gave a brilliant blue white light and was observed to travel at a very high rate of speed across the sky. The object was observed for several minutes and was seen to disappear in the distance. It was observed by several air force personnel and seemed to be at an altitude of several thousand feet. The object appeared to be quite large in size and was observed to be traveling in a straight line. The object did not make any sound and did not seem to be attached to any visible aircraft. The object was observed on the evening of 6 May 1952 at approximately 2000 hours. That it seems could it not quite belong in our atmosphere, yet it was there."
