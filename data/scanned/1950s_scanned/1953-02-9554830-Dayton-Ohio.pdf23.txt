The image contains three sketches. The first sketch is a curved line with the instructions to imagine that you are at the point shown, and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.

The second and third sketches are larger sketches that appear to depict a road or highway with scenery in the background. The instructions indicate that the larger sketch shows the position of the object when it was first seen (marked with an "A") and when it was last seen (marked with a "B").
