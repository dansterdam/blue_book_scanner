Reports of object four feet or less in size have occurred occasionally to date and, if the explanation is not immediately obvious, are investigated. On 6 October 14, 1959, officials at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, reported that several silver colored substances were falling from unknown objects in the sky near the town of Washington. Two Air Force investigators arrived in the area to examine the material.

The first sighting had occurred shortly before noon, when a farm woman noticed an object in the sky, traveling but not particularly fast from northeast to west. A few moments later, while she was still watching, the object disintegrated, and she observed small silvery particles falling toward the earth. The object itself was as large as a football, brown or black in color, and maintained a perfectly straight, steady, horizontal flight path.

A man mowing his lawn noticed on the grass two whitish-gray streaks about two feet long and eight inches wide, extending from east to west. Similar streaks were observed elsewhere, and it was determined that these silver particles were fragments or residue of whatever the original object had been.

The Air Force investigators took samples of the dusky earth and grass for analysis. Chemical tests showed the presence of silver, iron, and lithium. A soil sample from the site pointed the way to a solution. Silver iodide and other silver compounds used in cloud seeding to produce "rain shower" effects, frequently present in mountainous country for distances of thirty-five miles downwind, were found.

A few questions in the light plane produced the answer, enough from the University of Georgia at Athens and from the Lockhead plant at Augusta had been in the air that day, carrying out silver iodide seeding experiments.
