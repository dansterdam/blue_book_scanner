UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT

Time sighted approximately 1700 to 1705, Date 29 April 1953

Size, approximately that of a F-80 fighter aircraft.

Shape, circular with no extention of control surfaces.

Color, metallic silver

Track of object from north to east

Flight time observed, 60 seconds

At approximately 1700 the undersigned officers, enroute to FEAF from San Francisco on the USNS General A W Brewster, sighted an unidentified object approximately the size of an F-80 fighter aircraft, at 3 o'clock, altitude 2000 feet and slightly below the clouds, at a distance of about Â½ mile. This object appeared to remain stationary for a few seconds, then turn at right angles towards the ship, then gain altitude and travelled in an arc to a position of 5 o'clock, disappearing through the clouds aft of the ship.

The object did not perform with the smooth control movements of any known aircraft. Rather its controlled action were erratic with some turns at 90 degree angles and near vertical climbs. The movement from 3 to 5 o'clock was in an arc.

Estimated speed of this object was in excess of a jet fighter aircraft.
