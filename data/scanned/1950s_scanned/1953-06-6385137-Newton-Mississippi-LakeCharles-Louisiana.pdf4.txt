2 June 1953

Description
On the night of 2 June 1953 at approximately 2231 hours a T-33 type aircraft from Keesler AFB, Mississippi, was over the Tallulah, Louisiana, area returning to Keesler AFB from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The aircraft was at an altitude of approximately 23,000 feet when a whitish-green light attracted the pilot's attention. The light passed the aircraft from the starboard to port side at a distance of approximately 1/2 to 1 mile from the aircraft. The object was seen to be free of any visible trail or exhaust as it passed the aircraft. Though the object was seen to be moving at a high rate of speed in a straight course with the aircraft, the pilot did not notice any sound from the object. The light appeared to brighten and the pilot, thinking it was a rocket, called for an observer to confirm his observation. As the light drew closer, it appeared to the pilot to be a 1 to 1 1/2 feet in diameter and cylindrical in shape. Just before this object disappeared, it appeared to fire a small 1 to 1 1/2 inch object which was observed to the rear of the main object at an approximate speed of 1,000 miles per hour for approximately 2 to 3 seconds before the object distinguished into a ball of fire.

Discussion
The ATIC contract astronomer states that the object observed was a meteors. The fact that the object appeared to climb was probably caused by the motion of the aircraft as it turned to avoid collision.

Conclusion
Was astronomical (meteor).
