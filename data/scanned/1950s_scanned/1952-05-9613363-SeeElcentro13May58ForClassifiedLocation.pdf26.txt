APPENDIX V

EL CENTRO, CALIF. AREA - 13 May 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
In the El Centro, Calif., Area on 13 May 1952 four separate reports of unidentified objects were made as follows:

a. 1115Z - Hovering over El Centro, five "flying saucers" as large as B-36's, with a light underneath, disappeared at a terrific rate of speed. They were reported by the El Centro Sheriff's Office.

b. 1113Z - An FSFE pilot taking off from El Centro Naval Air Station reported what appeared to be a shooting star about 60 degrees to the east.

c. 1130Z - A sheriff's car at Holtville, Calif., sighted a strange object resembling a parachute and the bottom of the Salton Sea.

d. 1150Z - A control tower operator at Yuma, Arizona, sighted an orange and blue object 500 and 700 miles across hovering for a short time in one position. It changed to another position. Operator said it was sighted for two periods to be a falling star.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
There were no AF fighters at the time but four FSFE's from El Centro Naval Air Station were airborne from 1100Z to 1230Z.

III. CONCLUSIONS
a. It is possible that the FSFE's and what appeared to be a shooting star account for the first reports.

b. What appeared to be a shooting star was probably a meteor.

c. No conclusions.

d. The tower operator stated that he had observed the same phenomenon several times before and had been instructed that in reports of such phenomena the reflection of sunlight from aircraft at high altitudes might not be entirely the reflection of suncats.
