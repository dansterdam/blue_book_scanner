BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Crew of A/C sighted amber object
about 10 miles distant overtaking
and passing a/c. Thought to be Jet
type a/c. Light came up fast and
pulled ahead of reporting a/c and
disappeared. Speed of reporting a/c
was 200 knots. No air traffic known
to be in area and no radar contact.

III. COMMENTS
Duration extremely short for a/c
Subsequent TWX indicated that
the object was a rocket as the
USS Rushmore was conducting
rocket firing tests in Davis
Strait area between Goose Bay
and Frobisher Bay.
