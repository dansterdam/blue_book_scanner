Photograph it but even telepathically or cannot be acomplished at this time as see very faint of an image. This time it seemed more pronounced than on the previous 2 photographs sent to me but still not of sufficient clearness to warrant consideration at this time. The film was of a type which we did not carry regularly but have used on a few occasions on a special basis to attempt to obtain better definition on sightings. However the results were not satisfactory. The exposure was made under poor lighting conditions and the object was quite distant as the witness mentioned he was moving away rapidly. We will continue to follow up but at the moment I do not see how we can make further progress on this case. I have only 8 minutes of exposure and rarely can a clear photograph be obtained of all UFOs under such conditions. If we are in a position to make a much more detailed study, I should like to do so, but at the moment I do not think we are gaining anything of value that would justify the expense. The film and handling of the photographic work on this case has been extremely meticulous and careful, and when we are able to get something more definitive, I am certain we will have a real contribution. As we are faced with the limitations of our photographic equipment and the nature of the sightings, I am not too surprised at the results we have obtained.
