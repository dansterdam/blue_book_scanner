The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book report, that describes an unidentified flying object sighting.

Object sighted at about 1915 hours 27 Aug 52 from Edgemont. Directly overhead.
(a) Object shaped like a football. Our first impression was that of something akin to a searchlight flame, which illuminated from within. The sun reflected from its color that seemed that of a military plane.
b. There was no sound - vapor trail, etc.
c. Object traveled in a straight line.
d. Object traveled at a great speed - much faster than any aircraft.
e. Object was visible for a period of about thirty seconds.
f. Object was visible only during the time it took for it to cross the area covered by the sun's rays and disappeared upon leaving that area.
g. A jet fighter proceeded in the direction from which the object came - about ten minutes later.
