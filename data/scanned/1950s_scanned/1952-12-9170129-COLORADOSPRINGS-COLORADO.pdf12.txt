Colorado Springs, Colorado  L December 1952

I. Description of Incident
An Air Force sergeant and a civilian sighted a round aluminum colored object flying east to west. It appeared to be changing shape as it proceeded out of sight to the west. The sergeant estimated the time of observation to be 10-15 minutes. The two men stated the object was slightly larger than the full moon, and traveled slightly faster than the speed of sound. Their observation indicated the object was not an aircraft, but they could not identify it.

II. Discussion of Incident
Aircraft in the area included B-29's and B-50's as well as Camp Carson observation planes. The B-29's and B-50's are said to be a possibility since they were on a south heading 7 minutes after the sighting took place. The observation plane, however, was in the area at the exact time of the observation and was discounted. The sighting lasted but a short time.

III. Conclusions
Possibly aircraft.
