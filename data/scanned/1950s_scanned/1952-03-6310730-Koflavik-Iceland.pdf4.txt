AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Keflavik, Iceland

REFERENCES: TR-110-52
25 March 1952

1. This incident was first reported on CJVIS report DID 13-7020Z, from Base Operations Officer, Keflavik, Iceland, to Air Defense Command, and the Director, Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C., and Chief, USAF, Andrews Air Force Base, Washington, D.C. Information from Keflavik Air Force Base.

2. The report mentioned above stated that the estimated altitude of the object sighted was 2,500 feet.

3. The statement of Captain Clyde B. Kiser reveals that the GCA operator, whom he conversed with, reported that the object passed his scope at a speed much faster than F-86s that he had clocked on other occasions.

4. The mention of Capt. John W. Kelly, GCA crew chief, on duty at the time of this incident, indicates that the fact that no altitude information is available on the search system of the AN/APS-10.

5. Certain radar phenomena called ghosts or angels, the mechanics of which are not thoroughly understood, are capable of producing returns which in the majority of cases are indistinguishable from real targets. Ghosts or angels usually are observed to have a fairly consistent speed and track, and are identified as a target as they appear and disappear, rather than observed they should be treated as unidentified aircraft.
