Lt CASA, ATIO
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS SIGHTED OVER TOKYO, JAPAN ON 15 MARCH 1955.

AT APPROXIMATELY 2300 HRS, 15 MARCH 1955, A VISUAL OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY AN AMERICAN CIVILIAN, XXXXXXXXXXX, AND THREE JAPANESE CIVILIANS, OF AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT OVER THE CITY OF TOKYO, JAPAN. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING APPROXIMATELY 200 YARDS IN DIAMETER, LUMINOUS WHITE IN COLOR, AND MOVING AT AN APPROXIMATE SPEED OF 1,000 MPH. IT REMAINED IN SIGHT FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 SECONDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

SINCE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SIGHTING, THE WITNESS WAS NOT FULLY CERTAIN OF HIS SIGHTING'S CREDIBILITY, HE DELAYED REPORTING THE INCIDENT UNTIL SEVERAL HOURS LATER WHEN HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE INCIDENT'S VERACITY WAS INCREASED. HOWEVER, HE ALSO STATED THAT HIS VISUAL OBSERVATION WAS SUBSTANTIATED BY TWO JAPANESE CIVILIANS WHO WERE IN HIS COMPANY AT THE TIME. ADDITIONALLY, THIS OBJECT WAS DETECTED ON RADAR BY AN AIR FORCE RADAR INSTALLATION AT TACHIKAWA AIR BASE ON THE SAME DATE AND AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME.

THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE A SLIGHT TURN AND THEN ACCELERATE TO AN ESTIMATED SPEED IN EXCESS OF 1,000 MPH. THE RADAR INSTALLATION ESTIMATED THE OBJECT'S ALTITUDE TO BE BETWEEN 15,000 - 20,000 FEET. IT WAS TRACKED FOR LITTLE OVER A MINUTE. 

IT IS THE CONSIDERED OPINION OF THE LOCAL AIR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER THAT THIS SIGHTING, WHILE UNEXPLAINED, APPEARS TO BE OF A LEGITIMATE AND UNUSUAL NATURE. HE RECOMMENDS THAT IT BE INCLUDED IN INTELLIGENCE FILES FOR FURTHER STUDY AND ANALYSIS.
