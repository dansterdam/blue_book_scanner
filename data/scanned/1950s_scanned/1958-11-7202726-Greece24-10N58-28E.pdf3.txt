COMMENTS (For reverse, if necessary)
1. The information received in this report is very limited. However, it is the opinion of the AFSC that the phenomena viewed by this gentleman and his companions was a fireball. A fireball is a meteor of uncommon brightness. By definition, a fireball is brighter than -3 magnitude.
2. Fireballs often leave a short trail, are sporadic in their origin and often change in flight. Study of these meteors aids pointing out the irregularity of their occurence. Experienced astronomers rarely see more than one in a lifetime.
3. Because these items are usually an initial experience they have a startling effect on observers.
