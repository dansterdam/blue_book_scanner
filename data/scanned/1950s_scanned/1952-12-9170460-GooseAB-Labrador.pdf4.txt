The image shows a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, which appears to be a form for reporting UFO sightings. There are two diagrams on this page:

1. The first diagram shows a semicircular chart representing the horizon, with angles marked on it. There is a curved line with the letters "A" and "B" on different points of the line, indicating the first and last point of observation relative to the horizon.

2. The second diagram contains the words "No Motion" and is meant to illustrate the motion of the object or objects seen, but it is left blank.

I will now act as an OCR system and reproduce all the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.
