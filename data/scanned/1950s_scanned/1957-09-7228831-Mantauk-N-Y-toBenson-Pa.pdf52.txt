3. Benton established contact on an unknown target north of the station at 1912Z. The track described a westerly course at a speed of about 920 knots. The target was tracked continuously until it faded at 1926Z. At 1942Z, 2 minutes prior to the fading of the unknown target, a new target appeared at a position northeast of the station at a speed of 1,200 knots. This target described a track that closely paralleled that of the first track and faded at 1943Z at a position northwest of the station.

These unknown tracks were passed to the 7634 ACWRON (Migrate) at Lockport AFS, N.Y. and to the 7722 ACWRON AFS (Silverstone) at Claysburg AFS, Pennsylvania; however, these radars failed to establish contact with the targets.

5. Four RIVinians were to a state of Increased Readiness during the time period. The 20th CADD and the 31st CADD at 2009Z and the 30th CADD and 37th CADD at 1935Z.

6. Noermann's action was taken by the 26th CADD due to the very high speed of the target. When the track first appeared on the GEECR ploting board at 1902Z, the 37th CADD was notified and at 1912Z two F-102's aircraft from Kinross were scrambled. The 37th then scrambled two additional F-102's from Truax. By this time, both tracks had faded.
