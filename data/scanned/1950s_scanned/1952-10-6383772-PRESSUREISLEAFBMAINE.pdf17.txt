POSSIBLE ATMOSPHERIC ANALYSIS OF THE PRESSURE ISLE SIGHTING

The sighting of an U.F.O. over the little State University campus at the Tarzain of Houlton for his analysis. The object sighted is reported to have been observed to be a brilliant light source which appeared and disappeared with a pulsating motion. There was no noise associated with the sighting. The observer, who is a reliable witness, states that the object appeared larger than a star but smaller than the planet Venus. The size is estimated to have been about 3 to 5 inches in diameter when viewed at arm's length.

Dr. Hopkins' comments on the case are as follows: The difference between "his altitude" on observed flying from the ground is very little in comparison with the apparent size. The focus of a planet minding themselves of light years: only a planet of many thousands of miles in diameter. The object was located at an extremely high altitude and distance to qualify it as a planet or meteor. It could not have been a jet airplane or helicopter as there was no sound. The silence favors the conclusion that this was some form of balloon or dirigible-type of craft, but there is no report of any known balloons or airships in the area at the time.

Mr. Higgins is in the process of submitting a written report.

What was the amount of time the object was observed? This information is not given. But it is the survival of those who have observed these sightings at various times and places that the recorded evidence of unusual aerial activity is gathered to establish what may be termed the "hard core" of the U.F.O. problem which cannot be brushed aside as fantasy or products of overwrought imaginations.
