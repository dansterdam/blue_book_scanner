The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram or chart titled "VISUAL FLIGHT" that provides information about minimum ceiling and distance from clouds for flights in control zones, control areas, and elsewhere. The diagram shows different scenarios based on whether there is air traffic control clearance or not.

VISUAL FLIGHT 
MINIMUM CEILINGS AND DISTANCES FROM CLOUDS
WITHOUT AIR TRAFFIC CLEARANCE

IN CONTROL ZONES:
- CLEAR OF CLOUDS ALL LEVELS

WITH TRAFFIC CLEARANCE
IN CONTROL AREAS: 
- CLEAR OF CLOUDS ALL LEVELS

ELSEWHERE:
- 1 MILE AT ALL LEVELS

WITHOUT AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CLEARANCE
IN CONTROL ZONES: 
- 1 MILE AT ALL LEVELS

ELSEWHERE: 
- 1 MILE ALL LEVELS

WITH TRAFFIC CLEARANCE
IN CONTROL AREAS:
- WHERE VISIBILITY IS LESS THAN 3 MILES ALL FLIGHTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES ONLY

ELSEWHERE: 
- 1 MILE ALL LEVELS
