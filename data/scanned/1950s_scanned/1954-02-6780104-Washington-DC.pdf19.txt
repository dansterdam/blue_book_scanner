TRUE "UNKNOWN"

INCIDENT

24 July 1948

At 2:45 in the morning, the pilot and co-pilot of an Eastern Airlines DC-3, flying at 5,000 feet between Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama, sighted a dull red exhaust some 700 feet ahead, a little above and to the right of the airliner.

Captain [redacted], the pilot, immediately turned to his co-pilot and remarked: "Look, here comes a new Army jet job".

The object approached in a slight dive, deflected a little to the left and passed the plane on the right, almost level and parallel to the flight path, at a distance of approximately one-half mile. After passing, it pulled up sharply and disappeared into a cloud.

The object appeared to be a wingless aircraft, 100 ft. long, cigar-shaped and about twice the diameter of a "B-29". It had no fins or protruding surfaces. [Redacted] thought it had a "snout" similar to a radar dome on the front and he had the impression there was a cabin with windows above -- more like a pilot compartment -- except that it appeared brighter. The illumination inside the body itself approximated the brilliance of a magnesium flare. He saw no occupants nor did he [redacted].

The entire sighting, which was intense, fairly rapid, blue-green running the entire length of the object beneath the fuselage.
