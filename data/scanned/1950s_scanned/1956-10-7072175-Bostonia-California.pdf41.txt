SUBJECT: UFO Photographs Submitted by FBI on Miss _____________,
Bostonia, California

Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters USAF
Washington 25, D. C.

1. Attached is a draft of a proposed letter to be forwarded by your office to subject person, reflecting the results of an analysis made by this Center on photographs originally submitted to your organization by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Reference latter from 18th OSI District, Cheli AFB, California, dated 13 June 1957, a copy which was forwarded to this Center with enlargements of the original prints.

2. Subject photography is highly suggestive of a hoax; however, this should not imply that the attempted hoax was necessarily perpetrated by subject person.

3. Experience has shown that incidents of this type are often publicized, with allegations and statements detrimental to the Air Force, when explanations are not given to sources submitting photographs. It is, therefore, the general policy of this Center, whenever possible, to provide a brief summary of our analysis to such individuals.
