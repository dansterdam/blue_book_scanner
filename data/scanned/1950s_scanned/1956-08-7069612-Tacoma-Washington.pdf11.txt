2 Navy Men Ride "Sky Hook" Balloon To 8-Mile Altitude

Two Navy men today floated nearly 200 miles from Minneapolis, Minn., to a point south of Stevens Point, Wis., in a "sky-hook" plastic balloon at an altitude of nearly eight miles in the first test of a new carrier-type "sky-hook" plastic balloon.

The balloon was launched by General Mills, Inc., from International Airport, Minneapolis, at 1:15 p.m. and landed at 3:30 p.m. eight miles south of the Wisconsin city.

The balloonists were Lt. Cmdr. William D. Ross, project officer for the "Stratoscale" program, and Lt. Cdr. M. L. Lewis, Navy jet pilot who made the first full-scale test of the balloon.

On today's flight, the Stratoscale" balloon reached an altitude of nearly 40,000 feet in a flight in which several low-altitude records were attempted. The world's altitude record for balloons was reached by the U.S. Army Air Corps Flyers who reached 72,395 feet.
