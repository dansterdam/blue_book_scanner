The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a "B" marked on it, and a diagram of an object above the horizon line. The second sketch shows a larger scene with a figure on a road in the foreground, and a circular shape in the background.

EXTRACTED TEXT:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point "A" in the curved line. That is the position from which you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
