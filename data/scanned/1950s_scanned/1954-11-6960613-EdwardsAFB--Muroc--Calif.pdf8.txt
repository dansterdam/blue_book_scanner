This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

The text in the document is written in a typewritten format and is largely redacted or blacked out, making it difficult to read. However, I can attempt to transcribe the visible text as an OCR system would:

AFTER INTERVIEWING THIS WITNESS AND INSPECTING THE OBJECT, CAPT. DUNN DETERMINED THAT THE OBJECT WAS SOME TYPE OF AERIAL OBJECT, BUT THAT IT DID NOT CONFORM TO ANY KNOWN CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. CAPT. DUNN ALSO STATED THAT THE OBJECT EXHIBITED CHARACTERISTICS WHICH COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED BY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT THEORY.

ONE WITNESS RECALLS SEEING THE OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE AREA FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES. AFTER HOVERING THE OBJECT THEN ACCELERATED OUT OF SIGHT IN A NORTHWESTERLY DIRECTION AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

BASED ON THE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE WITNESSES, CAPT. DUNN WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY EXPLANATION FOR THE OBSERVED OBJECT.

THE INCIDENT WAS FORWARDED TO AISS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. DUE TO THE CLASSIFIED NATURE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER, NO FURTHER INFORMATION HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE.
