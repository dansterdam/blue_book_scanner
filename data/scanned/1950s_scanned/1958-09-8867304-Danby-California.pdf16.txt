COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER

In view of observations made by SOURCES at Danby and by the two
investigators, an evaluation of probable optical illusion caused by sun reflec-
tions on radio antennae is given this report. It is felt that Los Angeles
SOURCE would have agreed had he been given the time for further investigation
as did the other observers.
