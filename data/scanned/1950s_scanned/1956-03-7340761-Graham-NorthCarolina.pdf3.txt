III. SOURCE’S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE and his wife were on duty at the COC post, Fairchild Fields, Graham, North Carolina (GJIJS 305), when the object was first sighted at 050115Z March 1955. It was at an azimuth of 175° and an elevation of from 3-5°. SOURCE was certain he observed the object for a total of ten minutes. It was pointed out to him by another observer. He observed it with the naked eyes, with eyeglasses, without eyeglasses through 7x50 binoculars and with eyeglasses through 7x50 binoculars. After watching it for approximately five minutes SOURCE and his wife drove to another COC post approximately ten miles south. There they again observed it, but on this occasion no binoculars were available.

SOURCE stated there was neither daylight nor moonlight. Even though there were many stars visible, the object plainly stood out from the surrounding astronomical bodies. It appeared to stand still, it changed in brightness and it flickered, throbbed and pulsated. It did not suddenly accelerate, break up, give off smoke or change shape. It moved neither in front of nor behind another object or cloud. it appeared to be solid in form, was brighter than an auto headlight more than a mile away, and changed from red to green to yellow at regular intervals. There was no sound. The size of it was estimated with certainty to be that of a quarter held at arm’s length as seen through binoculars. It’s edges Were fuzzy, and SOURCE indicated that he felt it was constructed of a heat resistant alloy, was a minimum of two feet in diameter, and was approximately two hundred miles high and two thousand miles away. When he last observed the object it was at an azimuth of 115° and an elevation of 3-5°; it gradually faded away during the last five minutes. The sky was clear, there was no wind, and the weather was cold and dry. SOURCE stated that he felt the object was a man made satellite.

At the same time on the next evening (06011Z Mar 56) SOURCE observed the same object at the same location. Its characteristics were generally the same as the night before, but it was observed for thirty minutes. On that occasion it was yellow with red flashes at regular intervals.
