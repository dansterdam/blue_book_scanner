AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Alleged Sighting of Flying Objects near Kyushu, Japan.

I had just arrived in Kumple at approximately 1630, about one hour prior to the sighting, and inquired to Richard Doughty and George Hayes, both of whom were present at the time, as to what the local rumors were concerning flying discs. They stated that there had been no reports of any such objects in the area. At approximately 1730, Doughty and I were standing outside the entrance to the Airfix office building, and observed 4 bright, shiny objects hovering at an altitude which appeared to be about 1500 to 2000 feet. They were approximately in the same area or of the first sighting. About 1937 this object left the area and disappeared from sight.

On the night of 27 October 1952, I, A/2c George E. Hayes, was on duty in the radio maintenance shop at Ashiya Air Force Base, Kyushu, Japan. At approximately 1730 I glanced out of the window and observed 4 bright, shiny objects hovering at an altitude which appeared to be about 1500 to 2000 feet. After observing the objects for several minutes, they suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. I immediately reported the incident to my supervisor, M/Sgt Doughty, who was also an eyewitness to the occurrence.

I certify that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.
