No Case (Information Only)

24 November 1956
Dallas, Texas

Case #76: Dallas, Texas, Nov. 24. A bright light was observed about 6:15 p.m. by three witnesses, a housewife and two deputy sheriffs, according to the report. The object was described as brilliant, white, round, and about the size of a basketball. It was first sighted about 6:15 p.m., when it appeared to be about 300 yards distant and disappeared in the south. The object was seen for about 2 to 3 minutes and was observed by a neighbor. The object remained completely dark and emitted no other side of illumination. No sound was associated with the sightings.

Oscar Monnie, weather expert, tried to track down the sightings. He contacted the CAA at Love Field, Dallas, who stated they had no reports of any unusual aerial activity at that time. Radar at San Antonio and Abilene were also checked, but no returns were obtained. Monnie also contacted the Departments of the Army, Austin and San Antonio and the University of Texas, but no one had any knowledge of the sightings. The case is classified as U.F.0. Insufficient data is available to make a definite identification.
