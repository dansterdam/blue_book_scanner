The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. As per the instructions, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

April 29, 1958, St. Paul, Minnesota
A UFO similar to the one reported in Tower, Minnesota, was observed by tower operators at Wold-Chamberlain Airport and by other observers. The CAA tower operator and a weather observer both reported it. It moved very fast and at a high speed on an easterly course. It was described as emitting sparks from its glowing mass before its sudden disappearance.
NICAP member H. T. Sherman, insurance underwriter and canvasser, who reported the sighting to the CAA tower operators at Wold-Chamberlain. The captain first observed Venus, which Sherman as an experienced observer knew was Venus. The captain then suggested a meteor or "falling star," stated Mr. Sherman. "A UFO's appearance was not even discussed." Finally, Captain Klassen suggested a small light on a plane, but Sherman pointed out these lights.
1. When the light was first observed, it was still fairly light, being about 7 p.m.
2. The light would have been seen by any aircraft, approach of which would have been officially recorded.
The Air Force captain, had no other explanation, and the sighting was officially recorded.
