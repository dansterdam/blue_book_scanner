THE USUAL SWIFT CHECK HAD BEEN MADE, I BUT NO AIRCRAFT WAS SCHEDULED TO BE AT THAT POINT. GUIDED By GROUND CONTROL, THE PILOT CLIMBED STEEPLY WHILE HIS RADAR OBSERVER WATCHED THE REAR COCKPIT SCOPE BY NOW THE PILOT COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE UNKNOWN --.A STRANGE GLEAMING OB8ECT MOVING SWIFTLY ABOVE. PULLING INTO A TIGHT CLIMBING TURN, HE STARTED T9 CLO: THE GAP. I
AT THE SAME TIME HIS RADAR OBSERVER STARTED TO CALL THE UNKNOWN. THERE WA NO RESPONSE.
UNTIL THAT MOMENT THE STARFiRE-5 JET ENGINE HAD BEEN WORKING PERFECTLY.:
SUDDENLY, AS THE PLANE ;STREAKED TOWARD THE UFO, A WAVE OF HEAT MYSTERIOUSLY FILLED THE COCKPIT. II WAS LIKE THE BLAST OF A FURNACE I. HALF DAZED, THE: PILOT RAN HIS EYES OVER THE, INSTRUMENTS. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF TROUBLE, BUT’ THE STIFLING HEAT WAS INCREASING EACH SECOND.; ;
FRANTICALLY HE LOOKED AROUND. THE RADAR OFFICER-S FACE WAs A BLUR IN THE
WAVES 0f HEAT. AT ANY MOMENT IT SEEMED THE WHOLE PLANE MIGHT BUR8T INTO FLAMES.

‘*BAIL OUT -- BAIL OUT,* HE SHOUTED. PS

HE JETTISONED HIS CANOPY AND SEIZED THE EJECTION LEVER. HE FELT THE JUMP AS THE RADARMAN BAILED OUT. HALF BLINDED BY SWEAT. HE GOT A GLIMPSE THE UNKNOWN 081ECT.AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD. THERE wAs ONE FINAL BLAST OF HEA! HE PULLED THE EJECTION LEVER AND WAS HURLED OUT OF THE COCKPiT.

MOMENTS LATER, HIS SENSES STILL BLURRED, HE SAW THE RADARMAN-S PARACHUTE BELOW HIM. LOOKING BACK AT THE F-94, HE GROANED. THE JET WAS PLUNGING STRAIGHT INTO THE VILLAGE OF WALESVILLE, NEW YORK. AS HE WITCHED, HORRIFIED
IT CRASHED IN THE HEART OF THE TOWN AND BURST INTO FLAMES
AFTER THE HEADLONG PLUNGE, THE F-94 STRUCK TWO BLOCKINGS AND CAREENED INTO
A CAR. FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED, TWO OF THEM CHILDREN, AND ANOTHER WA SERlOUSLY INJURED. As SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE, GRIFFITH FIELD OFFICERS LOCATED THE TWO AIRMEN AND PIECED OUT THE THE: STRANGE STORY. STiLL DAZED, NEITHER MAN COULD ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE UNKNOWN OBJECT. NOR COULD THEY EXPLAIN THE SUDDEN MYSTERIOUS HEAT WHICH HAD FORCED THEM TO BAIL OUT
