Text from the document:

VENUS MOST PROMINENT

Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the west and will soon be joined by Leonids, "shooting stars".

BY JAMES STOKLEY

Though seemingly a brilliantly lighted object, Venus is in reality a rather dull and inconspicuous world. It appears so bright because it is close to the earth and reflects a great deal of sunlight. 

At present Venus is making its greatest appearance as an evening star for this year. It will reach its highest point in the sky about an hour after sunset, and will be setting before 8:30 p.m. This will continue for a few weeks.

Venus is now so conspicuous in the sky as to make it the most prominent object except the moon. It is about half as bright as the full moon, and appears as a beautiful brilliant star low in the west.

The planet's brightness is due to the fact that it is now between the earth and the sun, and its illuminated half is turned earthward. As it goes around the sun, Venus passes through phases like those of the moon, and at present we are seeing its "full" phase.

It will be some months before Venus becomes an evening star again, as it will pass between the earth and sun in the coming months. Then it will be seen as a morning star, rising shortly before the sun.
