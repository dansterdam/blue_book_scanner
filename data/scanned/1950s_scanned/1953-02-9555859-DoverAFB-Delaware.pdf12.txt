2130
On or about 1730 hrs on 26 Feb 1953 I saw a object in the sky. I can not specify a definite shape of this object because it was far in the horizon. I can not specify how far or close this object was.

When I first seen this object it was white and gradually turned to red as it dropped in the horizon & then disappeared. My position was steps in front of the NCO Club. It took a period of 15 minutes to disappear. The sky was clear.
