The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter from the United States Air Force regarding a reported sighting of strange objects in the air.

Commanding Officers,
Air Intelligence, A-2, HQ,
USAF, WASHINGTON

Dear Sirs:

Yesterday afternoon I, along with three others, sighted several strange objects in the air. They were in controlled flight. We watched them for several minutes.

Please advise me if the Air Force is interested in such sightings. If so I will be happy to furnish a detailed description of our sighting from notes I made during the time they were visible.

I can be found at the Post Office at any time.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]
Major, United States Air Force
