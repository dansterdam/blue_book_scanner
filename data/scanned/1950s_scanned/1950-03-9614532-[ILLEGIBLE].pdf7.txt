Near Washington

Veteran private pilot yesterday reported sighting of a strange flying object over the District. Arlington A. Petten said he saw an "aluminum disk-like object" about 40 feet in diameter and 10 feet thick while flying over the outskirts of Washington. He said it was moving at terrific speed and appeared to be about 20,000 feet above him. Petten was flying at 5,000 feet when he noticed the disk below him, he said. As he approached the object, it seemed to go into an "overcast." He said the sight gave off vapor trails like jet aircraft engines.
