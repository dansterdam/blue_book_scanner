3 November 1950

Four radar contacts were made with an unidentified object airborne over England on 10 November 1950 between 1000 and 1300 hours, and at one time this object came to within 30,000 feet of a B-29 aircraft, between 0859 and 1025, 10 November 1950. The object traveled at an average speed of approx 1800 statute miles per hour. Its movements were characterized by its apparent similarity to those associated with jet propelled aircraft, such as suddenness of appearance, changes of course and high rate of speed.

1. Visual contact was not made with object. Returns on radar screen permit limits to be placed on size of the B-29 or G-54 object gave the same returns on the PPI scope and is inferred that objects would have been approx wingtip to wingtip size of B-29. Maximum altitude established by radar is less than 50,000 feet and minimum altitude is less than 13,000 to 20,000 feet is less than five seconds giving a climbing speed in excess of 8,000 feet in the same period.

2. First contact was made with the object at 0835'? and lasted until 0907 when it was lost in ground clutter. In this interval the ground distance covered was about 2.8 miles. A second contact was made at 0946'? lasting until 0957?? when object was lost. The approximate distance covered was about 1.3 miles. A third contact was made at 0944'? lasting until 0957?? when object was lost due to acceleration and descent speeds exceeding radar capabilities.

3. Object was observed through surface radar contact by AN/TPQ-2 (GPA-584 radar set) and disappearing point was 08,45'? in this contact.

4. Observation was made from radar van at Hilston Airbase (520951'N - 0002315'W) of motion and position as described. Positions of first and second contacts 5 miles NW of Bovingdon Airfield (510337'N - 0002312'W) on heading of 439 degrees. Dropped object (this term of length of paper track) approximately 7 miles of London (near 515345'N - 0000108'E) after travel of distance of 3.1 miles and according to an observer descending at high altitude. The position of the third contact was at a point 6 miles south of London on course of 360 degrees, turning clockwise after about 6 miles to a east southeastern heading of 120 degrees at an altitude estimated at 13,000 to 20,000 feet.
The fourth contact was made in the vicinity of Eastbourne (500501'N - 0000215'E) making of 2251'? at time when the object is reported to have turned and accelerated towards the sea, this direction of travel of about 225 degrees.
