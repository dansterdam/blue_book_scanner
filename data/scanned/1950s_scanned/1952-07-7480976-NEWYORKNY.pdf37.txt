UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
NAME, address omitted
This is included. There was no attempt at interpretation and there was no identification. There was no known air traffic or air view in the general area at the time of sighting. The sighting was reported and given consideration.
It is believed the original and further information are too limited to warrant further investigation and no action was taken.
As stated in Mr.------ letter, he seems to be very interested in these sighting questions. He did not commit himself by saying that he objects to the fact that a flying saucer was made in July 1952.
