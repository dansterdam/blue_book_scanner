The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

The wording of the well-known reference in Ezekiel is: "... a whirlwind came out of the north ... a fire unfolding ... and a brightness was about it, out of the midst thereof as the color of amber ... it sparkled like the color of burnished brass ... like the appearance of lamps, and like the appearance of the wheels ... like the appearance of a beryl (greenish-blue) ... as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel."

Less familiar is a passage in Zechariah: "Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll ... the length thereof (was) twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof (was) ten cubits."

12 January 1938

Extensive controversies raged among astronomers during the 1700s about numerous small objects observed near Venus. Were they optical illusions? Satellites of Venus? A planet between Venus and Mercury? These telescopically observed objects probably have no connection with UAOs, although some commentators, notably Charles Fort, have tried to establish such a connection. We are possibly on firmer ground in quoting a brief reference in the 1877 Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, ... a report that at Cherbourg, France, on 12 January 1938, was seen a luminous body, seemingly two-thirds the size of the moon. It seemed to rotate on an axis.
