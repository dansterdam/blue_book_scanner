Stated the observation with operations from Great Falls AFB on 29 July 1952.

Committed in accordance with AF LR No. 200-5, dated 20 April, 1952. Subj: Unidentified Flying Objects.

Between the hours of 1400 and 1500 MST, 29 July 1952, from four (4) to nine (9) female observers, employees of a local radio-television station in Great Falls, Montana, saw three (3) white or light-colored, approximately disc-shaped objects traveling about 600 knots at an altitude of approximately 15,000 to 20,000 feet. The objects appeared to be powered by jet propulsion and were smooth-surfaced, with no projections or appendages. The objects maneuvered at high speed, made sharp turns, and other unidentified maneuvers.

The first observed there were one indefinitely shaped object, pear-shaped, dark-colored, and smaller than the later observed objects. This object disappeared behind a hill. Three (3) larger, disc-shaped objects then appeared, flying one behind the other at different angles and speeds. These (3) objects flew out of the cloud, circled, and returned to central point behind cloud. After a short time, two (2) other similar objects appeared from the same cloud, following the three (3) objects.

From 30 minutes to one hour later, another cloud suddenly appeared over a mountain area, some 20 miles distant, and three (3) similar objects emerged from this cloud and returned to it.
