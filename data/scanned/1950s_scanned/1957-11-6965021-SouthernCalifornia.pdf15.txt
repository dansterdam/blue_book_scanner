Two men were observing the night sky when they sighted an object which appeared to be an aircraft. The object was described as round, emitting a reddish glow, and moving at a high rate of speed. It was estimated to be about two miles away and approximately 1,000 feet in altitude. The object changed direction abruptly and then disappeared from view within a few minutes, leaving no trace.
