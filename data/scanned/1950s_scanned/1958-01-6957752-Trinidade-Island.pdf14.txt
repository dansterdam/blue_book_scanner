INFORMATION REPORT
FROM:  U.S. Naval Attach'es, Rio 
REPORT NO:  58-58
DATE:  11 March 1958

Preparing Officer's Comments:
1. Most flying saucer stories are not worth wasting much time or effort to investigate. This case DOES appear to be something more than the usual "sighting" as it is substantiated by official Navy photographs.  However, the unfortunate further investigation provided only frustration at every turn, as all angles of approach were met with hostility by Brazilian authorities, and the object remains unknown.

2. There appear to be only two explanations for this peculiar incident:
(a) Some overwhelming power has told the Brazilian Navy not to reveal the truth - this I do not believe as it would be superfluous speculation and hard to prove.  
(b) The whole thing is a fake publicity stunt put on by a crackpot. This seems likely as the strange appearance of the object, that it was immediately photographed, and the way the Brazilian authorities have treated the matter would lead one to believe the photos and incident may be just another effort to gain some cheap publicity - the kind that is well known propensity for never letting the truth stand in the way.

In addition, the photographs furnished by the Brazilian Navy are not of good quality and do not appear to show conclusively that the object was intended to photograph a recognized phenomenon. They appear that the object was intended to photograph a comparison in size and distance, and there appears to be no lateral drifting as would occur with any sizable object.

In conclusion, this officer's opinion is that the Brazilian authorities have not told the full story, and that the incident on Trinidade Island is probably a publicity stunt and the photographs are not of a genuine unidentified flying object.
