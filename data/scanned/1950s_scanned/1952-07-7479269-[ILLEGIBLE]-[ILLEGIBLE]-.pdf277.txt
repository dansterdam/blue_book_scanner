CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF EVENTS REGARDING THE SIGHTING OF UNUSUAL OBJECTS OVER FORT MONMOUTH ON JULY 1, 1952 AND WITNESSED BY 12 STUDENTS.

1. 0920 As I was walking past the radar range, Col. Smith and Hartlage reported that several students besides themselves were seeing strange objects in the sky which they considered to be peculiar. They noticed these objects at about 2,000 yards. This was not seen by me.

2. 0925 I immediately questioned Smith and Hartlager and after noticing their seriousness, gathered together all who reportedly saw the objects took them to my office in Bldg. 900.

3. 0927 I called Mr. Sheldon De Brun of Security and Vigilance and told him what happened and requested that he either call Col. Smith and Hartlager or have someone else do so and obtain more details in order to evaluate the objects seen overhead in the vicinity of other aircraft. These objects were seen by 12 men. This was as per orders regarding any unusual sky observations.

4. 0930 I reported the incident to Capt. Miracles in the Radar Division Headquarters, Bldg. 913.

5. 0935 I immediately began taking notes and statements from all who were involved in the incident.

6. 0938 Mr. Sheldon De Brun called back and reported that he had contacted Maj. Gen. Air Force Base and that this was all they could tell him.

7. 0943 Capt. Miracles and Capt. Dickerman came to my office in Bldg. 913 and questioned the students who saw the objects. They ordered photographs be taken but this was not possible since the objects had disappeared.

8. 0943 Students prepared their statements.

9. 1105 The complete report was submitted to Capt. Miracles, read by Lt. Col. Dunbar, and then handed to Sgt. Major Meek for typing.
