STATEMENT

On the 22nd May 1955, three other airmen and myself were on the Denver highway coming back to the base for bad check when our car went out of gas. We pulled to a stop on a hill. About 10 miles from Cheyenne. We stopped a car on the highway and we told two of the other airmen to go get gas while Airman ____ and myself stayed with the car between 2400 hours and 0100 hours. I looked out of the right front window and I saw a funny looking object it was shaped something like a pencil with a white light all around it. The object remained for about 10 seconds then it disappeared and about one minute later it was there again, then there was a flash of light and there were two of them they started moving skyward and then they were gone. As soon as they were out of sight suddenly in the area they disappeared from three were two cone shaped objects they had a sort of white color at first then changed to a blueish purple color at first. Then as they moved skyward they kept getting brighter and I could see them glittering then they were gone from sight. Airman Shephard and myself just looked at each other, and I said I guess we should report it, so at 0730 Monday morning 23 May 1955 we reported what happened to M/Sgt Francis J. Martin. We were coming back from Greely on route 85 when this all happened.
