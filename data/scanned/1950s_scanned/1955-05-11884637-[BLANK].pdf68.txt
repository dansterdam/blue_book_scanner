There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text appears to be providing definitions and explanations of different types of UFO sightings, such as "SINGLE OBSERVATION" and "MULTIPLE OBSERVATION", as well as details on how sightings were categorized and numbered for statistical analysis.

SINGLE OBSERVATION - A SIGHTING consisting of a single report from (1) one OBSERVER with no knowledge of additional OBSERVERS of the same phenomenon, or (2) a group of witnesses of the same phenomenon, each unaware of the other. The report made the report is called a SINGLE OBSERVER.

MULTIPLE OBSERVATION - A SIGHTING consisting of several reports from OBSERVERS of the same phenomenon who were cognizant of each other. The witnesses who made reports are called MULTIPLE OBSERVERS.

ALL SIGHTINGS - (1) The group of reports consisting of one report for each OBSERVER, including both SINGLE and MULTIPLE OBSERVERS. (2) The questionnaires, work sheets, and IBM card representing the report from each OBSERVER - in other words, the representation of each report in other words, the representation of each report in an other words, the representation of each report in other words, the representation of each report in other words, the representation of each report in

UNIT SIGHTINGS - (1) The group of reports consisting of one report for each SIGHTING, including all the reports of SINGLE OBSERVATIONS and the one most representative report from each MULTIPLE OBSERVATION. (2) The questionnaire, work sheet, and IBM card representing the report for each SIGHTING accepted for the statistical study.

A major serial number (four digits) was assigned to each sighting, segregating the year of occurrence by selection of limits for each year, as followed: 
0001 to 0500 reserved for 1947
0501 to 1000 reserved for 1948
1001 to 1500 reserved for 1949
1501 to 2000 reserved for 1950
2001 to 2500 reserved for 1951
2501 to 4900 reserved for 1952
