NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

CASE 10r Melbourne, Pla. 10 s 32 pm EST 1955
A reported bright light of unusual brightness was seen high in the sky over Melbourne, Fla. on 10 Nov 55. The object was first seen at about 10:32 pm EST and lasted for about 3 minutes. The observer was Miss Mary Holt, a resident of Melbourne, Fla. The object appeared to be moving from west to east at a very high rate of speed.
Miss Holt stated that the object appeared to be extremely bright and looked larger than a star or planet. The object appeared to flicker or blink at irregular intervals. Miss Holt called the attention of her mother, Mrs. M. Holt, who also witnessed the object. 
Mrs. M. Holt stated that the object appeared solid, circular in shape and was a bright metallic color, perhaps white or silver in color. The object moved rapidly and appeared to stop momentarily, then moved on at a high rate of speed, then stopped again momentarily. This sequence was repeated several times during the 3 minute observation period.  
The observers reported the object had no tail or exhaust and made no sound. After about 3 minutes the object disappeared from sight, apparently moving out of the observerD field of vision at a very high rate of speed. Neither observer was able to estimate the altitude or distance of the observed object.
