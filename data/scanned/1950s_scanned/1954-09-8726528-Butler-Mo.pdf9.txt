CASE FILE REVIEW:
Sightings in the U.S., Europe and Australia are continuing and will be covered in this case.

C-22, Rockford, 111...9/3/94) As they had done on many occasions, amateur astronomers, Peter Zager and Theodore McGown, were watching the Moon through a telescope. At about 10:05 P.M. CST they sighted an object which appeared to be about 12-15 feet in diameter. They observed it for about 1 minute and 15 seconds as it moved across the sky. They described it as round and "a brilliant white", and said the illumination from the object seemed to be coming from within it rather than reflected light. They estimated the speed of the object to be around 200-300 mph.

The drawings below are reproduced with the text. They illustrate the objects observed. McCaulley, through calculustimated the object to be 12.3/0 ft. in diameter.
