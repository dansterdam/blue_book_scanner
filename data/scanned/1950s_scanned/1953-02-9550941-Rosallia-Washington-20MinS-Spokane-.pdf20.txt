S-33 observer of 7707 was in flight in the vicinity of Spokane, Washington. Approximately 6:15 PM, PST. Observer was one of two pilots in the aircraft flying at 12,000 feet, which was moving at about 300 mph. The observer first noticed a bright light ahead of the aircraft which appeared to be at an altitude of 100 miles. The light seemed to be white with a red tinge to it. The aircraft approached the light, and the distance between the aircraft and light continued to decrease. Then the light departed at a speed which was estimated to be several thousand miles per hour, and it disappeared from sight in a few seconds. The occurrence was witnessed by both pilots, and it was an unusual occurrence.

Weather conditions at the time are described as excellent, with unusually good visibility.
