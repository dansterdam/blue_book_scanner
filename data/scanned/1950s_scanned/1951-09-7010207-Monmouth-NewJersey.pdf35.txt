1. Item listed in paragraph 1 of initial report from Pt. Monmouth were students, with the "top section of objects" that he had a knowledge of military aircraft and/or other technical matters exceeded past experience in any identification made. Further states observed carrying objects that were not similar to any observation ever made.

2. Item listed in paragraph 2, initial Pt. Monmouth report, was later identified as the reflections on water from airplane running lights.

3. Radar sets at Pt. Monmouth were in almost constant mechanical condition. However, the objects could not be distinguished on this radar and were more clear to the visual observation than to electronic surveillance and/or control.

4. It varies with paragraph 3, above, in fact that the Pt. Monmouth 1/0 called for action on the morning of 19 September asking if they had been tracking these unidentified objects and were advised negatively. But would not grand any further information although admitted the objects being there.
