MEMORANDUM REPORT TO Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

I, GRAHAM E. BETHUNE, was Co-Pilot on Flight 125 from Keflavik, Iceland to the Air Station, Patuxent on 9 February 1951. At 0052Z I sighted and observed the following object:

While flying in the left seat at 10,000 feet on a true course of 230 degrees at a position of 50 degrees 50 minutes N, 50 degrees 03 minutes W, I observed a glow of light below the horizon about 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the water. This glowing mass appeared suddenly, then was a thing suddenly, there was a twin bright light in the center of the glow. I called it to the attention of Lieutenant KINDON in the flight. He also saw the object for 40 to 50 seconds. I called it to the attention of Lieutenant JOHNSON in the flight. He was unable to see this send at roughly 20 to 40 miles away. I asked "What is it?" a ship. Lighted up or a city, I know of nothing that would light up over 250 miles out. We both observed its course and motion for about 4 or 5 minutes before calling it to the attention of the pilots.

The object was a glowing white mass, elongated in shape, and rapidly increased in size and altitude as though its speed was in excess of 1,500 miles per hour. Its attitude and size increased as though its speed was in excess of 1,500 miles per hour.

It seemed to close in on the aircraft and then dart away. In midair, at this time its angle changed and the color changed. It reversed its course and tripled its speed until it was at least seen disappearing over the horizon. Sudden changes in altitude and occasional disappearance over water indicated distances cover would be at least 300 feet in diameter, over 1,000 miles per hour.
