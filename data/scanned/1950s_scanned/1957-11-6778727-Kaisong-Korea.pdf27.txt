On 6 November 1957, at 0500Z, I was advised that a vast, great flash appeared unexpectedly in the eastern sky. It lasted about 10-15 seconds, and illuminated the whole countryside, giving the effect of broad daylight. This had the appearance of very intense lightning, but showed no characteristics of lightning - no noise, no thunder claps - whatsoever. 

The flash, which was estimated to have covered a vast area in the direction of northwest from this area, was followed by the appearance of a light, which appeared to be a very bright one, and which seemed to be "pulsating" - that is, it changed in intensity from bright to dim, and back again, at irregular intervals. This light did not move, remaining constant in relative position in the sky. It remained visible for approximately 30 minutes, when it suddenly disappeared. No other objects visible.
