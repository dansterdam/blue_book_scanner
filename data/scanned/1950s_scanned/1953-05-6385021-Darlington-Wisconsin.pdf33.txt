The image does not contain a photograph, it shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text of the document is as follows:

Report of J. A. Hynek
on the Darlington-Shullsburg sighting
31 May 1955

The nature of the newspaper and other reports including those obtained personally by telephone from two of the original observers led this investigator to believe that the incident was worthy of detailed investigation. The reports were conflicting, as evidenced, for instance, by the following excerpts:

"...an enormous blue-white light like a second moon."
"...it was suddenly getting brighter than usual."
"...like a balloon with an internal blue-white light."
"...it didn't look much bigger than a star. It seemed to waver, moving south a ways, then straight up, then south again."
"...as big as the moon."
"...it passed slightly to the south of Darlington, between us and the moon."
"...stayed in front of them, although they were going seventy miles an hour."
"...about the size of a grapefruit, traveling very high and almost due East."
"...prominent of light drifting westwardly."

It was felt by this investigator that if this case could be cleared up it might shed light on similar reports and particularly on the vagaries of the human element in reporting. Accordingly, this investigator and Lt. R. Olsson journeyed to Traux Field, Madison, Wis.
