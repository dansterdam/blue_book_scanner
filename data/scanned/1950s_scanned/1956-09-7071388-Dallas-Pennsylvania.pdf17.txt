Case 23-t W. Paul Sellin, Sept 22, 1956—Said the St. Paul, Minn., businessman and watchmaker, on returning home from Mendota and observing an object that crossed the sky, "It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. The object appeared about 40 feet wide and about 15 feet thick. As it passed over my head, I observed it had a dull silver color and in the bright sun was not reflecting any light. There was no sound or smoke or trail. It flew at a tremendous speed and simply vanished." Sellin estimated the object's speed at over 1,000 mph. The object was under observation about 30 seconds. Sellin was not the only witness for several others in the area made the same observation. This is just another of the growing reports of unidentified objects. 
p. — Chmn. Comm. for Collection of Material, APFRO, "objects and phenomena are not only one type flying, but of various construction... many of these will prove to be meteors, which accounts for the differences in observed characteristics."
