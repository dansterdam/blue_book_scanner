Transcription of the text from the document:

Greensboro, North Carolina
15 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
An AF-20 in flight over Greensboro sighted a silvery, round, spherical object with a clock-like luminous glow around the fuselage. The object was observed by the pilot on 15 December 1952 at approximately 7:35 p.m. The pilot was on a north heading at 25,000 feet traveling at 300 mph.

II. Discussion of Incident
The airforce show that AFB were in the area at the time of sighting as was a balloon released from the weather station at Greensboro. The pilot probably could have recognized the aircraft but a silvery, round, weather balloon might not be so easily recognized due to its small size. It appears that the latter explains the cause for this sighting. 

III. Conclusion
Probably a balloon.
