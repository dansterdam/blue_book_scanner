MEMO FOR Captain Hardin

Would you please send this man a questionnaire? I have made no reply to his letter.

Thanks

Lt White

We do not know of any special meteor which was seen on the date you mention, but records of these do not appear until later, in the magazines.

It might have been an ordinary airplane, perhaps; we cannot tell as well as you. There were no special meteor showers due on that date, but very often there are "spurious" meteors, that is, those not belonging to any particular shower, which fall and are seen, singly. Some of them are slowly moving objects; others move fast. We have seen them of the color you mention. We would mention that the height and distance, as witnessed, are quite deceptive; the objects are usually farther away than supposed.
