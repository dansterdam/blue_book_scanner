SUBJECT: (Confidential) Unconventional Type of Aircraft Sighted by
25 August 1951 - Albuquerque, New Mexico, at 2:25 Hours

TO:
Inspector General, USAF
17th District Office of Special Investigation
Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico

1. Reference is made to your Spot Intelligence Report of 27 August 1951, which indicates that this office or post you are forwarding has received information from the 17th District Office concerning an unidentified aircraft being sighted over Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 25 August 1951. Inasmuch as the District Office may not have a copy of this Spot Intelligence Report for your information, I am enclosing four photographs taken by me on 20 August 1951, which indicate the object he saw over Albuquerque on the night of 25 August 1951. If he does concur that this is what he saw, have him sketch in any other details that he may be able to give.

3. The Strategic Air Command has been contacted and they had no T-33 type aircraft in the area at the time. Northrop Aircraft Company has also been contacted and none of their flying wing bombers were flying.

4. It is suggested that the Flight Service Center for this area be contacted and questioned as to whether there were any unusual incidents on the night of 25 August 1951. It is believed that flight service centers occasionally make notes of unusual happenings and report unusual sightings according to regulations of CIVI15 (JANAP-146-A) and MATS.
