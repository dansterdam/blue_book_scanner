Transcription of the text in the document:

"At about 0245 on the morning of 8 August 1952, I was looking out of my bedroom window which faces South. I noticed a bright light in the sky approaching from the South. The light seemed to be moving fast and very high. It passed directly overhead and I watched it go from South to North. After it passed overhead, I timed its progress from South to North and the total time was 3 minutes later. This light appeared to be coming from the South to the North and was moving very fast, much faster than an aircraft. I observed it for a while after it went North but did not see it again after it disappeared from sight about 5 minutes later. This light appeared to be at a very high altitude, and from the West to East it seemed to be about 15 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate that this object was traveling at about 0345 hours. I observed it for a while after that, but did not see it again."

"I certify this data is true copy."
