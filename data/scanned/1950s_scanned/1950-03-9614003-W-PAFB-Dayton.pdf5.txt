SUBJECT: Cursory examination of such reports as have come to the attention of Hq USAF have generally confirmed the conclusions which were previously disseminated: the great majority of reports are believed to be of a rational and explainable nature. They do, however, reflect the continuing and widespread public and military interest in this phenomenon, and the desirability of having a centralized technical intelligence evaluation and collection effort for the collection of technical intelligence. These are being currently re-emphasized and continued.
