The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, with the text "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom of the page. The text in the document is as follows:

Since there was no rating derived by photo-analysis that would actually aid in identifying the object involved, this report is being sent to the Information Laboratory of WADS for further analysis. Until the report is returned from WADS, this incident will be carried by Project Blue Book as unknown.
