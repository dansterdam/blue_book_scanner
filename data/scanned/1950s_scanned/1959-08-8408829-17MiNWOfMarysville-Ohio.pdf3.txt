5. Examination of this glass by T/Sgt Charles E. Robinson, 376th armament and electronics squadron, reveals the following information:

"This item appears to be a water house stop that could be used in conjunction with the G-2 radar recording Camera or the C-22 radar recording camera. These types of mounts are not used with this type of equipment, therefore the amount of glass passing through and exposing the film to be varied. This would be extremely wasteful of film in high altitude, high speed aircraft if used for taking photographs in conjunction with a bombing system."

6. The carbonization of the glass and apparent melting of the glass may have been caused by air friction as would be generated by extremely high speed aircraft or by a free fall from extreme altitudes.

7. Personnel at North American air Division informed us that they had no photos of this type of aircraft in the area at that time. Aircraft of this type were equipped with this type of equipment.

8. Colonel Vidunak (telephone 52204), when contacted at Wright Patterson AFB, advised that the glass be forwarded for further examination.

9. It is requested that a copy of the results of your determination as to the source of this falling object be forwarded to this station in order that a letter of appreciation may be forwarded to the finder.

In formation for a follow-up story and at the same time a desire to publish the results of this examination is to be followed in the event further objects should be found or have already been found but not reported.
