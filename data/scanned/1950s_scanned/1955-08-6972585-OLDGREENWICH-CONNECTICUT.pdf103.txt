This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text describes an apparent UFO sighting, providing details about the object's appearance and the witnesses' experiences.

The text states that the object had "eyes like saucers, large, and set about 3 to 4 inches apart" and that "they seemed to be small men or midgets around the side of the face". It mentions that the object "seemed to be pointed at the top" and that the witnesses "progressed to the body" but could not determine if it was a neck or not. The text also describes the witnesses' reactions and their subsequent agreement that there was no neck.

IT WASN'T TOO LONG BEFORE THE APPARITION BEGAN TO TAKE FORM....
THE EYES LIKE SAUCERS, LARGE, AND SET ABOUT 3 TO 4 INCHES APART. THEY 
SEEMED TO BE SMALL MEN OR MIDGETS AROUND THE SIDE OF THE FACE. THE HANDS...FLABBY, 
LIKE A PIECE OF LEATHER....THEY SEEMED TO BE POINTED AT THE TOP...
AND THEY WERE TOO BIG.....(THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS DESCRIBED). THE HEAD
SEEMED TO BE CIRCULAR...COMPLETELY BALD ON TOP...AND THE FEATURES, 
SUCH AS THE EYES AND EARS WERE NOT PLACE ON THE HEAD AS WE MIGHT 
EXPECT THEM TO BE. WE PROGRESSED TO THE BODY....NO ONE WAS SURE 
WHETHER THERE WAS A NECK OR NOT...SO WE LEFT IT OUT. (LATER...
WHEN THE THREE MEN CAME BACK FROM INDIANA, THEY ALL AGREED THAT
THERE WAS NO NECK)(THIS EYE THE WAS WAS NOT ASKED FOR EITHER...IT
WAS A VOLUNTARY ADMISSION BY ALL THREE IN THEIR DESCRIPTION). THE 
BODY, ACCORDING TO THE WITNESSES, WAS QUITE BIG AND SPLENDIDLY MADE AND
LEGS AND A FORMLESS STICKING WOULD SEEM TO BE KICKING. 
THEY WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LONG AS THE LEGS, AND ALMOST TOUCHED THE
GROUND WHERE THE FEET WOULD BE. THE HANDS WERE HUGE, FULLY LOOKING
TWICE, WITH TALONS THAT CURLED...SEVERAL INCHES LONG...IN PLACE OF
FINGERNAILS. AFTER THE BASIC FORM WAS SKETCHED, AND THE HEAD ASKED
TO THE TOP OF IT, MENTIONED THAT IT WAS SO LIKE THE
APPARITION SHE SAW....SHE WAS NOT GOING TO LOOK AT IT ANY LONGER...
AND IT SEEMED TO GO OVERHEAD....WILL REMEMBER...IF EVER ANYONE
BRINGS STAYED ON INSIDE TO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE
DRAWING. THE ONLY PART OF THE FACE THAT NO ONE COULD DESCRIBE WAS
THE NOSE....MAINLY BECAUSE THEY ALL AGREED THE HUGE EYES WERE
TREMENDOUSLY FASCINATING, AND DREW THEIR ATTENTION TO THAT RATHER
THAN OTHER FEATURES. I ATTEMPTED TO SKETCH A NOSE IN, THEY SEEMED TO AGREE
IT MIGHT HAVE HAD ONE, BUT NONE WERE SURE...SO WE REMOVED IT.
