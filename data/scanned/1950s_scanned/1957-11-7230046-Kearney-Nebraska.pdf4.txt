COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. SOURCE was δ asked to indicate when fifteen seconds had elapsed. He es-
timed the time arier Coxi five seconds hod elapsed. SOURCE estimated 1,00-yard~
to be equivalent to 1500 feet. SOURCE estimate of the width of the underst
was accurate.

. Investigators arrive to interview the SOURCE after he had been subject
to al-night questioning by city officials and newsmen. The SOURCE thus had ample
time to firmly establish in his mind time answers no practically all questions which
the investigators could conceivably ask. The above facts notwithstanding, that
SO’.JRCES ready answers to all questions, particularly those which concerned minute
details, detracted rather than lent authenticity to his story. SC TG ilate: to
training in observation which would have allowed him to re! Cen such fato as
style of necklace the women were wearing. SOURCE admitted difficulty in different—
entwisting blues, grays and brown-, and although he stated his vision wo: W-20,
he wore glasses.

3. The facts that no supporting physical evidence (othen thay the ail spat
which is viewed with sus1pici ) could be derived; his record own his toe
detailed account of the incident; and hi eft lead the prepsr-
officer to conclude that the incident has no basis in fact, and that the SOURCi
suffered a hallucination as evidenced from the investigators! observations that
7! actually came to believe that he had witnessed the object.
