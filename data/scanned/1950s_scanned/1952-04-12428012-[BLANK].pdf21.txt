American and British developments have been about parallel.

Both have gone from centrifugal flow to axial flow compressors, to performance augmentation by use of afterburners and other devices, to improved operations at ever higher altitudes. The Soviets have apparently followed much the same trend. They are now developing engines of upwards of ten thousand pounds thrust, and they have at least one, the Lyulka, that is rated at eleven thousand five hundred. And we have every reason to believe that their development program is continuing at a rapid pace.

There is no indication, however, of any radically new principles in jet propulsion that would account for the reported behavior of some of the unidentified objects as to maneuverability and acceleration rates.

______________ will take over again now.
