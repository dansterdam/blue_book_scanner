The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that discusses interrogation forms and future work related to UFO sighting reports.

The text in the document is as follows:

In conclusion, it was the opinion of Dr. Hynek that little was gained by attendance at the meeting. The results were negative in the sense that it was confirmed, as Dr. Hynek already believed, that Drs. Liddell and Menzel had not studied the literature and the evidence and, hence, were not qualified to speak with authority on the subject of recent sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.

An attempt to arrange a meeting by Dr. Hynek with Dr. Menzel, Dr. Liddell, and Dr. Billings, after the meeting was over, was unsuccessful because Liddell and Billings both had to leave immediately after the meeting.

INTERROGATION FORMS
Five hundred copies of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" (Form A and Form B) were delivered on October 20, 1952. This questionnaire was used in place of the "Tentative Observers Data Sheet" to record data on all sighting reports dated after March 31, 1952. It has proved to be more satisfactory than the previous form, especially from the standpoint of recording data from sighting reports in greater detail.

Additional copies of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" can be supplied to UFAPB as needed.

FUTURE WORK
Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports will continue. A preliminary analysis of data on all sighting reports dated previous to 1952 will be given to UFAPB as soon as possible after evaluation is completed of the 1947 and 1948 sighting reports.
