Dec. 4, 1953

Sir;

Subject: "Flying Saucers"

While P.E. Kaylor's book, Flying Saucers from
Outer Space, lists in his appendix, a "Form A, U.S.
Air Force Technical Information Sheet" I wish to
request a copy of this form.

Do not claim to have seen a "Flying Saucer"
but if you are interested will report a fireball,
seen in broad light in the Adirondacks
some time ago. Inquiry regarding same
was made at the time to the Hayden
Planetarium - they had no report at the
time of fireballs. Thought it meteoric.
Was seen near midnight wouldn't venture
guess as to its altitude but wouldn't say
it was at great altitude. Will fill out
your form to best of my ability.
Air Force can evaluate it, I have no opinion,
will report only what I saw.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

Jamaica 35, N.Y.
