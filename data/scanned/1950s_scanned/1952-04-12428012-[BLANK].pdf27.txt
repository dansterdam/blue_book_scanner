ANALYSIS

And now, what do we do with the information when we get it?
Well, we make record of it, of course. We have a cross-index system
of filing now in use. And we plot sightings on maps, in different
ways and for different purposes, as I'll show you in a moment.
And then when we have the information organized as well as possible,
we begin the analysis.

It is here that we call upon the varied talents of a considerable
number of other people and other activities. The problem is passed
around, so to speak, within the entire ATIC organization for everybody
to have a crack at it. And since the Air Technical Intelligence
Center does have a considerable number of highly qualified personnel
in almost any given field relating to aircraft, the problem gets
a pretty good going-over right here within our own organization.

We donâ€™t stop there, however. You will recall that when the
early history of the investigation was discussed, you were told of
the scientific advisors employed. The same thing is being done
