Mrs.

Dear Mrs. 

In reply to your recent request, you will find enclosed a copy of the August 20, 1957 issue of the Weekly Market Bulletin which contains a report on the Flying Saucer Conference held in Dunbarton, N.H. to be held on August 27 at 1 p.m.

This is the only auction listed in Dunbarton during the three months mentioned in your letter and we trust it is the one to which you referred.

Yours very truly,
Clement A. Lyon, Director
Bureau of Markets
