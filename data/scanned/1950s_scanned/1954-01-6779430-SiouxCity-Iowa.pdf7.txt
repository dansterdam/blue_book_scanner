Dear Sir:

I has come to my attention that around 2:10 4 January, 1954 (0213) unidentified objects were sighted over the vicinty of Sioux City, Iowa, USA. These objects were observed for four consecutive hours, apparently in pursuit of a U.P.O./U.A.O. over Sioux City, Iowa. 

It is my objective to learn the reason for this surveillance. Were these objects set craft in pursuit of a U.P.O./U.A.O.? If so, can you inform me of the circumstances; location, direction, speed, color, and possible identification, including speed.

If, for any reason, you cannot give me the requested information for classification/security restrictions, please forward this missive to the proper authorities.

Thank you for your kind cooperation in this matter.

President
