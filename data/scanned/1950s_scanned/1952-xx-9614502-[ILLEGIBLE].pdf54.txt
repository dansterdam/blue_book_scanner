There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a written description of an observed object that the observer refers to as a "wire ball".

The text in the document is as follows:

DESCRIPTION: The object was "spherical" (an unusual shape) and had a third dimension. The size was about 4 the size of the moon in the field of view. The color was blue-white and the object was in the same field of view as the daylight fluorescent tubes. Only one object was observed. The object traversed about 15 degrees of arc and the sparks trailing from the object traversed about 10 degrees of arc parallel to the horizon. The observer described the object as first appearing as a "ball" and then becoming "like an exploded skyrocket" with sparks emanating from it before the sparks burned out and the object disappeared. The duration of the sighting was about 10-30 seconds.
