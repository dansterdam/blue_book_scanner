SUBJECT: Unconventional Aircraft at Cornersville, Virginia, on 19 July 1952 SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO: Commanding Officer
Headquarters Command USAF
Bolling Air Force Base
Washington 25, D.C.
ATTN: Director of Intelligence

1. This is to confirm the telephone call made to the Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, by an agent of this office on 23 July 1952. In this telephone call, information was relayed which was received from Special Agent FRANCIS B. LOLIVETTE of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

2. According to Special Agent LOLIVETTE, two (2) former Air Force military policemen, WILLIAM C. ADAMS and MACK JONES, Roanoke, Virginia, were traveling on Highway 221 near Centersville, Virginia, early in the morning of 19 July 1952. While traveling, their mobile (which is owned by ADAMS) was struck by an object which apparently fell from the automobile ahead of them. This object left marks on the automobile and had a metallic appearance. The object was of an unusual size, shape, and significance, giving rise to speculation at the time, and a local investigation showed that it fell from the unusual type of aircraft. Upon arriving in Washington, they heard about the unconventional type of aircraft supposedly monitored whatever the object which hit their car had fallen from such aircraft. They have compared this incident to several previous threats of irregular activities, and they are keeping this matter under close surveillance for examination.

3. This office is referring this matter to you for whatever action you might deem appropriate. The Office of Special Investigations is not taking any further action.
