Here is a detailed account of a visual observation of an aerial object that occurred on April 17, 1959 around 10:30 PM near Coburn, Virginia. The observer reported seeing a light that appeared to be round in shape and stationary in the sky. After a few minutes, the light began to move in an erratic manner, making a series of abrupt turns and changes in speed. The light then appeared to split into two separate lights that continued to move in an unusual manner before finally disappearing from view. The observer stated that the lights displayed no visible means of propulsion and made no sound. The entire incident lasted approximately 10-15 minutes.
