SWORN STATEMENT

I, Captain USAF, **** 135th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn statement:

On 23 May 1952 at 1600 hours, a shiny airborne object was called to my attention. This object was approximately 260 degrees from KAFB, appeared to be heading west and was approximately 3,000 feet above the terrain. It appeared to be 15â€“20 miles from KAFB and because of this distance no definite shape could be determined. However, because of the reflections, which were continuous, the surface could have been aluminum.

This was called to the attention of the Gladwin Senior Director who had already received instructions from the Chief Controller at ADC to investigate. This object remained in sight about 40 minutes during which time an Idaho flight, which was airborne, was diverted to investigate. Since we had no radar contact with the object, the direction of the Idaho aircraft was based on ground observation. A land line was run from the observer to the dais at Gladwin ATC.

Despite the fact that the Idaho aircraft was dead reckoned and directed to the position with relation to a cloud bank, the interception of this object was not successful. After about 25 minutes the Idaho flight, low on fuel, returned to KAFB for Pancake.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 27th day of May 1952
