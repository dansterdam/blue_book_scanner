Atlantic Ocean

Dear Sir:

Would you please send me the following information:

Why is the flying saucer scare? 

On February 3, 1953, a young transport aircraft with three-stars personnel on board, vanished over the Atlantic area. It went through a cloud and never came out (please explain).

Thank-You

N. Hollywood, California
