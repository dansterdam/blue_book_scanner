REPORT NO.: 2A-INT 09-3-55
PAGE: 5 of 5 PAGES

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
1. It is the opinion of the preparing investigator that the sighting was a star or planet for the following reasons:
a. Could not produce the effect of the green and red lights. One observer saw a steady green light with a flashing red. The other observed a flashing green and red with no steady interval.
b. No lack of or almost lack of motion could be explained by the earth's rotation.
2. The investigation discovered no balloon nor astronomical activity that would account for the sighting.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:  
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was astronomical in nature, probably caused by a star or combination of stars for the reasons listed above coupled with the fact that the objects were seen for a period of five successive nights.
