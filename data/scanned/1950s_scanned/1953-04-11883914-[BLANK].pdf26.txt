EXHIBIT I. TENTATIVE OBSERVER'S DATA SHEET (Continued)

21. In your own words please describe the sighting you observed. Use sketches if desired. All observations from the time of first sighting to the time of disappearance are important. Include a description of the weather, wind, and cloud conditions at the time of this sighting.

at 1850 hours, 8 November, 1948, I was standing just outside hangar No. 7 at the Newark Air Force Base, on the south side of the hangar. It was a perfectly clear night. I looked up toward the moon and noticed a pale luminous object race across the sky. It was about 1/3 the brightness of the moon, round like a disc, with little or no depth (thickness) to it. It appeared to be about the same relative diameter as the moon. It traveled from north northwest in an arc toward the south southwest in about one second or less, passing out of sight over another hangar. I heard no sound from the object. I estimate the speed of the object at 800 miles per hour, and its altitude at five to six thousand feet. I have seen jet aircraft make radical approaches at this field at approximately 600 miles per hour, and judging from them, the speed of the object I sighted was at least 200 miles an hour faster. From where I stood, I could see approximately 75 per cent of the path of the object. The peak of its arc was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon to the west southwest of my position.
