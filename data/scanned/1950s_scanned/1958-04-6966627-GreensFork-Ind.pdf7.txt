Dear Sir:

Please forgive me for the previous letter. You know I have been trying to get something constructive could be gotten from a ground survey, but it just is not to be.

Ten after ten after ten of the stuff is laying around or being sent for a variety of things.

The largest particles that I have seen in the valley north of Newcastle. Large particles are also at the top of the hill on Spiceland. I can tell this by the path of the small body. Our tail man recalls seeing something of the same general direction, some 40 years ago. This is and the fact that particles remain a mystery. A specimen or the mass, causes me to think that part of it is still in some kind of an orbit.

At first I was only interested in finding a meteor, however the more that I study it, well, I part of or get a bang out of it.

If you are interested at any time, you are welcome to examine any of the particles that I have collected. Again please forgive me for the previous letter.

Indiana
