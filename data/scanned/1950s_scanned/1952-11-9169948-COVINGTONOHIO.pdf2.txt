This page of the old Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a technical information sheet filled out by an ATIC Duty Officer regarding a report of a "brilliant blueish light in the sky" observed by a person in Covington, Ohio.

The text in the document is as follows:

ATIC Duty Officer received call at 10:15 on 9 May 52 from Dr. George A. Falkner, phone 34, Covington Ohio, said that he was observing a brilliant blueish light in the sky in a north-westerly direction from his home, which is located on Route 48, just west of Covington, Ohio. The light seemed to have a bobbing motion but he wouldn't venture to estimate its distance from his house. He said that he has viewed the same light at least 6 times in the past two months. Also he said that it appeared to be in the same location each time. Other people in the same neighborhood who have also viewed the light in the past are Mr. and Mrs. Pearl Etter.

ATIC Duty Officer called Patterson Operations. Dr. Falkner, Dispatcher, after hearing report, replied that a B-29 was flying in that area, north-west of VMP AFB and that it was testing photo equipment at all altitudes.
