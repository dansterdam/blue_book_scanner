Meek Air Attacks
Start Rumors Of
Flying Saucers
DETROIT, July 15 (UP) - The Air Force has no explanation for the recent appearance of numerous jet fighters over Michigan cities, an air force spokesman said they were merely 'on routine training missions'.

However, the spokesman denied the flying saucers theory. He said the F-86s were 'simply tactical training flights', but some Detroit residents insist they were chasing unidentified flying objects.
They said the jet fighters were flying in formation and seemed to 'attack' something in the air.

A Detroit journal-Herald reporter said he had talked with residents who said they saw the bright lights of jet fighters 'pursuing a rapidly moving object in the sky'.
He said the residents interpreted this as 'jet fighters attacking flying saucers'.
