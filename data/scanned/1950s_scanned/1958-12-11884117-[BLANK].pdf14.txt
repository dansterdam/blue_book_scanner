Specifically we would like to make maximum use of CRT aircraft and crews for delivery and pick up of an occasional 1-2 investigators to Air Force installations in the ZI. Under AFR 200-2 the AF installation nearest the point of UFO sighting will provide further support required from there.

4. Past experience has shown that the bulk of our most critical sightings have taken place in the Northeast portion of the United States. It is envisioned that a maximum of 50 delivery and pick-up flights would occur during any given year or roughly four per month. Distances should normally not exceed 6-800 miles each way.

5. We have tentatively established a project nick-named "Horse Fly" which will have to do with movement of investigators to and from points of interest. That nick-name would be used in any request for military CRT aircraft associated with UFO investigations.

6. With your concurrence I would like very much to have Colonel L. T. Glaser of our Air Science Division brief you further on the needs of our UFO program. This we will do at your convenience. After such a briefing I would be interested in knowing your views relative to amount and priority of support we may expect to obtain through the local CRT media.
