(1) Shape: Elliptical
Size: In length they were about two (2) widths of observer's little
finger, viewed at arms length. The width was about equal to
the width of 1/8" diameter wire held at arms length.
Color: Light green or like tinted white, no glow.
Number: Three
Maneuvers: Horizontal Inverted V
Formation: One object, first appearing circular, turned 180° on its
axis, so as to appear elliptical, then moved up and over
the other two objects to a lower position in the forma-
tion. This position was held for a short time and the
highest object ( the original spot of the inverted "V")
appeared to turn on its axis 180°, changing from circu-
lar to elliptical, then ascended rapidly, fading from
view. The remaining two (2) objects turned in a like
manner, and followed the first ascending object. The ob-
server counted to twenty-nine (29) (approximately 29 sec-
onds) during the time the first object ascended and the
last one moved to follow.
Manner of Disappearance: Objects went straight up until they could
no longer be seen.
Other unusual Features: Only one side of each object seemed to be
irradiant.
