AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
ATTN: Office, D/F FSAD
2. Preliminary analysis by Mr. Hahn to Headquarters, 20th Air Force.
I. SUBJECT: Unidentified Object tracked and reported by site #51.
II. DETAILS: The Unidentified Object was tracked and reported by site #51. Additional details were obtained from all personnel concerned during debriefing at Kadena, Okinawa.
III. ANALYSIS: The characteristics of the Unidentified Object and the analysis of these facts are as follows:
1. Radar observation: The object was observed by CPS-6B radar for a distance of 3 miles, which is located at 26*33'N, 127*57'E, a few miles North of Kadena, Okinawa.
2. Track was made on the high beam of the CPS-6B radar for a distance of 27 miles. The object was traveling at an average speed of approximately 1,850 mph and increased range to 152 miles and disappeared from the high beam. The total distance traveled by the object was calculated to be 97 miles.
3. The time of travel from the closest point to the object until it disappeared was 2 minutes. The distance traveled was calculated thus: 27 + 70 = 97 miles. The speed of the object was calculated for the 50 miles in 2 minutes to be 1,500 mph.
4. The antenna speed of the object was calculated to be 520 miles per hour.
5. The radar scope showed the object was illuminated for 2 minutes. The distance traveled was calculated thus: 50 miles in 2 minutes is 1,500 miles per hour. This calculation appears correct.
at 15*. The antenna speed was that: The antenna was timed and established to be rotating at 15 rps.
1. All of the electronic characteristics are known of the intercepting radar.
The interrogator-responsor time was 1/1000 sec. The band was 10 cm, and the pulse rate was 600 pps.
2. The blip displayed on the face of the 12" was unusually large and contained no modulation, thus establishing the width of the object.
3. The condition was that the normal movement of the blip, thus establishing the width of the object.
HIGH BEAM:
The high beam operator states the scope presentation showed a blip which would indicate an altitude of approximately 60,000 to 70,000 feet. It is accepted in this report that the object was changing elevation and range as well as speed.
The radar high beam has a beam width of .8 degree at the half-power point; thus at 60,000 feet, the beam width would be 840 yards (1/2 mile) wide, and at 70,000 feet, the beam width would be 980 yards (1/2 mile) wide. The blip observed on the high beam scope was 1/2 mile in width, which correlates with the calculated beam width.
