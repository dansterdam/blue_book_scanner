'Zooming Up'
An ex-convict's story of a chat with "spacemen" was reported by the Indianapolis Star on November 7, 1957. The article states that the ex-convict claimed to have encountered "spacemen" who were "friendly" and said his car battery went dead Wednesday and he looked for help. The article also mentions other reports of strange sky objects, including one from a man in California who claimed to have seen a large white vapor trail shooting from the ground to the sky.
