The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text discussing conclusions about UFO sightings and the need for further investigation and measurements.

the noise that was reported by the witnesses even though it was also subjected to the same type of vibrations.

We are informed, dealing with two types of apparatus that are similar in form and size, and in there managiability but different in "mechanical" manifestation as although they apparently are similar, they are both silenced by means of some sort of a special device that utilized the magnetic field.

Conclusions:
No nation on the earth has aircraft that are silent in maneuvers and silenced by a power system and, therefore, it is likely incontrovertible that these apparatus come from another world. On the other hand, the new types of apparatus that have begun to be manifested in a singular manner let one suppose that other apparatus of this type will soon appear. It will, therefore, be indispensable that the witnesses that should observe these "phenomenons" not hesitate in informing and placing themselves in touch with police stations or our Investigational Bureau, or the press.

Note:
A new magnetic examination was conducted by D. Pages one month after the investigation, and the examination by Jimmy Guieu. This indeed exposed the fact that metallic posts had an inverse rate/ magnetism. The almost exact same as in Vins one can ask whether or not the proximity of the apparatus can possibly cause the apparatus that are near to be temporarily neutralized in relation to their normal state and yet cause others to be modified or increased? Periodical measurements will be conducted on these pieces of fence in order to establish their eventual magnetism.
