CANADA, CONNECTICUT

LAST NIGHT A ROUND OBJECT WAS OBSERVED - A BRIGHT LIGHT, ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE DIAMETER OF THE FULL MOON, WHICH TRAVELLED AT VARIOUS SPEEDS AND ALTITUDES. IT APPEARED TO HAVE A TRAILING YELLOW LIGHT BEHIND IT. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES AND THEN APPEARED TO DESCEND BEHIND SOME TREES. IT GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF A BALLOON, BUT INCREASED SPEED AND ALTERED COURSE AT TIMES IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH A BALLOON. WHEN IT LANDED, IT DISAPPEARED. THE WITNESS STATED THAT HE HAS HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH AIRCRAFT AND BALLOONS AND IS CONVINCED THIS WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR BALLOON.

THE OBJECT APPEARED ROUND AND WAS HIGHLY REFLECTIVE, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE EDGES. IT APPEARED TO MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT TIMES AND THEN WOULD ABRUPTLY CHANGE DIRECTION. ITS SPEED VARIED FROM VERY SLOW TO EXTREMELY FAST. THE WITNESS HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FLIGHT OR WHAT IT WAS, BUT DISCLAIMED ANY INNER KNOWLEDGE OR SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SIGHTING.
