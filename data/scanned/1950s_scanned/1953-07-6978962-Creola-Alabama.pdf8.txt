Dear Capt. Harding:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just now managed to get to your letter of 27 July which enclosed the various reports. My study of these unrelated reports may not say that compared with Black Hawk, none of these approaches its interest. There are a few interesting sightings, but on none of these is the information sufficient to make a follow-up practicable.

Of the interesting ones, the very similar sightings of 24 July and 1 August at Cody, Wyoming, followed up 11 days later, were more recent with present information. I have no suggested explanation.

The 26 July sightings also show possible interest from the standpoint of time and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by aircraft.

It is too bad there is not more information on Creola, Ala. These cases cover four or more days, but there is possibly pay dirt in these.

Finally, the Stillman sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably have to remain unexplained. 

As for the remaining 30 or so, there is so little information concerning some of these which do not have obvious explanations that there is no purpose to be served in considering them further.

Thus, out of the total number there are 8 independent acts which, if staff and time were available, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I vote for sticking with the Black Hawk case until we have squeezed it dry.

Concerning the Black Hawk case, we are proceeding slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence, and considerable foreign interest has been aroused. I will let you know of progress, and a preliminary report is planned on this case for you soon.
