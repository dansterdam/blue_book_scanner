At 5:00 a.m. on 7 October, S.J. was standing in front of his church at Kisalon, Mindanao and saw a light approach from the Southeast. As the object moved closer, it became torpedo-shaped with four trails of flame. It separated into two parts and disappeared. Several people saw the object, and the people of a village on a ridge along which the object had passed were awakened by some unknown noises.

This sighting was recommended for an area of 30 miles around the point of observation. Low clouds and severe turbulence prevented adequate observation of the area in question. This area is extremely rough and peopled by unfriendly tribes. Philippine agencies were contacted and they promised to send in teams to question local people and search for debris.
