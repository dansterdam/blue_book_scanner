The text in the handwritten description states:
"The sky was steadily covered by clouds when suddenly a light was observed, brightly shining against the black background of the clouds. This light was traveling at a high rate of speed and made no sound. It traveled in a straight line and disappeared over the horizon. The observation lasted only a few minutes while the object was in sight."
