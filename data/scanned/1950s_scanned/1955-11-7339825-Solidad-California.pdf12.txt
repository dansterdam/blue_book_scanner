It was a bright moonlight night, cold, dry, windles and cloudless, with many OBSERVERS. The object was seen, hovering, and was observed for some 15 minutes. At times, occasionally, the object appeared to stall or slower down, and appeared almost as the color of fire (yellow, orange, red and blue), when viewed through binoculars (7X). It disappeared through the horizon after about one hour of observation.
NONE OF THE SOURCES WERE SPECTACULAR, AND ALL OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE FROM AN UNOBSTRUCTED, UNILLUMINED PLATFORM.
