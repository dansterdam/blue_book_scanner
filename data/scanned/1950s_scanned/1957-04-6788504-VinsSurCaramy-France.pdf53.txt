There does not appear to be any photograph present in the shared image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a text document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Plate 4 -- To the left -- The view that was taken from the window of Mr. ---, apparently was toward some hows here in the field of the projectoy and the three "small men". The distance from the window to the area does not appear to be much more than 60 meters. The high truck was with some bushes below
them. It would have been impossible to take good pictures, let one eventually remember the place what occurs so that no confusion is happened.

To the right -- Next to our General Secretary and the dotted white lines were present. The notes of Mr. [redacted]'s account are the subject of his observation and the surrounding area. These marks were well worn over a period of time and are pronouncedly not quite so noticeable as they have been smoothed out but one of them still bears a distinct tire mark of the automobile that passed that night. To the right we see the transmission field in the background.

To the right -- View that was taken from the highway but in the opposite direction. There one sees the high house of Mr. [redacted]. The arrow indicates the area of the field where the "object" was stopped and Mr. [redacted] saw from their windows to the right of the arrow one sees the cafeteria. This all occurred at 3:00 P.M. one night.
