There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a "DISPOSITION FORM" related to a conversation with an individual regarding observations of the moon.

FILE NO.                       SUBJECT: Conversation With Mr. Hasen Regarding report on the Moan
67-13-58                        DATE: 21 november 1958 COMMENT HO.: 70307/Bldg 228/Room 2103

During his recent visit to Washington, I was asked by Colonel McDavis to talk to Mr. General Watson, who had been making numerous phone calls regarding unidentified objects on the moon.

To go back, this same man is responsible for the development of a device which might be used by the Air Force people to navigate in the moon. According to information which he has collected, & photo "which might be of interest to the Intelligence Community." He visited me on the 21st instant and explained that these photographs were apparently explained away as a "cracked telescopic lens" and that this photos were not of interest to the Intelligence Community. He thinks, as a matter of fact, that these photos are of objects which are different from the moon. He says he has been trying, without success, to get some authoritative opinion on the subject of ionic or sonic propulsion. I am not sure if the reflection he mentioned was due to ionic or sonic propulsion. He refers specifically to the articles which are appearing in the newspapers now, warning people about flying saucers from the moon. He thinks that these are not saucers but merely things like "heat-waves from the moon."

I could concern whether your UFO or Science Division can give me some real data it might help determine whether this man bona fide or just another of those who want to stir up trouble. Any information or suggestion from your shop will be appreciated, as I was instructed to look into this matter on the next visit, and I asked to be notified the names of any visiting people from your shop.
