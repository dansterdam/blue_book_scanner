The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

An earlier sighting was brought to light by the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena in Washington, D.C. when it uncovered a 1957 "Hidden UFO Report", which had been reported to Otis Air Force Base on October 12, 1957. A strange round object, described as resembling a "flaming orange-red sphere", approached a fishing boats Atlantic and Bear and the Sport Fisherman near Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The UFO traveled at a "great rate" of speed.

The object, as seen through binoculars, appeared to be a sphere with sensing elements or spikes protruding from it. The time of the "spikes" were red. Several weeks later on November 4, an object described as a "sphere with fins" surrounding it was sighted from Cathedral City, California.

The Massachusetts sighting was turned in by three members of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution-based fishing boat Atlantic, Captain of the fishing boat Bear, and Captain of the Sport Fisherman. With these were two fliers from Charleston, South Carolina, one an Air Force jet pilot. All five men were aboard the Sport Fisherman.
