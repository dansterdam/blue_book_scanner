RESEARCH INVESTIGATION ANALYSIS

INTERPLANETARY INTELLIGENCE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA. December 28, 1964

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr. FTD (ITEW) Box 9043 Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Thank you for your two most recent letters in answer to my request. I hope your Christmas was a happy one.

I still have not heard from Dr. ____. I will let you know as soon as I do. Enclosed is the copy that was made from the 16 mm movie that I will send me. Please return as soon as possible because I will need it on January 12. Imamu (giving a lecture to about 75 sorority members (and husbands)) Free, all I will do is may be some members. I thought you might like to see the film for your records.

On November 9, I sent you several fragments believed to be a meteorite that I received from the Lickartid Science-tarium along with the information I had. Did you send the fragment to Dr. ____ at NASA, or to Dr. ____? Dr. ____ has the original 23 pound part and I forwarded several fragments to Dr. _____. In your letter of 11 December you suggested that you can analyze any special policy forward. I do not understand one or two of your sentences. I also suggested that samples of these fragments, as there is a possibility that they are meteorites or tektites indicated by Dr. ___, be sent to Dr. ____. Have you corresponded with Dr. ____ on this? Dr. ____ in a letter to the Planetarium stated that he believes the fragments to be meteorites or tektites. He theorized his conclusion eliminated the claimâ€™s belief is tektites, but in letter from Dr. ____ dated December he states the fragments appears to be of ordinary serpentine basalt rock, and not to release any information on it.

I am looking forward to the new Fact Sheet.

Would it be possible to obtain a copy of the letter dated September 23, 1947 and the list of 69 active organizations?
