In physical appearance with that of the first object, followed the same course of sighting, gaining in brightness and taking on a more round or elliptical shape. The seeming disappearance of the first object was the cause for noticing the second object.

a. GAYVR's residence is located approximately one (1) mile northwest of the center of Belfast, Maine, and is across the city of Belfast, Maine, and is approximately 1/2 mile from the harbor.

b. At 1930 hours on 5 August 1952, the sky was overcast, and visibility was limited somewhat by a drizzle. Both this sighting was reported over the harbor just north of the city of Belfast, Maine.

JACKSON advised that he and his wife observed the phenomenon of two unidentified flying objects from their residence just north of the city of Belfast, Maine, which are docked and anchored in the harbor just north of the city of Belfast, Maine, and it is not unusual for searchlights to be reflected against the clouds.

JACKSON advised that GAYVR, a person who has been described as reliable, claimed that the lights seen by him appeared to be larger than the searchlights, and that no reports of other persons having observed unusual objects in the sky had been received.
