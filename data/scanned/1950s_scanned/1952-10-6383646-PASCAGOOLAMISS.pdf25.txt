The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions for sketching the movement of an observed object. The diagram shows the overhead view of the horizon with the observer's position marked.

The text found in the document is as follows:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead
Horizon                  Horizon
          You

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
