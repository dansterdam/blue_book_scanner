There is no photograph present in this image from the Project Blue Book document. The image contains text describing the movement and appearance of an unidentified object observed for about 30 seconds. The text states that the object stopped in the sky, slowly grew smaller, became vague in shape, then faded out completely over a period of 5 to 10 seconds. It also mentions that the moon was not in the same direction or height as the object, and that the movement of the object was almost the opposite of the wind direction at the time.

This movement took about 30 seconds.
It stopped in the S.E., slowly grew smaller, as if moving away; became very vague in shape, then faded out completely. This fading out process took between 5 and 10 seconds.
Shortly before and sometime after observing the object I saw the moon.
The moon was not in the same direction as the object, was not at the same height above the horizon, and did not have the same shape or color.
The direction of the movement of the object was almost the opposite of the wind direction at that time.
