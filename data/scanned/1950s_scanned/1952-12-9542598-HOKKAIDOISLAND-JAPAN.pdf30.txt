STATEMENT

The following is an eye witness account of an unidentified object seen by a 27-30 year old US Army Air Force lieutenant on the night of 29 December 1952.

The report describes the lieutenant's observation of a bright light in the sky, which he initially mistook for an aircraft. After observing it for several minutes, he determined it was not an aircraft. The object had a high rate of speed and was flying at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The lieutenant estimated the size of the object to be about 30 feet in diameter. The object was visible for about 15 minutes before disappearing.

The report is signed by WILLIAM G. POZIOIC, 1st Lt, 6518th Air Base Squadron.
