METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors, to obtain as accurate data as possible on the time and direction of drift of meteors under various atmospheric conditions. The Hydrographic Office has been notified of the following observation, which appears to be accurate as possible, either by hearing and seeing, or by sight alone, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

On November 14, 1953, at 10:40 G.M.T. in the lat. 25-59' N., long. 136-53' W. a meteor was observed by LCdr. Carl F. A. Johnson, Master, reports that on November 14, 1953, at 10:40 G.M.T. in lat. 25-59' N., long. 136-53' W. a meteor was observed at approximately 25° altitude with a blinding flash. Dark blue in color, this course illuminated the sky, seen, and lasted for a full 30 seconds, and the comet's trail glowed for 6 minutes after its passage.

The meteor was clear and fine, wind NE force 2, low north-easterly sea and swell, barometer 30.32 inches, temperature 68° F., sea 72° F.
