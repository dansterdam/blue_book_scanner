Dear Captain Harley:

Thank you for your cordial and informative communication of 28 February. Your continued cooperation and patience - is appreciated.

Essentially, I shall keep in touch with your office as the script to my projected documentary progresses. However, the narrative will not substantially vary from the basic facts and information already obtained. And since the script of this post-narrated film will depend precisely on what data is available, including the negative (photos) to be made available, I hope you will so advise the Department of Defense.

Do you know when I may expect to receive everything? But I am certain that all will receive everything, and I intend to discuss with you just what I learn from the material as soon as it is all in my hands.

There is another point that I wish you would clarify. With reference to my inquiry into the availability of your motion pictures of the Autonomous Regions of the Antarctica or the Arctic, requested has been checked by the Department of the Air Force, and there are no such films available.

This reply has been a bit mystified. One of the films about which I was also mysteriously over at Edwards AFB, Calif., on 9 May 1957, and I have a letter from Captain Ruppelt there relative to this plane crash incident.

As to the gun-camera shot near Wright-Patterson AFB on 20 August, 1952, the light which the camera to focus to free itself from this objet that was scanned by radar and seen by ground watchers and which was immediately released by to be TRUE by the Air Force.
