Walking day air about 10:40 PM and saw a flying object falling. It was observed for only a few seconds as it fell from partly clear view to the sky. It disappeared behind some intervening clouds. It seemed to be a yellowish object giving of a glow. Unable to tell how far away because of intervening distance, it being a glow very bright and instantaneous distance is missing.
