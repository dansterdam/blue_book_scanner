SUBJECT: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program
TO: HQ USAF (AFCXN)
1. Reference is made to your letter of 7 December 1959 above, subject as stated.
2. Our review of the USAF Aerial Phenomena Program, including the project carried out relating to phenomena reported, indicates that more than half of the program relates to phenomena of a non-scientific nature. Considering the quality of data available from other sources, exploitation of the aerial phenomena observations would not significantly enhance our research programs.
3. For the reason stated above, it do not believe that the transfer of the USAF Aerial Phenomena Program to ARDC is in the best interest of the Air Force.
