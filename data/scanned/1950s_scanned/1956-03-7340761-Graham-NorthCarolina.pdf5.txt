Address: (redacted), North Carolina
Age: 30
Occupation: Draftsman at Western Electric Co., Graham,
North Carolina
Education: High School and Technical School Graduate

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was completely thorough in his description of the sighting. SOURCE was extremely cooperative and of superior intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was on duty at the GOC post, Fairchild Field, Graham, North Carolina (G119 3505), when he sighted the object at 0501lOZ Mar 56, at an azimuth of 175° and an elevation of 60°. It appeared to
be circular in shape and brilliant white in color with a blinking red light sup- 
erimposed on it. The edge of the object was fuzzy. It was brighter than the
background of the sky, and its brightness compared to that of an auto headlight
a mile or more away. The object appeared to flicker and throb, to stand still at
times and also to suddenly speed up and rush away. It did not move behind or in 
front of any other object. The sky was very dark but many stars were visible.
The weather was clear, dry and warm, and a slight breeze was blowing. The object 
compared in size to a half-dollar held at arm’s length when viewed through bin-
oculars. It was viewed through eyeglasses and 7x50 binoculars. SOURCE estimated
it to be round, to be 12 feet in diameter, to be made of plastic or bright metal
and compared in size to a large weather balloon. Object disappeared at 1350Z 
alum and seemed to drop behind the horizon. SOURCE stated that he felt it 
might have been a man made satellite rotating around the earth. The sun’s reflec-
tion could have accounted for the light observed.
