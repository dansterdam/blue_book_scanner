Here is the account of the sighting as given by the witness:

As the witness was on his way home from work, he observed an object which appeared to be about the size of a small automobile at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. The object was traveling at a rapid rate of speed and was glowing brightly. It appeared to change color from white to red and then to green. The object was observed for about 30 seconds before it disappeared from view. The witness described the object as being elliptical in shape and able to accelerate rapidly and change direction abruptly. There were no other witnesses to this sighting.
