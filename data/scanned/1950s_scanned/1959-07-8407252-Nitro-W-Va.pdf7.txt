Dear Sir:

On July 10th or several days before or after while I was visiting my father at Nitro, West Virginia,I observed something which I should have reported before but failed to do. At this time I observed which appeared to me to be two flying saucers; they appeared as two circular discs which gave off a luminous glow and perhaps had a blinking light. I am not familiar with the mechanics or equipment operated by the Air Force but it could have been flares or some other device since a plane came over shortly afterwards. It was late at night and I would have considered it strictly my imagination but the following morning as I was leaving my home an Air Force staff car passed by which would have been in that vicinity. The address is [REDACTED]. 

Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]
