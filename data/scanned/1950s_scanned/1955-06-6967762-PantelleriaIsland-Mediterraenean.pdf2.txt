The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Estimated to be 50 or 60 degrees weather conditions clear and calm. Apparently the object was traveling at a high rate of speed from the east to west. I spotted the object from my home in Pantelleria, looking out over the Mediterranean Sea. The object was traveling at a high altitude of approximately 50 or 60 degrees from the horizon. Weatherwise conditions at the time were calm and clear. 

As I watched, the object appeared to me to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed from east to west across the horizon. I would estimate its speed to be at least 1000 mph or more. It seemed to be surrounded by a white glow or luminous field. I watched the object for about 2-3 minutes as it passed across the horizon. It did not seem to deviate from its course at all but maintained a constant speed and direction.

What I saw appeared to be a metallic or reflecting surface, disc-shaped object. It was traveling at a high altitude, perhaps 20-30,000 feet, and was heading in a westerly direction. I am quite familiar with all types of conventional aircraft, and this was unlike anything I have ever seen before. Its tremendous speed and manner of flight rules out the possibility of it being a conventional aircraft.

I have heard nothing more about this sighting, and no further investigation seems to have been made. I merely wished to record my observations, as I found the experience to be most unusual and intriguing. If you have any questions, I shall be glad to answer them to the best of my ability.
