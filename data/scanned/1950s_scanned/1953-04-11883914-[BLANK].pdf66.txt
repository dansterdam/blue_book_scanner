for a meteor. The two lights were white and moved in a parallel direction. 
It is recommended that an Observer's Questionnaire be sent to this observer, 
as his sighting bears a resemblance to the sightings made by Astronomer R. It
was impossible to obtain full details of these sightings because this would
have classed me as an official investigator. The details of these sightings
should be obtained by official questionnaires.

A meteorologist at the Lowell Observatory is identified here as observer PE. He was not interviewed, but a clipping was obtained from a newspaper covering his observations made on May 27, 1950. The object
was observed between 12:15 and 12:20 p.m. on Saturday, May 20, from the grounds
of the Lowell Observatory. The object presented a bright visible disc to the
naked eye and passed moderately rapidly in front of a fractocumulus cloud in
the northwest. Upon passing in front of the cloud its appearance changed from
that of a bright object to a dark object, due to the change in contrast. No
engine noise was heard, nor was there any exhaust. It seems that this might
have been a weather balloon but in this case it would be strange if this
meteorologist would become confused by it. He reports that it was not moving
with the wind, but across the wind.

Finally, in this survey of astronomers, my associates and I at the
Perkins Observatory should be included. There are six of us there, and to
the best of my knowledge, none of us has ever seen any unexplainable object in
the skies.

While in Albuquerque, I met, through Dr. La Paz, a Dr. Everton Conger,
Instructor in Journalism at the University of New Mexico. On July 27, 1948,
