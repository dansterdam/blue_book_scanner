IV Air Command and several other official organizations. A second report that was made up from my own personal investigation and mentioned the personal remarks and tests (magnetic measurements) has been, I believe, sent by the Brignoles police force to the Air Police of Marseille where it should have arrived on April 19.

On Monday, April 22, 1957, at 1:00 p.m., Mrs. ---- could be found in a little wooden cabin on the far side of their wine vineyards after lunch. Mrs. ---- was washing the dishes when all of a sudden she heard a terrible racket and noise all around the little cabin. She ran outside and when she glanced up, she observed an enormous whirlwind of blue and red flames that at approximately 10-15 meters of altitude began to descend on the vineyards. Frightened, Mrs. ---- asked her husband to come and join her and see what she was frightened about. The "thing" had the aspect of a cone of flames that were whirling around the "thing" itself at a slightly turning speed, but the "thing" did not displace even slightly from its bearing.
The flying object stopped for approximately 1 minute at 5 meters from the western part of the field. It maintained itself at an altitude of approximately 5 meters.
