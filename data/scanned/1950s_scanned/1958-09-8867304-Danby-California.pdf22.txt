Dear Mr. 

Your letter of January 29th to General Schriever was 
referred to this office for reply since we are responsible for
answering public correspondence on subjects such as this.

The Air Force is always glad to receive information such 
as your letter provides. Security conscious citizens such as Mr.
and yourself are to be commended for your
interest in the defense of America.

Your letter and a copy of this reply to you are being for-
warded to the Commander, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-
Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is the Air Force organization 
which is responsible for analyzing and evaluating reports of this 
nature.

I assure you that the strange glow you noticed will be 
thoroughly investigated. You will probably be contacted for further 
information by the ATIC.

Again, thanks for your interest and for taking the time to 
prepare such a detailed account of the experience.

Sincerely,
X.

J. D. Johnson, Major, USAF
RALPH J. MEEVAO
