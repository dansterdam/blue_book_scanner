SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR DECEMBER 27, 1958
ASTRONOMY
VENUS APPEARS EARLY
A brilliant display of stars, with Mars easily visible and Venus beginning to show offer sundowners, can be seen in the January skies.
BY JAMES STOKLEY
IN NO PART of the world is the display of brilliant stars now seen in the sky as fine as it is in the south at this season. Mars, which is in the constellation of Aries, the ram, high in the southwestern sky, is easily visible.
Venus, also in the southwestern sky, remains visible until about 5:30 pm. But the great brilliance in the southwest is due to the Pleiades and the other stars now seen in that area. These stars include Altair, Deneb, Vega, and Rigel, which make up the prominent winter constellations.
Brilliance in the Southwest
It is in the southwest that the most brilliant display of stars is found these evenings. The star Sirius, as noted above, is the brightest star in the sky - much brighter than any stars now visible. Capella, in the northeast, is the only other first-magnitude star in view. But Sirius and Rigel, a blue-white supergiant, in Orion's left shoulder, are striking objects.
High in the south, just to the right of Orion, is Aldebaran, distinctly red in color, which marks the eye of the great bull, Taurus. Beneath Aldebaran are the dimmer but still brilliant stars known as the Pleiades, or Seven Sisters. They are a compact group visible to the naked eye, and they served as the principal means of navigation for the Polynesians across the Pacific.
Many look at the Pleiades, a group of six or seven stars that to the naked eye appear as a small misty patch, through binoculars, or even opera glasses, through which these stars emerge as brilliant and sparkling individuals..., but they are much farther off than Rigel or the others of the brilliant winter stars.
