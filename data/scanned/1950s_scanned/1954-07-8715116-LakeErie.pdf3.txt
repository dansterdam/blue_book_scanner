INVESTIGATION OF THE SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT OVER LAKE ERIE ON JULY 29, 1954

Narrative: 
The object was first sighted at approximately 9:10 P.M. EDT on July 29, 1954 about 10 miles southwest of Cleveland, Ohio, over Lake Erie, by witnesses from the East Cleveland Police Department and the Cleveland Airport Traffic Control Tower. It was described as being in the shape of an inverted bowl, silvery in color, and estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed to hover, or remain stationary, for a period of about 10-15 minutes, then accelerate at a high rate of speed, climbing out of sight in a northeasterly direction. No sound was reported.

The object was tracked on radar at the Cleveland Airport Tower, and the ARTC Radar at Chautauqua, New York. The radar target indicated an estimated speed of 500-700 mph. The object disappeared from radar at a range of about 65 miles.

The weather conditions were clear, with visibility of 10-15 miles. There was an inversion layer at about 1500 feet, which may have contributed to the sighting. 

The object was observed by at least 12 credible witnesses, including police officers and air traffic controllers. Their descriptions of the object were consistent, and they were apparently unable to explain what they had observed.

The investigation is continuing, and the Air Force is attempting to determine if any identifiable aircraft was in the area at the time. Any further information that may shed light on this incident will be promptly reported.
