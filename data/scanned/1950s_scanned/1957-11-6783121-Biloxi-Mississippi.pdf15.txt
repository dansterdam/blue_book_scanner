1. Enclosed are the photographs and sketches referenced in our message 082234, 6 November 1957. An explanation of each follows:
a. Enclosure #1: Photographs and negatives. These were taken of the object by the witness 30 seconds apart without moving the camera. Object is indicated by arrow.
b. Enclosure #2: Photograph and negative. This is a six-minute time exposure of the object taken by witness. Object is indicated by arrow. Also shown (key shows flight direction) are contrails of high speed object track and turn.
c. Enclosure #3: Sketches shown the object as being round and tapared in the direction shown. The object and contrails were produced by observer (witness) as he watched the object disappear into distance.
d. Enclosure #4: Sketches show the object starting to change shape (as evidenced by "slight spiral" drawn around it).
e. Enclosure #5: Sketches show the object still round and the "slight spiral" dimishing to straight line.
f. Enclosure #6: Sketches show the round object with a flat top (as witness thought he saw the object do a half flip). Sketches are the witness's conception of what the object looked like when it had changed from round to what is described for the first two sightings.
