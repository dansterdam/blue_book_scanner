The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document describes a sighting of a "planet-like" object by Coast Guard crewmen on a cutter ship off the coast of Louisiana, south of New Orleans, in the Gulf of Mexico.

Text from the document:

"Sebaro, 200 miles south of New Orleans, in the Gulf of Mexico. At 5:10 to 5:30 a.m., radar men on the Coast Guard cutter Sebago, 300 miles south of New Orleans, in the Gulf of Mexico, observed a high-speed target. It was also observed visually for several seconds at 5:22, and was described as "planet-like" in appearance."
