The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the instructions to "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

The second and third sketches show larger views of a landscape, with instructions to "Place an 'A' at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a 'B' at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch."
