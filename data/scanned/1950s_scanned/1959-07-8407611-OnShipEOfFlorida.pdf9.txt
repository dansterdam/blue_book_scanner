I judge that an position close to Cape Canaveral and the missile tracking area, I think this was a missile, than a missile, however, if unidentified IT would not be verified, if it was a missile, would you please tell me if you think it was a missile than your surely have a record on file verification as it was close to the british coast, I would like confirmation that what I saw belongs to the U.S. and was under U.S. control. 
It will certainly appreciate any help or orientation that you can give me.
Sincerely,
