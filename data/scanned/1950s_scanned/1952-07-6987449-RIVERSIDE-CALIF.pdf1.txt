There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a handwritten description of a UFO sighting.

Civilian notice:

1-3 seconds
Large, round white object with a sheen, somewhat metallic in appearance, seemed to hover over and move down street, straight and level.
