15 February 1954

Colonel George S. Weltanbaker
Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio  

Dear Colonel Weltenbaker:

I am enclosing a report, prepared by Chief Engineer of Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and some of his associates, on the subject of unidentified flying objects. This report is being handed to me by a Lockheed employee who professes to have seen flying objects and is actually considered to be a technical engineer. However, I thought you should have the report for whatever value it may be in your overall studies.

Best regards.

Sincerely yours,

D. L. Putt
Lieutenant General, USAF
Commander
