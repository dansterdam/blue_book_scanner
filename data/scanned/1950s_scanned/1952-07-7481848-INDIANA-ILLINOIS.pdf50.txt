COPY OF STATEMENT OF G. 95638 7 July, 1952.
I was not a participant in the alleged sighting. I simply heard the story from an eyewitness. It appears to be a fairly well documented case and I believe the eyewitness to be reliable. The story is as follows:
On the night of July 2, 1952, at approximately 10:30 PM CST, four persons, two men and two women, were driving west on U.S. Route 50 a few miles west of Vincennes, Indiana, near the Illinois border. 
They observed a bright light in the sky ahead of them which appeared to be stationary. As they approached, the light moved rapidly away, made a sharp turn, and then continued to move away at a high rate of speed. The light then appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet. It was described as being brighter than the planet Venus and about the same size.
The driving witness was a businessman from Springfield, Illinois. The others in the car were his wife and two friends. All four witnessed the incident. The location and time given by the witnesses are consistent with the Air Force records for this date.
I have no further information concerning this case. If you require any additional details, I would suggest that you contact the witnesses directly.
