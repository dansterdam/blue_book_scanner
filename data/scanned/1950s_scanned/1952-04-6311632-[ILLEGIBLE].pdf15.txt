Transcription of the text in the image:

Thousands of intelligent beings have come a long way to visit their fellow beings on earth, as the growing number of flying saucer sightings, though not officially recognized as such, indicates. Their spacecrafts are now frequently seen all over the world. I would call the attention of whoever may read this letter to the fact that the motives and conduct of these visitors from outer space are invariably friendly and in no way hostile.

What they seem to be after is neither conquest nor colonization, but rather a friendly exchange of ideas and knowledge for the mutual benefit of both worlds. Their technology being far superior to ours, they could easily conquer and subjugate us, but instead they have maintained an attitude of non-interference and have refrained from taking any aggressive action whatsoever. Their obvious desire seems to be merely to observe and study us, much as we might study a colony of ants, without destroying or disturbing it.

The general impression I have gathered from my contacts with them is that they are a race of highly evolved and cultured beings, far in advance of us in both intellectual and spiritual development. Incidentally, their physical appearance, as I have seen it, is strikingly handsome and dignified, the voice melodious and the manner courteous and gracious.

It would be a tragic mistake if the people of earth, out of fear or prejudice, were to greet these Celestial Visitors with hostility. Rather, we should make every effort to make them feel at home and to learn from them all that they are willing to teach us. After all, we are all part of the same universal family, children of the same divine Father, and it is high time we recognized this fact and acted accordingly.
