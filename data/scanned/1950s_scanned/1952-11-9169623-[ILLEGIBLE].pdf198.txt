as follows:

Dear Sir,

In the close pass there is an interesting Flying Saucer report in which you are mentioned as one of the persons who encountered the Saucers while at College and since college some 8-9 years ago. An individual who says he saw such sightings has recently showed me his Saucer show and told how he and you had your Saucer magic classes and that you have since tried out his theories with colored glass, I have since had him over again and this time he says all he would not believe the theories. Reg ardless, Durt was camped on a Mountain in New Mexico and Saw a film light at first disregarded as fire crackers and in a little while the light passed across Carolo bus stops recording. It lasted the brief time the light was visible but no more. This light was white and illuminated itself intermittently and Durt claims that he alerted several to look Close to it, most of them were skeptics but 7 gathered up there that were only part y curious, and brought them back with me. I noticed the Collection in Washington I had saw call:.

I heard nothing from them, but a Russian Scientists from the U.S.S.R. embassy did come and they came half of one of these objects, it was so hard we had to use a bridge hammer to break it in two.

In the center was a round Hole or Vacuum, filled with fine powder this Scientists screened every bit of this they were sure was a Bomb, in claims the object was Uranium and the vacuum was proven hermetically sealed. 

I am just telling you what he sa_ because I don't Claim to know all I know is what I saw and saw.

I think all this flying saucer is 99% illusion.

Respectfully Yours
