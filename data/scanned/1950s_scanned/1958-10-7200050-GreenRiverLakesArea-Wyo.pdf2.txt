The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with a bright object high above it. The second sketch shows a road with a person standing in the foreground, and a curved landscape in the background. There are also two smaller sketches, one showing a person looking up at a bright object, and the other showing a more distant landscape.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
