The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a typed document, likely from Project Blue Book, describing a sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over San Juan, Puerto Rico on June 8, 1954.

The text in the document is as follows:

C.I.R.P. Schuman
June 8th, 1954.

My father is a former postmaster of the town of Sabana Grande and he is now ill and unable to do much. He was mentally preaching and alert. He has a fine background and he is a highly educated individual. He has always been prominent in civic and political activities of the town.

My mother is the assistant postmaster of Sabana Grande and she is also bright and alert. She is 54. She could not be fooled very easily. Her name is Mary and she resides at Clad Heights, Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico.

As for me, I have been a customs employee and a clerk. I am now 26. I am a fun American and I am employed and she is bright and clever. As the others who have been to discriminate being: the town of Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, where I live as.

While I stopped my car to stop a car with non-resident plates to make them aware of the danger, they did not stop but I shouted "cliving a saucer" and pointed to the sky. I was signaling a saucer which seemed to be a silvery colored and it hovered for a short while some 50 feet or more above ground. This one I saw on August 25, 1954.

I projected the limes of the path of these saucers and on the point of origin we have Colombia, Venezuela, the Galapagos islands, the Panama Canal and the Pacific Ocean.

It is estimated that under the island in certain areas underwater, cavities exist. At night I have detected two flying saucers. That puts me in LOCO terms, that is in case none of our airplanes have been over our skies.

Respectfully yours,
