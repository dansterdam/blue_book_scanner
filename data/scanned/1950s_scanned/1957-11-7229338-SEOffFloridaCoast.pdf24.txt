```
On Monday, the 4th, the "Levelland Things" true ?? in near
the White Sand Proving Grounds. A 20-year. inex
veteran and an electronic engineer had the engine of his new
Mercury stopped ?? a brilliant, egg-shaped object ???? a pass
at the highway. As it went over ??? said, "It felt like the
radiation of a giant ?? lamp."

?? said there were ten other carloads of people stopped,
but if this is true no one ever found out who they were.

The Air Force wrote off ?? story ?? "Hoax, presumably
suggested by the Levelland, Texas, reports."
