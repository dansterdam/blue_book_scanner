OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

10 November 1958

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your thorough search of Air Force records fails to disclose any information regarding any reported sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Baltimore area on 6 November 1957.

Further, our files indicate there were no other sightings reported from other sources in the Baltimore area on that date.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
