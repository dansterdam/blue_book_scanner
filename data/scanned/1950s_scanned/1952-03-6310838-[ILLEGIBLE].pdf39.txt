R....., citizen of San-■■, California, reported sighting of a "blue ball of fire" 4-5 inches in diameter with a blue-white trail in the early morning hours of March 1, 1952. R.... stated that the object was traveling at a high rate of speed in a straight line and diminished in size until it disappeared from view. The object was sighted over the San ... airport. R.... stated that he was accompanied by his wife who also witnessed the object. No other witnesses could be located.

It is stated that the residents of the city of San-■■■ were partially aware of the activities of the aircraft associated with the reporting and made no effort to report this because many felt that it was either a plane or a meteor which were generally common occurrences in the area. The report was recorded but no further investigative action was taken.

Mr. Accepts by the officer s opinion that individuals in this community generally ignored this type of activity because they realized that it was probably associated with airport activities which were well known in the community.
