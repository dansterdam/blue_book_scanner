discrepancies in the photos have been found and the photographer is being reinterviewed.

One school of thought of the people in the black seems to be that the objects were seen as flying balls of light from the city. Several people reported seeing this type of object. It is believed they were birds but others insist they were not birds. The cases are many where lights were observed maneuvering over the city in flights that would be practically impossible for birds. It is reported that these people saw objects they describe as metallic and solid in appearance that were maneuvering in flight. 

The Federal Wild Life Game Warden was visited and it was found he was not familiar with the incident he subdued. He stated that the objects were birds. He further stated that he thought that the birds were disturbed by something that caused an influx of the birds into the Lubbock area. The Game Warden doubted if there would be enough of these birds to make up the many flights as were observed.

If the photos are authentic, the objects very probably are not ducks because an experienced photographer who got these photos of ducks under the natural light and flash, but failed.

The investigation of this incident is continuing. It is probably the most unique incident in the history of Project 10073 record in that it was observed so many times by a scientifically trained group of observers. These people are continuing interest after several weeks of observation because they had delivered that the object was some new Air Force or missile.

The photographs are now at the Photographic Reconnaissance Laboratory at Wright Air Development Center for analysis.
