On the evening of 12 July 1952, Major XXXXXX, USAF, and 8 1037th AU Unit members were in the vicinity of Belleville, Illinois. At approximately 10:30 p.m., they observed a brilliantly lighted object, approximately twice as large as a B-29 aircraft, traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 20 minutes above the horizon and proceeded in a northerly direction. The object appeared to be accelerating at a high rate of speed as it disappeared from view. It was observed to be emitting a brilliant yellow color as it traveled. It was ball-shaped and seemed to be approximately 50 feet in diameter. It was observed by several other people in the Belleville area also. The object was not picked up on radar, and no sound was heard from the object.
