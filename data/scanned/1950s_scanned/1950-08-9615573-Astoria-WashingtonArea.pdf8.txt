The Project of Project of Pennsylvania under Dr. Robert R. Menner has been carrying out research on certain portions of the so-called "scientific aspects" of fireballs. As may find of interest, which, I am told, some 35-year survey, the largest number of meteors and fireballs appear in August.

The incidents to which you so kindly want me is so similar to the "fireball" incident of 1957 which drew nation-wide notice from the press, radio and TV, the fireballs were observed by hundreds of persons, including pilots in the air, simultaneously from six states.

I need hardly state that such a large number of observers are still firmly convinced that what they observed was no ordinary fireball.

May I again thank you for the courtesies extended the Air Force representatives and for your sincere interest and understanding in the matter.

Sincerely yours,

A. FRANCIS ARCHER 
Scientific Advisor
