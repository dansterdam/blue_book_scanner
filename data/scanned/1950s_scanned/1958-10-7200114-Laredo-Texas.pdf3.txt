TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

(a) the target was observed on 11 October 1958 beginning at 07.57 GMT, lasting until 07th 22m 12.09s, an overall duration of 28.0 seconds.

(b) the data derived on film recordings of the radar signal consisted of two unusually distinct sections. The first section lasted for approximately 0.75 seconds, showing a range change from 14h mn to 17.3 mn. The second portion began where the first left off and lasted for approximately 1.22 to 1.67 mn. In that time, absolute range as indicated here is accurate to within 5 mn, but relative to each other they are accurate to within 2 mn.

(c) the target was observed in three or four beams being energized as follows:

Beam 1 Low           No target
Beam 2 Low           0721:hh.3 to 0721:03.0
Beam 1 High          0721:hh.5 to 0721:55.5
Beam 2 High          0721:hh.0 to 0721:22.0

* May have entered prior to this time, but beam was not restricted because of Beam Switching.

(d) No doppler frequency information was available because the range gate was not set to cover the 504 to 1178 mn which would alarm the Lincoln Coded Pulse doppler system.

(e) An intercept of the Russian satellite, 1958 ?2 had been expected at about 0732 at a range of 700 to 900 mn.

(f) No other targets were observed by the radar between 0701Z and 0806Z.

B. POSSIBLE TARGETS
A signal such as that received by the radar could, at first glance, have been reflected from any one of the following:
