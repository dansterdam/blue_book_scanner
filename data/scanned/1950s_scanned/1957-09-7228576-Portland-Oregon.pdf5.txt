The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten report. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

United States Air Force
Portland, Oregon
Gentlemen:

On the morning of September 10th I sighted an unusual object in the sky over the city which I feel I should report to you, since it was unlike anything I have ever seen.

It was clearly outlined against a bright blue sky at 6:15 and was "shaped like this"

It was the color of an electric light as near white as the moon is white. It was so bright that the moon in its proximity seemed dull in comparison. This bright color could be compared to the brightest part of the moon at this time of day.

To make it travel west at a speed fast enough to make it disappear in a couple of seconds behind the roof of a house. By the time I got past the house I could no longer find it.

Very truly yours,
(Mrs. F. H.)

P.S. I work at the Northeast YMCA and was on my way to work. I watched it while I walked about 250 ft.
