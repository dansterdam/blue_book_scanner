The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old project Blue Book report, describing the speeds and other characteristics of two unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text reads as follows:

The speeds of the two portions, while far less consistent than the courses, were nevertheless enough to preclude discounting a correlation on the basis of speed. The track carried by Montauk attained a length of about 143 n.m. in 95 seconds, giving an average speed of 5,400 knots (as opposed to 3,600 knots reported on the initial plot). Although the time period over which the track was carried by Montauk was too short to provide accurate estimates of speed changes, it appears that the track speed was, if anything, increasing. The last two plots, covering a 15-second time span, advanced the track approximately 13.5 n.m. giving an average speed of about 10,000 knots for this portion of the track. Again it is emphasized that these estimates must be viewed with caution because of the very short observation time.

The second part of BB-6 covered a distance of 128 n.m. in a period of 8 minutes. The average speed here was about 960 knots. The plots in this track segment indicate a speed of above 1,500 knots at the beginning and end of the track and a speed slightly below 900 knots in the middle portion of the track. Track BB-111, which paralleled the segment of BB-6 carried by Benton, achieved a length of 205 n.m. in 10 minutes for an average speed of 1,230 knots.

Since the speeds of the two segments of BB-6 differ by a factor of nearly six to one, a logical attempt to correlate the two segments can be made. If one assumes that the track described in speed during the 10 1/4 minutes it was dead-reckoned. On the basis of the two average speeds, i.e., 5,400 knots and 960 knots, an average deceleration of 26,600 knots per minute would be required over the entire 10 1/4 minutes to account for the change in speed.
