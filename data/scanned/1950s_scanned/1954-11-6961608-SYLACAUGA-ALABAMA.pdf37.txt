The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document titled "JOINT MESSAGEFORM" from the "AFOIN-ATIC" division, discussing the details of the Alabama meteorite, which is described as a dense stony matter with many grains of nickel-iron alloys (aerolite type meteorites). The document mentions that the outer portion of the meteorite showed evidence of heat erosion from friction with the earth's atmosphere, and that the meteorite was seen to explode from Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. It also notes that some other fragments distributed over a large area remain to be recovered, and that the speed of the meteorite when it entered the earth's atmosphere was probably in excess of 15 miles per second. The document is dated December 5, 1954.

JOINT MESSAGEFORM

INFO: 
FROM AFOIN-ATIC-R2775E
The Alabama meteorite is made up of dense stony matter with many grains of nickel-iron alloys (aerolite type meteorites). The outer portion of the meteorite is blackened, giving evidence of heat erosion from friction with the earth's atmosphere. The original meteorite was much larger than that portion which was recovered, since the main mass appears to have exploded from Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. Some other fragments distributed over a very large area remain to be recovered, and much of it must have fallen as ashes. The speed of the meteorite when it entered the earth's atmosphere was probably in excess of 15 miles per second. Evidence indicates that the Alabama meteorite was a member of the Andr√≥mid shower, occurring between 24 November - 7 December. These generally came from the north as in this case. If it is from this shower, it is from the debris of Biela's comet which disintegrated after 1852. Fragments from this comet have fallen for centuries.
