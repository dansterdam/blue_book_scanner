The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be the cover page of a document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The text on the cover page states:

File 4715
May 2, 1957
Edwards AFB, California
41 photos

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted all the text from the document:
