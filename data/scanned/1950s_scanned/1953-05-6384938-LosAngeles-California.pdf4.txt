Dear Sir:

This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 6th, together with draft for $25.00, which amount has been credited to your account.

The matter of your commissions on the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Plan has been reviewed and I find that your commission rate is 15% on first year premiums. This rate has been in effect since the inception of the Plan.

There must have been some misunderstanding as to the commissions on this business, and I regret that I cannot agree to an increase in the rate over that which has been in effect.

Thanking you for your interest in our Company, and assuring you of our desire to be of service, I am

Yours very truly,
[Signature]
