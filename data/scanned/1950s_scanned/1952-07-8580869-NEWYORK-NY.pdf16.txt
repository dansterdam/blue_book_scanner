Dear sir:
By the time you have already looked at the pictures you can guess it concerns the flying bananas or whatever they may be.
they appeared at exactly 10:15 P.M. on July 25, 1952 â€“ Friday. Mrs. and Mrs. [REDACTED], Mrs. [REDACTED], and myself saw these strange objects. When we first spotted them, they seemed to be going south very fast. Then they made a round turn and headed north. They seemed to be several in a close formation and had a white light that seemed to be at the nose. We didn't see any wings or tails. They were going at a terrific speed. After we watched them for a few minutes, they suddenly disappeared, hidden by the buildings. They were only visible for a short time. Why were they there? What were they? We can't understand it. Please let us know if you have any explanation for this. We would appreciate hearing from you.
Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
