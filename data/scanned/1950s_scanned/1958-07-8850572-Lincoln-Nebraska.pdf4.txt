The image does not contain any photographs. It is a document page that appears to be a memo for record regarding a reported UFO sighting in the Evansville, Indiana area on March 17, 1960. The text of the document is as follows:

MEMO FOR RECORD

Mr. [redacted], Newscaster, Evansville, Ind., called and informed Maj Friend that he had been advised by a representative of the Aerial Phenomena Research Group of Seattle, Wash. that a UFO was observed in the Evansville area on 17 March 1960. Mr. [redacted] wanted Air Force confirmation of the sighting. He was advised that the Air Force had no record of a sighting on 17 March.

It is interesting to note that 17 March is the date of the Northwest Airline disaster in the Evansville area. Cause for this accident has as yet been undetermined. It is possible that the APRO wishes to attribute this accident to a UFO.
