Text from the document:

was at first unable to get in touch with the witnesses (by that time they were publicity shy). Under the skeptical gaze of police, and a brigadier who insisted that the object was a guided missile, Guieu claimed that the possibility that the vibration was caused by the influence of a magnetic propulision field. The suits were striking.

He reported that the object had remained in the sky for one and a half hours and that the detail on it was so slight as to be scarcely visible. He then placed it on the ground exactly where the object had stood. But as he approached the witnesses, his car sign that had vibrated so slightly, the compass showed a deviation or some 15°. This same deflection occurred at the same distance which the object had flown. But a 15° compass deflection for that third sign was of the same kind, 25 yards from the first landing spot, did not affect the compass reading again. This showed that the vibration was not prolonged but a sudden shock as if a 15° deflection had been produced.

Back in the village, Guieu found that once the witnesses were convinced that he was not another journalist but a serious researcher they were willing to talk to him. This type-recorded interview was broadcast that same evening over Radio Monte-Carlo. Guieu states that the case was investigated by the Air Police (equivalent to the AFIC in the United States) but not as asserted in the nice pages by the D.S.T. (equivalent to our FBI).
