The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The document is a letter discussing an unidentified aerial object (possibly a meteor) that was observed and reported in the Williamsburg, Virginia area in August 1959.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Washington, D.C.

Subject: Unidentified aerial object (meteor ?)  
Sirs:
Not knowing what Government agency is interested in  
reports and description of unusual aerial objects, I decided  
to write to you, thinking you would have some interest in  
such reports, or could advise me where to send them.

Last September (1959) I sighted by chance an object  
moving through the sky in the manner of a meteor. It was  
larger than most meteors, however, and was bright green.  
The local newspapers had reported a day or two before that  
several green objects had been sighted in the early evening  
and were thought to be meteors. The object that I sighted  
was seen in the middle of the night, and I read no reports  
of it. I wrote down as detailed data as I could, all angles,  
etc. being estimated since I had no instruments.

If you should be interested in the data that I put  
down, I will be glad to send it to you. It will never about  
one page, typewritten.

It was only recently that I decided it might be of  
some interest or value. If this subject is not of direct  
interest to your organization, I will appreciate it if you  
will send this letter to the proper agency.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]
