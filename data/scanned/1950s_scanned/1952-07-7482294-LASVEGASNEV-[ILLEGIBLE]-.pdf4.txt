  Observation by withheld was sighted while on duty in the project area. Sighting was on 27 June 52 at approximately 0830 hrs. The witness was employed in a responsible position at the time and is considered reliable. The incident was sighted and verified by other observers as well.

At this time, a bright, dazzling white light, circular in shape, was observed in the western sky, flying at high speed, and climbing in altitude.
