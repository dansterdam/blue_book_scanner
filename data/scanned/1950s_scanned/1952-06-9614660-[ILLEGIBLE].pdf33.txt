STATEMENT OF [REDACTED]
On June 30, 1952 I sighted an unidentified flying object traveling at a very high rate of speed. This object was a bright red color and egg-shaped. It appeared to be much larger than a B-29 bomber. I am reporting this incident because I feel convinced that this was no conventional aircraft.

On June 30, 1952, I also sighted the same unidentified flying object as [REDACTED]. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed and was a bright red color and egg-shaped. It appeared to be much larger than any conventional type aircraft.
