Text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

It appears with your request for advice as to the disposition of the data concerning the unidentified object reported in Great Falls, Montana, on 9 August 1950. It is regretted that it was too dark to permit any satisfactory photography which could be studied, and consequently any analysis is impossible since this data is too dark to permit any study.
