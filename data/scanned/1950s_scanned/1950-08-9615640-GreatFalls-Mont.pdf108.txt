The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memorandum from the Director of Intelligence dated June 1, 1956, discussing two UFO sightings described in recently released movies.

The memorandum states the following:

a. The Great Falls, Montana - 1950 case: The Air Force's original conclusion, based on the interpretation of witness testimony, was that the UFOs were, with all probability, two Air Force F-94 fighter aircraft known to be in the vicinity at the time. Simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances were made by an aircraft manufacturing firm in a recent independent and unsolicited analysis of the film, showing striking similarities to the two white blips in this film.

b. The - Utah - 1952 case: The original film was analyzed by an Air Force Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory shortly after the sighting. The conclusion reached was that a bright spot of light appearing on the film was caused by seagulls soaring in thermal air currents. The credibility of this conclusion was undoubtedly supported by the presence of identifiable seagulls in some of the frames.

This conclusion was further strengthened by movies of seagulls taken at various distances, which showed them as bright spots of light similar to those in the film.
