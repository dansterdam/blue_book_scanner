My wife and I were sitting on a beach, watching for a large clear moon. Suddenly a bright light caught our attention as it moved low over the Northbound. The light seemed to be rising and falling in speed, and would sometimes flare more brightly. After about 30 seconds of observation, the light appeared to move to the Northeast. It seemed to travel much faster than an airplane and there was no sound. We watched intently as it moved across the sky and disappeared.
