Report of Prelim Investigation of UFOB Rept (Cont'd)
was, "Mrs. XXXX called me about 2230, 22 February on long distance and told me he had seen an object fall into the lake." He believed that she should know about the report in case some people who might be digging on the lake.
It was bothering him and he was unable to sleep. Outside of this statement she knew of no other information and had heard nothing further of any eye witness accounts. She made a trip along the highway the next day, but saw nothing.
We next proceeded back to Maiden Rock and had lunch. Upon questioning several of the local residents at this point, we failed to receive negative answers. After lunch, at 1430 we proceeded to Red Wing and stopped at the radio station where we questioned the news broadcaster. He had heard nothing and had made no releases on this subject. Departure was made from this area. Upon arrival back at St Paul, Capt Neumann had a call from the 31st ADIV Controller, who stated that a patrolman, Harry G. Roberts, telephone 2341, Frontenac, Minnesota, had a list of witnesses who had seen this object. A call was placed to Mr. Roberts. His report follows:
"I checked all persons in this area and found no one who had actual knowledge. I was in touch with the Game Warden at Wabasha, Minnesota, and he stated that he had been over the lake in the Maiden Rock and Stockholm, Wisconsin, area the 25th of February and had found no holes of unexplained origin." This call came through on 1 March 1958 at 1755 hours.
Meanwhile, calls were placed to a Mrs. XXXX and Mr. XXXX. Reports follow: Time, 1300, 1 Mar 58.
