There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a handwritten report or statement. I will now proceed to produce the text found in the document:

My name is [redacted], age 50 and I live at [redacted], Hopkinsville Route 6, Kentucky.

On Sunday night Aug 21, 55 about 10:30 P. M. I was walking through the hallway which is located in the middle of my house and I looked out the back door & saw a bright silver object about two and a half feet tall appearing round. I became excited and did not look at it long enough to see if it had any eyes or move. I was about 15 or 20 feet from it. I fell backward, and then was carried into the bedroom.

My two sons [redacted], age 25 and his wife [redacted], age 29, [redacted], age 21 and his wife [redacted], age 27 and their friends [redacted], age 21 and his wife [redacted], age 18 were all in the house and saw this little man that looked like a monkey.

About 3:30 A. M. I was in my bedroom and looked out the north window and saw a small silver shining object about 2 1/2 feet tall that had its hands on the screen looking in. I called for my sons and they shot at it and it left. I was about 60 feet from it this time. I did not see it anymore.

I have read the above statement and it is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.
