JULY 14, 1952 NORFOLK, VIRGINIA (WP AFS FILES) 2 WITNESSES 00
DC-4 WAS EN ROUTE FROM NEW YORK CITY TO MIAMI, INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND 01
OBSERVED SIX UNUSUAL OBJECTS. THEY WERE FLYING AT 8000 FEET WITH A TRUE 02
BEARING OF 310 DEGREES AND WERE APPROXIMATELY 25 MILES FROM NORFOLK WHEN 03
OBSERVED THE SIX UNCONVENTIONAL OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE IN TIGHT IN 04
ECHELON FORMATION. 05
OBJECT OBSERVED WAS EMITTING A BRILLIANT REDDISH AMBER GLOW AND ALL WERE 06
PROGRESSING ON A HEADING OF 69 DEGREES. DIRECTLY TOWARD THE PAA DC-4. THE 07
ALTITUDE OF THESE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE 8000 FEET. 08
PILOT CALLED THE NAVIGATOR'S ATTENTION TO THE OBJECTS AND BOTH OBSERVED THE 09
OBJECTS CLOSING IN THEIR DIRECTION. PILOT LOST SIGHT OF THEM WHEN THEY WENT 10
BELOW THE GLASS SHIELD ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE. HE IMMEDIATELY RELEASED HIS 11
SAFETY BELT AND CROSSED OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE COCKPIT, BEHIND 12
THE NAVIGATOR, WHO WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE THESE OBJECTS CONTINUOUSLY. 13
IT RECALLED THAT JUST PRIOR TO THE TIME THE OBJECTS WERE BELOW 14
THE DC-4, THE FRONT ECHELON SEEMED TO BE DECELERATING BECAUSE IT APPEARED THAT 15
IT WAS CLOSER TO THE OBJECTS THAN IT HAD BEEN. 16
