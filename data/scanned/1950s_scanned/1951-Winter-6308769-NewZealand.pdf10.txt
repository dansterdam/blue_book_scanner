Dear Sir,

Regarding the incident 1951 I can now disclose that I was on a fiswrking trip when this happened, I saw an elongated cigar shaped object with a number of lights on it which hovered for about half an hour. These landed at a clearing about half a mile away. I went closer and saw the object (about 600 yds in diameter and 100 yds high) emit a very bright light and then shoot off into the distance at tremendous speed.

Out of this event came a sample of the earth and only (and possibly) detachable portion of the event from what could be carried - and with this and discussion I think this substantiated evidence is all I can give you for a clear picture - the evidence of this has been lost to me by the passage of time.
