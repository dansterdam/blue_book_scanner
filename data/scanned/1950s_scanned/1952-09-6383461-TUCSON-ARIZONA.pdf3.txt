The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Disposition Form from the Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.: 
SUBJECT: (Unclassified) Material for Project Blue Book
TO: Chief, Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
FROM: Dept. of the Air Force
Hq USAF-AFOAT
DATE: OCT 23 1952 
COMMENT NO. 1 
1. Enclosed report was furnished by OSI and is for your information.
2. The inconsistencies between the visual description reported by the observer and the attached photograph are obvious, viz: the time reported as 1000 could indicate the photograph was taken at a later time; the object reported as cylindrical and the photograph showing a light fixture superimposed on the background through double-exposure.
3. The Photographic Division of AFCIG has evaluated the "object" as a light fixture superimposed on the background through double-exposure.
