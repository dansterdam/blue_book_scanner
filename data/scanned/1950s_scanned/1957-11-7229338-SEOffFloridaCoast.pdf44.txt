23 September 1960

Dear Mr.

Your letter of 9 September 1960 addressed to the Chicago Office of Information, concerning two UFO sightings which you think were reported to O'Hare Air Force Base, has been referred to this Office.

We are checking the matter with the Fighter-Interceptor Squadron which was stationed at O'Hare Air Force Base during that period. When we receive the information, it will be forwarded to you.

                                        Sincerely,

                                    LAWRENCE J. TACKER
                                    Lt. Colonel, USAF
