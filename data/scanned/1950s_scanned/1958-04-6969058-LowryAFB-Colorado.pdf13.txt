Text in the document:

April 29, 1958, St. Paul, Minnesota:
A UFO sighter by the name reported in a letter on April 27 was sighted by control tower operators at Wold-Chamberlain Airport and by others. The CAA said the UFO did not resemble a meteor or any other known object but that it was not to usual on high speed on an erratic flight without detriment.
It was described as emitting sparks from trailing stream before its disappearance. The UFO was seen by NICAP member H. T. Sherman, insurance underwriter and astronomer, who reported the sighting to Air Force Captain Kleeman at Wold-Chamberlain. The captain first suggested Venus, which Sherman said was visible, but the captain then suggested a meteor.
The story, reported by Mrs. Sherman, "A meteorite or UFO" suggested that out. Finally, Captain Kleeman suggested a gas phenomena and pointed out these items:
1. When the light went out no plane was visible in the sky which at 9 p.m. was still twilight.
2. No pilot in his right mind would approach a field with heavy traffic at such high speed and suddenly go out of sight. 
3. The Air Force captain had no other suggestion and the sighting was officially recorded.
