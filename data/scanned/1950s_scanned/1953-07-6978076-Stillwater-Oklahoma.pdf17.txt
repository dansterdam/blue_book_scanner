9 July 1953

The following information was obtained by long distance telephone from Mrs. Lyle Coonradt, 1621 Old Town Place, Colorado Springs, Colorado. This information was given to me by Mrs. Coonradt on 25 July 1953.

1. As close as I could say it was elliptical, a dull white light, somewhat larger than a weather balloon. It was about 300 yards from me and about 500 feet elevation, moving in an arc from northeast to southwest. It was silent, appeared to be glowing and was a limited and irregular shape. The thing that would throw up a slight haze was the way the light seemed to oscilliate or pulsate. This pulsation lasted appr-oximately 30 minutes.

2. I may this object at approx-imately 2300 (11 pm) on 6 July 1953. I observed this object for approximately 1/2 hour.

3. I observed it from the ground with the naked eye.

4. I was outside on the ground at Cordell Call, Oklahoma. It was on the northern edge of a field approximately 1/4 mile from my residence. This field was located in the North Central part of Stillwater, Oklahoma.

5. I have two (2) years experience as Ground Observer Corps observer with the Stillwater Filter Center. I have approximately one hundred (100) hours in the air.

6. Further around towards North from 120° from East on up to North to the Northeast (about 150°) there was OME down to the horizon.

7. Meteorological condition is unknown.

8. I did not take any pictures and did not obtain any fragments.

9. There was no interference to my knowledge.

10. There was no aircraft in the air to the best of my knowledge.
