Statement of Captain [redacted]

On the afternoon of Thanksgiving Day, 23 November 1950, while I was in my quarters, Sgt LAPS, Major [redacted] knocked on my door and said, "I just saw a flying saucer." Captain [redacted] who was with me at the time, and I went outside to talk to Major [redacted]. Later that same afternoon, after Captain [redacted] had left my home, Major [redacted] knocked again and asked me to come outside in a hurry because he thought I would be able to see another object (flying saucer) before it got out of sight. I ran outside and quickly focused my eyes on an object that he pointed to. I immediately saw a second object.

As far as I can remember, they were directly over the building in which we lived; they were white in color, one following the other. I recalled to Major [redacted] that one object looked like a seagull suspended in mid-air with its wings extended but silent and motionless. The second object appeared to be two lengths of the same attitude. The second object looked like a white ball, the diameter of which appeared to be the same as the width, at the widest part, of the object that looked like a seagull. They were stationary for about one minute. Then they started rotating north and gaining attitude. They disappeared about 30 seconds after they started moving. The two objects kept the same relative position to each other during the entire time.

Captain, USAF
