COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
This object was observed visually and on the radar scope by the pilots of the aircraft performing the ECM mission on 11 January 1958. The object's speed, maneuverability, and visual characteristics observed electronically and visually appeared extraordinary, and the efforts to uncover any conventional explanation of the phenomenon were unsuccessful.
