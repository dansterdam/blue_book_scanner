Dear Sir:

At approximately 9 p.m. Monday Feb 3 I sighted what I thought was a low glide plane on second observation I realized it was not a plane but some kind of an object which I watched for about 25-30 minutes. The object appeared to be about 35-40 feet in diameter. It seemed to hover and move slowly what appeared to be a whitish glow around it. It did not have a propeller, jet or any visible means of power. We were about 7 miles away from it.

We were travelling west & was about 4 miles east of Hortense, Ga. The object when first sighted was about 2000 ft. coming in from the southeast. It was steadly moving in a northeasterly direction at a great speed. I was watching it through 7x50 binoculars. It was about 35' to 40' over the trees. We watched it till it disappeared.
