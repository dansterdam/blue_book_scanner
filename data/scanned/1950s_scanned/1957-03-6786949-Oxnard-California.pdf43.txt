Dear Colonel Carey:

As the Director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, I am writing to you in regard to the UFO sighting near Oxnard Air Force Base on March 23. We have been informed that four UFOs were tracked by radar in this area, shortly after midnight on March 23, at around 12:00 p.m.

We also have been informed that an Air Force jet fighter was scrambled to investigate, but was unable to make visual contact with the objects.

Following the investigation by your personnel, I would appreciate receiving the following information:

1. What is the classification of the report?
2. By whom were they classified?
3. By what authority were they classified?

A stamped self-addressed envelope is enclosed for your convenience. The prompt reply will greatly appreciate your cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely yours,
