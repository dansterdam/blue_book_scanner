the geographical area mentioned above on a flight traveling operation. The Tactical Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Charleston Air Force Base confirmed this fact. The position of the other two aircraft (United Airlines) and the time and distance involved supported this conclusion. On 11 October 1959 positive green sightings from a motor. All aircraft saw the motor at the same time and the direction was also constant. There is no Air Force order or directive in existence which orders Air Force pilots to pursue UFOs. Air Defense Command will, of course, scramble aircraft to identify an unknown object on their radar tracking equipment. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Government Operations Committee has indicated from time to time its interest in the subject of UFOs, and we have furnished them all the information they have requested. After preliminary investigation, the Subcommittee Staff has indicated that they do not intend to have hearings and the Air Force people that public hearings would likely give undue dignity to the subject out of all proportion to which it is entitled. The sensation seekers and the publishers of scientific fiction would profit most from such hearings, and in the long run we would not accomplish our objective of taking the aura of mystery out of UFOs. However, the Air Force stands ready to give its wholehearted cooperation to any Congressional Committee dealing with public policies on this matter should overriding considerations require them.
