STATEMENT

On the 12 August 1953, at about 2325 hours, a bright object was visually sighted by a crew consisting of 5 members of this unit. The object appeared to be about 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground and was observed for about 2 to 3 minutes. It maintained a steady flight and finally disappeared to the northwest. I watched it is object as it was in sight and I considered it to be a solid, self-luminous body, larger than a star and about the size of a small aircraft. This was a very clear night and no clouds were present as to interfere with the visual contact.
