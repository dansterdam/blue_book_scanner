The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s.

Transcribing the text from the document:

THE FRONT THREE OBJECTS FAILED TO HOLD THEIR POSITION IN RELATION TO EACH OTHER, WHILE THE REAR SQUADRON CONTINUED SMOOTHLY. THEN THE ENTIRE GROUP OF SIX OBJECTS ROLLED TO THE LEFT IN PERFECT UNION AND THEN RECOVERED TO LEVEL FLIGHT.
INSTANTLY THEREAFTER, THE ENTIRE GROUP OF OBJECTS CHANGED THEIR DIRECTION TO A 150 DEGREE CHANGE...NO SIGN OF ARC WAS OBSERVED.
THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE WEIGHTLESS AND CHANGED A 150 DEGREE DIRECTION IN SILHOUETTE AND IRREGULAR DEVICES.
UPON COMPLETION OF THE TURN, THE SIX OBJECTS EMITTED A VERY BRILLIANT GLOW...THE LIGHT WAS CONVENTIONAL, UNCONVENTIONAL OBJECTS EMITTING.
THE RIGHT OF THE ORIGINAL FORMATION, ALMOST INSTANTLY THEREAFTER, ALL REAPPEARED IN THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION.
REAPPEARED ON THE OBJECTS INSTANTANEOUSLY AND THEY APPEARED TO BE IN A STEEP CLIMB...THIS TIME RECOVERED AND LEVELED OFF.
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THEY WERE LOST TO VIEW. THE OBJECTS WERE DEFINITELY NOT CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
ESTIMATED VELOCITY DEFINITELY EXCEEDED 1,200 MILES PER HOUR.
ESTIMATED SIZE OF OBJECTS 30 TO 40 FEET IN DIAMETER. ESTIMATED ALTITUDE 10,000 TO 15,000 FEET.
ESTIMATED SPEED, BY USE OF A PENCIL HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH, APPROXIMATELY 1,700 MILES PER HOUR.
ESTIMATED LENGTH OR DIAMETER WAS FROM 30 TO 40 FEET, IN RELATION TO THE CITY AND SURROUNDING AREA.
THE WHOLE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A DULL GLOW WITH STEADY GLOW OF LIGHT, AND MORE RED THAN AMBER.
THIS LIGHT ON TOP OF THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE INTERMITTENT AND NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE OBJECTS...SINCE IT WAS NOT REFLECTED OFF THE OBJECTS.
IT DID NOT PULSATE BUT WAS STEADY, AND THE OBJECTS WERE SHARPLY OUTLINED.
THERE WAS NO CORONA OR HAZY PERIPHERY SURROUNDING THEM. THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT WAS IN RELATION TO THE RATE OF ACCELERATION.
THE SIDE GLOWING APPEARED RELATED TO THE DIRECTION AND SPEED OF THE OBJECTS.
IT WAS FOUND THAT SEVEN TO EIGHT SECONDS AFTER THE OBJECTS CAME INTO VIEW, NO EXHAUST FLAMES OR TRAILS WERE OBSERVED.
OF THE 25 OR 30% OF PASSENGERS ABOARD THE AIRCRAFT OBSERVED THESE UNUSUAL OBJECTS, HOWEVER, THE AIR FORCE ADVISES US THAT 7 TO 10% OF THEM WERE OUT OF NORMAL COLOR VISION.
