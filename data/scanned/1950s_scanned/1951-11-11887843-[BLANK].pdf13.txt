Extract of Letter from AFCRPL, dated 15 September 1950, Subject: Status of Project "Twinkle"

TO: Commanding General
Air Material Command, USAF
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio

"If no fire balls are observed in the next six month period, it is recommended that the project be discontinued. In a memorandum as sporadic as the fire balls appear to be, it is felt that at least one year's observation should be obtained before the project is discontinued.

There is considerable doubt in the minds of some of the project personnel as to the reality of the phenomena. As long as a reasonable doubt exists, it is not wise to discontinue entirely the project observations. But should six months' observations prove that no fire balls have been observed in the past and may be discontinued due to the unreliability or nonoccurrence of the phenomena, it is recommended that the project be terminated.

At present it does not appear likely that the next six months of observations will yield any significant information, and the project may be discontinued after that period.

It is requested that a six month extension of the Land Air contract be negotiated. It is also requested that the spectrographic equipment abandoned by Holloman Air Force Base due to lack of personnel be turned over to Land Air for operation in the next six month period. Observations by this Directorate and recommendations for future conduct of this project will be forwarded to your command."
