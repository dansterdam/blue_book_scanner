Gentlemen:

I am inquiring about an object that my husband, and several other people in this part of the country, saw which is on the order of a "Flying Saucer." The way my husband described it, he saw an object which was really just a white light which tinged red,
and it was about 3 miles high & 5 miles in distance from him. He saw this about 7 weeks ago, and just 2 days ago, a family here in Nelson, Nebraska saw it outside their home. It has no definite form, and makes no noise, but is merely a light and follows people.

It has frightened my husband so that he will not go out at night. I wonder if you could give us any information that would lead to a probable explanation. Anything that could put my husband's mind at ease.

I know this is a bother, and if there is any charge, please send me a bill. Our town, Nelson is in the South-central part of Nebraska.

Thanking you for your time and trouble, I remain

[REDACTED]
Nelson, Nebraska

P.S. There is a stamped addressed envelope enclosed for your convenience.
