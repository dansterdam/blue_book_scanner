MARSHFIELD, MISSOURI.
Do about 1500 feet it then started to come down much slower than it had climbed as the climb took only about 20 seconds, after coming down to what we thought about 500 feet it changed its revolving action in that it started tumbling but not any faster than it had revolved. After falling a short distance in this position it emitted a series of white smoke or vapor this was not in a trailing form but just one big puff of smoke or vapor, as this time or any other time did we ever hear any noise, after omitting this smoke or vapor it stopped all motion and fell straight into a small patch of timber. We did not actually see this object hit the ground because of the rough terrain but we did see it go behind the timber line. We then left out truck and went into the woods to see if we could find any other trace of this object. After some minutes we found two places in the grass completely pulverised but did'nt show any sign of an animal track, this might or might not of had any thing to do with it but it did seem strange in which act did seem like that of an animal or human had made it that it did not leave any track.
When we first noticed this object it seemed to hover at about the 800 feet level. The wing or rotor was slightly curved upward at the tip and near the two dark stripes. When this object stopped it gradually started to call the whole mass was noticed up its directing the base of this wing under would be the bottom was the heaviest part. At no time was there a glow about involved in any fashion. While falling it did not flutter or spin at all but fell straight down to the ground line. Before falling past the timber line we watched this object fall.
