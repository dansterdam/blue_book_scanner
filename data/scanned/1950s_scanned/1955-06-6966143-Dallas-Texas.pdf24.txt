COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
1. This Headquarters does not concur with the conclusions of the Preparing Officer for the following reasons:
a. The sources' descriptions of the flight characteristics and flight paths of the objects do not compare with that of a meteorite.
b. The duration of sighting is too long for a meteorite.
c. Sources stated that they believed they saw the same object three separate times rather than three separate objects. 
d. One reliable source stated that the object was not a meteorite.
2. This report is forwarded to ATIC as unresolved.
