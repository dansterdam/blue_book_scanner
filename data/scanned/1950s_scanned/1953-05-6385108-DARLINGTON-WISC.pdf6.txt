SOURCE: DARLING SUSPECT - MAY 5, 55

About 8-45 AM 5/4/55 I, W.H. Sullivan, Indiana, was driving and I saw sitting on the barb wire fence a bright silver object...it appeared to be round and a trifle larger than a basketball. It was shaped like a plate tilted at an angle and gave off a very bright shiny gleam as if sunlight was reflecting off it...it hovered about one minute and then "took off" at a tremendous speed straight up into the sky and disappeared from sight.
