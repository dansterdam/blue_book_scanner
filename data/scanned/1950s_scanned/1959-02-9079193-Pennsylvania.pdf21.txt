PROJECT BLUE BOOK RECORD
11 MARCH 1959

1. THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THE INVESTIGATION AND EVALUATION OF A SIGHTING OF A UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT BY CAPTAIN ARTHUR E. BENDER, A PILOT, AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS ON THE EVENING OF 9 FEBRUARY 1959.

2. CAPTAIN BENDER, WHO IS WELL KNOWN TO THE UNITED AIRLINES PILOTS AND CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL AT PITTSBURGH, REPORTS THAT WHILE FLYING RIGHT SEAT, THE LARGE GROUP OF LIGHTS REPORTED OVER THE PITTSBURGH AIRPORT WAS REQUESTED TO INVESTIGATE. THE GROUP OF LIGHTS WAS DESCRIBED AS LARGER THAN PITTSBURGH AIRPORT AND COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA.  CAPTAIN BENDER REPORTED THAT UPON APPROACHING THE FORMATION, IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT THE LIGHTS WERE ARRANGED IN A SYMMETRICAL PATTERN AND WERE OCCASIONALLY BLINKING ON AND OFF. WHEN HIS AIRCRAFT CAME WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES OF THE LIGHTS, THEY APPEARED TO SPREAD OUT AND DEPART AT A VERY RAPID RATE OF SPEED.  THERE APPEARED TO BE THREE OR MORE OBJECTS IN THE FORMATION WHICH HIS AIRCRAFT COULD NOT OVERTAKE.

3. A CHECK WAS MADE WITH THE AIRCRAFT SUPPORT SYSTEMS PROJECT OFFICE, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A SIGHTING SUCH AS DESCRIBED BY CAPTAIN BENDER. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FLIGHT PROFILE AND OTHER ACTIONS DESCRIBED WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF A DEVICE CAPABLE OF ACCELERATIONS SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER THAN THOSE POSSIBLE WITH CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
