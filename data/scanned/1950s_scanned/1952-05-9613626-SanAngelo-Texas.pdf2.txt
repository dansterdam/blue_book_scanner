We were flying along when over the interphone came the question what was in front of us. Our present altitude was 18,000 ft. I was flying right scanner and couldn't see anything. The last scanner gave a report of what he saw i lefty my position and looked thru the left blister and saw four gleaming balls in a straight line. The wing stopped as from seeing more of them. Then I returned to my position. That is all I saw. I had no idea of their altitude or how far from us they were. I have never seen anything like this in my life.
