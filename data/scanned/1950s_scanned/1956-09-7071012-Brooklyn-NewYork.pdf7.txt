There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

THE OBSERVER REPORTED SIMILAR SIGHTING LAST NIGHT EXCEPT THAT ONLY
THE WHITE OBJECT APPEARED AS REPORTS FURTHER THAT OTHER KIDS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AREA HAVE SEEN SIMILAR SIGHTINGS
