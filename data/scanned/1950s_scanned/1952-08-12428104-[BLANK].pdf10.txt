The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

RAQDs carry lights at night, a fact which may account for some instances when pilots attempted to chase UAOs during hours of darkness. Such conditions could have produced a loss of orientation on the part of the observer. Movement is always relative. If the only outside point of reference is a point of light, and both the object and the observer are moving, it is practically impossible for the observer to separate the two motions. It is difficult enough to fly a good pursuit curve on another aircraft, let alone close on a solitary moving light at night.

Another type of balloon figuring in the UAO picture is the kind used in connection with Project Skyhook. These weird plastic bags, which ascend to heights of over 100,000 feet, are shown in the photo at right. They are flown from mobile launching sites, sometimes singly and sometimes in clusters. Balloons of constant or fixed altitude, those made to transmissions go out, may be tracked by means of very-high-frequency direction-finding equipment for the duration of their flight over the United States, or until either their balloon or their batteries are expended. However, these, as well as the less spectacular balloons, may be lost and wind up in the UAO files.

It has been suggested that some UAOs, especially those where the object appeared to be close-range, quickly accelerating and quickly disappearing, appear to be an unlikely explanation. These missiles are launched at only three locations throughout the United States: 1) Point Mugu, north of Los Angeles, Calif.; 2) White Sands, Ariz.; and 3) Patrick AFB, Cocoa, Fla.
