The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As 5:00 P.M. on October 7, 1957, Father Llorente was standing in front of his church at Kisalon, Mindanao and saw a light approach from the southeast. When the object moved closer, it became torpedo shaped with four trails of flame. It separated into two parts and disappeared. Several people saw the object, and the people of a village on a ridge along which the object had passed were awakened by some unknown noise.

An aerial reconnaissance of an area of 30 miles around the point of observation was attempted. Low clouds and severe turbulence prevented adequate observation of the area in question. This area is extremely rough and densely forested. Preliminary investigation were conducted and they promised to send in teams to question local people and search for debris.

Father Llorente is a former chemistry and math instructor at Fordham University. Because of the assumed high degree of reliability or interest, this case is carried in the category of "unknown" pending further information.
