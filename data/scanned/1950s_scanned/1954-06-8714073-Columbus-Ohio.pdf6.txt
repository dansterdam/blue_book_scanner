II. Report of Interview (continued)
B. Operations NCOIC - 97th FIS, Patterson AFB - 25 June 1954:
1. Immediately after leaving the Patterson Tower, I went to the 97th FIS to check for any unusual reports that they might have received during the same period of the sighting. M/Sgt. O'Cara, NCOIC of the Operations Section stated they had had two (2) aircraft in the air at that time. One, aircraft serial number 51-3013, piloted by Lt. Kirk, and aircraft serial number 51-3340, piloted by Captain Costa.
2. Take-off and landing times are as follows:
51-3013 7/0 2040 hours Landed 2220 hours
51-3340 7/0 2215 hours Landed 2305 hours
Sgt. O'Cara could not tell me which of the aircraft was in the Columbus area during the time of the sighting. Subject pilots could not be immediately located for questioning, but Sgt. O'Cara promised to ask them about the report and contact me at the earliest possible time.
