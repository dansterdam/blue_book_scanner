Mrs /sh/SAFOICC/72842/17 Feb 66

Dear Mr. ________

This is in reply to your letter requesting information on the UFO sightings in the Mid-West in August, 1965.

A study of the reports indicates the sightings were due to a temperature inversion which caused astronomical bodies to appear to change colors and move when viewed through layers of the atmosphere.

I am enclosing a current report on Project Blue Book. This report contains statistical data through the year 1965.

                                                                           Sincerely,

                                                                           JOHN P. SPAULDING 
                                                                           Lt Colonel, USAF
                                                                           Chief, Civil Branch
                                                                           Community Relations Division
