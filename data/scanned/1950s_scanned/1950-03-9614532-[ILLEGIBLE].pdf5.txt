'Flying Triangle' Was Really There - That would you could believe, if only
it had been a Triangle, what you saw was a flying object, and what was saw
was a flying triangle. only two points, however, seemed to stand out clearly:
1. It was a flying object, and 2. Montrose A.F.B. apparently got it on radar.
Beyond that, the report gets a little confused. The Air Force says it was an
Unidentified Flying Object, but people who saw it claim it was a flying
triangle. If it wasn't a triangle, then what the heck was it? At any rate,
it was a flying object, and the radar at Montrose A.F.B. did pick it up. So,
consequently, there was something there, even if it wasn't a triangle, as
some may have hoped. This, at least, seems certain.'
