"REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

7 November 1957

PLACE OF INCIDENT: Vicinity Levelland, Texas

DATE & TIME OF INCIDENT: 2 November 1957, approximately 0100 hours

WITNESSES: Several persons in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:

On the night of 2 November 1957, between approximately 0100 and 0115 hours, several persons in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas, reported seeing a large, egg-shaped object land on or near Highway 116. The object was described as being 40 to 60 feet in length and 18 to 20 feet in height, with a bright blue-green light on top. The object was reported to have paralyzed the ignition systems of automobiles in the area.

The first report was received from a Texas Tech student, who stated that as he was driving along Highway 116, his automobile engine stopped and the headlights went out. He reported seeing a large, glowing object land on the road ahead of him. As he approached the object, it rose up and sped away. He was able to restart his automobile after the object had departed.

Other reports were received from individuals in the area, all of whom gave similar descriptions of the object and the effects it had on their vehicles. In several cases, the witnesses stated that the object appeared to follow their automobiles for a distance before departing.

The Air Force conducted an investigation of the incident, but was unable to determine the nature or origin of the object. The case remains unresolved."
