25 July 1952, Osceola, Wisconsin

Targets on photo marked “Hudson Point fm" are considered to be due to interference from another radar set operating somewhere in the same frequency pulse repetition rate and antenna rotation speed as the set at Osceola. Indications are that this interfering radar is located in a South-east direction from Osceola. It is considered possible that the W/T set located at Allouez, Wisconsin could have caused interference due to the W/T set located near Osceola.

The periodic appearance of the targets was caused by the slight difference in rotation speed of the two radars antennas. Interference occurred when the two antennae were pointing towards each other.

Targets on photo marked “Hudson Point fr" cannot be as accurately evaluated. Indications are, however, that this photo was taken about the same time as the other one. It is considered possible that the two too may have been caused by interference from the interfering radar signals.

Weather data would be useful in determining if some distant (2000 plus miles) radar sets could have caused the interference, the data needed are as follows:

a. Temperature and winds
b. Humidity at peak height
c. Cloud conditions
