To Dover AFB from Blue Book
The report for statement from the main witness for my investigation on the night of Feb 
28, 1953:
My wife and I first noticed what appeared to be a circular light in the western sky at about 9:10 p.m. as we were driving south on Route 9. At first it appeared to be a star, but as we watched, this object began to zigzag back and forth, moving up and down, and at times appearing to stand still. In a matter of a few minutes, this object seemed to become bigger and brighter, and I would estimate it was at about 2,000 feet altitude and about 2 miles from our position.
The object seemed to be following a course roughly parallel to the ground, going from west to east. At one point it appeared to come to a complete stop and then seem to split into two or three separate objects, which then immediately came back together as one. This type of maneuver was repeated several times while we were watching it.
To the best of our estimate, this object was in sight for around 15 to 20 minutes before it seemed to fade away into the distance. At no time did we hear any sound coming from the object. The sky was clear and there was no visible moon or stars.
We are positive that this was not a star, plane, or any other type of conventional aircraft. It was something which defied explanation. I felt it was my duty to report this sighting to the proper authorities.
