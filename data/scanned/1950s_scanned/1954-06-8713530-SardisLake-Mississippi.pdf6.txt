27 September 1954

SUBJECT: Fallen object - Sardis Lake, Mississippi

1. The area examined, Greenwood area Delta, was covered in a report made to this office on September 22, 1954. The essential details of this report are:

(a) Fisherman had reported a falling object in the lake crossing location.

(b) Examination of the lake revealed no object on the surface and no disturbance was noted in the water. An old 30 mm cartridge was found which appeared to have been in the water for some time.

(c) Inquiries were made in the area, but no additional information could be obtained.

2. The area was again visited on 25 September by the undersigned. No further information could be obtained, nor was any evidence found to indicate the presence of a fallen object.

3. It is considered that the original report was probably due to an erroneous observation or misinterpretation of some natural phenomenon. No evidence to support the existence of a fallen object has been found.

4. The case was reported to Captail Virgil King, Assistant Public Safety Officer, Grenada, Mississippi, by telephone on the 22nd of September. Mr. King stated he would investigate the matter further.
