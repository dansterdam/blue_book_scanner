The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with some diagrams.

The text in the document reads:

The one in the foreground which is of two larger ovals on the top and the objects under them. It indicate with the rough outline being the best possible drawing the observer could make, these objects appeared to be circular or oval in shape, but not distinct or clear enough to determine exactly their shape and outline. The larger ovals on top seem to have been brighter or more illuminated than the objects underneath.

Towards the bottom of the document, there is a simple diagram depicting a curved shape.
