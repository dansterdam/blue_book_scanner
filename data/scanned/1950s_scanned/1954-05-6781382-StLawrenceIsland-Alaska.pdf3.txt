Sirs:
Enclosed is Log of UFO and Jet activity over Cincinnati, Ohio
May 5, 1954. It may help you correlate events.

Also enclosed is my organization's latest edition of Newsletter.
Although administratively, I plan to cooperate fully with ATIC
and the USAF regarding UFO activity. In many instances, people,
locally, prefer to "keep 'unseen' sightings away from official
channels, but are willing to turn over the data to me for analysis. Others, aware of, or as members of CRIBO, keep me informed of all UFO events.
Glad that this cooperation of CRIBO, phone me of UFO-Jet activity.
Clause, what I am gathering of UFO myself and thus gather other pertinent reports from people in the city.

Sincerely,
Leonard H. Stringfield
Director
