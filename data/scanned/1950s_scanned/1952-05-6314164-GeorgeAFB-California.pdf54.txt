Text from the document:

"When a light of object observed, first felt that it must be a star or planet, but its movements and strange disappearance caused interest and curiosity. This was not a star or planet, and could not have been an aircraft, balloon, etc. Its movements were such that it could not be explained in ordinary terms.

The object was first observed about 7:30 pm, Pacific Standard time, on May 6, 1952, at George AFB, California. It was approximately 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon in the northeast.

The object was bright and appeared to be stationary for a period of time, then suddenly disappeared, only to reappear a short distance away. This process was repeated several times, with the object finally disappearing completely. Its motions were unlike anything I have ever seen before.

The object was observed by several people, including Capt. J---- B----, the Operations Officer, and other officers and airmen. All were in agreement as to what was observed.

I feel that this occurrence is worthy of investigation, as it could not be explained in ordinary terms, and may have some significance in relation to the general problem of unidentified flying objects."
