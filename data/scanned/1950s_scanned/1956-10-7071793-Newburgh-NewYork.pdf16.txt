The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with a series of questions and instructions related to describing an observed object.

FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT IF IT WAS NOT FOR MILITARY PLANES THAT IT RESEMBLED A CIRCULAR SAUCER SHAPED UFO. MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED IT LEFT A TRAIL OF GRAYISH SMOKE OR VAPOR IN ITS WAKE. IT WAS ONLY SEEN FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND COULD NOT BE OBSERVED FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS.
