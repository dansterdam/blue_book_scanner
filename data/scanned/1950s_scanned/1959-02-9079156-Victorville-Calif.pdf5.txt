k. Captain Rudolph H. Pestalozzi, USAF, AO739577, 831st Air Division Intelligence Officer. He is liked by his schoolmates and teachers. His parents rely on him, say he is a reasonable, responsible boy. Has a good war record, and a hobby makes and flies model airplanes. There is nothing in his background to indicate any likelihood of his making false reports or delusions. 

Unidentified Flying Objects have been reported to the 831st Air Division Intelligence Officers during the past two weeks by both civilian and military observers, who decline to be used for reporting purposes for fear of being laughed at or discredited.
