SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON  

On 9 January 1953 at approximately 7:40 P.M. Alaska Standard Time a witness observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon over Eklutna, Alaska. The witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, observed the object for approximately one minute and described it as being about 200 feet in diameter, silvery in color, and elliptical in shape. According to the witness, the object was observed at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet and was traveling in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of approximately 200 to 300 miles per hour. No exhaust or trail was observed emanating from the object. When first sighted the object was traveling in level flight and then suddenly climbed vertically at a high rate of speed and was soon lost to sight. The witness is a reliable person and his report is considered to be credible.
