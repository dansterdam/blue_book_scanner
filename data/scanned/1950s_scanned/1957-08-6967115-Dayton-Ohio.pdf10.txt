The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any change in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. feet.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One): a. Head of a pin, b. Dime, c. Penny, d. Nickel, e. Quarter, f. Half dollar, g. Silver dollar, h. Baseball, i. Grapefruit, j. Basketball, k. Other

23.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.): 1. Certain, 2. Fairly certain, 3. Not very sure, 4. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Faded gradually from sight

24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be and what shape would it have? Please draw a sketch of how you think it would appear.

( There is a hand-drawn sketch and some additional writing at the bottom of the page that is difficult to read.)
