1. The preparing officer in company with an OSI agent and a Castle AF Base PIO representative made an investigation concerning an unidentified elliptical shape sighted over Modesto, California on September 15, 1953 to view a photograph.

2. The reason for sending the picture was that Mr. *** Modesto Bee newspaper photographer, took pictures for the same paper on September 15, 1953. The light seemed to be about 10 degrees above the horizon in the direction of Modesto Airport. They said it appeared to be a red object with a tail, and that it remained stationary for about 10 minutes. Nevertheless, he took his camera to the newspaper building and his camera malfunctioned with the shutter open for about four hours.
