MEMORANDUM TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

1. On 24 March 1950, Justus E. LILIE JR., Investigator, Military Intelligence Section, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, interviewed Pvt. Jeffrey, the Jet Observer, Headquarters, Maintenance Branch, Signal Section, 

Spar and reported that at approximately 1900 hours, 12 March 1950, he and two long and white streaks observed crossing his rear (somewhere between south or west) to almost directly east (somewhat north of east).

The phenomenon was clearly visible for approximately three to four minutes (4000 to 4500 hours) during the vapor trails of the vapor trails which was almost absolutely no sound.

It was further stated that because of the fact that absolutely no sound could be heard, the vapor phenomenon is clearly separated from the blue of the sky, in that the vapor trails were so very thin and wispy in characteristics, the apparent appearance in the western sky to its vanishing point high in the eastern sky was observed in about four minutes.

In absolute perfect and equally spaced formation, also very high, in an absolute straight line. Since visibility was perfect, he estimated the distance covered by the object during his observation to be at least 400 miles (at four minutes duration). The speed of the object, therefore, was about 600 miles per hour.

2 items:
1. Direction of Flight
2. Length of Streaks.
