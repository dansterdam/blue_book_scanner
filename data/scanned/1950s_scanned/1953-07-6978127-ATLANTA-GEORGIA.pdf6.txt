Text from the document:

7 July 1953
Description
On the night of 7 July 1953, three observers from Atlanta were driving on Highway 78. While passing through Decatur, Georgia, they encountered a brightly lighted saucer-shaped object in the middle of the road. There were three small animals near this object. As the observers bore down on this object, two of the animals entered the "saucer" and escaped. As the "saucer" rose at a 45 degree angle, it turned a light blue color. The third animal was knocked unconscious. After getting out of the car and finding this animal, which was lying on the ground, the observers stayed at the scene and several other automobiles stopped. The animals died in about 30 minutes and was taken to one of the Atlanta newspapers. A reporter for the newspaper called the FBI, who in turn called the incident.

Discussion
This animal was first examined by a local veterinarian who stated that the animal was a small bear-like animal. However, the university authority identified it as a member of the monkey family and not an animal from space. A member of the State Crime Laboratory and another member of the Emory University staff identified the animal as a monkey which had been shaved and from which the tail had been removed. Observers confirmed that the whole animal (except the shaved spot and the lack of a tail) could not get his picture in the paper. Observer was fined $10.00 for obstructing the highway and was released at that time.

Conclusion
Other - None.

Note: This is one of many similar reports received by Project Blue Book.
