                SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT 

SUBJECT: Unconventional Type Aircraft (Unexplained "Blip” on Radar Scopes Caused by Metallic Targets) 

To: Director of Special Investigations Headquarters United States Air Force Washington 25, D. C.  
            ATTN: Counter Intelligence Division 

1. SYNOPSIS:  Lois L., Radar Operator and Controller, 661st AC & W Squadron, Selfridge Air Force Base, MichL, did on 9 March 1950 observe on radar scopes unexplained "Blips".   The "Blips" acted in a peculiar manner. It was assumed that the unidentified "Blips" were of an unconventional type aircraft. Observations of "Blips" also recorded by enlisted personnel on duty during the concerned period of time. 

2. DETAILS:   Lois I. was on duty with the 661st Radar Section on 9 March 1950 to control the positions of local Jet aircraft. Observations and control were normal until approximately 1915 hours, at which time, observed a blip on the radar scope at approximately 10,000 feet, range and azimuth holding steady at 270° at 25 miles. "Blips" was brilliant for a few seconds, then faded, and came back at a different location approximately five (5) minutes later. As this time other radar operators observed the "Blips" and questioned it. The estimated speed, which was not well founded but assumed to be about 1500 miles per hour, is a combination of vertical speed and horizontal speed based on various vectors derived from the instruments. The "Blip" per observed when picked up the second tims to move laterally to a bearing of 360* and was observed to be consistent for about three (3) minutes with the same scope.   __     during this period of time, did not record the information in a log however, his curiosity caused him to contact various jet fighters in this area to determine their altitude, bearing, and speed ---- could be used as a conclusive check on the radar scope.   _  than left the Radar Room and turned over controller work to
