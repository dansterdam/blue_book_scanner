AF FORM 112â€”PART II 
APPROVED I JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO. IR-4-575

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. All personnel listed in initial report from Pt. Monmouth were students, with the exception of the project engineer holder. They were all civilians, radar operators, since 1942 and stated he had no knowledge of a "flying saucer" report prior to observing the incident. This information was obtained during an interview made by him.

2. The item listed in paragraph 2, initial Pt. Monmouth report, was later identified as a balloon.

3. The radar pots at Ft. Monmouth were in first-class mechanical condition. However, the erratic behavior and "fluttering" nature of the target as described in the initial report indicates the strong possibility of occurrence of targets and/or aircraft.

4. At variance with paragraph 1. above, is the fact that the Pt. Monmouth PIO called the radar section on the morning of 10 September, stating that a "negative recall" was received by the PIO, but withdrewl the martial body with technical data concerning the observation.
