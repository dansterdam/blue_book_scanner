Question 20: The attitude I judged roughly to be at first 50 to 75 miles. However, the object could have been considerably farther. The speed was usually very slow. I am reasonably sure it moved forward no more than two half-dollar lengths which appeared at full view for several seconds.

Question 18: While the object moved forward, the body rolled or listed, completing this performance, behind a semi-permanent obscuration. This appeared to be a region of space that concealed the lower portion of the object. At the same time, the visible portion was sharply defined, suggesting the concealment was not caused by fog, dust, etc. The visible contour remained consistent and uniform throughput its visible portion.

Remarks: No meteors or aircraft were observed during the sighting. The sun had no effect. The object caused a reflection. The case was investigated but search operations to find any physical evidence of the object were negative.
