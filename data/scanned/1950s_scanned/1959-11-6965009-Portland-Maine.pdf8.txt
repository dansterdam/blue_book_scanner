Sir,

I wish to report having seen an unidentified flying object on November 13, 1959 about 2:00 p.m. The following is an account of what I saw:

About 2:00 p.m. as I was looking across the sky in a south-north direction, a bright light caught my attention. As I watched it was a weather balloon but soon discounted this as it got closer. It was flying high and had a translucent glow of rapid speed. It had a round ball shape and was white in color. It was not a conventional military or commercial aircraft. It disappeared in the northern sky.

The sky at the time of observation was a clear blue without cloud formations. It was not and could not have been a satellite coming on a path very close to earth.

The above is a factual report as I described it. I am sending this information to you for whatever value it may be to you.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
