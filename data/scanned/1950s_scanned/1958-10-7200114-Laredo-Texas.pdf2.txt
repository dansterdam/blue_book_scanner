UNIDENTIFIED TARGET OF AN/FPS-17(XW-2) RADAR MISSION 164

I. INTRODUCTION
The AN/FPS-17(XW-2) radar at the Laredo Test Site, Laredo, Texas was in operation on 11 October 1958. The expected target was 1958 A 2, the instrumented portion of the third Russian satellite, Sputnik III. A target was observed, but the characteristics of the intercept would make one believe that the object observed was not the one expected. Other possible explanations are discussed below.

II. CONCLUSIONS
The object observed was most probably:
(a) a meteor showing both a head echo type reflection and a specular type reflection from the trail, or
(b) two meteors occurring in the same portion of space at very nearly the same time.
