Army explosives specialists dug down into the back yard at a San Gabriel home yesterday in search of a possible missile.

Capt. Joseph Jackson, commander of the 6th Army Ordnance Explosive Disposal Unit, directed the digging operations.
The Temple City sheriff's department assisted in the search.
Sgt. Charles Melvin said the digging would continue today if it was necessary to go to a depth of 20 feet.
