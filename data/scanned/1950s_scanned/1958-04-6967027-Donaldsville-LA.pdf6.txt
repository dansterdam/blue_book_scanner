The image appears to be a grayscale, somewhat overexposed photograph of what seems to be a parachutelike object or some type of aerial downed craft descending from the sky. The object has numerous lines extending downward, which are likely cords or shrouds, attached to a central point or assembly, which is consistent with a parachute design.
