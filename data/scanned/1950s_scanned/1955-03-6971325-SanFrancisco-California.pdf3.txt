Air Force UFO form continued
Please provide a report of a sighting of an unusual object, which apparently came toward the observer, and then seemed to stand still and rock up and down. The object was silvery in color and seemed to be glowing. Its size was approximately 15 feet in diameter, and its shape was round or circular. The object was observed for about 2 minutes. It disappeared from view in a manner that indicated it was flying away from the observer, and not merely fading from sight. The observer stated that this was a definite sighting of an unusual object, and not merely an illusion or misidentification of a known object. The observer appeared to be sincere and considered the sighting to be of utmost importance.
Very Respectfully,
