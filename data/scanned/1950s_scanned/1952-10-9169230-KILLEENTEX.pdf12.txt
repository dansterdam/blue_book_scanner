Reports of Unidentified Flying Objects
Killeen, Texas
17 October 1952
GLANCE AT WEATHER Capt. D/Ops.
Initially reported by this Hq. TT No. OPNS 1201
and Sq. 13 approx. 1730 hrs. 17 October 1952
An Air Force plane on a routine training mission about 12 miles southwest of Killeen, Texas, vicinity of Blue Holes Lake, reported sighting bright lights maneuvering at high speeds over the area. The pilot, Capt. [redacted], and bombardier, [redacted], made the observation and reported it immediately to this headquarters. They stated the objects were very brilliant, moving at high speeds, and would disappear and reappear. The pilot made two passes on the objects, but they could not get a close visual or radar contact. The objects were observed for about 15 minutes. As they proceeded on their training mission, the objects appeared to follow them, maneuvering southeast. As they neared Killeen, the objects veered off to the southeast and disappeared from view.
A check with local authorities failed to reveal corroborating observations or sightings in the city at the time. However, there are no other indications of the method of propulsion or the objects were controlled from the ground as one might assume for an aircraft. The project has been notified and will conduct further investigation to determine the nature of the objects.
