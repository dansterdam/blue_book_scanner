CHASING THE FLYING SAUCERS            29 Nebraska for what purpose?
SCHMIDT: Buying grain.
LARSON: Is this your first trip to Kearney?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And by buying grain, what do you mean, sir?
SCHMIDT: Buying for the farmas elevators.
LARSON: And you travel around the country, sir?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And you drive what kind of a car, sir?
SCHMIDT: A '55 Buick Super.
LARSON: Now this afternoon I believe you were out south of town —about how far, sir?
SCHMIDT: About four miles.
LARSON: About what time was this?
SCHMIDT: Between 2:00 and 3:00 in the afternoon.
LARSON: And you were headed in which direction?
SCHMIDT: I was going south, and then turned east on the Newark highway.
LARSON: You noticed something in the Piatt River bed, am I right, that it was dry — ?
SCHMIDT: There was a flash there—what I first noticed.
LARSON: And that was how far from the road, sir?
SCHMIDT: About, half a mile, I would say.
LARSON: Did you continue to drive, or did you immediately stop?
SCHMIDT: No, I drove on up a little closer to where the flash was, to see what caused it, and when I got so close I found out—I thought it was a balloon that had crashed there.
LARSON: Then you drove closer to the object?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: And then what occurred?
SCHMIDT: When I got within 50 feet of the object my car stopped. The motor went dead. I tried to step on the starter, but there was no response whatsoever. I got out of the car. I figured the terminal had just broken loose on the battery. I got out of the car and walked toward this balloon—or what I thought was a balloon—and when I got within 30 feet of it, a light shot out and, I wouldn't say it paralyzed me, I would say it hypnotized me (Schmidt's voice shows confusion as to the exact effect of the ray—G.B.).
LARSON: You couldn't move?
SCHMIDT: I couldn't move.
LARSON: Could you think?
SCHMIDT: Yes, I could think and talk, but I couldn't move.
LARSON: Before we go into further happenings in regard to this object, wonder if you could describe it. About how long was it, sir?
SCHMIDT: It was about a hundred feet long, as near as we could step it off, and 30 feet wide, and I judge it was 14 feet high.
LARSON: What did it appear to be made of?
SCHMIDT: Real bright aluminum.
LARSON: Now this was in the bed of the Piatt River, which is dry at the present time? It was sandy there?
SCHMIDT: Yes.
LARSON: It appeared to be of aluminum, bright and shiny. And as you got out and you approached this object. Did you notice anything as to how it would move? Did there appear to be pipes, or propellors, or what was it?
SCHMIDT: On each end of the machine there was a tube running up and down, and in these tubes I could see big fans. It seemed like that did the propelling.
LARSON: How close did you get to this object?
SCHMIDT: I got to it and in it.
LARSON: I understand that, sir.
