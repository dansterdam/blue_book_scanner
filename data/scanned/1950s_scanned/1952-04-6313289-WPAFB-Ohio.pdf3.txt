Report of Sighting
On April 20, 1952, between 1325 and 1330, Capt. [redacted] and Lt. [redacted], both of whom reside in [redacted], Ohio, observed an unidentified aerial object. Capt.

It exhibited no trail or noise and went out or sight still considerably above cloud level.

About halfway through the observation, Capt. [redacted] called Lt. [redacted], who came out and observed the object for an extremely short period. The weather at 1830 was as follows:
5,000 scattered
