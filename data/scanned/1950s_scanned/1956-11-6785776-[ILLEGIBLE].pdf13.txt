Case 274, Columbus, Ohio, Nov. 27, 1956 - Just for the record, another unexplained sighting. Reported the Columbus Dispatch, "A mysterious blast heard Tuesday morning by residents in the eastern and northeastern sections of the city through a flood of calls. A check with officials at local airports revealed the blast did not result from any locally based planes breaking the sound barrier. Investigators had not been able to determine what caused the blast." One report described the blast as "a double explosion and said it shook windows and rattled window panes."
