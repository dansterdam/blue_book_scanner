The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typewritten page from an old report document.

runs reasonably true north and south at that point. It is with extreme caution that this officer is writing this description. I would hazard a guess the object was not less than 25 to 35 feet in diameter. That is disregarding the relative size. The distance involved and the fact that this officer was unable to force himself to approach closer to his suspicion of the nature of the object is very probabaly the reason the object was beyond determining what it really was, or if there were any opening or construction. This officer has been serving in Naval Aviation for approximately 25 years and is familiar with the normal illusions one can see in connection with high speed, high altitude aircraft. This officer did not at any time paint or sketch any phenomena and I believe this statement to be a honest one on the part of this officer, the object, a definite mass and was not a reflection or an optical illusion.
