THOUSANDS WITNESS SAUCER OVER MOROCCO AND TANGIER -- Casablanca, Maroc-Presse, 22 Sep 52.

PETER a CASE MOLEEZ-TIRAR FR. 4-52.

On 22 September 1952 about 1:15 hours, a luminous disc-shaped saucer, flew at a great speed over Casablanca. Shortly afterwards, about 15 observers at Rabat saw the same object which was now stationary, and our Tangier correspondent received reports from local residents.

The observers called to say that he had seen the object going from east to west at 1:15 hours (about 2-3 minutes before it flew over Casablanca!). ALSO, two observers painted on the object with a chronometer: it was then 1:17 hours, and the object was coming from the direction of Rabat, travelling from East to West.  

Some of the reports gave the following details about the object: luminous, cigar-shaped, about 40 feet long, a silvery-green globe ending in a long cone and flying about 700 feet up, the same as a plane which flew by the object (according to Casablanca); and a flashing, glowing, object-stopped, was trailing white smoke in puffs, as though puff followed an explosion.

About 6,000 spectators at a boxing match in Casablanca saw the object pass over the area at 1:15 hours. Louis Gentil, numerous persons saw it at 1:15 hours (according to the reports). It made its appearance in Rabat, then in Casablanca, if made its appearance to the east, a meteor, again traveling from east to west.
