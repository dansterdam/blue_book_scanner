ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 25 AUGUST 1951

On the evening of 25 August 1951, at 11:15 p.m., a civilian guard on security patrol at this base observed what he described as a saucer-shaped, high-speed aircraft similar to a silver disc in the sky. This object was at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet and was moving at an estimated speed of 1,000 - 1,500 mph. The object was observed for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.

Weather: Broken clouds at 17,000 ft., visibility five miles, wind S at 5 mph.

Status of Investigation:
The possibility of this being a known aircraft was checked with negative results. The AC and H Radar Station at Kirtland AFB did not observe any unusual or unidentified aircraft.

The guard's background was checked and since he has a "2" clearance, it is assumed that he is mentally stable. The photos taken of the V-shaped object at Lubbock, Texas, (see Appendix) were sent to Albuquerque. They were shown to the sources by the O.S.I. and sources stated that arrangements of lights on the object they saw was similar to the photo. They sketched in the wing as they saw it.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had seen the object but only negative results were obtained.

Further evaluation of this incident depends on the outcome of attempts to establish the authenticity of the Lubbock photos.
