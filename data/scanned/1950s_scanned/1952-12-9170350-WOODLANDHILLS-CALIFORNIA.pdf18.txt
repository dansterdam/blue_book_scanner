DATE: December 9, 1952

The initial thing to come to my attention was a strange object in the sky, which attracted my attention due to its unusual appearance and movements. It was hovering and seemed to be under intelligent control as it made abrupt changes in direction and speed. It was a brilliant, silvery-white object of considerable size and seemed to be metallic in nature. It remained in view for several minutes, during which time it carried out a series of seemingly purposeful maneuvers. At one point it appeared to project a beam of light downward. When it finally disappeared, it did so at tremendous speed, streaking across the sky and out of sight in a matter of seconds. The entire incident was highly unusual and inexplicable in terms of any conventional aircraft that I am familiar with.
