There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Stereoscopic (three dimensional) camera at 1/100 of a second shutter speed and 16, 11, and 8 lens opening. During the two hours we observed the object we watched it with the naked eye and through 7x50 binoculars.

At about 10:30 a jet type aircraft (P-33) flew up to see if he could identify the object. He climbed to 40,000 feet and said the object was about 7,000 feet above him or at 47,000 feet. When we observed the object through the binoculars it appeared to be the size of a pea (in the glasses). This was the same size a small house appeared on the ground through the binoculars. Since we were 10,000 feet from the ground and approximately 37,000 feet from the object it appears that the object was three times as big as a small house.

We left the object at approximately 12:30 and went back to our base. At this time another jet (F-86) was proceeding to the scene to try to get closer to the object and possibly identify it. When we left the object was still drifting to the East at approximately 20 miles per hour.

Film from Stereoscopic cameras is being forwarded with this report. Film broke once while taking first picture from plane, which necessitated re-threading the film in the airplane.
