The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the labels "A" and "B" on it, and an object appearing above the horizon. The second sketch shows a landscape with a road leading to the horizon, and two smaller sketches on the sides.

The text in the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
