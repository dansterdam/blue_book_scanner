C - The other one took off and went north, is that right?
C - A little later?
C - Oh yes, quite awhile later.
C - How long did you see these objects?
C - seemed to be over the field about an hour.
C - Was it hover in one spot?
C - It seemed to. It seemed to raise up and move in different directions and sort of pulsating. Brighter, dimmer, brighter, dimmer. 
C - That is right, any color change when it moved?
C - Yes, it got brighter.
C - Did it accelerate?
C - That is right.
C - Taking a look again through your glasses, you are wearing now, visually?
C - Yes, that is larger we looked through the binoculars from the house. 
C - What time was it when you first saw it?
C - It wouldn't be. It was about 8:30.
C - About 8:30. You called the Sheriff's Dept. about 11:30. 
(That is correct. What were the lighting conditions in the sky at that time?
C - Not the larger one. The larger one had moved toward north down the Alvardo.
C - What would you say weather conditions were last night?
C - I would say but it thinks they were good. That sky was clear and you could see other stars.
C - What did you see or do about the object toward the northwest, the larger one, the one that had moved?
C - Did you stand and watch it or lose sight of it or what happened?
C - We just stood and watched it. We saw it go down near highway going east and west and then it seemed to go straight up and gone.
C - About what time was that?
C - It must have been about 9:30 or so. The small one came back out again and the lights were still going on and off and it continued for a while and then it went up. 
C - Was there any light? Then at 8:30 you say you saw it and you called the police at 11:30.
C - After we had been watching it a while.
C. - All right, Sister, thank you very much.
