The image contains a handwritten letter addressed to the "Chief", but there is no photograph present. I will now act as an OCR system and reproduce the text found in the document:

Dear Chief:

This data we I ask is a report on a very strange object that we saw or sighted on the evening of Feb. 9, 1952, at about 7:05 pm near Ada, Minnesota. 

This, I realize, is something new as we know what a lot of people think when we tell them about it, but it's true. It was a fast moving object with a sort of a yellowish-green light that lit up the country-side very bright as it passed over. 

When this happened, we were all in the truck, it was so fast and unexplainable that we couldn't believe our eyes, and we watched it until it went behind some trees across the road from us. It left no trail or smoke or any noise as it went by. I would estimate that it was traveling at least 300 to 500 mph as near as I could judge.  

It seemed to be about 15 to 20 feet in diameter, and it was about 150 to 200 feet up in the air. There was no doubt in our minds that it was not a shooting star, plane, helicopter or anything we have ever seen before. 

This is about all I can say about the size and speed and direction. It was going from North to South. I have marked on the map where we were when we saw it and where it went behind the trees. If this interests you at all, I would be glad to give you any other information I can. I am sure you have seen other reports like this, but I thought you would want to add this one to your files too.

Yours Truly,
Dietloff Sabel
