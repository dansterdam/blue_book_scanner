Transcription of the text in the document:

March 9, 1959
Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
Sighted at 9:20 p.m., March 5, 1959. Object observed was round, brilliant, gold in color, and about the size of the full moon. It moved slowly from east to west, and disappeared behind trees and buildings at the end of sighting. The object was silhouetted against the night sky and was observed for about one minute. It made no sound and left no trail.

The witness is reliable and all right. He will not stand the publicity so his name should not be published for it.
