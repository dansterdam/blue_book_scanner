FILE NO.			SUBJECT
TO: SAMUEL R. RUSSELL		Report of Sighting Unidentified Flying Object
(ATCC)			FROM: MAJOR		DATE 7/28/52	COMMENT NO. 1
1. On Wednesday evening, 23 July 1952, at 2015 hours, an unfamiliar object was noted in the sky at approximately a 15 degree angle from the vertical due south from South Charleston, West Virginia.
2. When first sighted, the object had the appearance of two white lights similar to a star, but much brighter. The object appeared to be approximately 1.5 to 2 miles high and 1/4 or 1/2 apart as viewed from the ground.
3. On the appearance of the aircraft, the object ascended vertically and became progressively smaller. The aircraft made a circle and came under the object again. As this time, the object was so distant as to be merged into the cloud formation. At approximately 20,000 and 40,000 feet, the object was estimated to be about 15 feet in diameter.
4. It was estimated that the object was again as high as the aircraft, approximately 20,000 to 40,000 feet. The aircraft would make a third pass, the object was so distant as to be merged into the clouds and became disappears.
