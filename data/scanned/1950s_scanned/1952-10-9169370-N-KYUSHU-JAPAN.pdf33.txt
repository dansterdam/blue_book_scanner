Subject: Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by 2nd Lt. John Mamara, AO-2, USAF, Pilot 
Summary: On 27 October 1952, the pilot observed a reddish-orange, flashing, elliptical object at an estimated altitude of 50,000 feet. The object was observed for about 5 to 10 minutes and then disappeared.
Details: 2nd Lt. John Mamara, AO-2, USAF, Pilot, observed a reddish-orange, flashing, elliptical object on 27 October 1952, at 2:20 p.m., 30 miles southwest of SHIRAHA-SHIMA, and 20,000 feet altitude. This object moved in that general direction, but it appeared they were "painting" something in that general direction. As it approached the plane at about 3,000 feet, it flashed a bright light and then made a sharp turn and disappeared from sight. The pilot complied with instructions to conform with "Conform Yellow" procedure and replied that he had visual contact but appeared to conform yellow to go below and friendly to the object, and it continued on a course outbound from the plane.
Friendly then landed under an overcast and object disappeared.
The foregoing was a true and complete narrative of the flight of "Conform Yellow" from 1740 to 1827 on 27 October 1952.
