The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the analysis of an unidentified flying object sighting.

The text in the document reads:

NO interruption in the grading processing indicates the original transparency shows no interruption in the grading.  This gradually obliterates the clouds in the upper portion but the body of the object remains fixed in its original position.  The contour lines begin to appear which indicate the object is not saucer-shaped but rather of an unusual configuration.

In our investigation, no single clue was uncovered which in our files is listed as a UAO --- Unconventional Aerial Object.
