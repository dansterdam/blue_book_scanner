Dover AFB, Del.
22 February, 1953

On 22 February 1953 at about 1940 hours in the Central Dover area of Dover, Del., a resident of Dover observed an unusual aerial phenomenon, which was described as follows:

The witness stated that on the evening of 22 February 1953, at about 1940 hours, he observed a bright reddish-orange light in the sky which appeared to be stationary. This light was observed for several minutes and then began to move rapidly to the east, making a 90 degree turn, and then disappeared from view.

The witness described the object as reddish-orange in color, approximately the size of the moon, and was clearly visible to the naked eye. At times, the object appeared to pulsate or change in intensity. The witness estimated the speed of the object as approximately 400-500 mph. Attempts were made to locate the object again, but it was not observed.

This incident was reported to the Dover Air Force Base on 23 February 1953. The object was not detected on radar and no aircraft were reported in the area at the time of the sighting.
