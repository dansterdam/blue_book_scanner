Reports Three
Flying Discs

Herald staff writes:
Excited sky watchers in South Florida reported seeing three mysterious discs or flying saucers over the state early Sunday morning, August 3, and answering the questions given in recent "flying saucer" reports.

The light was seen by several people in different locations, according to the accounts. One man said he saw the discs hovering over the sea for more than 20 minutes.

Three Miami Beach residents reported seeing one of the 40-foot discs shortly before 3 am, Sunday, disappearing towards the north over the water at high speed. They described the object as a brilliant light, apparently supported on a dark frame, which swooped across the sky as they watched.

One witness declared it was "as large as 40 or 50 feet across from our angle," and was maneuvering rapidly in various directions before zooming out over the ocean at tremendous speed, disappearing in a few seconds.

Several others reported seeing similar objects at about the same time in nearby Hollywood, Fla. and elsewhere. One woman said she saw three separate objects fly over her Hollywood home, hovering, then speeding away.

The Navy dispatched the USS Coral Sea to the area to investigate, but the objects had disappeared by the time the ship arrived on the scene.
