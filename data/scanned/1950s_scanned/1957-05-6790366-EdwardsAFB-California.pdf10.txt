The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book report. There is no visible photograph in this image, only text describing a reported UFO sighting over the "United States secret testing grounds" at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

The text describes how the object was observed by a camera crew, who took a series of photographs as the object moved away. The object is described as changing shape from round to elliptical, with a "wind pat" correlated with its movements. The report states that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise theodolite measurements could not be made to confirm the object's size, elevation and bearings.

The case is considered to have been "improperly handled" and the Edwards AFB PIO officer made statements that it was "unknown", noting that further local inquiries could have helped solve the case.
