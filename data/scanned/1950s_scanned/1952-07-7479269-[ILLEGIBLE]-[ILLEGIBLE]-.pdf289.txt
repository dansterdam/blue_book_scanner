STATEMENT OF: Pvt J. Gaeke

UNCLASSIFIED

While searching for targets on our 584 we picked up several moving targets almost directly overhead - Range 10,000 - 15,000 yds and shifting about in azimuth time was about 0930 hrs.

Several minutes later we picked up and tracked a similar target slightly north and east of our location at between 29,000 and 30,000 yds - not moving considerably in A.z. or E.l.
