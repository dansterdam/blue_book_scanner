SIGNED STATEMENT

I, Warren J. Sigmundson, 2nd Lt., USAF, AO 12613792, 34th Air Division 
(Def.), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On Friday evening 17 October 1952, at approximately 2115 MST, I 
observed a strange object in the sky. While sitting in the Municipal 
Stadium, watching a local football game, I happened to look to the north 
and saw what appeared to be a very large meteor, the path of fall was 
almost vertical and toward magnetic north. The object gave off a bright 
bluish-green color, and emitted a sudden flash when it disappeared from 
view.

It is extremely difficult to describe the size of the object because, 
as the moon, it was only in sight for two (2) seconds. It was, however, 
larger than the average falling star, the object appeared to twist itself 
out rather than fall from sight. This was borne out by the approach 
flash at the end of the fall. Estimates on speed was other factors of 
which it would be impossible to give an accurate estimate due to the 
leet of comparable size.

/S/ Warren J. Sigmundson

Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 21st day of October 1952.
