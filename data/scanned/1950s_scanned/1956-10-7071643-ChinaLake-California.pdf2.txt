Definite identification of your sighting has not been made as yet. However, the information will be used in our continuing investigation, and analysis of the incidents in question.

The matter is under certain examination and you are located in an area which is surrounded by a number of flight-test stations, air-fields and other related military activity. As a review of a detailed map will indicate.

From your brief description and speed of the objects observed, the possibility that they were meteors or jets may be given consideration. However, on the basis of your statement that the objects hovered, it does not appear that they conform to the former. You may rest assured that the matter will be given proper study.

Your interest in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

ROBERT E. O'CONNOR 
Captain, USAF
