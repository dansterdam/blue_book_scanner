Tiffin, Ohio 
Case 11-6783215
November 6, 1957

On November 6, 1957, at approximately 7:10 pm, the witness, a male resident of Tiffin, Ohio, observed a strange aerial phenomenon in the sky over his home. 

The witness stated that he was outside in his backyard when he noticed a bright, glowing object in the eastern sky. The object appeared to be spherical in shape and was emitting a pulsating light. As the witness observed the object, it began to move slowly across the sky in a northerly direction. 

The witness estimated the size of the object to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter. He also reported that the object appeared to have a rod or antenna-like structure extending from it. 

The witness observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared from view behind a tree line. He immediately reported the sighting to the local police department, who in turn notified the United States Air Force.

An investigation was conducted by the Air Force, but no definitive conclusions were reached regarding the identity or origin of the observed object. The case was subsequently classified as an "unidentified" under Project Blue Book.
