UFO RESEARCH ORGANIZATION
1309 FOREST GLEN DRIVE
CUYAHOGA FALLS, OHIO
April 12, 1958

Major Lawrence J. Tacker
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker:

My letter of March 11, 1958 has still not been answered. I request that you investigate this matter as an urgent case. In this letter I mentioned an incident which occurred on March 5th or 6th, and I still await your detailed comments.

On March 5th or 6th, at approximately 7:00 P.M., some natural falling from the sky was reported in the Ohio area. It was a large ball of fire which seemed to descend very slowly in a southerly direction. The material fell in this area which is in the extreme southwestern portion of Cuyahoga County, near the Geauga County line.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Director
