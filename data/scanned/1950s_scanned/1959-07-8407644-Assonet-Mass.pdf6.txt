The text in the report is as follows:

INDIANA FAMILY CHASES SAUCERS:
On the night of July 9th, a family living in the rural area near Columbus, Indiana, said that they witnessed a group of several white lights in the sky near their home. They told officials that the lights seemed to play around and disappear from sight before reappearing and then repeating this activity several times. The family tried to chase the lights by car but could not keep up with them. They said the lights seemed to be traveling at tremendous speeds. The father of the family said he thought he could have thrown a rock and hit them, they were so low. These lights remained in the sky for about an hour, then they flew of out sight. Local officials identified the lights as being similar to Air Force night training flights, but this explanation does not fit the facts as told by the family.
