"WITH FIREBALL X XX23A - A WESTERN AIRLINES PILOT WHO SIGHTED THE FIREBALL WHICH WAS SEEN OVER SEVERAL WESTERN STATES TODAY SAID HE IS INCLINED TO DISCREDIT THE THEORY THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A METEORITE, BUT PROBABLY SOME OTHER OBJECT.

HOWEVER, HE SAID THE CREW DID NOT DISCUSS THE SIGHTING AND COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO IT. ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE, HE ADDED, THIS WAS NO FLYING SAUCER CONCERN TO US. IT WAS SO IMPRESSIVE BE KEPT OUR EYE ON IT DURING THE COMPLETE ENCOUNTER. WE KNOW WHAT WAS BEHIND US AND WHAT WAS BEFORE US. THIS DEFINITELY WAS NO FLYING SAUCER.

HX24A - ADD WITH FIREBALL X XX3 TO DISINTEGRATE AIRCRAFT SUDDENLY SAID THAT THEY REPORTED SIGHTING SOMETHING THAT WITHIN SECONDS AFTER THEY REPORTED SIGHTING IT DISINTEGRATED INTO A ROCKET OR MISSILE HAD BEEN FIRED AND ENDANGERED HIS PASSENGERS. HE REPORTED HE COULD NOT TAKE EVASIVE ACTION. SCHULTZ SAID THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT FOR ABOUT A MINUTE. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 10,000 TO 15,000 MILES AN HOUR."
