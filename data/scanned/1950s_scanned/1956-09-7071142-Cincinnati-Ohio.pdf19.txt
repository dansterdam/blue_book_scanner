The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, but it does not contain any photographs. Instead, it is text-based and provides information about "The World of Flying Saucers" and discusses various types of "angel hair" that have been observed, particularly in industrial areas. The text mentions incidents where angel hair has been collected and analyzed.

Galley 81 â€” THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Other Varieties of Angel Hair
Several types of angel hair, not of known terrestrial origin, have been reported in industrial areas, particularly in and near cities. When the filtering system of such a factory fails to be carried away by the wind and eventually disappears, its base may be found to have characteristics differing from the normal industrial waste. Some types of angel hair, especially if the residues break and disappear, can in particular be mistaken for by-products of industrial processes. Scientists at this and other centers can often determine with ATIC, in identifying unknown substances, that they are of unearthly origin.
Late in the afternoon of September 25, 1956, a housewife in Cincinnati, Mrs. Bertha B., told news reporters that while she was in her yard, she had found some angel hair. She described the hair as white, filmy, and diaphanous, with fibers about the diameter of a human hair. When she touched it, it disintegrated and blew away. Mrs. B. collected some of the remains and sent it to the Air Force for analysis. ATIC investigated the material and identified it as waste products from a local industrial plant.
