35. When did you report to some official that you had seen the object?

36. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
(Circle One) Yes No

36.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too?
(Circle One) Yes No

36.2 Please list their names and addresses:
As I don't believe it would have been possible to get the others, and also because I don't know the correct direction where I was looking. I would also hesitate to mention anyone by name without their permission.

37. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this?
(Circle One) Yes No

37.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?
On Dec. 13, 1954 at 7:25 p.m. (CST) I saw a group of 5 or 6 objects silently traveling east to west, quite a distance from my home. They seemed to be about two blocks from my home. It was traveling east with perhaps a tendency towards the southeast.

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
That it was some kind of unmanned flying device, a test model perhaps, or an optical illusion of some sort. As I said in my letter, it would not have been a guess. As I wrote, I have never claimed to have observed a "flying saucer" and I wouldn't want to foster that guess. It was rather an attempt to be helpful in supplying information that might be of value to those engaged in the investigation. I hope the enclosed information will be helpful.
