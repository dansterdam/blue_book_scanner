DRAFT 21 Oct.

Dear Mr. Baumgart:

I refer to your inquiry concerning the interest of Mrs. (redacted) of Sheffield Lake, Ohio, concerning an unidentified flying object she saw on 21 September 1958.

Air Force investigators arrived in Sheffield, Ohio, on 3 October 1958, contacted Mrs. (redacted) and also initiated other phases of an investigation to possibly evaluate this sighting.

Investigation revealed that a railroad track ran near the home of Mrs. (redacted). The right of way of this track was sighting a train passed the house at approximately the same hour of the reported sighting. The train had a rotating headlight which under some conditions would produce unusual effects.

Contact was also made with Chief Bosun Mate William Schott of the Lorain Coast Guard Station. Chief Schott reported that he was using his spotlight in an attempt to attract the attention of another ship, and that the light was directed toward shore in the general direction of Mrs. (redacted) house. The time and date of this incident coincide with those reported by Mrs. (redacted). Mrs. (redacted) of Lorain, Ohio, a witness listed in Mrs. (redacted) report, couldn't recall anything unusual on the night of the reported sighting. Mr. (redacted), another witness of Lorain, Ohio, was not available for interview. The weather at the time of the incident was a misty rain with haze and smoke.

Conclusion of Air Force investigators were that the combination of moving lights, noise of the train and prevailing weather account for the illusion experienced by Mrs. (redacted). The Air Technical Intelligence Center, after evaluating the evidence in this case, concurred with the conclusion of the investigators.
