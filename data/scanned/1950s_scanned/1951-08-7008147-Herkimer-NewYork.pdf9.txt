where "A" is the Angle of View about 60° as permitted by opening between trees.

"B" Glow from unseen object first became visible.

"C" Unknown position of object at moment its glow became visible. 

"D" Unknown radius of the object's "glow". Presumably not lower than this over the trees since object’s glow did not light up foliage on trees as it approached nearer, i.e., had to pass below (D.E.) and sweep in towards observer due to closeness of approach, that is, went to infinity straight up the page as it passed. 

"E" Volume of object itself became visible about a second after its glow was first noted.

"F" End of object's visible flight of 3-5 seconds duration and being of unknown altitude and speed. Object's declination about 30° from zenith.

Oct. 21, 1953.
