1. Referenced the attached letter from regarding an unidentified flying object report on 11 Nov 57.
2. Our records indicate no reports from the Springfield, Missouri area on 11 Nov 57. However, an FTD form 14a may be forwarded to them to fill out. It should be stated though, that due to a lapse of many months it may not be possible to positively identify their sighting.
