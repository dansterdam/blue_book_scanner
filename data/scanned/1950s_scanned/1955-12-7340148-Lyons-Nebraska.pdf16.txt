more. Some claim to have observed it come within a
few feet of the ground before shooting back up into

ahead of him.
The fireball has been described by various witnesses

a high rate of speed, making sharp turns and then
darting upwards at a steep angle.
There has been much speculation in the Ord vicinity
as to the nature of the fireball. Some believe it is a
mysterious celestial phenomenon, while others think
it may be some type of aircraft.
Residents of the Ord area are keeping a close watch
