WASHINGTON, MARCH 17--(UP)--THE NAVY SAID TODAY THAT A WEATHER BALLOON, NOT A FLYING SAUCER, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A REPORTED SIGHTING OVER THE UNITED STATES. COMMANDER JOHN M. FORD, OF THE NAVY'S OFFICE OF PUBLIC INFORMATION, SAID THE NAVY'S TRACKING PROGRAM HAS REVEALED MANY SUPPOSEDLY MYSTERIOUS AERIAL OBJECTS TO BE WEATHER BALLOONS.

THE AUTOMATIC TIMING DEVICE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE CAUSED THE BALLOON'S COURSE AND SPEED TO CHANGE, WHICH WOULD HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE SIGHTING. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE TIMING DEVICE DID NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY.

IT WAS NOT EXPECTED TO SOAR BEYOND THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IT DRIFTED INTO THE UPPER AIR STREAMS AND WAS GOING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE FLIGHT WAS PLANNED TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW TYPE PLASTIC BALLOON CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING PRESSURE, ALTITUDE AND POSITION DATA UNTIL RADIO CONTACT WAS LOST.

Balloon released from Stanton, Minn. at 1220 A.M. EST Friday, 13 March 1959. It was not expected to soar beyond the United States. However, it drifted into the upper air streams and was going at a high rate of speed, more than 100 miles an hour at a height of 34,000 feet. The flight was designed to test the feasibility of a new type of plastic balloon equipped with instruments to transmit pressure, altitude and position data until radio contact was lost.
