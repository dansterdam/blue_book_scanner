DETAILS:

Investigation opened at the direction of the District Commander, pursuant to receipt of information furnished by Mr. C. (CENSORED), regarding sighting of an aerial object over Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 6 September 1952.

The following information was furnished by Mr. C. (CENSORED):

He, Mr. C. (CENSORED), reported that he, his wife and small daughter, were sitting in the patio of their home and at 2115 hours had sighted a round object, apparently metallic in appearance, hovering and maneuvering over Albuquerque. The object was approximately the size of a basketball and was observed with the naked eye for about 15 minutes. It approached from a southwesterly direction, passed overhead and disappeared to the north. Northwesterly direction. The object appeared to be controlled in its flight and was very red in color, with a red tail and moved with a "jerky" motion. It did not estimate the speed of the object nor its altitude.
