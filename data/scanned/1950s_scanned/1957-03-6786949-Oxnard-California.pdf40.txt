The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR system, I will extract the text from the document:

FOUR MALES
Pilot observed to search the area he had
seen nothing, though airmen, police
and other ground observers clearly
saw the intense round objects which lighted
brilliant red light.
At least one of the four UFO's
observed by radar was almost directly
over Oxnard Air Force Base at this
time. (Operators' signed report included
the following account this matter which
will be called Operator 1).
The time was 2330 (11:50 p.m.).
With several other CAA men, Operator
1 was on duty in the Municipal Airport
control tower, Oxnard, California.
"We were watching the radar scope,"
he related. "Suddenly, we noticed
3 unidentified objects (about
the size of a basketball) moving northwest
at a speed estimated to be around
700 miles per hour. Moving in
a southeasterly direction at the same
speed and approaching the base were
3 more objects - the same size, speed,
and apparent characteristics as the first
3 that had passed over."
"I notified the base and the tower
operators' signed report will be included
This matter is most important
and mystery. Unidentified flying objects
that move at such incredible speed, stop,
and hover can be explained only by the
fact that they represent some sort of
'special' aircraft, unknown to us and
operating in our air space. This, I believe,
merits the most careful study and
investigation."
