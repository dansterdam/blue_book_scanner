The annotations in handwriting are partially obscured and not entirely clear, but they appear to be signatures or initial notations and possibly reference to "No! Sputnik II," with additional comments related to the satellite's re-entry or crash date. The words "Not! CCC" and "Charleville" followed by a signature or initial are also legible.
