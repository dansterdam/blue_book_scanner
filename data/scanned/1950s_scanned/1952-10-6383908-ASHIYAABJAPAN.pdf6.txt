STATEMENT 

On the evening of the 18th of October 1952, I T/Sgt Raymond E. Chase, was on duty in the CCA trailer located at Ashiya AB Base, Japan. 

I observed moving with the other targets. These targets appeared to be identical with slow moving aircraft. These targets had no definite course or formation, but moved from north to south. At one time five targets appeared. 

The lower informed us they could not see anything in that area.

These targets also were on the elevation scope appearing between 200 and 500 feet in the air.

I have been in CCA 21 months. Do not know what these targets were and do not wish to guess.
