AREA REPORTED ON: Simiutak (BW-3), Greenland

SUMMARY: 
1. At 14:42, 24 June 1953, A/C Richard A. Hill AF 11 173 575, a weather observer with three years experience, was tracking a weather balloon at an altitude of approximately 13,000 feet near the town of Simiutak, Greenland (61N, 46341W). The object was sighted instantly upon explosion of the 100 gram balloon, and was described as 1/2 Hill's state the object had burst the balloon. Description of the object at this time was expressed by the observer as being a "silvery, metallic, circular shaped" object which appeared to climb rapidly under the balloon explosion. The object continued to rise at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet (according to the observer's estimates) for fifteen seconds, then flashed as the altitude gained and finally disappeared after five minutes.  Object was seen by subject individual only.
2. The observer stated that the object disappeared in a northwesterly direction and was under observation for approximately 5 minutes. Winds were calm for five minutes as the object disappeared from view. This correlated with winds aloft at Simiutak showing winds at 10,000 feet 120 degrees at 16 knots, 12,000 feet 120 degrees at 16 knots, 15,000 feet 140 degrees at 20 knots, at Simiutak. The visual and radar reported at the heights between 13,000 and 15,000 feet were estimated at 150 to 200 miles per hour.
