DATE OF INCIDENT: 31 DECEMBER 1952
TIME OF INCIDENT: 1235CST
SUMMARY: (give details of incident. Use additional blank space if necessary. Expand any abbreviated words)
Automatic Gunlaying Radar set (similar to one half of a AN/APS-ll equipped with an APQ-13 installed in the nose under the bombardier's compartment) noted several bogies being tracked intermittently by the ATA of the AGC. Radar set for a period of approximately 90 minutes. Pilots of F-86's observed a flight of unknown objects which were identified by the ATC and ARTC radar sets. The flight plan and report are attached.
Although nothing could be seen by any of the members of the crew, the following facts are noted:
a. The phenomenon was detected by both radar sets.
b. The behavior of attempting to remain 3000 to 4000 yards in front of the F-86 during descent from 40,000 to 15,000 feet was unexplainable, and seemed to indicate that something intelligent was guiding it.
