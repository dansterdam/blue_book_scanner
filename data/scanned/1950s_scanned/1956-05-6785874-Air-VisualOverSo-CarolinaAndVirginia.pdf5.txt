The text in the document describes a sighting of a "cross-country flight from Eglin AFB to Rolling AFB" on May 10, 1957. The report provides details about the sighting, including the speed, altitude, and behavior of the observed object.

Here is the full text transcribed from the document:

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112 
REPORT NO.: ID-JSOE-l, PART THREE 
  
AFB: I sighted a cross-country flight from Eglin AFB to Rolling AFB, about 22:00 EST, 10 May 57. This was the third sight of the object. We had two previous sightings at Eglin AFB 500 feet AGL (above ground level) and the other 10,000 feet AGL. This was the first sighting of the object. I made sure it was not a star first by watching it for a few minutes the greet of the flight it was moving at a tremendous speed, and I estimate it was traveling about 1500 to 2000 mph. It was approximately 5000 feet MSL (mean sea level) and seemed to be elliptical in shape. This was seen for a few minutes, but in a few minutes the object seemed to accelerate to an even higher rate of speed and soon disappeared from sight. The object apparently had the sun's rays reflecting off its surface, although the sun's rays could not have fully covered the surface. The object appeared to be translucent and there seemed to be a dark spot on its surface as small as it was would appear round and (2) a transparent object in the pallion, which would appear only slightly lighted.
