11. COMMENTS
No conclusive evidence leading to conclusion can be reached. Case shows indications of a visual illusion or hoax. However, William Doles gave a reasonably good account and apparently was sincere. No other witnesses have come forward and no physical evidence was left. Case is unclassified awaiting further data for evaluation.
