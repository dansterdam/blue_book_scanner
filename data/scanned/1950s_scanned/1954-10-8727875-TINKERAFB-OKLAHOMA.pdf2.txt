The text of the document discusses several references in the report related to similarity to "UFO returns". It mentions that the "return" is due to a person signal, rather than a single target. It also describes the approach, turn around, and disappearance of the signal, which is caused by the PPI (Plan Position Indicator) of the radar system.
