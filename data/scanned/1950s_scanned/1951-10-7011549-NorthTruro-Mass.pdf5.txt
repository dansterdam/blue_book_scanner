Radar Report. - SEE CASE FILE
EVALUATION. 1: INSUFFICIENT DATA
The weather information does not support temperature-inverted anomalous propagation. There probably are other discrepancies in the upper atmosphere which could also cause anomalous propagation. The possibility that meteors entered the atmosphere and were detected cannot be disregarded, and may be the answer to this report. A meteor would cause ionization of the air which should increase the target detectability. Short duration of the condition supports this theory, rather than anomalous propagation.
