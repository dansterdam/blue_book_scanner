This page does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing an encounter between a fighter-interceptor squadron and an unidentified object.

I. Claine M. Jones, 1st Lt., AC 779830, assigned to the 56th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Kinderhoff Air Force Base, at approximately 2508207 Jul 52, I was number two man in a flight of two (2) F-94A-1 aircraft. We were in the air on a routine radar search from our target of approximately angles 11,500'. The target appeared to be metallic. 

I immediately made a gentle port turn and there upon the AO scope appeared a brilliant white dot of light. He gained for 1257 and to skim. And very shortly the FO asked for another pass. I made a turn and as I was approaching again, the target now appeared as 250 knots and approximately 3,000 feet. As I fired my bursts from my guns, I could see tracers going through but no damage indicated. At this time the target was flying above us and gaining us fast. Our angles was about 13,500'. We were in pursuit of the object which appeared larger than the F-94B which we had been using as the target.  

At no time was there a visual contact made with the unknown bodies. 

The foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge.
