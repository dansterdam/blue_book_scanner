The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Has American Airlines been intimidated also? Have they been forced to be an accomplice in this considered an infringement on his 'personal freedom'? Is this to be terminated by Air Force pressure? Why after the 'case and desist' of the ridiculous campaign? Does it consider the usual detailed procedure in security reasons, or is it to strengthen the unity of people in the UFO field? Contact should be made with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. 1950 Committee, IWW is wondering what they are in cooperation with ground observer pilots. It is strongly urged that the Association and members give this their unequivocal consideration.
