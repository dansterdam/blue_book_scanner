AIRCRAFT INCIDENT

Unidentified Aircraft Sighting
1200 HOURS, 24 AUGUST, 1953

This is to confirm a verbal statement made by the Superintendent of Air Navigation to you on 24 August, 1953.

2. Mr. reports as follows:

"At 1200 hours on 25 August, 1953, a circular object was observed in the vicinity of the Marine Workshops, Port Moresby, when a cloud building up suddenly in roughly a south-westerly direction from Port Moresby, at a very great height.

I watched this cloud, which grew in intensity for several minutes. Suddenly it opened, and in the centre I saw what appeared to be the shape or possible size of this object, as it appeared slightly larger than the cloud. But whatever it was, it soon disappeared in a very cloudy defined vapour trail behind it until it finally disappeared with a rapid gain of altitude."

I had my movie camera with me and photographed the whole thing on the telescope lense. I am waiting the results of the photograph to ascertain what the object might have been. It appeared to me to be some type of aircraft, high powered and of unusual configuration.

As far as I know, Air Traffic Control knew of no aircraft movements in that area, and in any case, from the extreme altitude of the object, it could not have been a civil aircraft.

Weather conditions at the time were cloudless.

To do not know of any operational performance implying this observation operating in this area at the time.
