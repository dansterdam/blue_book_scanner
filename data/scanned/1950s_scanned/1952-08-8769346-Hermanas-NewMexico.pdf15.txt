This page of the Project Blue Book report does not contain any photographs. The text of the document is as follows:

Two unidentified objects were first observed visually and with binoculars at 1615 PDT for a period of 1 hour and 15 minutes. They were described as silver in color, spherical in shape. They were described to be at an estimated speed of 400 to 450 mph. No sound was heard. The objects were moving from 2 to 9. One object appeared to be at an approximately 18,000' and the other at about 13,000'. The two objects appeared to be at a relatively 15 miles passing over head of the observers. During this time the objects at about 13,000' apparently rose to the approximate speed of 9 altitude as the lower objects. Then the objects reached a single altitude W of the observers, falling to a slightly different position, apparently disappearing into the sun momentarily. After appearing to disappear into the sun momentarily, the observers then sighted the same 2 objects at the approximate location from which they were lost from view. During the latter period of observation, 6 additional objects of similar description were observed 15 to 20 miles W of the observers. This made the total size to 8 similar objects observed in this area. These additional 6 objects came into view in a trailing position and continued with the original 2 objects apparently to be in a vertical direction. The observers stated that the objects took up a different formation repeatedly covering an estimated 4 mile area. The observers also stated that the objects were definitely not jet and had no visible trail, exhaust or sound and further stated that it was difficult to follow any one object for any length of time.

The weather officer at Holloman Air Force Base reported the weather as clear, ceilings high broken. This report indicates the possibility that the objects sighted might have been weather balloons.
