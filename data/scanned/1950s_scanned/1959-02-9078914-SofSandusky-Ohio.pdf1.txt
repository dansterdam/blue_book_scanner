10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Yellow-orange speck. Speck grew larger as they drove toward it leaving Sandusky. Yellow-green and larger as it passed and faded. Had a tail thrown off like a jet. Obj had an upper mush like the body of a shark, while the lower part was rather level or flat.

11. COMMENTS
Description is typical of any obj that is in the sky during the daytime hours. The flight path and high altitude jet aircraft. It is the opinion of this analyst that the observers probably saw an exhaust trail and contrail with some reflecting from it.
