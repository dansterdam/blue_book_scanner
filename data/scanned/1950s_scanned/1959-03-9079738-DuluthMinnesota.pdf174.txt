ABILITY: SOURCE WAS FRIENDLY AND SEEMED TO BE SINCERE. HE WAS DISTURBED BY
WHAT HE OBSERVED AND FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT HIS SIGHTING WAS THAT OF
A DEFINITE MILITARY AIRCRAFT RATHER THAN THAT OF A CONVENTIONAL
AIRCRAFT ENGAGED IN ROUTINE NIGHT FLIGHT.
DETAILS OF SIGHTING: 1ST LT. WRIGHT C. McGUINE, PILOT, AND I WERE FLYING ON A
ROUTINE INSTRUMENT CHECK FLIGHT IN A USAF T-33 AIRCRAFT. WHILE PASSING THROUGH
50,000 FT., HEADING EAST, MAKING ABOUT 350 KNOTS, WE SAW A BRILLIANT LIGHT
OFF OUR RIGHT WING. IT APPEARED TO BE ON A SOUTH HEADING. OBJECT INCREASING
IN SIZE RAPIDLY, SEEMED TO BE DIRECTLY ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH US. I
WAS TRYING TO LOCK ON THE TARGET AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS TRAVELING IN
DIRECTION CONTRARY TO OUR OWN, CLOSING RAPIDLY. AS WE NEARED THE OBJECT,
IT APPEARED TO SLOW DOWN UNTIL IT CAME TO COMPLETE STOP ABOUT 300 YDS. FROM
OUR AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECT WAS MAKING A DEFINITE GLOW AND APPEARED TO BE ROUND
OR DISC-SHAPED. THE COLOR WAS A BRILLIANT WHITE-ORANGE. OBJECT REMAINED
STATIONARY FOR ABOUT TWO (2) MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME THE RADAR OBSERVER
IN OUR AIRCRAFT WAS UNABLE TO PICK UP ANY RETURN. ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT WAS IN
FULL VIEW OF BOTH PILOTS, THE RADAR OPERATOR COULD NOT DETECT IT.
AFTER REMAINING STATIONARY FOR ABOUT TWO (2) MINUTES, THE OBJECT ACCELERATED
TO A FANTASTIC SPEED AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE DISTANCE, LEAVING ONLY A
BRIGHT TRAIL OF LIGHT. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO ACCELERATE SO RAPIDLY THAT
IT SEEMED TO EXTEND INTO A STRAIGHT LINE OF LIGHT WHEN OBSERVED.
