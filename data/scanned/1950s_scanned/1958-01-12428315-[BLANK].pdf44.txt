The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

WHEDON: (Cont'd)
Facilities all the way across the
Pacific ... it meanders all over
the country before it finally sailed
off into the Atlantic. This resulted
in literally dozens of UFO reports.

CUT BACK TO EDWARDS
EDWARDS:
On that basis, then, some large 
percentage of Flying Saucer re-
ports are actually nothing but
balloons.

WHEDON:
Right.

CUT TO MASTER CHART OF TABULATED UFO
REPORT. IT NOW SHOWS: "BALLOONS -
26.4%"
Figures show that balloons account
for 26.4% of all recent UFO sight-
ings!

CUT BACK TO EDWARDS AND WHEDON.
EDWARDS:
Let's take another case, Colonel.
