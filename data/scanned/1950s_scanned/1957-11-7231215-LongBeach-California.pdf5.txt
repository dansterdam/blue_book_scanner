SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information (Herbert S. Taylor)

TO: HQ USAF SAF-OIPT (Mrs Geiser)
WASH 25 D.C.

1. Reference the attached letter from Herbert S. Taylor, dated 31 Oct 63, requesting information on unidentified objects recently seen from him.

2. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply:

a. The 29 Jan 51 sighting at Sioux City, Iowa, carried an initial conclusion of mirage. However, subsequent review indicates there may have been possible comment to indicate this sighting involving the planet
Jupiter in the west. The star Deneb was in the Northwest as the reporting aircraft pilot took off and the engine in the East.

b. The Long Beach sighting of 7 Nov 57 has been evaluated as possibly caused by the bright Venus planet at the time, there were approximately 10 aircraft in the vicinity of the airport at the time of the sighting. There is no report of remarkable maneuvers associated with this observation.

c. The case still retains its original evaluation as adequate.
