II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a very likable adolescent. He seemed to be quite reliable and his account to be as accurate as possible. Sheriff White said that he is level headed and quite reliable.

III. CIRCUMSTANCES: According to his story, on March 26 when the sky was clear and the wind was calm, the source was walking along the road near his home about 10:55 (0330Z) on March 26 when he noticed something in the sky. At first he thought it was an airplane, but as he watched it, it became clear that it was not an airplane, but a very bright star. The only difference was that it changed colors and seemed to be hovering over a nearby hill. He continued to watch it for about 15 minutes. During this period it suddenly became smaller and went out of sight. He said he heard no sound and the object was about the size of a half moon at its largest. He could not detect any details or markings on the object and it did not seem to have a tail or wings. The whole sighting lasted only about 15 minutes.
