AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
I/O 5275b, 2gan Up, APO329, IR-1-53
STATEMENT:

At approximately 2127I, 26 Feb 53, 1 observed a strange star-like object in the sky. It was 2-3 times larger than a star, white in color and appeared to be pulsating. It was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes. At one time it seemed to divide into 2 separate objects only to reform again as a single object. The object then appeared to descend and became obscured by clouds. It did not appear to have any sound or exhaust and disappeared from sight.
