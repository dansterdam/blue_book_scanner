The image appears to contain two photographs. The larger one shows a rural landscape with a building in the distance, while the smaller one shows some trees and power lines silhouetted against the sky.

The text accompanying the images describes the general height of the trees in the area where the Shene man sighting took place. It states that the UFO was first seen and traversed its course at tree top level, with an estimated altitude of traverse of 60 to 100 feet.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:
