"NO CASE (Information Only)

Case 163. Bromley, Ky., July 1 or 2, 1956--The sighters, Mr. and Mrs. Bromley, are not sure of the date, but they are certain they saw a huge glowing object about a quarter of a mile through their bedroom window. It was about 3 a.m. Both were awakened at the same instant by the intense yellow glow and lift-off from the ground. To him it appeared round and self-luminous. Reassuring himself that he was not being deceived by hallucination, he watched the object for a short time, the following night, but saw nothing."
