When the searchlight was lit again, the ball was still there.

Curious onlookers crowded around the searchlight; they also saw the “ball
of the Christmas tree”. They saw it up to the moment when (around 2300 hours)
the crew gave up, and decided to extinguish the searchlight. However, they
were not the only ones who saw it; the next morning, inhabitants of the suburbs
of Sablon and Queuleu, had to confirm the appearance of the phenomenon.

But, the radar apparatus, which had scanned the skies without interruption,
did not record anything.

”This 'thing'," explained one of the technicians, is non-metallic and, there-
fore, not detectable by radar.

The day-before-yesterday, the Metz Fair, which had been visited by more
than 600,000 visitors, closed its doors: no more searchlight, no more radar,
no more mysterious spheres. Nothing is left, but the testimony of a dozen
people; the searchlight operators, an officer of the Geographic Service of the
Army, and Commander Cottel, who’s report is impatiently awaited in the mansion
of the military governor. The curiosity, which can be well imagined, will make
the flying saucers an historic event.

Three little Beings in an Electric Saucer

Nevers, October 13

Two merchants of Clamecy, Mr, Louis Vigneron and Henri Gallois, who were
on their way to the fair at Corbigny, noticed, yesterday morning around six-
o’clock, from their little truck, a craft of cylindrical form and of a fairly
large diameter, appearing at a distance of approximately 50 meters.

At the same instant, the engine of the truck stopped and the headlights
went out.
