SUBJECT: Letter from C/M Pucinski
Pucinski's draft of a suggested reply to Congressman Pucinski with reference his letters from Mr. ___ ____ ___ ___ is sent for your concurrence.
A search of the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center's UFO files reveals no case reported for Illinois on 4 November 1957, nor is there a case for the area on the 3rd or 5th of November 1957.
The case referenced as taking place on 19 July 1958 actually occurred on 20 July 1958. The object was sighted in the Crystal Lake area of Illinois and was identified by the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center analyst as a balloon. The description of the object, position of the sun, and wind vector substantiate this conclusion.
This sighting took place during the month of November 1957 which recorded more UFO sightings than most years. (See attached press release.)
