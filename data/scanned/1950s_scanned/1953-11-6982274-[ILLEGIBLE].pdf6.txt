The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a scanned document page. The text on the page describes a "flying saucer" controversy in England, where the meteorological office in London reported a "white disc" sighting by two fliers and registered observers. The text mentions that this sighting is being investigated as a possible new aircraft.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

The people in England are up in the air over a new "flying saucer" controversy. The Meteorological Office in London says a "white disc" reported by two fliers and registered observers "is nothing but a weather balloon." Another official claims the alleged "flying saucer" fits the description of a new aircraft being developed for the power.
