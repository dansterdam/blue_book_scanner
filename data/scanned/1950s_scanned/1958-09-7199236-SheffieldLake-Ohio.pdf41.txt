From the train and the prevailing weather conditions: It is not uncommon for persons having the same type of observations to comment on the occurrence of the same unusual conditions as a matter of interest and is the opinion of the investigator that this incident was probably of a nature that might at any time come to the attention of the general public.

The incident reports analyzed by a man with a background in astronomy and physics.
