THE KEARNEY INCIDENT                                                                                   45

tures, when I have described these 
wafers, the ladies have been very in-
terested in them because it would
solve their cooking and dishwashing
problems. I do not know what the
space people ate.
While we were sleeping the craft
hovered in space about six or seven
miles above the earth. I inquired
whether this wasn't dangerous as 
another ship or a meteorite might
strike us. They assured me that there 
was no danger for they use an auto-
matic pilot during such times, and
if another ship came within range
it would avoid the ship we were on.
My bed was similar to the one to 
which I am accustomed, with a mat-
tress and made up with sheets, pil-
lows and blankets. The ship was al-
ways warm and remained at a con-
stant temperature. I do not know 
where the heat and light came from, 
but it was light all of the time. Even 
when we were beneath the surface
of the water the light glowed from
the ship for a distance of three or
four hundred feet or more.
Upon our return from the Arctic 
Circle, I drove my car out of the 
spacecraft, up Highway 6, and back
to Hollywood. As I left, the space
people told me they would see me a-
gain in the near future.
I had to get a new battery for my
1958 Buick, for the old one was com-
pletely dead the second day' after
my return. When it was tested at the
garage they found nothing but pure 
water in it. I also found, during my
earlier contacts, as described in Part
I of this book, that each time I was
stopped by the spacecraft, the bat-
tery in my 1955 Buick boiled dry. 
One time the top of the battery was
completely blown off as if a great
pressure had been exerted below it,
and a black tar-like substance had
spread over the top.
This concludes the report of my
contacts with the people from the
Planet Saturn up to the present
time. However, I shall be watching
for I am sure they will keep their
promise to return again soon.
