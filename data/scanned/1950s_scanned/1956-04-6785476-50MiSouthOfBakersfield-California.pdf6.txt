b. Name address:
Mr. [redacted]
Bakersfield, Calif.
37. Was this the first time you have seen such an object? Yes.
38. Do you opinion what the the object was? In my opinion what he said about the object was as follows: It was silvery and shaped like an ordinary high-speed aircraft with the characteristics of a jet. However, it appeared as if it had a very flexible tail or wing section, which seemed to change and maneuver unlike any jet or conventional aircraft I have ever seen. At this time, my friend and I thought it was some new experimental aircraft from one of our own secret guided missile test ranges. However, a few seconds later, it disappeared into the sky at a fantastic rate of speed.
39. Estimated speed. It disappeared so fast it could not be measured.
40. Which way was it travelling at the time - straight, up, down, left or right? It was travelling straight in a horizontal direction. 
41. Don't know - lost to view it vanished so quickly. I could say very fast.
