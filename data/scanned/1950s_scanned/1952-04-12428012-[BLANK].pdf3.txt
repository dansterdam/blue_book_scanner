we must disregard the satellite possibility in our investigation.

To come back at least a little closer to earth, we will discuss
for a moment some of the other lines of inquiry that have been
followed. I will give over now to Mr.      , of the Aircraft
and Propulsion Section, Technical Analysis Division, ATIC. Mr.
is an aeronautical engineer. He will give you an account of develop-
ments in other fields, again in consideration of all possibilities,
however remote. Mr.

Mr.        :

Let me speak first about guided missiles. The early history
of the operational use of this weapon is now quite well known. Its
first application was during World War II by Germany, with the
launching of the 1944 V-1 or "buzz-bomb" attack on London. These
missiles, although strange and fearful enough in many ways, did
resemble aircraft in basic configuration. Their speed was about three
hundred and fifty knots, and their range not more than one hundred
and forty nautical miles.
