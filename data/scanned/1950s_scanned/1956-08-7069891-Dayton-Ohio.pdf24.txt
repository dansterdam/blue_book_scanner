The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches and illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line to illustrate how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second larger sketch shows a person standing on a road with buildings in the background, and a smaller sketch in the corner showing a person standing on a hilltop or mountain.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
