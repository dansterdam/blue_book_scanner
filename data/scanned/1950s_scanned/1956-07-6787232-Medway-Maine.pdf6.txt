I. SOURCE:
Address: Star Route, Medway, Maine, (HEGA 2836) Age: 63

Occupation: Paper Mill Repairman, and one time guide for the Mt. Katahdin area.

Education: Grade School

Qualifications: Mr. M was for several years a guide in this area of the state, and is well acquainted with distances and directions which might be questioned in this matter.

II. RELIABILITY: As far as can be judged in the course of this investigation while talking with Mr. R and several of the neighbors who live near him, his reliability is irreproachable. Honesty and truthfulness have always been a great part of his makeup.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Mr. C in the company of a Mr. ware fishing at Debsconeag Dam, (HEKA 9347), approximately fifteen miles West of Millinocket, on Friday afternoon, 19 July 1956, when their attention was attracted to an object approaching from the Southeast, flying fairly close to the ground. It was judged to be approximately three to four hundred feet above the ground. The object's watched until it passed from view in the Northwest, behind the trees. The length of time required to pass from view, after sighting it, was from 20 to 30 seconds. They were not positive as to the exact time but judged it to be shortly after 192001 Jul 56, and were more positive that the sun could have nothing to do with what they saw. Even though the sun was shining brightly, there were no clouds visible from where they were located, or any other objects which could have been reflecting sunlight.

One thing which both men definitely believe, is that it was a solid object, and they had ample time to observe it fully, watching it from both directions. They observed the trail of fire which followed it, also the smoke trail which it left. The fire itself was far brighter than the background of the sky, and disappeared twice during the time the men were watching it. The flame emitting from the rear of the object was similar to that which is seen following a jet aircraft after dark. While coming from the top of the object at approximately the center of it, was a small flame of bright blue, which went straight up, curving with the force of the air after it left the object. The color of the object was a dark metal color. The flame trail was judged to be approximately twelve feet long.

During the time this object was observed by these two men it did not alter course and apparently did not come any closer to the ground. It seemed to be guided along a straight course, from the time they first saw it until it disappeared from view. One thing which they both thought very odd, was the fact that there was no sound whatsoever, and they both felt if it had enough force to push itself along, at the rate it was going, there definitely should have been some. The object was travelling directly against the wind which was blowing from the Northwest at the time.
