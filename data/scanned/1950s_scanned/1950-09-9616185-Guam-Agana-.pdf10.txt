This is one of the many reports submitted by Mr. [redacted] to the Air Force. Cannot comment on Mr. [redacted]'s insistence that a particular saucer has been following him for some distance (B) indicating it was seen in 1950; his original report of file, which caught up with him in a balloon where it knocked him out with its bright lights and then disks were seen hovering 360 degrees around his aircraft, but harmless. Believable as a Source is obvious, but hazardous to be considered a technical viewpoint, and reasons why such analysis can be initiated.
