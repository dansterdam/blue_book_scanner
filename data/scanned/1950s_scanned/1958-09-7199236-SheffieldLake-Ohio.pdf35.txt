SAFHI-2 ATIC: Maj. L. J. Tacker
ATIC-6-2 
On 7 October 1958, the Air Technical Intelligence Center received a letter from Mr. CR 3, the author of the incident, reporting a sighting of an unidentified flying object. Action was initiated by the ATIC on this date to have this sighting investigated by the 1002nd AICS.
On 21 September 1950, the witness was awakened by a very bright light which illuminated her bedroom. This light was elliptical in shape and about six feet in diameter, appearing approximately six to eight feet from the ground, moving slowly in a northerly direction towards the water. The object was approximately five to eight feet from the ground. The witness observed the object from the window for several minutes. At this time she saw two tail-light type lights on the sides of the object. These lights appeared to be amber in color and emitted a pulsating glow. The object moved slowly over the water and appeared to be approximately six feet in diameter and approximately six feet thick. The item was reported to have made several turns around the area and was estimated to have lasted 15-20 minutes.
The Air Force investigators arrived in Sheffield Lake, Ohio on 3 October 1959.
