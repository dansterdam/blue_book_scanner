COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
a. In the opinion of the investigating officer this sighting was undoubtedly caused by the star SIRIUS for the following reasons:
a. The position of the star SIRIUS as plotted by the UNITED STATES NAVY OBSERVATORY on the date of this sighting coincides very closely with the azimuth and elevation of the object observed.
b. During the period of this observation, this star has been unusually close to the horizon. This condition is an area accustomed to nightly oversets at this time of year would tend to attract attention to particularly.
c. The fact that SIRIUS observed object on succeeding nights in approximately the same position on each occasion indicates very strongly that sighting was astronomical.
d. Both sources stated that they now believe the object to be a particularly bright star.
