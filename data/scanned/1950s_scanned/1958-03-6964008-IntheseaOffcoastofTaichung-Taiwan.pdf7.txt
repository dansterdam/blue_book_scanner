11 MAY 59

REPORT CONTROL SYMBOL: CCTR-F 
63. GRS IM is the subject, as follows:

1. The report is forwarded to the Center as Inclosure No. 2 to GAFOIR letter R-1 of 6 Mar 59.

2. The report at this Center was been reviewed. No new facts have been established to substantiate the existence of an unidentified flying object.

3. Several details lend to a theory that this is a hoax, controlling a valve or other control attached to the main body of the metal rod. These details are:

a. The gelatinous texture and strange form of the object, which forms a central-recessed spot.

b. Section (Hl) shows trailing, fringes, which could be used to provide connection with a mechanism, which can be actuated in accord with the flight's motion.
  
c. The hemispherical ridges of opaque rubber (?) on the flat end of the bottle is strictly for prevention of shows and efforts to be fixed moves in the channel.

d. The lower metal collar being a black tubing of radio (x), joining a hermetic seal through which the real night object is another physical emotion.

e. The function of the main plastic channel with its metallic parts is not known. It may possibly be a device of adjusting the length of its rod (1) protruding beyond the first 2/3 of it.
