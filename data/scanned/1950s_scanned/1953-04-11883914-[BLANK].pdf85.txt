There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a document labeled "RESTRICTED SECURITY INFORMATION" and contains text about soil and vegetation samples that were studied during the month.

The text in the document reads as follows:

6. Type of film used

Simple standards could be established by which it should be possible to determine the source of light photographed with the camera and spectrographic equipment, at relatively little expense. It is believed that the camera and equipment will be most useful when the light is emitted by a single chemical element. If two or more elements are involved, analysis will be difficult with this simple recording device.

Soil and Vegetation Samples

During the month, two sets of soil and vegetation samples were studied by an agricultural specialist and by physicists.

Regarding the "Florida" samples, no difference was observed between the two samples of soil, but it was found that the root structure of the plants from the area in question was degenerated, apparently by heat, while the root structure of a control sample was undisturbed. In addition, the lower leaves, those nearest the ground under normal conditions, were slightly deteriorated, apparently by heat. No logical explanation is possible for this alteration of the first sample, beyond the suggestion that a high soil temperature around the plants could have been the cause. No radioactivity was found in any of these samples.
