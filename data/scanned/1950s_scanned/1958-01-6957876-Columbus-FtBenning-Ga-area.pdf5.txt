AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 12-58
PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

TO: Commanding General, 14 3533 Air Div. (Defense)
FROM: Commanding General, 14 Air Div.
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena
INCIDENT: This happened as he was certain that the phenomenon was under discussion; that the Air Force had collected reports on the same phenomenon and that he could not see how the descriptive data that he volunteered would differ from the data previously gathered. He stated that he would describe the sighting as described to him if requested to do so. The sighting occurred on 17 January 1958, in the Columbus, Fort Benning, Ga. area. The object was first observed at approximately 1900 hours and disappeared from sight at 2000 hours. The hovering object appeared and reappeared, moved rapidly from one point to another, and was described as illuminated, changing colors and seemingly giving off sparks. It was learned through the sighter's remarks that the phenomenon had sustained the interest of several people in the Columbus, Fort Benning, Ga. area and that this was about the third or fourth sighting of the same or similar phenomenon within the past few weeks.

Physical Evidence: None.

COMMENTS OF INVESTIGATING OFFICER:
Description of objects and circumstances indicates that they probably were some form of formation of the U. S. Air Force or some other U. S. Government agency aircraft, or some atmospheric phenomenon like ball lighting, etc., illuminated and producing unusual effects which could have caused the sighting. This type of phenomenon has been reported before and caused curiosity and speculation about their possible origin and nature.
