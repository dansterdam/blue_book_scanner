THE AIR FORCE RELEASES A "FLYING SAUCER"

WASHINGTON, July 12 W) - The Air Force announced today that a powerful new flare-type object seen recently in the sky was a "flying saucer" and that the Air Force was responsible for some of the reports of sightings of the mysterious objects.

Field officials were pleased with a visible demonstration, the announcement said, when the 10-foot diameter disc was released from a 30,000-foot altitude, discharging a bright magnesium flare which illuminated the sky.

The Air Force said in a statement that the object, described as a "flying saucer" was actually a special instrument package developed by experts at Wright Field, Ohio, and tested at high altitudes.

The package, using a magnesium powder as a power source, was designed to operate for a limited time at high speed and high altitude, the announcement said.

The power source is extremely high temperature. The powrer is contained in a hermetically-sealed container. When the container is opened, the powrer ignites at once, and the pilot can turn it on at will. The same device was used to gather scientific data at the high altitudes and was developed by Robert M. Gannon, a Massachusetts Caltech physicist, for the purpose of securing scientific information at extreme altitudes and at high speeds.
