Characteristics. The color of the light seemed to change from white to red as if the atmosphere had an effect on it as it gained altitude. Object unidentifiable due to darkness of night, speed of object, and position of observer. Object not audible. When on ground, nothing of a motor, engine, or other propulsion nature was noticed. Temperature approximately -20° and noise could be (have been) heard at very long distances with no wind at that temperature. Upon landing, (Pilot after F-94 landed) the object moved in an erratic flight path for a period of three minutes until it was pointed out again to the pilot and a ground crew members.(????) Then it took up a heading of 160° gaining speed until it looked like a falling star or meteor. Descending all the time, it continued to become a brighter red as it reached the earth. The light appeared to diminish its forward speed and descent to the earth as a helicopter would. At this point the light was noticeably more red than before. Time: 0996:16z to 0996:26z. Weather conditions: Night, VFR CAVU.
