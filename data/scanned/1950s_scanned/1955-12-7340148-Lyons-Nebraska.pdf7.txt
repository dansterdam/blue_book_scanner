METALLIC FRAGMENTS SPRAY OVER VESSEL 
Can 1227, Yakohia, Vatulele, Fiji Islands, December 27, 1955 - Whatever the origin and purpose of the objects (described as the inexplicable behavior) is much like the Auckland Star, December 27, '55 reported, during a lighting storm in the Fiji Islands. The Auckland Star reported on this incident, which resulted in a shower of metallic fragments that rained down on a vessel near Vatulele. Nobody was hurt. A passable explanation, said the Star, was that the metallic particles as a blinding-effect, caused by lightning. Such an explanation is plausible, but no evidence is given to confirm this. Harold Fulton, of CRIFO, New Zealand, who has made a study of such incidents, is not convinced.
