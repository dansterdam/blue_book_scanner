There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only text.

The craft rose vertically several hundred feet in the air, tilted, and accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed in an arc to the south southwest. The craft contained a very shiny metallic surface which reminded me of blue glacier ice. The top of the craft resembled a honeycomb. The craft appeared to be smooth, as if it were covered with some transparent material.

Around the midaction was a band like a scalloped wedding band. The bottom of the craft was also made of a smooth silver looking metal except for some darker areas. The craft appeared darker than the rest of the bottom, but not as dark as the scallops at mid-section. I could see the bottom of the craft rather distinctly and found it rather difficult to sketch.

I estimate the altitude to have been 400 feet above my position, perhaps less. Distance is about one-half mile. Diameter estimated 150-200 feet. Vertical one-fifth of diameter.

Second sighting was a two weeks or so later. The craft did not stay so long, nor was it in the same direction. It left in the time direction. I will look forward to visiting with you on your next trip to Boulder. Also I would be interested in what further information you might have concerning other sightings: Could it be of help in this area?
