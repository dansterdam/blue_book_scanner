TWO MORE VIEWED "FLYING SAUCERS"
Colville, Washington
Note: The observation 'I reported in the article of 19 July,' could be explained by assuming a different plane or two saucer-like objects attached to a flying trip.

This object was characterized by a dazzling brilliance of sunlight. It appeared spherical, caught the light and reflected it with the brilliance of a mirror. Reflection from the light metal used on our planes. There were no wings.

Thomson said his mother-in-law, riding with him in the front seat, also saw the object. They watched it for several seconds, then it disappeared. They both saw the object and did not know what it was.

After the object was over his shoulder, Thomson, who was observing it, said suddenly it disappeared rapidly without sound.

Thomson added that he forwarded an account of the observation to the Canadian and US Air Force, which indicated for well authentication checking of aerial phenomena reports submitted to them.
