b. Redmond, Oregon UFO sighting, 24 September 1959.
c. LaCamp, Louisiana UFO sighting, 12 April 1960.
d. Proposed study by the Aerial Phenomena Group.

3. a. The Dalton, Massachusetts case (ice fall), 25 March 1960. A 30 pound chunk of ice fell from the sky in Dalton, Massachusetts. An analysis of the ice determined it to be a large piece of the ice in its freezer, to save it. Subsequent to this, it was determined that the water over its outer cover in order to insure that only its original composition was analyzed and it was analyzed at the physical laboratory of WADD to determine its composition. A copy of the report of this analysis is being retained as it may have interest in this area.

b. On 29 September 1959, a UFO was sighted at Redmond, Oregon by a policeman and an employee of the FAA facility. The FAA installation at Seattle upon receiving the report from Redmond, Oregon, contacted the Air Force for assistance to determine the nature of the sighting. Civilian aircraft were scrambled, but were unsuccessful in their attempts at interception. Subsequent to 28 September 1959, the GCI site has had similar returns from the Redmond area. The GCI site did not consider there was a relationship between the visual and radar sighting, but the the FAA logs carried them as one report. No report of this case was made.
