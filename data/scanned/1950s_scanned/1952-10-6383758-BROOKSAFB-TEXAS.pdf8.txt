STATEMENT

On the day of 6 October 1952 at the hours of 0930 to 1030 A.M. Brooks AFB, Texas, airforce personnel, I saw hovering in the sky at about 10,000 feet an unidentified object. It was flying along in one place then darting off to the Northwest, I say it in several places. The object gave off a silvery glow, and seemed to be about the size of a medium bomber plane. I could see no windows, nor any exhaust or jet. At various times the object would appear to stop and hover momentarily, then dart off in another direction which I believe was westerly.
