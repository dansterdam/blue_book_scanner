1. A study has been completed of the Coast Guard negative of unknown serial objects. A full report to describe this study will be sent to you in a short time. Until it is completed, this brief summary will contain the findings of the photo reconnaissance laboratory:
2. The central point in question is the apparent brightness of the 8 objects coupled with the total absence of any corresponding highlights or reflections of these objects from the automobiles in the picture. The brightness of these objects appear to be unnatural and higher than the normal bumpers and trim of the automobiles. This is indicated by the included prints in which the background and sky details are almost invisible, yet the objects stand out eight times.
Further examination of the Series A prints shows no trace of highlights on the automobiles caused by the objects. All bright spots that can be seen are direct reflections from the sun. There are, however, surfaces which should show highlights, e.g., the largest object. It is obviously a fairly new coat of paint which everyone polish to the point.
Yet nowhere on the print is any suggestion of an overhead illumination directly on the object.
