(19) SUBJECT:  UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER RESEDA, CALIFORNIA
LOCATION: Reseda, California 
DATE: March 6, 1957

THIS REPORT WAS PREPARED BY MAJOR FRANCIS P. CICI, SPECIAL AGENT, 69TH DISTRICT OFFICE OF OSI, HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA.

THIS IS APPARENTLY A CREDIBLE REPORT OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OBSERVED BY TWO WITNESSES IN RESEDA, CALIFORNIA ON MARCH 6, 1957. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET IN DIAMETER AND WAS SEEN AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 800 FEET. IT MOVED IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT A VERY HIGH SPEED AND THEN STOPPED COMPLETELY, HOVERING IN ONE SPOT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES. THE OBJECT THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT AND ITS MOVEMENTS ARE CLEAR AND CREDIBLE. THERE IS NO PHYSICAL CORROBORATION WITH ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OR TRACES OF THE OBJECT, BUT THE REPORT APPEARS TO BE BASED ON RELIABLE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS.

THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HAS EVALUATED THIS INCIDENT AND CONCLUDED THAT IT REPRESENTS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATIONS. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND SOURCE OF THIS SIGHTING.
