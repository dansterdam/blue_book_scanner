Dear First,
Having read the April 7 issue of "Life" with the article on flying saucers, I thought I would write in my own experience.
What I saw seems to be different from anything mentioned in "Life", so if there is a natural explanation I would appreciate your telling me so that I would make no more mistakes.
My "saucer" was red, a dull, intense red. I saw it about 9:35 in the evening. I regret to say I don't remember the day.
The shape of the object was rather like this _____________. It was not an aeroplane light or something like that. It remained in one place for about a minute and then suddenly went up a little and into a cloud bank. It made no noise that I could hear, but it was quite far away. I am no mathematician so I can not say anything as to the height or the speed of the object. If this is any use to you I will draw a picture of what I saw.
The object went south west up, the line represents the angle which the object made on its price.
Please tell me if this is any use. This is an entirely true story.

Sincerely,

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
