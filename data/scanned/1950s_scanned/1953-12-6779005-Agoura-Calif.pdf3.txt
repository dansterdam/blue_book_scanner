On December 28, 1953, I was aboard my C-54 airplane, VL 3301, with passengers, which was approximately 7 miles southwest of Agoura, California, at 12,000 ft.

At about 8:00 PM we observed the California Avalon and Palos Verde hills) at 10,000-12,000 ft. on the top of a mountain in the Pacific Ocean. The night was clear, and the sky above the mountain was clear. Our attention was called to this object as it drifted slowly over the mountain. We were roughly paralleling the object as it moved. We had a good, unobstructed view of the object. It appeared to be a large airplane and we thought at first it was a C-54 rather than a jet (which we had not dealt with before). As we observed the object, it gradually appeared to go into a spiral dive and finally disappeared.

I was standing between the pilots and observed the object but it did not appear to be any conventional airplane. It made no sound and exhibited no navigation lights (toward the setting sun). We were approximately 7 miles from the object when we first noticed it. I have had considerable experience in aircraft observation and am quite familiar with all types of airplanes, both military and commercial, and this was definitely not any type of airplane I had ever seen before. The spiraling dive and final disappearance was rather unusual. It appeared to be hovering or standing still at times during the observation."
