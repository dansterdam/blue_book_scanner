(Page 8) The train time indicated here is not specified as EST or EDT. The train time indicated here is not specified as to whether it was bound eastbound or westbound. The time of the sighting was about 2:54 EDT, the approximate time of the passing of the train.

(Page 9) The investigators point out that approximately 100 feet of track can be seen from the window of the train. It is believed that train crews or members of the houses or structures a stationed they may have seen the object if it was present.

(Page 9) The primary job of Haistead and Montgomery is to investigate findings. They may have considered a possible connection of all this to the object observed with the radar. In no instance should the investigators hazard a conclusion for official public information purposes.

(Page 9) The Air Force conclusion stated that it was a combination of several things which was responsible for the sightings. The illumination that was initially observed on the object was probably reflections of the train's lights on chisel-jet 's ship as it passed by.
