There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

"that tells us what to do to side step these things.mxxinxsxa And try after try was made on my last trip to Ascension to engulf or meas me up in somethinq. Now it was only after quite a number of these things happened that I decided in my own best interest to get off that place. For example, a gun was stolen from an airplane. Now I know about this even though it was kept quiet at the time because after all you give the old soldier credit for being able to do a little checking around when he is being shall we say gouged so mercilessly. Now uh uh people on a rock that would go to the trouble of stealing a gun from a United States military aircraft wouldn't hesitate one minute to use it on people and I'm sure you will agree that this is true and of course uh a gun like that uh there is no telling who it will be used on.

But the place got to be so stinking rotten there. We had personnel on that base that/wouldn't have had in my back supply room unguarded for a single minute.

How in gxxxx the world people like this got through security and was hired by companies like RCA I will never know. Some of these people were technically cut and out psychopaths.

Now one statement was made, I believe this was somewhere around Dec or perhaps Jan, of Dec 1957 or Jan 1953 uh uh uh or somewhere along about that time uh."
