(4) Distribution by year and month (Statistics to be handcarried your office) (5) Unknown by year and month (to be handcarried) (6) Yes (7) Yes. Numerous times, and often involve very experienced radar operators. This is standing requirement for radar operators when object considered UFO and photo equipment available. Examples: Some time ago Navy rushed to ATIC approximately 3000 ft of radar film of UFO observed via radar. Also, a B-36 radar operator with 11 yrs experience photographed exceptionally large UFO's showing on his screen while flying over the South Atlantic. Analysis confirmed the nature of the UFO's. Tracking film has been done through Theodolite, radar and other instruments. Triangulation is a part of the standard analysis technique, and is utilized where two or more observers report the same object from separate locations. (9) Yes. Results negative. For example, Geiger Counter sweeps of some aircraft involved with alleged UFO's at high altitudes shows a slightly higher radioactivity than normal. Reason: Aircraft receive a greater dosage of cosmic rays at high altitudes. Examples: Mantell Case, (which apparently prompted this query). (10) Yes. Specialized combination spectrographic - stereo-cameras instruments are located in approximately 60 strategically located sites in the U.S. Results: negative. Only conventional objects in those few spectrographic photos taken.
