Intelligence Officer

We first want out and I know it was 1600 MST when watching the last time.
One of the objects we took off to my left at intense rate of speed and was a while streak in the sky, probably was the objects great speed. 
This is in the office. I saw it. Myself.

Captain 

17th Tactical Air Traffic Squadron 

A little background of this incident will clarify the statement that I and Capt have previously made. So, when we looked at these two objects come across the sky, they first attracted our attention as they were flying in an unnatural path. How did they know to take off? 
The statements below show that there was some transmissions over the squawk box that flying saucers? The statements show that they did not have time to take pictures because the speed of these objects were so great that they took off and were gone so fast. As soon as the objects had disappeared, I came into the traffic office and called the on duty Intelligence Officer and was asked several questions regarding the incident and the direction of the objects and also their apparent altitude which these objects were flying.
