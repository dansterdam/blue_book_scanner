Dear Sir,
Saturday night as I was traveling U.S. 64 I saw something which puzzled me. It was approximately 12:15 and I was about a mile east of Spring Hope, N.C., driving west, when I saw a green object. It seemed to be traveling straight toward the earth and appeared to be a meteor, except that it was very large and had a green color. The speed seemed to be about the same as a meteor, when it seemed to reach the earth, the object burst into a shower of sparks, illuminating the whole countryside. I could not help but think that it was very large compared to anything I have ever seen fall from the sky.
Several of my friends have also seen things similar to this. Friday night, January 10, my neighbor saw something which he described, and it was very similar to what I saw. Two more of my friends have seen green lights at different times. A friend from Rocky Mount saw something green Friday night, but it seemed to be a little different from the rest. As I said probably have a very simple explanation, and I would appreciate any light you could give me in finding out what caused these sights. Thank you very much.
