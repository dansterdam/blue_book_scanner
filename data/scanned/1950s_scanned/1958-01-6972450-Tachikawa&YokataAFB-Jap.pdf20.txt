Strange! Japan and the United States must continue to work together to solve unidentified aerial events concerning both security and aviation interests. One incident can decide the strength of our alliance. Alertness over national airspace is a must. Please pass any reports on UFO sightings made in Japan to this office so they can be compiled and evaluated for future analysis.
