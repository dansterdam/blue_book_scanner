This means that counting both the 13 percent on which we had insufficient data for analysis and the 26 percent which we could not attribute to any known cause, there have been 272 sightings of which we have record that we are unable to explain.

With these -- nearly forty percent of the total -- we have run up against a completely blank wall.

We don't know what is causing this unexplained forty percent. Since we don't know, we keep trying to find out.

And that about expresses the whole philosophy of the Air Technical Intelligence Center. We keep an open mind, and we keep trying to find out. So long as there remains even a possibility that there may be something here that could develop into a hazard to the security of the United States, we will continue the investigation.
