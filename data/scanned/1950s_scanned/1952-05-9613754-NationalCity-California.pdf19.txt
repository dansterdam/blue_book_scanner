Transcribing the text:

I had just seen
25 cts. as I drove, road clear.
it seemed it would hit E I could
see it and it seemed
seeing it would come right at me so I
stepped on it fast and it went over 
to the east. It was round, seemed
about 25 ft across, red-orange in color
just a shell Appeared to be solid, 
and fast, no noise, just moved fast 
enough to clear the road.
