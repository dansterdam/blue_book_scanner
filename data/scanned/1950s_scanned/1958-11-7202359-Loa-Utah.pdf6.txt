The image shows a hemispherical diagram, likely representing the sky, with various directional degrees marked around the perimeter such as 0° (N), 45° (NE), 90° (E), 135° (SE), 180° (S), 225° (SW), 270° (W), and 315° (NW). The zenith (90°) is at the top of the hemisphere. There are also angle measurements from 0° to 90° progressing upwards from the horizon to the zenith, marked at intervals of 30° and 60° along both the vertical and horizontal lines. No photograph is present; the graphic is a line diagram.

The diagram appears to denote the positions or directions in which observations were made or something similar. The ground level is illustrated with a line and some texture representing the horizon.
