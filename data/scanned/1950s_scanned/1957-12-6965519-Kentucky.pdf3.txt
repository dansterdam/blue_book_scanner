VENUS THE FLYING STAR, last night caused a "STIR" according to reports. This is an unusual brilliance of Venus, compared with its usual steady glow. Last night at 6:30 p.m. George Adams said he noticed this and photographed it. The pictures shown here are the results of his camera catching what he claims is an unusual phenomenon of the planet Venus. The brightest star in our sky tonight, as this is written, is the planet Venus, commanding attention in the western horizon. (Staff photo by George Adams)
