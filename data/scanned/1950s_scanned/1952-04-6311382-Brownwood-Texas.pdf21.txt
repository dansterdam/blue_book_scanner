PAGE TWO JEDDY #3

SPED AT FIRST GLANCE APPEARED TO RESEMBLE A METEOR AND I KNEW THIS OLD 
TO BE FLY A LEVEL COURSE I'D FR THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED IT UNTIL IT
DISAPPEARED IT TRY APPR 130 DEGREES OF AN ARC PD IT WAS VISIBLE FOR A
MINUTE OR SO PD I JUDGED IT ALTITUDE TO BE ABOUT 25,000 FT PD I AM NOT
SURE BECAUSE IT WAS NOT TOO VISIBLE PD I COULD ONLY SEE IT FOR SUCH A
SHORT TIME PD BUT I WOULD JUDGE ITS SPEED TO BE WELL OVER 1500 MPH PD

USAF " A&K-00 4-121 ABOUT 2035 CST 2 APR 52 I
LEFT THE JOC AREA TO WARDS HIS AGE AF PD ABOUT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL I
GLANCED UP AND NOTICED WHAT FIRST APPEARED TO BE A METEOR PD HOWEVER CMA
THE COLOR ATTACHED TO THIS OBJ WAS ALMOST A PURE WHITE AND BEING BRIGHT
I COULDN'T DISTINGUISH THE EXACT LENGTH OR SHAPE OF ITS FLIGHT APPEARED
AN AZIMUTH OF ABOUT 200 DEGREES OR 220 DEGREES AND SEEMED TO ARC SLIGHTLY DISAPPEARING TO THE NORTHWEST PD WHEN THIS OBJ WAS DUE EAST OF MY 
POSITION CMA IT SEEMED TO LOSE TWO PIECES OF ITS EXHAUST CMA WHICH 
BURNED OUT VERY QUICKLY PD FROM THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED IT COVERED APR 130 DEGREES OF AN ARC AND WAS VISIBLE FOR ABOUT
SINCE I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING BUT THE EXHAUST TH IS NOT RELIABLE PD

THE ALTITUDE WERE RELIABLE I WOULD THEN ESTIMATE THE SPEED UPWARDS OF
