1. On 10 November 1957 an unidentified object was observed to the west-southwest of Misawa Air Base, Japan. This object was described as being round in shape and resembling a dull reddish-orange color. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view. There was a distinct tail which appeared to be several miles long which also disappeared with the object. The report stated that the object appeared twice in 15 minutes, first sighted for 10 minutes, then reappeared 5 minutes later in a different direction for an additional 10 minutes before disappearing again.

2. The object was observed by chance and disappeared by fading out. Time of observation was approximately 0915/15.

3. Observations reported were visual, unassisted by optical devices.

4. Sighting occurred between 0945 and 1005/15.

5. Observers were located at approximately 39째 26' N 141째 22' E and 39째 33' N 141째 25' E.

6. The observers included Lt Col Marshal, E. Halley, AG 1CC0539, Japan-Korea Weather Reconnaissance Flight Air Force: Masahide ITAGAKI, Intelligence Commander, Naval Forces, Japan.

7. The time of the sighting was clear with visibility better than 10 miles. Observers reported 3-5 seconds visibilty at the time of sighting, made from 10,000 ft. to approximately 20,000 ft.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
In the Tokyo area during the reported time period at this time of night, conditions are sufficiently clear to enable visual sighting if the object existed. The report indicates that the object was observed a total of 15 minutes, with two distinct appearances. The absence of a description of the actual sighting and the failure to obtain any photographic evidence leads one to believe that this object was probably a meteor. The observers, apparently, mistook it for a "flying saucer" after the actual observation. The observers did not actually view the object assume that it was probably a meteor observed visually from an aircraft in flight.
