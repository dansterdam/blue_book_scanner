ATTN OF: 
AFCTI-MLjb^16

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting

28 July 1959

SAFTS-3

1. Request your office forward three copies of ATIC Form #16 to
Mr. █████████, Berea, Kentucky. Request that he forward one copy
to his sister, █████████, the other two to be filled in by the two
individuals who were with █████████ when she saw an UFO.

2. The above is the only address given to the ATIC. However, Berea
has less than 3,000 population, and in all probability has one central
post office.
