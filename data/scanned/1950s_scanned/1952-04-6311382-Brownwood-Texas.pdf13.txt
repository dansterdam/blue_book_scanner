April 7, 1952

On the night of April 2, 1952, my wife and I sighted an unidentified object in the sky. Our location was in the Oaklawn drive-in theatre 4 miles northwest of the city of Brownwood, Texas.

While watching the movie, I observed a "flaming object" approaching at a high rate of speed from the southwest. It appeared to be glowing, emitting sparks, and was traveling out of the air and watching it come directly overhead. I was convinced it was a meteor.

The object was flaming yellow in color and the end extended particular orange jets of flame. It was approximately the size of a small airplane and although it was extremely fast, I was able to observe it for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. I observed and watched the object continue on its course and disappear to the northeast.

I am a graduate electrical engineer and I am positive it was no electrical disturbance. The object traveled parallel to the earth's surface and I detected no sound. This further substantiates my opinion that it was not an airplane, nor a meteor. At this point I should like to interject, that even though I can't know what this object was, I am completely convinced it was some form of aircraft, possibly of an unorthodox design, that I have never seen before.
