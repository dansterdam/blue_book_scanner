Dear Mr. [redacted]

In an earlier letter I replied to you concerning the sighings you mentioned in previous correspondence.

The latest Department of Defense release on the subject of UFOs
is enclosed. I had forward you this release several months back.
It will be several weeks before the new fact sheet is published.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

WILLIAM H. COLEMAN, JR.
