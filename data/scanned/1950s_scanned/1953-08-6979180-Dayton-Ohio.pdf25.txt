I was driving along the Indian Riffle Road and before we turned off on the private road, I observed the objects. They seemed to be traveling at a rapid rate of speed and it was 4 or 5 miles before they stopped. It looked like something change like the back part was a different color of a star, real bright. I stopped the car and watched them. It just floated up, then it got real bright. It was real bright. It seemed to be going straight up about 20 minutes and then got dim and I never did see it again. It just faded away kind of in a gradual circle, and just faded away. I suppose it was possibly about 3 or 4 miles high. There was nothing else in the sky but the moon. It was about three or four miles and it went off on the northeastern direction. I have never noticed any such objects before.
