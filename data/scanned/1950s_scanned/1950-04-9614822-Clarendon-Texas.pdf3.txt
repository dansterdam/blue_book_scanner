Transcribed text:

On 17 April 1950 a flight was made from Northrop Field, Hawthorne, California, to Amarillo, Texas, in connection with Project MX-775. The airplane used for this flight was F-86D No. AF 8507, with Lt. Col. Lloyd Sallam and Sam F. West as observers, and the undersigned as pilot.

Shortly before departing from Amarillo on 18 April 1950 for the return flight to Northrop Field, I was requested by the Amarillo Airport office to call the local CAA office range station. Upon contacting the CAA offices I was informed that the CAA observers in Clarendon, Texas, had under observation an unidentified object at approximately 20,000 feet over Clarendon at approximately 12:00 noon Amarillo time.

After reaching an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet in the vicinity of Memphis, Texas, an object was sighted to the northwest of our position. This object was at a considerable distance and could be detected only by the intermittent reflection of the sunlight on what appeared to be a metallic surface, as another pass toward this object was made radio communication established with the Clarendon station indicated that the object was still under observation as to the possibility of other aircraft being in the area, as no other altitudes at that altitude were known to be in the area but this one, that information was passed from Fort Worth, Texas, to search for and observe the object but it had not been sighted.

After flying toward the object for approximately 10 minutes, it began to take form and appeared as it might be a weather balloon. Amarillo radio was then questioned.
