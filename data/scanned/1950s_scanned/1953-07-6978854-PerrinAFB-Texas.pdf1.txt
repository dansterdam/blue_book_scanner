The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a project blue book document, with various fields filled out for a report, including the date, location, source, number of objects, length of observation, type of observation, course, and physical evidence. The text in the "Brief Summary and Analysis" field is too blurred to be legibly transcribed.
