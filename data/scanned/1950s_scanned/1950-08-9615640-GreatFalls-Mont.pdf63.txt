OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

On August 9, 1950. at 1215 hours, the observer. Mrs. Dewey J. Fournier, was in her back yard, 3100 4th Avenue North, Great Falls, Montana, when she noticed a strange object in the sky. 

The object was first sighted at approximately 10 degrees above the northwest horizon. It was traveling in a southeasterly direction and disappeared from view at approximately 60 degrees above the southeast horizon.

The object was observed for a period of approximately 30 to 45 seconds. It appeared to be in the form of a ball of fire, approximately 6 to 8 inches in diameter, and was leaving a long, wide trail behind it. The trail appeared to be whitish in color.

The object was traveling at a terrific rate of speed and made no sound. When first sighted, the object was traveling at an extremely high altitude, but as it progressed southeastward, it appeared to lose altitude. No estimate was made of the actual altitude of the object.

The weather at the time of the observation was clear, with a few scattered clouds in the sky. The wind was from the northwest at approximately 10 mph.

No other witnesses were located who observed the object.
