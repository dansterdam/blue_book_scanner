"Readjustment is what this operation is concerned with. I feel right in saying that it was a guided craft something in the range of 40 to 50 feet in diameter. It was traveling at a high rate of speed, it seemed to be beyond the range of visual observation as it was not visible at the time I observed it. It may be that this was not an unusual occurrence, but I would like to establish the existence of an equability or standards about the matter. I might add the subject receiving much attention among the personnel and men I talked to were quite concerned about it. Regard this as being strictly confidential and asking that it not be divulged to anyone. I would be glad to give any additional information you may require about the matter."
