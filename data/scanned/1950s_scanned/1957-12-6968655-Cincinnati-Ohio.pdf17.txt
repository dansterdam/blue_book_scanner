SUBJECT: "UFO" Aerial Motion Picture Film - Cincinnati, Ohio, Dec. 6, 1957 (Continued)

We are puzzled by the fact that although directions, locations or designations were not specifically asked for in both the official letter (copy attached, dated 5 Apr 58) and in five (5) separate spaces provided on the question form, this answer was submitted.

A check with radar units and GOC posts that came to his attention as witnesses or reported any UFO or anything unusual for that locality within a three-week period was negative.

However, Venus was so bright during the normal period of the observation that it could have been mistaken for an unusual object in the sky, unless the appropriate lenses were used.

The negative comments on any probable motives on the part of the observer appear to be a picture of the moon, over four times the actual size. 

The original film for return to the is attached.
