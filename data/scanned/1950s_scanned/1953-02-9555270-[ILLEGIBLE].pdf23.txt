COMMENT OF PREPARING OFFICER:
ACGW Dpt. and CPT were interviewed by intelligence officer. 232th ACGW Dpt, both were of opinion that they would not have reported the incident if they had not been required to do so. The incident was of such nature that it was moving so slow as to be scarcely observed. No radar contact was made and no anti-aircraft weapons were fired.

Possible explanation for sighting: At 2210t, 26 Feb. 1953, all radar sites in central area of Honshu, Japan were alerted to watch for unusual sightings. Object sighted at heading of 265 degrees from Site 3 would indicate the object might have been the lights of an aircraft or some other object in the sky which were flying in their local area. No aircraft were flying at Johnson, and the weather search lights at Tacoma and Tachibana were on.
