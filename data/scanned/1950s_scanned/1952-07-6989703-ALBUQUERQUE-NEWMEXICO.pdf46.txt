On 29 July 1952 at about 9:15 PM, an employee of the Ground Observer Corps at the Kirtland Air Force Base reported observing an unidentified object in the sky. The object was described as round in shape and appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. It was first observed at about 9:00 PM and was seen for approximately 15 minutes. The witness stated that the object appeared to be hovering at an altitude estimated to be between 2,000 and 5,000 feet. The object then began moving at a rapid rate of speed first to the east, then to the southwest, and then back to the east, according to the witness. The object emitted a bright light and was described as being a silvery or aluminum color. There were no wings or means of propulsion visible, and no sound was heard. The witness reported that the object's movements were very fast and erratic. Four other employees of the Ground Observer Corps also observed the object and confirmed the witness' account. However, the actual size and distance to the object could not be determined. The object was lost from view as it moved away to the east. No explanation for the sighting could be determined.
