UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
At 2000 hours, 29 Sept 1957, during darkness, Lt O'Connor's attention was caught by two bright lights in the sky, about 5-10 degrees above the horizon, traveling on a generally NE to SW course. The lights appeared to be at an elevation angle of about 25-30 degrees, and were traveling at a speed which Lt O'Connor estimated to be approximately 600 mph. As the lights approached, he noticed that there were actually two objects, side by side, and that they appeared to be connected by some sort of a "bar" or "bridge" between the two. The objects stopped, hovered momentarily, and then separated, with one continuing on the original course, and the other turning and heading in a northerly direction. Both men were just looking around when O'Connor's attention was caught by the lights. The objects appeared unidentified - like a couple of bottle-shaped lights without a top. They seemed to be about 25-30 feet in diameter, and between 50-100 feet apart. The objects were observed for about 2-3 minutes before they disappeared from sight. Lt O'Connor also saw the object just before it disappeared.
