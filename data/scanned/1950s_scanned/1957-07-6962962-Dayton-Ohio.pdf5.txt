Jupiter and Saturn Rule Skies

Lyre Leads the Way
Shortly after dark during the month of July, the eye catches the brilliant yellow-white star nearly halfway up the eastern sky. This is Vega, the brightest star in the Lyre constellation. Following Vega in a line toward the south is the faint but conspicuous Altair, the 12th brightest star in the sky. These two stars and the fainter Deneb, nearly overhead, mark the Summer Triangle, a prominent landmark among the summer stars.

Star of Distinction 
Higher in the south, the golden planet Jupiter shines with a steady brilliance, far outshining any star. At the present time Jupiter is the most prominent object in the evening sky, the brightest it will be this year. Saturn, the ringed planet, is well on its way toward the southwest, shining with a soft yellow light just a little less brilliant than Jupiter.
