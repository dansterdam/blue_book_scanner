Dear Sir,
This is in response to your recent letter to Captain Hector Quintanilla of the Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, on the incident of an Unidentified Flying Object you observed on September 8, 1959.

Your UFO sighting cannot be related to any conventional, ballistic or astronomical body. The brightness and clearness of the object indicates it was a close sighting and of an aerodynamical type. We appreciate the information presented. Therefore, we are unable to identify or classify the information presented.

Thank you for reporting this unusual sighting to the Air Force. All reports of Unidentified Flying Objects will be listed as an "unknown" observation unless additional information is received to clarify the incident.

Sincerely,
MARTIN M. JACOBS
Major, USAF
