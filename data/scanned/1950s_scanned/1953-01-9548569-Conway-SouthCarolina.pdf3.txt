UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PLACE OF ORIGIN: (Conway, S. C. - February 9, 1953)
SUBJECT: SAUCER (The saucer, Conway S.C. February 9, 1953)
SUMMARY: On February 9, 1953 between 12:30 and 12:50 pm, a 15-20 feet diameter disc-like object was observed on the trail near Conway, South Carolina. It was dull gray in color and was moving erratically, slowly gaining altitude. It was observed by two adults for several minutes, but it could not be approached. Both said, "The object obviously was never in contact with the ground and was completely under control in its motion."
"Under the weather," the observers claimed, accounting for a hill-in where it momentarily disappeared from view. The object was seen to emerge over the hill and continue on its way without interruption. The object was not audible and did not leave a trail.
To summarize, "There was no visible sign of propulsion. No vapor trail. No noise. No disturbance of the surrounding air. It simply moved as if under complete control and with apparent anti-gravity characteristics."
Destruction Regime: To be destroyed by consigning to the wastepaper basket & by forgetting the matter.
