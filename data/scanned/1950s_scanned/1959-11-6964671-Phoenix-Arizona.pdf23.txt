Alright, I've talked this over with myself and my self and I cannot believe I was so inconsiderate of my friend's viewpoint. I regret having been so overbearing in my conversation and attempting to impose my own views so forcefully. My friend clearly has strong feelings on this matter, and I should have listened more carefully and with more empathy instead of pushing my perspective. In the future, I will try to be more mindful of hearing others out and considering their perspectives, even when they differ from my own. I value this friendship and don't want my stubbornness to damage it. Thank you for your patience - I clearly have more to learn when it comes to having productive, respectful dialogues.
