Dear Col. Gilbert:

In response to your letter of 30 October 1958 with enclosed questionnaire, am returning latter filled out as well as possible. Estimates of size, distance, etc. are almost impossible to make, but comparison might be made with a small airplane, flying low and moving very fast.

I hope this information will make possible identification of the object. I would very much like to learn what it was.

Yours very truly,
