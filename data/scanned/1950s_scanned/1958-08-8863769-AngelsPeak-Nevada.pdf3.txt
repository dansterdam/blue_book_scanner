1. Object diappeared in same location as when 1st
sighted, but object apparently moved.

2. Time of sighting is given as two different times;
doesn’t say whether object sighted twice or whether
time of sighting was between times reported.

3. Observer states weather “very clear, no wind”;
weather reports indicate surface wind of 10 knots, 
thunderstorms in all areas of sighting with 8/10
cloud coverage at 12,000’.

NNNN
The above is inconsistent info, however, observer
probably saw an AC light. Obs. location is
approx. 15-miles SW of radio range for Indian Springs
and Las Vegas, which has heavy air traffic.
