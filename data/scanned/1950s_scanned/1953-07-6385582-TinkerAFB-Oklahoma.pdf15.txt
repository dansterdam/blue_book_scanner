The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

The object looked round just like a big basketball, it was bright white - it looked like it was made of a highly polished metal surface. It was about 15 to 20 feet in diameter.

It was hovering about 50 feet above the ground and there was no sound. There was no exhaust and no glow.

I saw this object at 1930 and I watched it for one (1) hour.

The object was visible from the ground. I first saw this just slightly that the bright light attracting my attention. 

It was at east end the 77ft hanger the guard was on duty, were it was hovering.

I would say it was at least 35,000 to 40,000 feet high.

There were 4 jet clouds in the west, 24 to 30 miles high in the west.

I did not take any pictures and no fragments were obtained. 

Along toward 1235 there was a 40-50 cane just flying high over the field.

The object I saw started getting dim and faded away until you couldn't see it.
