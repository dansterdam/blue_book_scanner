There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing handwritten text.

Text from the document:

Pretty fast because we did not hear them until they were at about 5 o'clock, and there was no wind, the clouds were stationary, and we saw something quite large, bright, and round. There was no noise, no trail, no balloon, or any other object that seemed to identify it. We were puzzled about this one, and if you people come up within the next couple of years with an explanation, I'd appreciated hearing it. We had better let me know, because I would hate to shoot down one of these things and see them disappear suddenly like to have say. 

(B) Found sight as bright as searchlight with flame color, could be some kind of nuclear engine, sound about that of airliner at 10,000 feet. Passed overhead from horizon to horizon in 1001 panic, didn't get to 100,50.

An investigation for approach in 8hr.
