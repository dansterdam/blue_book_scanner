ATTN OF: AFOIN-4E46
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting
TO: SAFIS-3d (Major L. J. Tucker)
1. The UFO sighting reported by Mrs. Anna Rodis currently was nothing unusual about the sighting. The incident was reported to be seen from several homes in the area, and does not appear to be an important sighting. It is apparent that she is influenced by the books she reads on the subject, and decided to write to the Air Force about this sighting.
2. The Air Force did receive a report from Wisconsin in September 1957, and it was concluded to be the aurora borealis, which was seen from several locations.
