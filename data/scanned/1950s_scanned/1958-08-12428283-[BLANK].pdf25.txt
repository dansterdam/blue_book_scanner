Warfare, resulting in it does the confidence of the public in the Air Force.
There are many other aspects of the public participation in the UFO program and, as far as the Air Force is concerned, they are a real bear.
23. There are, therefore, two distinct problems the UFO program.
The first is success, how to properly cope with the growing interest shown the public, particularly the news media, in the UFO program. The second is to cope with the growing problem of public participation in the program. We feel confident that the solution of the first will greatly help in solving the second. The first problem is wholly ours and is being so handled. The number of "unknowns" is being reduced steadily although as I said before it can never reach zero because of the fact that the reporting is invariably based on the impressions of individuals and are subject to human error based on controlled measurements. There appears to be little difference between the usefulness of reporting by qualified trained observers such as professional and pilots and that of lay observers.
24. The second problem involves matters of public relations, and the cooperation of the press, the education of the public, and of legal resources.
25. I will be glad to attempt to answer your questions.
