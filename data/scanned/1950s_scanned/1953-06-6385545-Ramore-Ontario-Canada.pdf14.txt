AFFIDAVIT

At approximately 2315 EDST 30 June 1953 I was called from the telephone and shown by AIRMAN McDONALD to view an object in the sky. I saw an oval shaped orange colored object to the East - similar to an egg standing on end. It hovered about fifteen feet from the ground. It had a dark spot in the center and a door on the lower part. The object made no sound. It disappeared slowly upwards, and was last seen by me at tree top height. The object appeared to be solid.

The door on lower part - opened and a man with two heads stepped out and walked down to the ground. He seemed to be walking on steps but there was no visible steps. He had two looks - his head turned back and forth - his actions were same as human - but stood erect. He approached the object. Two other type men stayed behind in the object. The man had fair skin, carried no weapons or briefcases, appeared friendly. The man spoke English. I do not recall the conversation but I do recall his saying they came from beyond pluto. When speaking the man spoke from only one mouth. His appearance was normal except for the heads, and their clothing was similar to ours but the man wore shorts.

At the conclusion of his talk he returned to the object and it slowly disappeared to the East.
