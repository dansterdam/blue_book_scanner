GERMAN LEGION FLYING SAUCER

"One of the German Legion associations which have been active before the war and are now looking up again in the aeronautical research field. 

"This association was formerly responsible for several original designs of dirigible-type aircraft in Germany prior to 1939 and during the war, including some which were proposed for some of the German saucer-type planes."

"Now the brains of the association have produced a design for a revolutionary type of aircraft which might look remarkably like possible saucer-type."

"The new design is shared like a flattened disc with a large central opening surrounded by a ring. It is said to show remarkable similarity to the disc or disc-like shapes of the objects often seen or described of the aircraft."

"For the time being, the original constructed model is carefully guarded at the residence of the association members, and experts of the research association say that it has great advantages over orthodox aircraft, particularly in maneuverability and stability."
