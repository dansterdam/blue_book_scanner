MOON TO PASS
OVER CHICAGO
THIS MORNING
Expected at 5:47 for 
a 4 Minutes Visit
Sputnik II, Russia's half-ton satellite, is expected to pass over Chicago almost direcily overhead at 5:47 a.m. this morning, according to Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, chairman of the Argonne National Laboratory. He said that the satellite will be visible for about 4 minutes at that time if skies are not overcast.
In preparations for the anticipated appearance here, the Argonne Laboratory will have a team of astronomers and physicists with telescopes and cameras set up in the laboratory's reservation area. The sky will be kept under observation with telescopes and cameras starting at 5:30 a.m.
The moon will also be passing over Chicago at about the same time, as it moves directly from the south.
The moon passed over Chicago yesterday at 6:05 p.m. and was visible for about 6 minutes.
