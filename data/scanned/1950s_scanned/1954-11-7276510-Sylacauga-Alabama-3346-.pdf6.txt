SYLACAUGA, ALABAMA, NOVEMBER 30, 1954
METE0RITE FELL THROUGH ROOF OF HOME

On November 30, 1954, at approximately 3:00 p.m., a 9-pound meteorite crashed through the roof of a house occupied by Mrs. Ann Hodges in Sylacauga, Alabama. Mrs. Hodges was struck by the rock on her hip, causing a severe contusion. She was taken to a local hospital and treated for the injury.

The meteorite penetrated the roof, hit a large console radio, and then bounced onto a bed where Mrs. Hodges was napping. The rock fractured into several pieces upon impact, some of which were recovered later by investigators. 

On the day of the incident, Mrs. Hodges reported that she heard a sound like a "large blown tire" immediately prior to the meteorite striking her home. Neighbors also reported seeing a bright flash of light and hearing a loud explosion around the time of the impact.

The meteorite was identified as an ordinary chondrite, the most common type of meteorite. It is believed to have originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This incident marked the first known case of a meteorite striking and injuring a human in the United States.
