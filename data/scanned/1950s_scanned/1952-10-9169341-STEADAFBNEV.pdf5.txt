The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram showing the motion of an object. The diagram depicts the path of an object, with an "A" at the start of the path and a "B" at the end, indicating the direction of motion.

The text in the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One):   a. Head of a pin     b. Pea     c. Dime     d. Nickel     e. Quarter     f. Half dollar     g. Silver dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):  a. Certain     b. Fairly certain     c. Not very sure     d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, it would be helpful if you could describe in detail the composition of the object, if the size and shape were familiar objects, and what type material would you say it was made of? How large would it be, and what shape would it have the same appearance as the object which you saw?

1. METALLIC HISTORICAL
2. SIZE AND SHAPE OF LARGE DAYSPRING
3. BRIGHT ILLUMINATED OBJECT VERY SLOW MOVING AT MODERATE ALTITUDE ESTIMATED ABOUT 300 FT
