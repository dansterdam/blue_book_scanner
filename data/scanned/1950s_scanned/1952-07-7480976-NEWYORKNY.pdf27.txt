And Light Smoke Trail

It was probably a meteor--rather than an exploding jet plane or guided missile or flying saucer. According to the report, the brilliant fireball and long smoke trail was seen today--it was real enough. I enclose saying they saw the phenomenon at about 10:30 a.m. and 1111 air force base near the general area. The report concludes by stating that all evidence of the explosion or flight disappeared with the sighting.
