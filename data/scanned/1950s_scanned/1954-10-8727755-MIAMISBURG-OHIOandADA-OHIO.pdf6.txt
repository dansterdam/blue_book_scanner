The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line on the horizon, and the instructions indicate that this represents how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it.

The second sketch depicts a larger view, showing the position of the object when the observer first saw it, and a reference to a smaller sketch to provide an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The third sketch shows a landscape with mountains in the distance and a person standing in the foreground, suggesting a perspective of the observer's view.
