This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The image shows a diagram of a horizon with instructions for the observer to draw the path of an object. The text on the page provides instructions for the observer to sketch the motion of the object.

"23. In the following sketch place an 'A' at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a 'B' at its position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an 'A' at the beginning of its path and a 'B' at the end of its path.

The object moved as one could make out, downward along a slight curve and then at the end of a trajectory disappeared. 

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving."
