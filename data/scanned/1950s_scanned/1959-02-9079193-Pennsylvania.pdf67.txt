The image appears to be a page from a handwritten document, but there is no photograph or image visible within it. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

Doylestown is 25 miles E of Philadelphia. The object was observed for about 30 minutes. It was round or ellipsoidal in shape, silver or aluminum colored, and seemed to be about 30 feet in diameter. It moved at a moderate speed, and was observed at an estimated altitude of 500 feet. There was no trail or exhaust visible, and no sound was heard. The object appeared to hover for a time, and then accelerate and disappear. There were several witnesses to the observation, all of whom were reliable persons. No further details are available.
