BATTERY D 701ST AAA BATTALION
SOUTH PARK MILITARY RESERVATION
PITCAIBN, PENNSYLVANIA

18 March 1952

STATEMENT

AS Duty Officer, I was called to the M33 Radar at approximately 0001 hours on 12 March 1952, to observe the operation of my Battery Radar Crew. At this time they were on stand-by surveillance of the local airspace. 

At approximately 2100 hours they succeeded in picking up on the radar screen an unidentified object which is estimated to have been about 20 miles distant from the Battery. The object was moving at a fairly high speed and had very minor erratic and elevation variations.

The object was of the opinion that it was a homing pigeon in appearance, the pip size indicating that it was a normal echo. This opinion is based on the fact that the radar crew had previous experience with homing pigeons, and the pip size and maneuvers of the unidentified object were similar to those of homing pigeons which they had tracked on previous occasions.
