The body being an oval about two or three feet long and about one and one half feet wide. The top portion being somewhat rounded and the bottom portion being somewhat pointed or tapered. The entire object was a metallic gray in color and seemed to be highly polished or reflecting light. There were no visible seams, joints, windows, or other surface features on the object. The only unusual aspect was that the object appeared to be hovering silently and motionlessly about 20 to 30 feet above the ground.

The object was observed for approximately 3 to 5 minutes before it silently accelerated and quickly disappeared over the nearby trees. During the time it was observed, it made no sound and displayed no visible means of propulsion.
