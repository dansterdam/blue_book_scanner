STRATEGY AIRCOMMAND REPORT NONE KNOWN UNIDENTIFIED INTERPLANETARY OBJECT
SUBJECT: As requested by the Director, the following is a report on an unidentified flying object sighted and reported to the USAF on April 7, 1958.

The reported sighting occurred at 11:48 p.m. CDT on 7 April 1958, over Alexandria, Louisiana. The witnesses were Lt. Col. Bill Brake and Major William F. Dady, SAC, who were returning to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, from Dallas, Texas, in a SAC B-47 jet bomber. 

The officers stated that while in level flight at approximately 32,000 feet, they suddenly observed a bright light in their immediate vicinity. The object was described as round or spherical in shape, yellowish-white in color, and approximately twice the size of a star. It was stationary and did not blink or move. The officers stated that the object was estimated to be about 10-15 miles distant and at an altitude of approximately 55,000 feet. 

When the radar blips suddenly disappeared off the scope, the object suddenly disappeared from view. The incident was not observed on the aircraft's radar and no other aircraft were seen in the area at the time. The officers were interviewed and their reports were consistent.

ONE REASON FOR SECRECY
Secret if GCA picked up objects over the North Atlantic, as it would fully explain why sightings are not made public. Yet the Government holds that publicity would affect morale.

DISEASE ON MOON COULD KILL WHOLE POPULATION
The possibility is that dust storms on the Moon may bring lethal germs to the Earth. Some Doctors fear that these could wipe out the entire human population of the Earth.

MORE ON CBI
Thousands of pilots and radar operators who are now stationed in the CBI theater are eager to communicate what they have witnessed in the skies of that area. CSI is undertaking to obtain more information but is hampered by military restrictions that prevent free discussion.
