21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 

   NOT VERY, ABOUT   of ONE OF THE SAUCER’S WINDOWS

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
