A SCENE VISUAL AND RADAR OBSERVATION WAS MADE AT 1923Z BY SIX SIXTY OTHER INDIVIDUALS. VISUAL OBSERVATION WAS MADE WITH OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS. THE RADAR EQUIPMENT PERMITTED THE SPEED TO BE AT ABOUT 1800 MPH. IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE OBJECTS WERE PROPELLED AND THAT THEY WERE NOT REFLECTING DEVICES MOVED BY THE WIND. THE OBJECTS WERE IN FORMATION, LESS THAN THREE. THESE FORMATIONS PASSED OVER EVERY FIVE TO TEN MINUTES AND APPEARED TO MANEUVER AND THEN DISPERSE. THE OBJECTS WERE TRACKED WITH RADAR EQUIPMENT. THE OBSERVATIONS WERE CONTINUING AT 1726Z. ONE FIRST ATTEMPT DID NOT HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF MR. PIER'S BACKGROUND BUT DUE TO HIS BEING A RADAR INSTRUCTOR HE FELT THAT A C-3 EVALUATION WAS WARRANTED. THE SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE OBJECTS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED AND THE OBSERVER DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY WERE WINGED OR NOT. MR. PIER CONSIDERED SIMILAR OBJECTS LAST FALL BUT WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE ANY DETAILS AT THAT TIME. HE STATED THAT SOMEONE FROM WASHINGTON HAD TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THESE OBSERVATIONS. NO OTHER INSTALLATIONS REPORTED THESE OBJECTS AND G-2 FIRST ARMY HAD CONTACTED EACH 75 SO HAD NO REPORT. FURTHER INFORMATION WILL BE FORWARDED WHEN RECEIVED.
