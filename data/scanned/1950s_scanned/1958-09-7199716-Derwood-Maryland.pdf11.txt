MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD 
8 October 1958

Sergeant Locknane, Detachment Commander of the 1001st Air Base Wing, Andrews AFB, called and stated that a reconnaissance of a site near Derwood, Md., had reported an UFO sighting.

Lieutenant Dempsay also said that two airmen in the Control Tower sighted an UFO which was described as hovering, and which operations had dispatched a 51-11 to investigate.

Approximately one hour later, Dempsay called to further relate that the object was still observed and that it seemed to be "dipping down" periodically. It was further stated that workmen near these facilities claimed to have seen several large, orange colored trucks. 

We received no queries.

The matter was noted until the night of October 6th, on that night, I read in the final edition of the Washington "Star" on page 6 there was a 2-column story about a UFO sighting near Derwood, Maryland.

After reading the "Star" account, I called Lt. Dempsay concerning the above article, He had no further details to furnish since the sight-ing was witnessed only by the airmen in the Control Tower operations.

In the spirit of AFR 200-2 (para. 9) which reads: "Sightings may be re-leased to the public or other government agencies by the commander of the Air Force Base concerned only after it has been positively identified as a familiar or a known object." The details that I obtained shall in my opinion be limited to this type of information.

I called the "Post" and talked to the duty officer concerning their UFO story to confirm if I had a few more details which might lend a bit of light to the subject.
