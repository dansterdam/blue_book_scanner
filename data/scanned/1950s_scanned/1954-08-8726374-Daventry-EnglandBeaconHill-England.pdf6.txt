FLYING UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS
OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA.
18 July 1960

Lt. Colonel Lawrence J. Tacker, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Colonel Tacker:

(1) In accordance with paragraph 8 of AFR 200-2, I should like to request the analysis of the film taken of UFO's, mentioned by Major Herb Schirmer, USAF Public Information Officer for the Oklahoma City Air Force Station, Okla., in a letter dated 27 June 1960.

(2) I would like to thank you for sending me a copy of AFR 200-2 as amended; your courtesy is appreciated.

(3) That is ATIC's analysis of the 8mm color motion pictures of UFOs taken on 2 July 1960, which we forwarded to the USA for analysis.

(4) I should appreciate receiving a copy of the new AF fact sheet, when issued.

(5) Does the Press Release 10 September 1957, the total of UFO sightings for 1956 is listed as 778; of this number 2.2% is listed as "Unknown". By my calculations, this figure out of 778 is 17.32. Several of the other statistics are also uneven; please advise me what 9/23 or 99/100 of a sighting is?

(6) Have you or the Air Defense Command any further UFO sightings by rockers? Is other means upon Unidentified Flying Objects? Is there an ADC order in effect authenticating such findings? If so, and they are not classified, I should like to request copies.

(7) Does the United States Air Force exchange information on UFOs with the Air Force of friendly nations?

Sincerely yours,

JAMES MANEY
Deputy Director
