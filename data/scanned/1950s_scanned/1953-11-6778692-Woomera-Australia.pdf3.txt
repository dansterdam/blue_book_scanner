Air Attaché, Australia IR-36-54 7 

he saw a bright object proceeding North at a high speed at approximately 0230 hours on the 23rd November, 1953. Shaw could not enlarge on his statement.

9. All the persons interviewed claimed to have been sober and in a normal frame of mind and insist that they have not exaggerated their descriptions of what they saw. They are regarded locally as being most reliable people. Their sight is good.

10. While no one would estimate the height, size or distance from the object, their stories, which were independent of each other, and were only discussed with each other several days later after each had given his story to other people, are very similar.

11. The Met. Officer's report can only indicate that the object or objects were at an altitude of over 5,000 feet. It is possible that a bright star may have been seen through light cloud, and with the turning of the cars, appear to move rapidly. Alternatively, a meteorite may have been seen under the same conditions. A check with the Government Astronomer may throw some light on the matter.
