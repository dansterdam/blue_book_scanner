COBURN, VIRGINIA Report

On 9 February 1959, Mrs. Coburn reported sighting several unidentified flying objects in the sky near her home in Virginia. Mrs. Coburn stated that she observed these objects on two separate occasions on this date.

The first sighting occurred at approximately 1:00 p.m. Mrs. Coburn reported seeing four or five bright, silver-colored objects maneuvering in the sky. She described the objects as round or disk-shaped, and stated that they appeared to be hovering or moving slowly. The objects were visible for several minutes before disappearing from view.

The second sighting took place at around 3:30 p.m. on the same day. Mrs. Coburn again observed several bright, metallic-looking objects in the sky. She reported that these objects were similar in appearance to those seen during the earlier sighting, and that they were also maneuvering and hovering in the air. The objects remained visible for a short period of time before vanishing.

Mrs. Coburn was unable to provide any further details or additional information regarding these sightings. No physical evidence or photographic documentation was available.
