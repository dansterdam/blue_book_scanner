1701st Air Transport Group

On 29 July 1952, as I was in the Transport Control Office, I observed a group of officers looking out the window at 3:55 p.m. as they were transmission over the PLAN IIIC, stating that "flying saucers" were sighted toward the west. Immediately, I and several others went to the windows and observed several objects, round in shape, gray in color, and very high in the sky. They were immediately out of sight and headed towards the west. They appeared to be very high and very fast, much faster than any jet planes we have today. We all watched in amazement and disbelief as they disappeared from sight. Later on that evening, there was a large gathering of all the officers discussing this incident and there seemed to be only one opinion, that what we saw was not an optical illusion or any known type of aircraft. The project officer of the Control Section said that similar reports had been made at 1925, 1:55, and looked into the route, speed, and heading of these objects. He stated that the control tower had merely observed and vectored the objects off of the screen, and as per regulations, had submitted a report to higher headquarters. The information I have given is what I personally observed and what was discussed by the officers present.
