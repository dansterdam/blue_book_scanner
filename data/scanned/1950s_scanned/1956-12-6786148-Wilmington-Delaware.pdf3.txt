Dear Sir,
The object was seen in a clear sky and I could see it clearly. The distance was much greater than I had first thought. A good many friends of mine were with me and all saw the objects closely. What I saw was a round, shiny, fiery yellow, saucer-shaped object far above my head. It streaked across the sky at a terrific speed, then it turned straight up and disappeared into the clouds in a matter of seconds - much quicker than any plane or missile I have ever seen. The movements were so fast that I could hardly follow it with my eyes. How can I explain such an incredible and inexplicable phenomenon as this? It was a real object and bright as the sun shining through the clouds. Yet, I see no gloved for the vehicle to be real. Perhaps one day, the facts we have gathered will be enough to explain these objects scientifically. The mystery remains, but my friends and I know what we saw lighting up the sky that day. It was no balloon, aircraft or anything else of ordinary nature. Something very mysterious is happening in our skies, and the sooner we face that fact realistically, the sooner we may find the answer.
