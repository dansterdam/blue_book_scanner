9. REMARKS:
a. On 4 October 1951 at 1227Z a radar operator at the Okinawa Ground Control Intercept Station, 6th A/I "AN" (CC 2)' 55' N, 127° 15' 15" E) detected an unidentified target on his search radar scope. This target travelled at a speed of over 600 knots and was followed for approximately 12 minutes.
b. The PPI height trace was operating on a range from 0 to 120 nautical miles, indicating the target was at maximum range. The target's closeness and speed caused interference with the other scopes in the station, and the scope had to be turned off at times to prevent the interference.
c. There was no visual sighting of the object and no other echoes were seen in conjunction with it. It maintained a steady course and no known aircraft were in the area at the time. The target disappeared from the scopes, leaving no trace, and no sound or other phenomena was observed. The radar operator stated that the blip was easily seen and that radar lock-on was maintained throughout the sighting. No unusual interference or distortion of the scope presentation was noted, and the target was reported to be solid and well defined.
d. There were no indications that this object at the time of the sighting was anything other than an unidentified flying object.
