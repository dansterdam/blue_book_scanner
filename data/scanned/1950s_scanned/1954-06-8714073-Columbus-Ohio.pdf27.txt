ANOTHER SAUCER?
Dayton Flyer Reports 45-Minute Chase Of 'Unidentified Object'
Dayton had another "flying saucer" Wednesday and it was chased for 45 minutes by a pilot for the Ohio National Guard, who said he saw it "break off" when he got close. 
A spokesman in the area where the sighting occurred confirmed that the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base had been informed and said that no further information could be given.
ROY TOLD how he "tried to close in an effort to get it within range quickly and get a better look for identification." He said: "I made left and right turns, but it out-maneuvered me. It changed direction quickly and seemed to stay about the same distance ahead of me. I couldn't close the gap no matter how I tried." 
He was flying one of the Guard's F-51 training fighters on a routine flight when he first saw the object. "It looked like a ball of fire at first. Then I could see it was disk-shaped and was maneuvering at a terrific rate of speed," he said.
"When I broke off, it just seemed to fade out. I can't say whether it went straight up, straight down or just disappeared." He said he had never seen anything like it before.
