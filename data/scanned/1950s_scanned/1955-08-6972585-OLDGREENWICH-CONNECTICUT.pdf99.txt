BOT BACK TO THE STORY.....X WAS TRANSFERRED BY WHAT HE HAD SEEN....A TER IT LANDED....HE R.N INTO THE HOUSE AND RELATED TO THE REST WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED. NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE HIM....AND AFTER TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE...THE WHOLE FAMILY PASSED IT OFF AS BEING FUNNY. ABOUT ONE HOUR LATER.....HOWEVER, THE SMILES DROPPED OFF THEIR FACES. AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE INCIDENT. 
IN THE REAR OF THE HOUSE, INSIDE, AND UNDER THE STAIRS, APPEARED A SMALL MAN....ONLY THREE AND ONE HALF FEET TALL, HAD AN EXTREMELY OVERSIZED HEAD WHICH WAS ALMOST PERFECTLY ROUND, AND THE ARMS EXTENDED TO THE GROUND WITH LARGE. OUT OF SIZE HANDS, WHICH HAD TALONS ON THE ENDS OF ITS FINGERS. THE EYES WERE SAUER LIKE...MUCH BIGGER THAN A HUMAN'S.....AND GLOWED A YELLOWISH COLOR. THE BODY WAS SLIGHTLY MADE OF SILVER JELLY AND GAVE OFF AN EERIE LIGHT TO THE LIGHT GIVEN OUT BY IT. 
AT HIS HABITUAL DIAL WATCH, HIS HANDS WERE RAISED, AS HE PEACHED THE HOUSE. AS THE SOMEONE TOLD HIM HE WAS ABOUT TO BE RECORDED....HE MOVED SLOWLY TOWARD THE BACK DOOR. ARMED THEMSELVES....A SHOTGUN FOR ....AND A ..22 RIFLE FOR....WITHDRAWING INTO THE HOUSE SLIGHTLY...THEY AWAITED THE ARRIVAL OF THE CREATURE. IT MOVED TO WITHIN 20 FEET OF THE BACK DOOR AND BOTH MEN FIRED...NOT ONE PELLET OR BULLET SEEMED TO STRIKE IT...IT SCURRIED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS. THEY WAITED FOR A FEW MINUTES...THEN WENT IN. 
THE FRONT ROOM WHERE THE CREATURE NO LONGER WAS. AT THE SIDE WINDOW ANOTHER ONE APPEARED....AND THIS TIME AT POINT BLANK RANGE THEY FIRED THROUGH THE WINDOW. AGAIN IT DID A FLIP AND DISAPPEARED. THIS TIME THE MEN DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE AND SEE IF IT WAS HIT. AS THEY STEPPED OUTSIDE, ANOTHER ONE APPEARED BEHIND THEM AND THEY QUICKLY WENT BACK INSIDE.
