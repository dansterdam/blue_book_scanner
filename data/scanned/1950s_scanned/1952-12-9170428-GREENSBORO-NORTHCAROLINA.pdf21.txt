STATEMENT CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

On 15 December 1952 while flying straight and level at 15,000 feet, as number two man in a two ship formation (2 RF-80's), I observed an unidentified object at 11 o'clock high position. The time was approximately 0915 and we were heading west over Greensboro, N.C. at the time of sighting. I first noted the object by its silver color, reflections from it, and its oscillating movements. I was flying close formation at the time, approximately 300 MPH, the right wing of the lead aircraft and observed a reflection approximately 6" to 12" above the leader's canopy. At first I thought that it was another aircraft doing "Lazy Eights" at 30,000 feet*or higher; however from past observations of aircraft doing this maneuver at high altitudes, I decided that it was rising and falling too fast to be another aircraft. I called it to the attention of the flight leader, but he did not observe it. About that time we went into a bank and I lost sight of the object and did not observe it again.

Shortly thereafter another two ship element reported an unidentified object. Recognizing their call sign as two pilots in my squadron, I requested that they try to get a good observation since I too had noted it. Since it was some distance away, I could not determine too much about it. However, from my position it appeared about the size of a 50 cent piece and I felt that it was at least 10 miles away. As a rough estimation, it appeared to be looming and gaining about 3,000 feet at a rate of about 5,000 feet per minute. It appeared circular in shape, but distance precluded an accurate description.
