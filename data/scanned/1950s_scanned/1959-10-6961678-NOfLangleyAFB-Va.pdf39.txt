AS THE VARIOUS REPORTS OF STRANGE OBJECTS HAD BEEN RECEIVED FOR SOME TIME FROM VARIOUS MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE SIGHTINGS COULD NOT BE ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATED AND EXPLAINED LOCALLY. THEREFORE, ON 16 MARCH 1948, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE DIRECTED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROJECT GRUDGE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE AIR MATERIAL COMMAND, WRIGHT FIELD, OHIO, FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANALYZING THESE REPORTS AND DETERMINING, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE NATURE OF THE OBJECTS REPORTED. PROJECT GRUDGE WAS OFFICIALLY DEACTIVATED ON 27 DECEMBER 1949, AT WHICH TIME IT WAS REPLACED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK, UNDER THE SAME JURISDICTION. PROJECT BLUE BOOK WAS OFFICIALLY TERMINATED ON 17 DECEMBER 1969. DURING THE OPERATION OF THESE PROJECTS, REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS WERE RECEIVED FROM MANY SOURCES, INCLUDING MILITARY PERSONNEL, COMMERCIAL AIRLINES PILOTS, AND CIVILIANS. WHILE MANY OF THE REPORTED OBJECTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, BALLOONS, AND ASTRONOMICAL BODIES, A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER REMAINED UNIDENTIFIED. THE INVESTIGATION OF EACH SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS HANDLED INDIVIDUALLY AND THOROUGHLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE OBJECT REPORTED.
