11 MARCH 1944 - Captain WILLIAM H. FORD, AD 4521H. At 0230 hours 
while flying at 5,000 feet indicated altitude, his attention was drawn 
to what appeared to be a small light flitting across his path at a 
considerable distance, traveling in an east-west direction. The light 
was brilliant and sharply defined. It was spotted almost due south of 
the aircraft and disappearing behind the left wing seemed to diminish 
rapidly in size as the distance between the aircraft and the light 
increased. The light appeared for approximately two to three seconds.

FORD continued his mission, but the light did not reappear. He made no 
attempt to close on the light, as it gave the appearance of traveling 
at a tremendous rate of speed. FORD stated this incident was an isolated one and that he attached no special significance to it.

FORD'S co-pilot, Lieutenant I. V. GILCHRIST, AG 30 228 769, 
corroborated FORD'S account.

At 0030 hours, 6 March 1944, BRADSHAW (previously unidentified) 
reported he had been unable to locate a definite target or targets. He 
was (1) aircraft, speed 175 (225?), 58 miles SW of NOUASSEUR. He had 
made several runs, and other aircraft was, at times, visible. He broke 
off at 0045 hours due to lack of definite target.
