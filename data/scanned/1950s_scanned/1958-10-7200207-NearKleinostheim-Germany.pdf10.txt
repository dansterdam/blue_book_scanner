There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be a written description or report about a sighting of some unidentified object.

My Opinion as to the description given by my cousin, it could be an object which my cousin saw as minutes toward the earth and was illuminated by the suns rays. As the object fell into the earths shadow, it therefore must have been reflecting the suns rays and was seen in countries west of Germany, especially in north & South America, because there it would still have been day light. The object came in the direction of my cousin because it grew larger and most have been approaching on an approximate decent line the eastern Mediterranean sea toward Australia. Because the object was seen shortly after the moon was launched, it could possibly be the "Pioneer" returning to earth.

My cousin positively says that the object was shaped like a rocket for the railyard for many years, but was often on night duty in the signal tower which most have many large windows, through which one can see the night time heavens very well. He tells me that in his life time he has seen close to 100 shooting stars.
