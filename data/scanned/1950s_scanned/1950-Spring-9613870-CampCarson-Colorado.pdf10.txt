The text of the letter is as follows:

HEADQUARTERS FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION (AFSC)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO 45433

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is the FTD form 164 which is completed except for the exact dates. If you do not have access to the dates of the Survival School at Camp Carson as the closing of 1950 and it is important, I will write for a copy of my records and forward you the exact date.

I wrote the letter on this matter because officially the Air Force has been calling me a liar or otherwise for several years while I was holding a 'top' secret clearance and having access to a lot of highly classified materials. I know what I saw, and I reported it through proper channels. However, if there is a reason for me to shut up on this, I will otherwise it will be discussed as an unclassified.

Sincerely yours,

Col. USAF (Ret.)
