FLYING SAUCER SIGHTED ON FILM IN HAWAII: One of the very rare incidents of a flying saucer being sighted by a capable observer and actually photographed was reported to have occurred at Diamond Head, Hawaii on 3 January 1958. The witness, a 21-year-old college student, was visiting friends at Diamond Head. While looking through a window, he observed a peculiar object moving in the sky to the south. He immediately picked up his camera and succeeded in obtaining several photographs of the object before it disappeared. The object was described as a disc or saucer-shaped object with a dome on top and was metallic in appearance. The witness stated that the object moved at a fairly high rate of speed and completely stopped and hovered at one point during the observation. He is certain that what he photographed was not a conventional aircraft. In 1958, ten UFO photographs were taken at Diamond Head, Hawaii by a junior college student. Several of a UFOS on color film for 90 seconds.
