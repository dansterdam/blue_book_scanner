Transcribing the text from the document:

HEADQUARTERS FAGED MAT'S, KIRTLAND
AFB, IM.

OBSERVER: Lt USN

OBJECT OBSERVED: A 17:44Z 6 seconds direct observation through my telescope of a bright silvery object that seemed to be about twice the size of the moon. The object was observed directly overhead, about 65 degrees azimuth. It appeared to be a balloon or a plane, moving in a steady and level flight. It left no trail and made no sound. I studied the object for the full 6 seconds of its visibility and it appeared to be a silvery, round or elliptical object, sharply defined at the edges, and reflecting a bright silvery light. After about 6 seconds it disappeared abruptly, apparently straight up.

COMMENT: This case appears to be one of a conventional aircraft rather than a UFO: the object was observed to be steady and level in flight, with no unusual maneuvers or characteristics, and was visible for a relatively long period of time (6 seconds). The observer's initial impression that it might be a balloon or a plane seems likely to be correct. No further investigation appears warranted.
