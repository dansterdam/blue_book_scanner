The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a former United States Air Force program to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

a. Textile Sample:
The sample purported to be so-called "angel or hair". It was reportedly a very delicate or fine fibre, white in color, rather evenly distributed in 2-3/4"x4"area. It was given both chemical and microscopic tests and, without doubt, was found to be an industrial product. Subsequent investigation of the origin of this sample in the Materials Branch, did not volatilize.
This is the type of industrial or waste product "lint" that may be encountered by various Government agencies or manufacturing concerns of the type to where this originated. There appears to be no particular significance or importance attached to this material which was other than a normal waste product in manufacturing.
The act which you refer to, of carrying nine pounds of metal a distance of one and one-half miles for deposit in a "fuel pit", must have been the category or "box score" type of reception given this "sample" or material by the investigator. Of course, this could be the result of overzealous or an overactive manufacturing of "cover-up" efforts and so resultantly, constituted a desirable waste of Government time and money and effort.
