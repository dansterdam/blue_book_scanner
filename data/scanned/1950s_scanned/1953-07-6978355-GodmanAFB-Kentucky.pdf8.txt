This page from a Project Blue Book document contains two sketches, but no photographs. The larger sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and instructions for the viewer to imagine a point "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen. The smaller sketch shows two positions, "A" and "B", to represent the object's position when it was first seen and when it was last seen.

Here is the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. 

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
