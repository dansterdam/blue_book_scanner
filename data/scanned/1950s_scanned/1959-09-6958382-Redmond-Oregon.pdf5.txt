Dear Mr. President: 

Please permit me a little of your busy time to ask on behalf of my organization several questions on matters of concern to us all. On the brink of bursting the erstwhile limits of our spatial horizons, we seek simply the truth about these matters. 
 
1. The official publication of NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, of which Donald E. Keyhoe, Major, USMC, Ret., is Director) refers to an Air Force statement which is contrary to Federal Aviation Agency reports. 

The AF-FAA conflict ion concerns the alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on September 24, 1959 near Redmond, Oregon. NICAP states that FAA proof of the tacts of the sightings, proof which is officially logged FAA evidence, includes: details of a chase by four AF F-102 Jets, a description of the UFO and an AF report of tracking the object by radar for over one hour. These FAA reports were signed by L. B. Davis, Chief, Redmond Air Traffic Communication Station, and William F. Zauch√©, Jr., Chief, Air Route Traffic Control Center, Seattle The reports, sent to NICAP, were accompanied by a confirming letter from Eugene S. Kropf, Assistant to the Regional Manager, FAA Region 4, Los Angeles. NICAP states that the FAA reports are at NICAP headquarters in Washington, D.C.. 

NICAP states that on January 19, 1960, it received the following statement, which was signed by Major Lawrence J. Tacker, Pentagon Public Information Officer handling UFO Information: "The ATIC account of the sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of the attempted intercept. It is the ATIC opinion that this object was probably a balloon..." 

Mr. President, do you think that the Air Force should be requested to make, immediately, a complete and public explanation of this case?
