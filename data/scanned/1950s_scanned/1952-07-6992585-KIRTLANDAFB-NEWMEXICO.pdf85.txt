SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Omit classified in-mail commend on separate papen. List enclosures as lower left. Report date of report AT AF Form 112—Part III)

On 30 July 1952 a pilot of an F-89 aircraft contacted GCI for practice intercept. 
The aircraft was vectored to investigate a “meteorological object” in the vicin-
ity of Presque Isle, and Mars Hill, Maine. Definite identification of the ob-
ject was not made; therefore in accordance with AFI 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, 
a FLYOBRPT was submitted.
