I came on a business trip to the Bainbridge Island area near Seattle. I went on Friday afternoon July 18, 1952 and came back the next morning, Saturday, July 19. 

The round thing I saw was in a wooded area across the road from where my family and I were camping near DeBorgia, Montana. It came over the trees, turned sideways, and came down to about 300 feet. Then it went up over the trees, turned sideways again and went away.

This thing made not a sound and the night was clear. It was a bright clear night and I could see it very well. I watched it for at least 15 minutes. I was mystified as to what this thing was. It looked like aluminum colored with bright lights, 25 to 30 feet across, shaped like a disk.

I want to emphasize that I am not a nut and have never been a nut. I have a masters degree and consider myself a very rational and stable person. I have never told this to anybody before but felt I should report it because I think the government should know about things like this. It was a strange and unexplainable experience.
