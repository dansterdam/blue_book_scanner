Transcribed text:

The ob.ject looked round and was real shiny. It was probably still slow as it passed a couple of cars was around the field and stopped. Once in a while it would dim the lights on the cars. There was a light like a star or planet in the center.

It was about 1215 when I saw the object and I was about 20 minutes.

This object was visual from the ground.

I was one (the the 377 bomber) it seemed about 150 feet or more. When I say this object it seemed about 150 feet or more. I don't know why I didn't get a better look at it, it was very bright. The object was about 1000 feet I would say.

I have been in the Guard Forces at Tinker Air Force base for 21 years.
The weather was very clear and there was a slight breeze.
I didn't take any photographs nor obtained any fragments.
There was no aircraft in the air.
