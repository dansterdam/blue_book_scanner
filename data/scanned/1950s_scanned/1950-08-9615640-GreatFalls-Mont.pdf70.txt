The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document that describes a sighting of two bright lights in an echelon formation at Great Falls, Montana on August 15. The text mentions that the objects were made with colored movie films and were featured in a movie titled "Unidentified Flying Objects", which was being shown nationwide on various TV channels at the time.

on August 15, baseball park manager captured the sighting, on film, with his movie camera at Great Falls, Montana, of two round bright lights in echelon formation, which moved behind a water tower. These objects were made with colored movie films and appeared in the movie entitled "Unidentified Flying Objects", now being shown nationwide on various TV channels.

The report received three other movies that were considerable attention. One in 3600 frames showed two bright spots of light speeding away without any visible means of propulsion, and another in 3600 frames showed a bright object being observed under telescope examination. But we were not able to come to any definite conclusions.
