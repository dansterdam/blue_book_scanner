From: "Flying Saucer" information:

Dear sirs:
Another Long Beach, Calif. physician & myself are vacationing in Europe for the month of June and July. Yesterday, July 13, we observed a formation of 9 bright objects, white in color, flying in echelon formation at a tremendous speed. They flashed on the clear sky, were above us for a few seconds, and disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared. There were no vapor trails and no sound. The objects appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length. In my opinion they were at an altitude of approximately 60,000 feet or more. I was looking on the open sun porch adjoining our room on the top floor of this hotel. My companion was also watching them from the rear window of the building. We have seen many unusual aerial phenomena before but never anything quite like this. There were no other known aerial devices in the sky at the time. The sky was almost perfectly clear, with only a few small clouds. There were no reflections or mirages. The objects moved in perfect formation and at a speed which would indicate tremendous propulsion power. I estimate their speed to be somewhere between 3 and 5 thousand miles per hour.

I do not know whether you are as all interested in this subject as I am. In view of the fact that this is the third time I have reported unusual aerial phenomena and in view of the seeming increase in these occurrences, I am anxious to establish direct contact with any person or persons who may be able to evaluate these reports properly. If there is a published journal or periodical devoted to this subject, I should be grateful to have the name and address so that I may subscribe. Perhaps you may be able to suggest some other constructive way in which I can assist in obtaining further data on this most fascinating and important problem. Should you be interested in a photograph of the objects, please write to me at the address below.

Sincerely,
Long Beach, California 
U.S.A.
