There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which contains a questionnaire with multiple-choice questions about the observation of an unidentified object.

S. What direction were you facing when you first saw the object?
8.1 What direction were you facing when the object disappeared?
8.2 Circle one of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to the above two questions.
9. Were you wearing eye glasses when you saw the object?
10. How was the object seen?
11. What do you remember about the weather conditions at the time you saw the object?
11.2 WIND (Circle One)
11.4 TEMPERATURE (Circle One)

The text on the page appears to be the questions and multiple-choice options for the observer to fill out regarding their sighting of an unidentified object.
