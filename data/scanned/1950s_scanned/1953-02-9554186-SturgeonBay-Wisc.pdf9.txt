There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report form, containing text for various questions and instructions.

Here is the text output from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. 

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One):
a. Penny
b. Pea    
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Silver dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following): What are you sure of your answer to Question 22.
a. Exactly certain
b. Not very sure
c. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects appear from view? All lights flashed on and off at irregular intervals and movement was very erratic.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object (or objects) which you saw.

A great stationary candle flame, I think a lemon could be used to illustrate it.
