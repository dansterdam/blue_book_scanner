2. An l i t o r observer, who did not wish to be further
identified. stated that he observed an unidentified
object on August JL3, 1950. in the vicinity of
La Jolla, Caiif'ornia. He states he was traveling in
his private automobile at the time and first observed
the object in the sky to the west of his position.
He stated that the object appeared to be round or
ball-shaped and was traveling at a high rate of speed.
He estimated its speed to be several times that of
conventional jet aircraft. rie could not estimate its
size or distance from him due to the fact that he had
no reference point with which to compare it. He said
the object seemed to be s:noke-gray or silver in color
and did not emit any trail or exhaust. He stated the
object was in sight for approximately 30 seconds
before it disappeared from view to the east. He said
the object did not follow any specific course but
rather seemed to be maneuvering in an erratic, Jerky
fashion.
