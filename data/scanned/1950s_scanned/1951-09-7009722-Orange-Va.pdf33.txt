CASE #   
25 Aug 51   Lubbock, Texas

The bulk of the following information is taken from photostatic copies of article from the Lubbock, Texas, Avalanche Journal, dates 26 August 1951, 28 August 1951, 1 September 1951, 2 September 1951 and 5 September 1951. The contents of these articles have been investigated and verified by the USAF and RANCE AFB officials.

On the evening of 25 August 1951, 31 August 1951 and 1 September 1951, flights of an unidentified object were observed over Lubbock. In some instances there were several flights per evening. The description of the objects varies to some extent but it is generally agreed that it is a V or U shaped set of lights. Photos were obtained of 2 such flights. The photographer has been investigated and appears reliable. Discrepancies in the description of the object 1st in the number of lights, which varies from 50 to 18, and whether it was a V or U shape. The flight path was NE to SW or N to S. They were brighter than stars and yellowish or blue. In most cases there was an absence of noise, a few people heard a slight "whoosh".

The incident has aroused the populace of Lubbock and two theories have arisen. One is that it is an aircraft; the other is that it is light reflecting off some type of migratory fowl.

Three college professors were gathered together discussing astronomy on the evening of 25 August 1951. They happened to be looking at a certain constellation when they observed the first flight at 2110. They described it as a rough semi-circle of lights. A second object passed over 3 minutes later. The men observed that there was no shock wave felt and they surmised that the object or objects must be above 50,000'. (Comment: 10 object or connection were in all probability too high for visual).  Sights except at very low altitudes.) They could not judge the exact attitude or speed but agreed the speed was very high.
