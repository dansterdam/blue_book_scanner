JETS "TRAILER" IS BLAMED FOR "BALL OF FIRE"

Great balls of fire!

This is what many San Joaquin Valley residents swear they saw and northwest sky last evening.

In Hanford many people are reported to be to police Lieutenants to have told of a brilliant California Highway patrolman who followed it. He said it appeared to be moving northward and eventually disappeared.

To some it appeared elliptical, later shortening to nearly circular, but other reports said it looked like the still of a comet. 

Meteorologists of the Fresno Weather Bureau to whom it appeared to be an aircraft were puzzled. They said a red trail left behind and it was apparently at about 35,000 feet and moving at the estimated speed of 600 mph.

The thing had a pale, but shining, yellow color at first but became reddish later, and according to some reports, differed northwestward about 9:50 PM.

The vapor trail had the appearance of a brilliant, streamlined half-mile long bar-like form. Webb said he was standing near "Tulare" and Divisadero Streets where he viewed the sight. He said it appeared to be moving northward and eventually disappeared.
