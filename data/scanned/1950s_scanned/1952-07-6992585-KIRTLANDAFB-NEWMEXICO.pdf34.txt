The document contains two simple sketches, not actual photographs. The first sketch appears to be a circle with a smaller circle beneath it, perhaps depicting a spherical object. An arrow points to the right, indicating the direction of movement. The second sketch features two circles of differing sizes, with a pair of lines resembling a simple face with eyes, and an arrow pointing to the right, representing movement.
