------ during the Christmas Holidays of 1955.
---------The are also very interested in the rays of light given off by this object because at one time this morning we were standing outside under a tree watching it when some rays come directly at us, although we didnâ€™t realize this until the area around the tree limbs above our heads lit up for about a second or two, therefore engulfing us also.
--------- If you can tell us anything about this object we would appreciate it very much.
--------- Sincerely yours,
