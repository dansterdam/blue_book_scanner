had witnessed this, no followup whatever was made. It is that sort of thing at this time; and in a great many other cases that has led to the facetious, but somewhat deadly remark by someone that "Project Blue Book might as well be called Project Unexplained", (Ivan Sanderson's organization) but rather indicates a similarity to the Univeristy Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained since 1947, because of the incompleteness of the investigation of cases reported, since many cases were not adequately followed up. I had often pointed out that our efforts in Dayton and in Washington that a day or reckoning might some day come when the Air Force might be asked to show cause. In this case, for instance, no attempt apparently was made even to find out what was made known to them. How many other cases are incompletely investigated we do not know.

I have rated this a 2 3 C 6 meaning puzzling but possibly explainable case of good sighting. 6, since there were two witnesses technically trained. One witness was a Lieutenant Colonel who was shortly thereafter assigned to the Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters, United States Air Force. It seems unlikely that they would have been militarily misidentification of an FW4, and reported this conclusion, fairly tight turns, and then have turned their own aircraft across misidentification on the part of these two experienced pilots; and therefore, it is unjustified, however, in the statistics for the year to until it is unquestioned, it cannot be fairly called an "unidentified". I have long inveighed against the unacceptable (and this is to say good statistics) statistics employed by Blue Book over the years in transforming "possibles" and "probables" into firm actualities.
