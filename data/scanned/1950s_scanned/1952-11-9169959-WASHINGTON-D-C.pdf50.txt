25 November 1552 Incident of 2 Unidentified Objects observed at Washington, D.C. at time between 23:00 and 00:00.

Objects were at an altitude of 300 to 3000 feet. Speeds of 100 mph, no sound, and erratic/interceptive maneuvers.  

It is believed that due to radar units being slightly off calibration and communications interference, the objects were not tracked on radar. 

It is also believed that the majority of the radar plots were legitimate and that the sightings by competent officers were of an unidentified aerial object.

The sighting officer knows of no object which riis at 3/273 knots, moves without sound, and evades interception.

The Inclined Camera charts and radar should aid in verifying position.
