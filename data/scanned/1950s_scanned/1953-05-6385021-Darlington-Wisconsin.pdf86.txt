8 June 1953

1st Lt. Roger Olsson
ATTN: Electronics Officer APS
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Lt. Olsson,

In connection with the sightings of 21 May in Wisconsin the following phone calls were made for additional information:

(1) To Mr. Glenn Winslow, a Darlington police officer, who reported he saw object first at 0315 overhead, moved it, could see it move, was bright enough for sight observations, did not appear to be a meteor, and disappeared in 15 seconds. Police radio station did not keep up with it. Direction of object changed to South later. Object was observed by Winslow for more than a house estimating distance as daylight.
Overhead sighting, brightness, apparent motion, W heading and change in direction rule out Venus.

(2) Winslow states that police officers in Monroe sighted the same object. Winslow familiar with Venus states object was not Venus. Was asked to observe Venus before sunrise but police officers could locate. Cited object almost as large as the moon.

(3) Called J.B. Sharer, Monroe COG Observation Post. Object not reported to his until 0615 - Object sparkling and difficult to pick up, moving west. Was directly South at 0900. NGTE: Venus on that day was directly South at 0900. His evidence ALL points to Venus.

(4 & 5) Jamie also called Chicago and Green Bay Filter Centers to see if the object was picked up on their radar screens. Green Bay had no direct reports but later sent down a newspaper clipping from Darlington paper - Chicago had 2 radar tracks on an object supposedly the same as seen on ground. The radar was picking up a moving target.

It seems probable on the present evidence that some observers saw Venus and others identified did not and probably saw a balloon.
