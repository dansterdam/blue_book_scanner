STARS OR PLANETS

GENERAL

The planets, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are generally brighter 
than any star, but they twinkle very much less (unless very close to horizon). 
Stars twinkle a great deal and when near the horizon can give impression 
of flashing light in many colors.
1. Shape: Pinpoint - starlike.
2. Size: Never appreciable.
3. Color: Yellow with rainbow variations.
4. Speed: Stars apparent speeds carry them from east to west in the 
course of the night but they are often reported as erratic.
The effect is psychological, most people being unable to 
consider a point as being stationary. Occasionally tur-
bulence in the upper atmosphere can cause a star to appear 
to jump (rare) but somehow twinkling gives the impression of 
movement to many people. Note: Just because the report says 
the light moves does not rule out the possibility of it being 
a star unless motion is from one part of sky to another in 
relatively short time.
5. Formation; There are no clusters of very bright stars but faint 
stars are grouped in their familiar constellations.
Note: A report of 4 or 5 bright clustering lights would 
rule out stars.
6. Trail: None.
