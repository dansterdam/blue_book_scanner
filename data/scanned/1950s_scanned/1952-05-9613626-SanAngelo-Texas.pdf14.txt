SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDEhTIFIED FLYING OBJECT AT SAN ANGELO, TEXAS ON 19 May 1952

While the pilot and co-pilot of a training B-25 medium bomber were flying a routine rissicn at 12,000 feet altitude 40 miles west of San Angelo, Texas, they observed an unidentified obj eet at 12:41 PM, 19 May 1952. The object was first noticed by the pilot while flying straight and level on a westerly course. He first observed it at a distance of approximately 15 miles directly ahead and slightly above. It appeared to be in level flight and traveling in a north to northeasterly direction. As the pilot continued to watch it, the object commenced an erratic motion, diving and climbing in a rapid and abrupt manner. This motion was visible to both the pilot and co-pilot. At one point the object appeared to stop momentarily, then resume its northerly direction. At no time did it appear to leave a vapor trail. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Its size was estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter. It could not be identified as any known type of aircraft by the pilot and co-pilot.

The aircrafts commander of the 12-25 related the San Angelo sighting, and a ground radar station which was in operation at the time did not pick up any unidentified targets.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officers:
It is the opinion of the intelligence officer that the pilot's report of the sighting is accurate and reliable, and it is definitely worthy of further investigation.
