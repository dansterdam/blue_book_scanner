The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only text.

The text in the document reads:

"New Mexico

The seven persons reported said they were told by a UFO on Fat., Reb. 21st, while driving their car near the mouth of Fats, that they had been selected for the purpose of having a rather critical laboratory examination. The flashes were seen in a directing fashion."
