On the morning of July 23, 1953, Mrs. and I were fishing at the marsh of Pontriage, Wauwatosa. At approximately 8:30 a.m. a bright object hovering over the marsh was observed. This object appeared to be oblong in shape, somewhat oval, and was changing colors from flame color to white. The object hovering motionless at first made no sound. By skirting the edge of the trees the object could be seen clearly. It made no westerly movement but seemed to move closer to us. It then moved to the southeast and out of sight. The object appeared to give off light or reflection. It remained in view about 5 minutes. We were amazed at this spectacle and could not explain it. As soon as the object disappeared a military jet aircraft passed overhead at high speed.
