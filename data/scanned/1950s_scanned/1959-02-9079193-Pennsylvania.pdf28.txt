UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Pennsylvania
Date: 28 Feb 1959
Hour (Z): 2045
Visibility unlimited at 3500' - on top of broken clouds
Description: Three lights varying in color from yellow to orange, also changing in intensity from dim to brilliant. Lights apparently moving east to west
Direction of Motion: E to W
Satellites: (AFCIN-473; Phone 69219) Checked - objects much too slow and uniform
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) Objects too slow for meteors - description doesn't fit - motion rules out planet
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-41): N/A
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) Size of object rules out "ball lightning"
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Possibly aircraft
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably very good.
Analysis and Conclusions: Information from Pittsburgh is that a B-47 returning operation was in progress at the time of the sighting. The Air Force bomber and tanker aircraft were flying from east to west. Witness indicates he is not familiar with the flight patterns used during refueling operations, and the objects of this sighting were probably due to a misinterpretation of the lights on aircraft during a refueling operation.
