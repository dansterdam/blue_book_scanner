Blood and Glass Create Prain-Producing Chemical

A PAIN-PRODUCING substance found in the blood is described in a report in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. This substance appears to be formed by the action of glass on the blood. The substance produces pain when injected into the muscles.

The pain-producing substance appears to be another type of chemical substance in the same general class as histamine, which is known to produce pain. The substance is similar to the factor found in blood producing inflammation. The presence of this substance may account for the pain sometimes experienced by persons who have their blood drawn and is contained in the glass tube.

ANTHROPOLOGY
New Dates Add to Man's Antiquity in America

MAN HAS NOW been shown to have lived in the Americas some 35,000 years ago. This is the oldest date established with certainty.

The date, 35,000 plus or minus 29,000 years, is established in Science, the report of a study of charcoal found in Guanaco Cave, Chile.

The radiocarbon dating method is the tool used in arriving at the age of this charcoal sample. The 35,000-year date greatly extends the antiquity of man in America beyond the previous oldest date of about 14,000 years. This new date shows that man was present in the Americas much earlier than has been believed."
