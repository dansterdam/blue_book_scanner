    Contacts With Space People
    Glossing quickly over the most
documented sightings, the AF con-
centrated on one case the explainers
felt they could thoroughly discredit
and thus infer that the other ones
were just as unreliable. They had
the perfect setup; a man who claim-
ed he had been inside a space ship
and talked to the occupants. The

man in the street tended to discount
so-called “contact stories.” And as
soon as it had been learned that the
man had a prison record, the anti-
saucer elements began to have a
field day. To cap it off they had
the witness put in the booby hatch,
but apparently were able to hold him
there only a few days.

    You’ve probably heard much of
the Kearney Nebr., case. Reinhold
Schmidt, grain dealer of California,
said he had come upon a huge ob-
ject resting in a river bed. At first
he thought it was a huge balloon—
but instead of reporting what was in
the papers, let FLYING SAUCERS
bring out the next best thing to
hearing a taped interview with
Schmidt. Thanks to a friend who
broadcasts a flying saucer radio pro-
gram, and Gene Larson, news direc-
tor of Station KGFW, Kearney,
Nebr., we publish the interview
verbatim, as it went out over the air.

    LARSON: This is Gene Larson,
news director of Radio Station
KGFW, in Kearney, Nebraska. At
the present time on this Tuesday
evening, Nov. 5, 1957, we are at our
studio. The time is central standard
time, 7:20. At our side at micro-
phone we have a Mr. Reinhold O.
Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt has stated
that his home address in Bakersville,
California, is 715 Gage St., and that
he is employed by Valle-Pak, Inc.
They are in the wholesale hay, feed
and grain concentrates. Their office
is 501 West Main St., at Brawley,
California. Mr. Schmidt, this after-
noon I believe you had something
occur to you, and you talked a little
bit about it. We would like to ask
you a series of questions. The infor-
mation that I have given so far, Mr.
Schmidt, is that correct?

    SCHMIDT: Yes.

    LARSON: In other words you
work for Valle-Pak, Inc., you live
in Bakersville—you are in Kearney,
