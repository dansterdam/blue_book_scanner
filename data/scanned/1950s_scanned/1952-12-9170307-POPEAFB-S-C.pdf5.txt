I. Description of Incident
From 11:20 to 22:15 a ground radar station picked up an unidentified object, It appeared to be a stationary object with a slight circular motion which did not cancel out when the moving target indicator was employed. Five blips showed this circular motion indicator at approximately 5,000 to 6,000 feet from the ground station. Numerous reversing and returning movements were present in the area. Eight transient aircraft flew through the area during the radar observation and an F-51 was directed to investigate. The pilot saw nothing unusual. The radar operators involved have had several years experience.

II. Discussion of Incident 
Photographs were taken of the PPI scope but have not been received by ATIC. There is a possibility that local cloud formations may have caused a spurious radar return. Other than this there appears to be no plausible explanation for the incident.

III. Conclusion
Possibly weather phenomena.
