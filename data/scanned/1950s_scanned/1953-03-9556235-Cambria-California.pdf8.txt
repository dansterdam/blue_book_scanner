LOCATION: Cambria, California DATE OF OBSERVATION: 9 March 1953

PREPARED BY: G2, HEADQUARTERS, 775th AC&W SQ, MARCH AFB, CALIF. DATE OF REPORT: 17 March 1953

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: An unidentified bright, disc-shaped object was observed in the sky over Cambria, California on 9 March 1953 between 2100 and 2135 PST. The object was described as being silver in color and traveling at a high rate of speed over the horizon. It appeared to be approximately 25-50 feet in diameter. The object was observed by several persons who were on the horizon when first sighted. The object was described as spherical in shape, with no visible means of propulsion. It appeared to be traveling in a horizontal direction and changing to a zig-zag pattern as it moved away. The speed of the unidentified object was described only as "excessive". No contrails or visible means of propulsion were observed.

On two subsequent nights, 10 and 11 March 1953, an extremely bright planet was visible in the direction from which the unidentified object had appeared to come. It was not determined whether this planet was the same object observed on 9 March 1953.
