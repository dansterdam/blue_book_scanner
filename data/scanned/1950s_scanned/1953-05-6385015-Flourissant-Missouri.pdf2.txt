SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
Observed Florissant, Missouri

1. This District Office is in receipt of correspondence from the Ft. Louis Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated 9 June 1953, regarding subject matter, as follows:

For your information and for whatever action you may deem ap-
propriate, on 20 May 1953, Mr. Rollie Olsen, a prosperous merchant of Florissant, Missouri, advised his wife and daughter while eating dinner about 6:00 P.M., that he had observed an unidentified object slowly descending from the west in the sky in a direct line flight from the porch of their residence.

Mrs. Olsen was unable to observe the object, the speed or height of which he stated he could not estimate, but she was disturbed by his manner and appearance during the observation to permit his wife to bring his night power glasses through which he periodically observed that it appeared to move in a series of about eight surges or starts with one second intervals between, after which it disappared from his sight as it blended into the sky and stars. 

He advised that he had difficulty in distinguishing it from a star, but was of the opinion that it was not an aircraft and could not be classified as such. He further related that the glasses did not seem to bring the object any nearer.

This information has been obtained from other than USAF sources and may not be disseminated outside the Air Force establishment.
