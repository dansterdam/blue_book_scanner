I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 11 February 1952, between 1305 and 1315 CST, the source, a civilian woman, was checking a flight plan list at an airfield near Kansas City, Missouri, when she observed a strange object in the sky. The object was observed for ten minutes through 6 x 30 binoculars and during this period it remained stationary over the observer and contained south of Kansas City.

II. FACTS OF INVESTIGATION
A pibill balloon was launched from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, at 0930 CST and it is doubtful if the balloon launched at 0920 would be in the area at 1305 CST as they usually burst within the area at 1305 CST.
The balloon launched at 1130 CST could have been observed, however. In the 35 minutes between the time of 1130 CST balloon launching and the observation, the balloon would have ascended to approximately 30,000 feet and would have traveled approximately 15 miles. (The wind was from 3150 at approximately 30 knots.) This would mean that the balloon passed near the source, if some allowance is made for an error in timing, it is very possible that the balloon could have passed directly over the observer.

III. CONCLUSION:
The object observed by the source was very possibly a rawindsonde balloon launched from Fairfax Airport.
