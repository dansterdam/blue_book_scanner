AF, FORM 112 - PART II
UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM:  Materiel Intelligence Division, 4410 
MATS, Andrews AF Base, Washington, 
DATE:  25 March 1952   
IR-110-52
PAGE 2 of 4

1. At the time of the first sighting, the GCA team was being utilized by a local commercial airline company for that purpose. At the same time, the traffic controller at the Traffic Controller Section, Climb to 10,000 feet, tried to make a visual sighting and to intercept the target. Upon arrival to its new position, they tried in vain to make a visual sighting and interception; this was impossible due to poor weather conditions that existed at the time.

2. The aircraft was vectored in by the GCA team to the headings of the target, but no visual sighting or contact was made of the target.

3. Reproduced below are extracts of certified statements by the personnel reporting this incident:

(2) After the tower relayed this information to me, I contacted Reykjavik Operations Center. I noted that other aircraft had been cleared into this area. No other aircraft had been cleared. At 0735Z I requested the GCA Unit to pick up the target. This was indicated up the first time.
