Dear Mr. ____,

Reference is made to your letter of January 18 to Senator Margaret Chase Smith, requesting the return of some negatives from Project Blue Book. 

The object in the negatives is the star Arcturus. This was determined by an analysis of the negatives and information submitted in conjunction with the negatives by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Scientific Consultant to Project Blue Book.

The negatives are returned as requested.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
