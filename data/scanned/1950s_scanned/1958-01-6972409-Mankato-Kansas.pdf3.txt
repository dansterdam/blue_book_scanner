Before she could get her camera focused again I saw that the
nose of the plane was disappearing and told her to hurry or
she would be too late to get a picture. She looked and
raised the camera but didn't take the picture as the plane
was disappearing in an irregular line and continued to do
so back through the cockpit and finally through the tail
until all that was left was the white light of the aerial
which showed for a few moments and then was gone.

The sky was clouded in that direction and only two lines of
light from the sun could be seen after the plane disappeared.
One was in line with the spot where the plane had been and
the other farther above the horizon.

The time lapse from when we first sighted it until it dis-
appeared was several minutes, possibly five.

What was this phenomenon?

What caused it?

Are there planes in existence which have aerials similar to
the ones mentioned?

If what we saw was the image of a plane where was the original
located?

Have you received any reports from others who saw this object?

Thank you for any information.

                Respectfully,
