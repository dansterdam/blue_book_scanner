The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, possibly a page from a UFO report document.

I think we should be told.
At 20 min. to 4 o'clock Monday morning May family of 4 children + herself were in our car. The car was moving. They were Dressing, and out location was about 1 1/2 mi east of Harrison 30 yds. seated next to my wife and to all concerned half asleep.
We were out at this place because of a bright light - strange and to what we were for our way home. My wife's voice brought me out of why she had woke to that light there - I answered a small farm light - my wife - something like that! She spoke up half asleep and that she was moving.
It did not take the long to come to!
