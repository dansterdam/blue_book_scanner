The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead
    /\
   /  \
Horizon - - - - - You - - - - - Horizon

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.
[The witness has drawn a sketch showing an elliptical object moving from left to right across the horizon with arrows indicating its motion.]
The witness described the object as flying the elliptical course very rapidly. It appeared to move silently, without sound. Generally several objects, up to 4, were following the first one. There were no vapor trails, smoke or exhaust visible. The object had no definite shape - just a bright glowing mass. The object was in view for about 3 to 4 minutes.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[The witness has drawn a sketch showing an elliptical object with no distinct features.]
The object appeared as a saucer-shaped or football-shaped object. The object appeared to be metallic and was somewhat shiny. It was estimated to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter.
