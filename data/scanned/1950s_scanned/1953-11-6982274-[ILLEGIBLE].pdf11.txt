The image provided does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, with various fields filled out, including date, time group, location, source, number of objects, length of observation, type of observation, course, photos, and physical evidence. The text in these fields is mostly illegible, with the exception of the "BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS" field, which appears to contain handwritten notes, but is too faint to be accurately read.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can output the text found in the document, which is as follows:

1. DATE 2. TIME GROUP
3. 21 - C*ij - Ì‚ 3 
4. SOURCE

5. NUMBER OF OBJECTS 
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
7. COURSE 
8. PHOTOS
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

10. CONCLUSION
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
