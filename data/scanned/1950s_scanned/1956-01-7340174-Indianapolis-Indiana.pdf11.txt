The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing a brightness comparison at Indianapolis, where someone was opening a gas station or supermarket and had several of those portable strobe-producing lights. The document mentions that in contrast, they were candles in brightness. It also suggests that if this is Army photographic equipment, similar high intensity lighting sure would help on low visibility approaches on dark foggy nights.

For brightness comparison - at Indianapolis someone was opening a gas station or super market or something and had several of those portable strobe producing lights. In contrast, they were candles in brightness. 

Another point I had not thought of - after the light went out, or disappeared. I did not see any aircraft position lights. Suggestion: If this is Army photographic equipment, similar high intensity lighting sure would help on low visibility approaches on dark foggy nights.
