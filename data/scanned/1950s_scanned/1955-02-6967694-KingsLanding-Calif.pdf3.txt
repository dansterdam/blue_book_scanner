This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten report or document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) between 1952 and 1969.

The text in the document reads as follows:

The event at Kings Landing, Calif. would probably have been the sighting of the 2nd type of unidentified object reported in this particular case. That is, a dark object first seen at about 6:00 P.M. which was observed to travel at a high rate of speed, passing from a point near the horizon to a point high in the sky and then disappearing. A larger, lighted object was reported to have appeared shortly thereafter, maneuvering in the sky and then disappearing. This account seems to be quite consistent with many other sightings of this nature. Some investigators have speculated that the initial sighting was probably of a conventional aircraft, and the later appearance of the lighted object was perhaps an unidentified aircraft. Under the circumstances described, however, I am not certain that either of these explanations can be accepted with a high degree of confidence.

No more has contacted me concerning this matter. I shall be writing to the observers asking that they provide additional details which might assist in the evaluation of this report. It is hoped that the full facts can be determined, since this case is of more than usual interest.
