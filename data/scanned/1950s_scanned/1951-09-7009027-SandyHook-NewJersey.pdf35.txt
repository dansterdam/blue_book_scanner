Col T: All right, may I ask you at this point whether you personally interviewed the pilots?
Maj B: I talked to one of them on the phone, but I didn't see them.
Col T: Was he able to give you any additional description of the object, as to its apparent shape, methods of propulsion, possible construction, and so on?
Maj B: No, he said it was a round object which reflected the sun's rays, indicating a metallic surface. That appears simply my interpolation, - they say it reflected rays - That it was moving in an arc-like direction, they said it was an arc-like movement, not straight - in an arc, and that when they got approximately 8000 feet from it, it veered, and went out to sea and vanished completely. Now I was told by Lt. Rogers that he communicated with one of the radar set-ups in this vicinity, and asked them to search, and he told me that the response was entirely negative.
Col T: The radar unit did check during the course of operation and did not report anything appearing on the radar scope.
Maj B: That as I remember Lt Rogers conversation with me, - at the time I didn't make any particular note of it but it has since come up, and seems to be important and I believe that's true. Now, Colonel, perhaps you'll want to talk to one of those pilots at Dover. They are at Dover today.
Col T: They are assigned to a fighter interceptor wing at Dover? Is that Dover, Delaware? Dover, Maryland?
Maj B: I believe it's Delaware sir, but I'm not certain.
Col T: Yes. What is the designation of their unit, do you know?
Maj B: It was 148th Fighter Interceptor Unit.
