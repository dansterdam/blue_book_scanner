dead-reckoned pre-plot information, these stations except Benton, Pa., detected anything that could possibly have been correlated with track BB-6. Antiaircraft units in the area of the track penetration were also advised but were unable to obtain contact with this target. Texas Tower #2, the picket ships and AEW stations in the area did not report unusual, high speed targets during this time.

The characteristics of the target blip described by the three operations personnel indicated that this return appeared realistic insofar as shape and size were concerned. The initial target return observed at 2130 unit was thought to be that of an aircraft showing Mark X identification. Several sweeps later the Mark X beacon control at the scope was placed in the off position but the target characteristics remained the same. As the target approached the station, the size diminished but the intensity remained the same. Tracking continuity and blip/scan were 100% throughout the entire track.

The FPS-20 was operating on Channel 2 during this period. At 1912z, Channel 2 failed and the set went off the air. Thirty seconds later Channel 1 was in operation. A defective tube in the modulator caused the above failure. Set operation and console noise level appeared normal during the time of the incident.

On NORAD Team Observations: A series of random blips on a UPA-35 console. These blips occurred at a constant azimuth of 160Â° but at various ranges. The operations personnel involved in the BO incident noted these blips.
