Rosalia, Washington
I. Description of Incident
A B-29 aircraft was in flight in the vicinity of Spokane, Washington, when one of the crew members sighted an unusual object. The flight was at 32,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of around three to five minutes as an unidentified course circling and drifting in the air. It was visually observed for a period of approximately 45-55 seconds.
II. Discussion of Incident
ATIC determined that a scheduled balloon payload was in the general area at the time of sighting. U.S. Weather Bureau records indicate a scheduled gas balloon release took place at 0900Z on 7 February 1955 from Miles City, Montana. It was estimated the balloon would take approximately four hours to reach the general vicinity of the sighting. If the object sighted was the gas balloon, it would have taken approximately 45-55 seconds for it to pass the aircraft, which is consistent with the visual observation time. Therefore, it is concluded that the object sighted was probably the gas balloon.
III. Conclusion
Probably balloon.
