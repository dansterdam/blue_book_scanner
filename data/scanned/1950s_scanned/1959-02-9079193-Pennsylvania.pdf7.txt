COMMENT NO. 1

This is the same incident reported by Capt. of American Airlines. The incidents took place approximately 50 miles east of Youngstown, Ohio at 2040 hours. Witnesses sighted objects over Youngstown that were described as approximately 200-210 knots and the distance from the point of sighting was approximately 110-130 miles. 

A member of the Unidentified Flying Objects Research Committee, who is a member of the United Airlines, interviewed Capt. and has probably a remembrance of this sighting.
