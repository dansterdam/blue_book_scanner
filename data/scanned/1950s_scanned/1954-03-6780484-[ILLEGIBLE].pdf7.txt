I am convinced that the source of the lights was up the river toward south. The lights seemed to be hovering in the air for sometime. They would appear to move rapidly for a short distance and then stop and hover again. The lights looked to be about the size of a man's fist held at arm's length. There were about 4 or 5 of them. They were a whitish-blue color. The lights were up the river beyond the trees and below the horizon. They were not on the ground but up in the air. The lights were not aircraft and did not have any sound. The lights moved in a horizontal motion up the river and did not ascend or descend vertically.
