Dear Sirs:

I wish to report having seen a "Flying Saucer". It may have been one that could have been recorded by your project, and I want to relate the circumstance of its existence. 

I was on a vacation camped on a small lake called Rock Island Lake which is near Tavern Lake about eighty miles north of Kankakee, Illinois. It was about nine o'clock in the evening and the sky was perfectly clear and the moon was perfectly clear and about half full and at a height.

Suddenly under the moon and at a height about halfway between the horizon was a sight which traveled from east to west perfectly horizontally and it seemed very fast. Its apparent size was about twice the size of an average star. When it disappeared I could not be sure whether it went behind the hills or whether its light went out, but it seems to me to have remained apparently the same during the time it was in sight.

Its appearance was as if it were made of clear plastic containing a brilliant white light. The main body was a disc, the thickness of which was about one-sixth of its diameter. As the rear was a blunt rounded nose about the shape of the front of an aircraft nose and toward the rear the sides became blunt and almost flat. There was no visible motion and no noise and its appearance was as well as I can draw it.

For two days afterward I tried to convince myself that this was a reflection or could be explained some normal manner as to go up to one or two seconds from an attitude of almost complete disbelief to one of firm conviction that this thing exists and that I saw it.

Yours sincerely,
