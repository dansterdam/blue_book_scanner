Here is the OCR-generated text from the document:

```
Sgt Bolio called in December Mr. from NICAP wrote a letter 15
requesting information on this same subject and in January sent a letter
to Major Tacker informing you of the evaluation of the Portland, Ore
UFO sighting of 24 September 1959. It is carried on the records of
ATIC as insufficient information. The ATIC account of the sighting
fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of
the attempted intercept. It is the ATIC opinion that the object was
probably a balloon as evidenced by the relatively long period in
the area, more than an hour, and the fact that unless equipped with
reflectors, balloons are not good radar reflectors. The average
direction and strength of the wind at the time of the sighting was
South at 15 knots.

The section from the signature reading "T43" can be identified as a date (14-Jan-1960) as text, followed by a signature that appears to read "Tom Tower."
