REPORT NO. UNCLASSIFIED      3 OF 32 PAGES

72. UNIDENTIFIED CONDITIONS AT TIME OF SIGHTING ARE NOTED AS FOLLOWS:

a. U. S. Weather Bureau Reports on winds and velocities as follows:
Surface winds 320 degrees at 10 knots
Winds at 3,000 feet 320 degrees at 15 knots
Winds at 6,000 feet 320 degrees at 18 knots
Winds at 9,000 feet 320 degrees at 22 knots
Winds at 12,000 feet 320 degrees at 28 knots
Winds at 15,000 feet 320 degrees at 32 knots
Winds at 18,000 feet 320 degrees at 36 knots
Winds at 21,000 feet 320 degrees at 39 knots

b. Ceilings: None.
c. Visibility: 10 miles.
d. Cloud cover: None.
e. Thunderstorms in area and quadrant in which located: None.

3. An unconfirmed report indicates the sighting of an unidentified aircraft. The possibility exists that the pilot did observe and look on an unidentified object and that his description is necessarily as accurate as possible, as it may have increased its distance to a considerable degree over a second time but was due to its apparent abrupt acceleration.

4. There is a possibility that momentary ground clutter returns similar to the pilot's description. These are often caused by atmospheric conditions or an unexplained anomaly in the radar. The pilot's description has the two were the same object.

5. The determination that the blip was actually the sighted aircraft could not be made due to the pilot's failure to observe closing rate indicators as his aircraft increased its distance at a considerable rate of acceleration.

6. The duplicate interferences encountered was probably coincidental.
a. An AF-W-APL memo summarizes the interfereces between the two targets as:
     (1) The possibility of simultaneous jamming.
     (2) The possibility of controlled as to the high voltages and low wattages involved.
b. No conclusion can be drawn from the pilot's description of the interference with such conditions as existed.
