Dear Sir,

On June 14, 1954, I forwarded a letter to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, the same mentioned a sighting of unidentified aerial vehicles manifesting above Canterbury, New Zealand on June 6, 1954. I requested a comprehensive investigation for additional information regarding this sighting. To date, I have not received any further communication.

I should appreciate it if you could institute a thorough inquiry into the matter and advise me of the results. Any information or assistance you may be able to provide would be most welcome.

Sincerely yours,
