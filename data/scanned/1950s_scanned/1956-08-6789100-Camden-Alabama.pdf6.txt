No. Case (Information Only)	
Case 180, Greenfield, Mass, Aug. 1, 1956.—The follow-
ing report is related by its investigator, Rev. Albert Baller:
"Mr. George Kendrick awoke at about 2 a.m. From his
bed he could see through a window to the East. His at-
tention was drawn to an extremely bright orange ‘star’ of
enormous size which hung about 10 degrees above the
horizon. He awakened Mrs. Kendrick who went outdoors
to get an unobstructed view of it. She gives its apparent
size as ‘about half the size of the full moon’ and its color
‘a deep orange.’ Not noticed at first, but later in her two
hours of observation, was a ‘narrow, rope-like beam of
light’ which emerged from one side of the disc and ex-
tended vertically for ‘considerable distance’. Also, after
watching this object for a short while she noted another
object (not clearly visible at first, because of the brilliance
of object No. 1) which was a short distance in front of
the disc and of a dull, silver color. Also, this second ob-
ject, which looked ‘like a large silver peanut standing on
end’, showed a rather irregular contour and its edges
were not sharply defined as with the disc. After watching
this spectacle for a time, Mrs. Kendrick reports that a
new development took place. Suddenly the bright orange
disc began to ‘spit out tiny white stars’ which began to
fly every which way over Greenfield. They flew with no
obvious pattern, sometimes one alone, sometimes two or
three together in a ‘crazy series of maneuvers’. She
counted them as they appeared and found that there were
eight. When Mrs. Kendrick looked again at the disc
at about 4 a.m. these smaller star-like objects were no
longer apparent."
