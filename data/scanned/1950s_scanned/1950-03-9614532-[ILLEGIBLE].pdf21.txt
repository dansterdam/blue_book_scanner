Flying Saucer Whirls Above Baldwin Hills
It's an Odd Kite, With String Control, Designed by Former Jet Test Pilot as 'Aerial Target'
A flying saucer whirled over the Baldwin Hills yesterdayâ€” some 15 inches in diameter, with curved yellow vings that rotate with disk.
On the ground, holding the string, was Roy Wolford, former jet test pilot, who thinks his cardboard saucers may be the cause of many "flying saucer" reports from householders who glimpsed one of the kites spinning in the air.
