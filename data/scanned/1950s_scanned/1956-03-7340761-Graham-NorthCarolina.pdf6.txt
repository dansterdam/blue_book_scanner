Flight 2-B, 4602DI AISS 
Part Four
I. SOURCE: Mr. [REDACTED]
Address: [REDACTED] North Carolina
Age: 45
Occupation: Sgt, North Carolina Highway Patrol
Education: High School Graduate

II. RELIABILITY: Cannot be judged. SOURCE was interviewed by telephone.

III. SOURCE’S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Personnel at the GOC post Fairchild 
Field, Graham, North Carolina (GIG 3505), called the Highway Patrol Office and 
reported seeing the object. SOURCE proceeded to the post where he also observed 
it. He saw the object in the south, and was fairly certain that he observed it 
for one minute. The sky was dark but stars were visible. The weather was clear, 
cool and dry; a slight breeze was blowing. The object appeared to stand still 
and change in brightness. It did not suddenly speed up, break up, give off smoke 
or change shape. Neither did it move in front of or behind any other objects. It 
was viewed through 7x50 binoculars. The object was brighter than the background 
of the sky and compared favorably with an auto headlight more than a mile away. 
The object appeared to be solid, and was green, amber and yellow in color. Its 
edges were sharply outlined and it made no sound. SOURCE was fairly certain 
that it compared in size to a baseball held at arm’s length. It disappeared over 
the horizon. SOURCE estimated the object to be two or three miles away, and he 
thought it was caused by some type of weather phenomena. This was the first 
sighting SOURCE had witnessed.
