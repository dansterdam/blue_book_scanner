The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, possibly a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"Ever since that incident, that photo would be in my possession and never would be shown to anyone, or published and returned. We consider the sighting incident a strictly confidential matter, and cannot divulge any information concerning it to the press or anyone else.

We have not retained the negative or print of the photo, as you requested, and a reasonable explanation of the delay in replying would be that we were attempting to locate it and find the proper procedure for returning it to you. Unfortunately, we do not have the photo in our possession and cannot return it. Please believe that we are as anxious as you to clear up this matter as soon as possible. We appreciate your interest and trust that you will understand our position in this affair. If you have any other questions, please feel free to communicate with us."
