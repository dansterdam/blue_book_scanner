CERTIFICATE

At approximately 11:15 PM E.D.S.T., on Tuesday, 20 June 1953, I observed what appeared to be a multiple of disc-shaped objects in the sky. The objects appeared to be somewhat larger than the "full moon" and were definitely of an unconventional design. The object was hovering in the sky at a north-easterly direction and then disappeared from sight. The object was distinctly outlined and had definite forms.

There were one or other men present at the time and they will corroborate this observation.
