AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO.: AFOIR-15-35  
DATE: 6 JUN 1953
PAGES: 1 of __ 

SUBJECT: Object Sighting, Newton, MS and Lake Charles, LA, 23 May 1953

On 23 May 1953 at approximately 2325 hours, Mr. John J. Coyne, Consultant of 3200 Snider, Dallas, Texas, reported to Wing Intelligence Officer that he had sighted an unidentified object while in route to New Orleans from Dallas, Texas. The object was initially observed at approximately 2247 hours CST about 25 miles north of Newton, Mississippi, traveling at an estimated speed of 700 - 800 MPH and at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet. The object maintained a steady parallel course with the aircraft and remained in sight for approximately 40 - 45 minutes, at which time it began gaining altitude and disappeared from view. The object appeared oblong or elliptical in shape, emitting a steady white light which at times appeared to intensify and diminish in brilliance.

The witness was certain the object was not a star, planet, or any known type of aircraft or celestial body. It was not affected by cloud cover encountered during the sighting. The witness reported the incident immediately upon landing at Dallas.

This report has been investigated and the facts related in this report are substantially correct.
