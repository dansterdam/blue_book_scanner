AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 29 SEPTEMBER 1951
PLACE OF OBSERVATION: ORANGE, VIRGINIA
On 29 September 1951 at 8:15 PM (EST), an unidentified object was observed in the sky over Orange, Virginia. The object was described as circular, approximately 25-30 feet in diameter, and silver or aluminum in color. It was observed for approximately 3-4 minutes before disappearing. The object moved in a straight line and at a constant speed, estimated to be around 500-600 mph. No sound was heard.
The report states that "the object was definite and easily identified" but "it is believed impossible for conventional aircraft to perform the speed and maneuverability exhibited by the object."
