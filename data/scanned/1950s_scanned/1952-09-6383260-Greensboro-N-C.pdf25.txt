Dear Sir:

Enclosed you will find two reports which are self explanatory. I desire to submit the following information as a strange object in the sky on the night of September 12, 1952. These people reported the sighting to me because they know me to be active in the Naval Air Reserve and a Naval Aviator. Both of these militers have had considerable experience in flying, this matter came to my attention when your Major Rood who in turn asked me to handle the matter and enclose a statement which they subsequently furnished.

Since obtaining these statements I have talked with several persons who also saw this object and find that the basic description is about the same with all of them, one of these persons is Mr. Arthur Jefferson of the Army Reserve Corps. One person in the vicinity of Lake James and elsewhere, N.C. and others.

If there is any further information you desire me to secure I will be glad to do so.

Very truly yours,
