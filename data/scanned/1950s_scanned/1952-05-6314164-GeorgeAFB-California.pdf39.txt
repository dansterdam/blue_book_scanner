Chicago, 3/18/52

It has been approximately a week since I last contacted Bluebook regarding the sighting of a strange object over George AFB, California on 5-6-52. I have not as yet received any further response or information from you. The incident was reported through channels on that date, with a request for any information or investigation that could be conducted.

Curious as to whether any follow-up has been made, and if you have any details concerning the matter. This was an unusual sighting, and one which merits further inquiry. Please advise what, if any, action has been taken.

Thank you for your attention to this request. I would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, as I am most anxious to learn what progress, if any, has been made in this investigation.

Sincerely yours,
