Approximately 2:25 p.m., 27 June 1956, OCR # 15 015 C1LMENS AVENUE, Wilmington, Ohio, age 17; age 10.
All supposed to report sighting a strange aircraft approximately 2-4 miles north of Wilmington, Rt. 32. When first sighted, the craft was below tree-top level. The craft appeared to be taking off on the ground; however, they did not see it on the ground.
Craft described appeared to be round - the diameter appeared to be the length of an automobile. A bulge in center of the top - looked like a canopy of a plane. It made no noise and there was no smoke or vapor trail. It was silver color. The craft was about 3' or 4' thick.
They stated they were familiar with the shape and outline of a jet plane. They said it was very fast. They appeared to descend at a steep angle at first, then almost vertically. It was out of sight in three or four seconds.
The youngest boy said it looked like a "button."
This is a report from the radio.
