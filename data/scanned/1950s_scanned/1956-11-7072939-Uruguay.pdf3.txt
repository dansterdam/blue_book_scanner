CIOVT brings this case to consideration as it was reported by a member of the Armed Forces of our country. A very well known person who went to Uruguay to investigate concerning the unidentified flying object.

It had three displacement characteristics: 1) shape, 2) maneuver, 3) swinging oscillating movements.

1) SHAPE - It describes it as oval. Has no sign of a cabin or cupola on any side. It gave us the impression of 2 saucers joined by their sides.

2) MANEUVER - The report says that the object maneuvered bruskely "almost at right angles" without slowing down or stopping. There are several previous reports of unbelievable changes in its route. One of them is the course described in this report.

3) SWINGING OSCILLATING MOVEMENT - Here we think it necessary to make some comments. According to the report, it made these oscillating motions they consider the possibility of its being guided by "earth's magnetic field." They think there is a possibility of their automatic device that constantly analyses the magnetic fields through which they travel. It would explain the oscillation observed before a brusque change of course, a pronounced climb or a sharp turn. The causes for this oscillation would be the adjustment of the saucer to the magnetic fields.

This report indicates that it was an unidentified flying object of the type known as "flying saucer."
