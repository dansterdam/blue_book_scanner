24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
I calculated the size, distance, and speed of the objects. On the traingle objects reconstructed the formation with scotch tape and seven polished dimes. I mounted the construction at an angle in the sunlight to get the bright, glowing effect and backed off until I reached a distance of about 3 feet. At this reconstruction simulated very well the original sighting when the sun was reflecting off moving, highly polished surface of the figures for altitude of not 10,000 feet away approximately 4-5000 mph.
