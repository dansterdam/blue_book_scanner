The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting in the sky. The document provides details about the sighting, including the size, movements, and luminous qualities of the object observed. It also mentions the involvement of ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) officials and the use of a telescope to observe the object. The text is a descriptive account of the incident.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 99--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Heading to the city south of the road. According to their report 
to the Air Force, the U.F.O. was an illuminated object, something like a ball, 
something like a little car, and brilliantly illuminated by two very intense
light beams that seemed to shine from the bottom and converged over the top. 
Frightened at this apparition, the witnesses could provide only uncertain estimates 
of distance and size. The object seemed to be of twenty to thirty feet in diameter, 
was at an altitude of about 500 feet when first seen, and was hovering about two miles away. 
As they drove on, the object seemed to move and travel parallel with the car for about a mile. 
The object's lights dimmed and a circle of some kind appeared on the underside, 
and then the lights rose vertically, very rapidly, paused, and vanished in a few seconds.

Checking the most probable explanations first, ATIC officials
found that the nearby Willow Run Airport had no aircraft in the area and that no star or planet seemed to be involved. Further investigation showed that the flying bird cage was
actually the escape telescope of the University of Michigan. This telescope was installed on the top of Peach Mountain. It was clearly visible from the road on which the witnesses were traveling.
The dish, which the witnesses took for the object, was a wire-mesh structure that suggested the bird cage. At the time of the sighting the dish was turning in the direction of the witnesses and was illuminated by a floodlight as well as by the bright moonlight. It had apparently attracted the car only because the car itself was moving.
The astronomers operating the telescope were rotating the dish from the horizon to the zenith, and the yellow lights dimmed because the witnesses were seeing less and less of the surface. The "circle of red lights" on the
"roof" were the red aircraft warning lights on the nearby WUOM radio and TV tower between Peachey and the witnesses. When the dish reached the zenith and the operating crew turned off the floodlights, the dish was no longer visible to the witnesses, who interpreted the sudden disappearance as a sudden vertical ascent into the sky [1].
