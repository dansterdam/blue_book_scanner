1. On 15 October 1952 and again on 16 October 1952, unidentified objects described as luminous, stationary, oval-shaped objects were observed in the sky near Ashiya, Japan, by the personnel of this unit. The objects were first observed at about 6:30 p.m., 15 October 1952 and again at about 6:00 p.m., 16 October 1952. The objects appeared in the north, moving to the south as far as 20 to 30 miles and then returning to the north. The objects were observed for a period of 15 to 20 minutes on both occasions. The objects were estimated to be approximately 5 to 10 miles in altitude and about the size of a small aircraft. They appeared to be luminous, giving off a bluish-white light that changed to a reddish-orange as they moved. They did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion and made no sound.
