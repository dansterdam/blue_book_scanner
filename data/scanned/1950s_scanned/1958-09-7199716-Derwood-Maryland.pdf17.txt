VII. STATEMENT OF W. -

a. Name: 
b. Approximate Age: 35

Address: Mr. Battery was located directly along the azimuth (335 degrees) from ARLINGTON, Va. (2921/7008), the crossing of Maryland state Route 118 and Route 12??.

2. Statement:
#6. Incl Mr. - to be a short intense interest with observer "but not one of fear". No sound was heard but the objects were observed by him and his wife to be "Bright white light flashing through the sky from South to North". Source stated the light seemed to be coming from only one object which appeared to be round or at least was not square or rectangular in shape. The light appeared to him about 7 times flashing from South to North. He stated that sparks were falling off the two (2) objects but their light faded and then brightened again. The objects were at a high altitude and no other details were observed of their contour or shape, except the objects behind some trees and for all he knew they were still going. Source was certain the phenomenon took place but had no idea as to the actual distance or size of the objects.

VIII. RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATION:
The interview with Mr. W. revealed that the UFO area of Battery "BB" was conducted in the vicinity of Derwood, Md, the interview was conducted for civilian sources leads in the vicinity as well as short interviews to narrow down the sighting. Interviews with civilian sources with negative results, and the sighting of a fast moving light by Mr. - and his wife was substantiated. The report indicated that no one who had observed the light on the ground had claimed to the observer but it was learned from several sources who had tried to locate the two (2) objects described by Mr.- that their light faded in and out and it was doubtful if the source did not seem to have identified the actual objects as the phenomena.
