Col Harrington: How long did you look at it before you mentioned it to the others?
Mr. *******: Maybe 10 or 15 minutes. I just asked them what it was when we stopped the car and put the telescope on the top of the car. I first saw it right above the car.
Col Harrington: How did you happen to have the telescope with you?
Mr. *******: We were driving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles and I think I showed it to them. I did not take the telescope along and I just left it in the car.
Col Harrington: Did you report this to anyone else?
Mr. *******: No, I did not. People seem to think you are out of your mind if you mention it.
Col Harrington: And what do you think?
Mr. *******: I think it's very logical. I have never seen anything like it before. 
Col Harrington: How about speed? Could you make any guess as to the speed?
Mr. *******: It was not going too fast. I would not tell because I do not know. It seemed to hover and then take off at a tremendous speed. It went way up above us and then disappeared. When I first saw it it was about as big as a silver dollar.
Col Harrington: Can you see that high up?
Mr. *******: Yes, you can.
Col Harrington: How high up?
Mr. *******: We saw it was very clear. You could see the stars up there and the last time I saw it was up it.
