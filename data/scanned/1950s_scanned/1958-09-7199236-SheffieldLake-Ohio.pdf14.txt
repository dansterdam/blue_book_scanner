November 27, 1958

Dear Major Tacker:

Would you kindly specify what moving lights caused me to see an object 25 feet in diameter and 6 feet high hovering in my front yard? Our reference to the prevailing weather has also convinced me that the object hovered in the report form that it had stopped raining some time before the sighting. I would appreciate it very much if you would explain these matters to me in a little more detail.

Sincerely,
Mrs. [Redacted]
