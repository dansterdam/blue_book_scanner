1. At approximately 1645H on 12 March 1954, an object described as a large, brilliant white light was observed by the French Military Authorities at Nouasseur, French Morocco. The object was first sighted at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet and its speed was estimated at 3,000 mph. The object changed direction at high speed on several occasions and eventually disappeared from sight at an extremely high altitude. No sound was associated with the object. Attempts to track the object by radar were unsuccessful.

2. The object was under constant observation for approximately 10 minutes. It was reported to have been of a very definite shape, as indicated by the brilliance of the light rather than the actual contours. The visual and radar tracking attempts failed to produce a positive identification of the object.
