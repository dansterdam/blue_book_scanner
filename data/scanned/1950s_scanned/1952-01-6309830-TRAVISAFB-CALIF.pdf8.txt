Reference: I. Your letter 22 May 1968, subject: UFO Investigations,
I have the following comments on all the cases you have
listed, in the order they were listed.

1. 7 January 1952, Palmer, Alaska.
      I have noted this case 23 C/, meaning that as far as witness
ness was concerned, the stimulus giving rise to this report could
have been something quite ordinary or it could have fallen into the
category of "cigar-shaped UFO" reported from many countries and
which have no probably explanation. In this instance, there is not
sufficient information to go on. The report we have is stated:
"Alaska Air Command informed and will take further investigative
action, if any further data warranted when available."

      To the best of my knowledge the further data were never transmitted.
Data plus time that it was reported by one woman out of 2 (not 45 as the original report stated) and the fact that it was observed at the time of the setting sun, leading me to think that it possibly could have been an unusual meteorological, but data insufficient for firm evaluation" is my recommendation for this classification.

2.  14 April 1952, LaCrosse, Wisconsin.
      I originally asked to review this case in the hopes that unknown to me some additional follow-up had been made. I found that
despite the fact that a captain of commercial airliner and others
reported this incident, the file on this case contained very little
additional information.
