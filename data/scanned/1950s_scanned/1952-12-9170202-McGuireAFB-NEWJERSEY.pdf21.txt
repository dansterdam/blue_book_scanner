I, Norman A. Karas, SERGEANT, A.F., A..F. 12166804, do certify that:

On 6 December 1952, while flying over the Gulf of Mexico towards Galveston, Texas, I noticed an unidentified object approaching our aircraft at a terrific rate of speed. The object appeared to be elliptical in shape and I then noticed two similar objects, each about the same size as the first, trailing our aircraft. The entire one is losc to the object usually and seas it at a close range.

The color of the object was a bright bluish white and seemed to have a metallic appearance. The object closed to within 1/4 mile of our aircraft, hovered for a few seconds, then moved off at an extremely high speed and was not a jet, propeller driven aircraft or optical illusion.
