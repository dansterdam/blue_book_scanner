The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"The new sightings looked important. The first report was dated January 8, 1953. Early that morning, a B-29 bomber, with Capt. George Mandlin at the controls, was flying over California on a routine mission. Lt. Frank Bridges, the copilot, had the sight-land to the east. (As in all these official cases, witnesses' names have been changed.) It was a clear night. They could see Santa Ana, some 10,000 feet below, for the 12-20 miles. Suddenly, a bright light appeared 4 to 5 times the size of the B-29, moving rapidly over the area. Mandlin and Bridges watched it maneuver, make a fast run, and then return at fantastic speed, to a point near the B-29. Mandlin took one look, hurriedly averted to the left. For a split second, the strange craft seemed to hold their speed. Then they suddenly showed down, the motion twisting as if a few of the machines had overshot. Banking away, they slanted upward and vanished.

Though Maddin knew of no superior craft that could make such speed, the answer came back: No experimental aircraft-no planes of any kind were known to be in the area."
