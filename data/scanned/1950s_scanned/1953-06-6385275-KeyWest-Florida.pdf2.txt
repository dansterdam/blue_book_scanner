There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document containing text and diagrams.

20. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE MOTION THAT THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS MADE.  PLACE AN "A" AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PATH, AND SHOW ANY CHANGES IN DIRECTION DURING THE COURSE.

21. IF POSSIBLE, TRY TO GUESS OR ESTIMATE WHAT THE REAL SIZE OF THE OBJECT WAS IN ITS LONGEST DIMENSION.  600 FEET.

22. HOW LARGE DID THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS APPEAR AS COMPARED WITH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OBJECTS HELD IN THE HAND?  (CIRCLE ONE)

22.1 (CIRCLE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TO INDICATE HOW CERTAIN YOU ARE OF YOUR ANSWER TO QUESTION 22):
A. CERTAIN
B. FAIRLY CERTAIN
C. NOT VERY SURE
D. UNCERTAIN 

23. HOW DID THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS DISAPPEAR FROM VIEW? AFTER LISTENING UP (CASE BELOW) FOR 3RD. LINES DISAPPEARED TO START TO PORT BEHIND A DISTANT CLOUD, THEN GONE. 

24. WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE ELSE DO AFTER SEEING A PICTURE OR A SIGHTING SUCH AS THIS?  WE WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO IMAGINE THAT YOU COULD CONSTRUCT THE OBJECT THAT YOU SAW.  WHAT MATERIAL WOULD YOU USE TO MAKE IT?  HOW LARGE WOULD IT BE, AND WHAT SHAPE WOULD IT HAVE?

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I HAD: I HELD IN MY HAND A KEUFFEL AND ESSER HALF-CIRCLE PROTRACTOR.  NEAR THAT, I TRIED TO CONSTRUCT BY SIGHT A HUGE QUESTION MARK, BUT IT WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE TO THE TASK.  IT WOULD TAKE A HUGE GEODESIC DOME TAPERING TO A POINT, BUT THAT TOO WAS INADEQUATE.  I'M CERTAIN IT WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANYTHING I COULD EVER CONSTRUCT. (THIS SOUNDS QUITE INSANE, BUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED.)
