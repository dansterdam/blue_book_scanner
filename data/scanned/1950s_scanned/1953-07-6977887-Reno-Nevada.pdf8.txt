U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)

At 1145 AM on July 3, 1953, Mr. X and myself were sitting on a grass lawn at 628 5th Street, Reno, Nevada. We had been looking up through some trees and saw an object in the sky which attracted our attention. It was unusual in its character and motion. It appeared to be a bright metallic object, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and did not resemble any conventional aircraft. It moved at a high rate of speed, making a slight whirring sound, and oscillating in an up and down motion. The object was sighted for approximately 2-3 minutes, thinking it might possibly be a weather balloon, however, it was not moving in the direction of the wind and it was definitely not a weather balloon. As it moved away, it neither slowed or changed in appearance. 

I immediately contacted the Nevada State Police Headquarters (2300 hours) who were not interested and suggested I call the Air Force. I called 4 Army numbers listed in the telephone book, but no answer. I then called the FBI, who referred my call to the Air Force. I told them I could not locate the object anywhere since.
