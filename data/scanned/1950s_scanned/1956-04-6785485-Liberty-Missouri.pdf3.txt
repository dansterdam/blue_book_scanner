REMARKS: (General description of what you saw--use back if necessary) A round, white, somewhat glowing object passed very rapidly from the south to the north or northeast. I first saw it to the south and watched it move swiftly and silently to the north. It appeared to be flat on the bottom, rounded on top, and looked something like a saucer. There seemed to be a black ring around the object. It gave a whistling sound as it passed. I had the impression it was very high and very fast. I estimated its elevation to be 5,000 to 7,000 feet and its speed to be about 1,500 miles per hour. The total time of observation was about 15 to 20 minutes. The sky was clear and the visibility was good. The object did not seem to maneuver, but simply passed silently and swiftly from south to north or northeast.
