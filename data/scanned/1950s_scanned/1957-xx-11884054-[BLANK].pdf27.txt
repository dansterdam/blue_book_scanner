The image appears to depict a photograph of a night sky with a cloud-like formation resembling a "moon-dog" - a weather phenomenon where light is refracted through ice crystals in the atmosphere, creating a halo-like effect around the moon. The caption beneath the image explains that this moon-dog effect could be viewed from an aircraft at two o'clock high from the one shown in the picture.

The text below the image is an excerpt describing the aurora borealis, or northern lights, which can produce conditions associated with mysterious flying objects. The text discusses the characteristics and behavior of the aurora, including its association with the Earth's magnetic field and solar activity, as well as its visibility and appearance.

AURORAS
The aurora borealis, or northern lights, produce conditions and phenomena which have been associated with mistakenly-conceived flying objects. Auroral activity is associated with the earth's magnetic field and electric disturbances on the surface of the sun, and other solar activity. The auroral zone in the northern hemisphere follows roughly a circle around, and about 23 degrees away from the magnetic pole. In Europe, auroras are seen only infrequently below 50 degrees.
The aurora borealis cannot be seen in daylight, and during moon-lit periods it is inconspicuous. It is sometimes a bright enough to read by, and on rare occasions, its surface brightness surpasses even that of the moon. The most distinctive form of the aurora is that of a curtain or band of light extending across the sky, though the lower edge of the aurora is nearly horizontal, the band as seen from Europe would appear somewhat higher due to its great distance from the observer. Auroras may consist of more than one curtain and may appear and disappear rapidly, remain constant for long periods, or move slowly across the sky. Some may appear merely as a diffused lighting in the sky. Faint auroras may appear colorless. Bright auroras are usually yellow-green, but other colors such as red, blue, green, and violet are sometimes seen. A red curtain with a yellow-green base will often be tinged with red around its lower edge.
