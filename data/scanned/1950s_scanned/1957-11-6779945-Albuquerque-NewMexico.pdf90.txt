The image appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a table or chart with rows of data and text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can output all the text found in the document:
