TEXT:
Fonsi in the Mrs. 29 Aug came from Dayton reported that she had written 'report on an unidentified object which she had observed in the direction of the radar station and had been observed by several other persons. According to the report, the object moved first in a straight line and then in a circle and then darted away at a terrific speed. She called the report to the attention of Mr. Weike, Radio Announcer of station WHIO, who had also been watching the object and he verified the report. The object glowed and seemed to be metallic and was not any known aircraft or helicopter. Mrs. Mott said the object moved all around and this time, up at a very steep angle and far away faster than any jet or missile. Mrs. Mott and the object reacted against reflection by looking at and through the mirrored and metallic surfaces, through another mirrored window, and for various other tests. The case is very interesting and Mr. Weike says he will cooperate in any further investigation. COMMENTS: The sighting by Mrs. Mott in a residential area - a radar or communications station seems most likely.
