On 7 October 1958, Mr. of the Office of Special Assistant to The Secretary of Defense for Research and Development, Alexandria, Virginia, reported seeing an Unidentified Flying Object at 1010, daylight time. The object was observed for approximately 50 seconds and described as being bright, an oblate spheroid with an annulus around the circumference and approximately 600' in its longest dimension (subtended an angle of 3 degrees at 3 miles). The object was stationary for approximately 10 seconds and then disappeared by moving away from the witness. Mr. was the only witness to report this phenomena.

2. The opinion of the ATIC is that Mr. was a victim of an illusion created by the reflection of the sun from either ice crystals or a very thin cloud. As the sun lowered behind the horizon it illuminated less and less of the reflector, the decrease in size creating the illusion of motion. The wind had a component which was generally toward the north; therefore, the reflector drifting toward the witness could help account for the apparent increase in altitude. (This is a not, however, considered a major factor.

3. The fact that the object was reported as first stationary then moving lends to the above conclusion. There would be no apparent motion until the amount of reflected light began to noticeably diminish. Further weight is lent to this conclusion by the fact that this object was reported as being approximately 600' in length. Investigation failed to uncover another witness.
