AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: (XXXXX) HQ 71st Air Rescue Sq. APO 957
Date: MAY 1-57
Initial Report
Neptune, New Jersey
October 21, 1957

Commanding Officer
U.S. Signal Corps
Fort Monmouth, New Jersey

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a sketch of the UFO as the date and time indicated. Can you explain this sighting as a conventional aircraft, satellite, or astronomical object, or identify it?

I first picked up the object approximately in the center of the sky at Paganism as it was traveling in a southward direction. It appeared to be double the size of a passenger plane approximately 75 feet in diameter. It also seemed to be lit with an extremely bright white light having a field of 135 yards.

Picked up the object initially with a pair of standard 7x50 binoculars and tracked it to the point below the horizon as indicated. At this point it blinking, oscillating side to side, and at times disappearing from sight. It appeared to be traveling at a tremendous rate of speed and within about 10 to 15 seconds was out of sight. By the time the object reached the southwest horizon, its apparent size was that of a star.

Although the object appeared to be double, a single light, while the rocket appeared to be double, it is difficult to state whether my eyes played tricks on me. At the time the object was observed, no known conventional aircraft or balloons were sighted in the area.

If you care to correspond with me, I'll appreciate it.

Sincerely yours,
