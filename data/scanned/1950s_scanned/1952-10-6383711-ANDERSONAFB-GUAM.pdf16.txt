This is the light said to be a much lower intensity and appeared to be a strange luminous objects very rapid motion. The object was first observed at approximately 12:25 am and disappeared very shortly before reaching the horizon.

As per the description of the strange light, there was an impression of a sharp outline or edge that remained very steady and constant during the period of observation. The light appeared to be spherical in shape and was emitting its own illumination which varied little in intensity. The light was moving at a fairly high rate of speed and disappeared from view in a south-easterly direction. The light had no "tail" or exhaust and appeared to be self-luminous. The size was estimated to be approximately 2-3 inches in diameter as observed at the horizon.

The light had no "vapor" around it and it was round. The size could be referred to as the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length.
