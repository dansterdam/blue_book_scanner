April 29, 1954

To whom it may concern:

On the afternoon of April 27 I happened to be in the backyard of the residence at the address given below when I heard a very peculiar noise overhead. I looked up and saw an object that resembled a flying saucer in the afternoon sky. The object was very large and metallic-looking. It tried to locate the noise but could not find out what it was.
