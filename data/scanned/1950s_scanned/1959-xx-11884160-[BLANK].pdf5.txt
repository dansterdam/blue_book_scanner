AFCIN-4-Tl5 Weekly Activity Report
SUBJECT: UFO Program
1. An UFO Advisory Panel meeting was held in the office of the Aerial Phenomena Group on Monday, 25 May 1959. Possible approaches which would possibly make an extension of Special Report #14 more comprehensive were discussed. It was concluded that the Aerial Phenomena Group would immediately give consideration to making a detailed analysis of particular events to determine their possible effect on the number of UFO reports. A talk by Frank Edwards on 6 June 1959 at Akron, Ohio was decided to be used as an initial event for this study on UFO's.
