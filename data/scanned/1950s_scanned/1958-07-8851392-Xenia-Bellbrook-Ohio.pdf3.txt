Text from the document:

U.F.O.

15 July 1957
Near Xenia, Ohio
The object was emitting a pulsating light and was observed to be hovering, at times, about 100 feet above the ground. It was moving at a velocity that was about 50 mph. It appeared to be approximately 30 feet in diameter.
At one point, the object seemed to divide into two smaller objects, one of which then returned to the main object, while the other continued on a separate course. 
The witness claimed that a car's motor was affected as the object passed overhead.
