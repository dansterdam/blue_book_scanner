AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The sequence of events comprising this report are herein set forth and contain the results of investigation which was conducted and completed as outlined below:

On 3 March 1954, at about 2110 hours, a light was observed in a field near [ILLEGIBLE], which appeared to be hovering and maneuvering at a low altitude. The object was seen for approximately 90 minutes and was observed to ascend vertically at a high rate of speed and disappear.

The witness was first a farmer who was working in the field and observed the light and a [ILLEGIBLE] who was called to the scene who also observed the light. Both witnesses, independently, stated the object appeared to be approximately 35-40 feet in diameter and gave off a bright bluish-white light. The object was watched as it hovered approximately 10 feet above the ground, then ascended vertically at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

CONCLUSIONS: The observer, who has held any position in the air control or intelligence fields, stated he was unable to identify the object and that no aircraft were known to be in the area at the time. An analysis of the information indicates that the object was unidentified and that no logical explanation could be deduced. All the evidence indicates that the object was a bona fide [ILLEGIBLE] which could not be identified as any known type of aircraft or vehicle.
