The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a report on a balloon released at 09002 from the U.S. Weather Bureau station at Rosalia, Washington on February 6, 1953. The text describes details about the balloon release, including the balloon's ascent and trajectory, as well as observations about the wind speeds and altitude factors that affected the balloon's movement.

Text from the document:

6 February 1953 - Rosalia, Washington 

Pibail balloon released at 09002 from U.S. Weather Bureau station at Rosalia, Washington. Track of balloon 35S.

Slanting was from over Rosalia to 19.5 miles south in 15 minutes. Wind at 10,000' was from approximately 270° to 280° blowing 50 ft. (15.2 m) per second.

60 minutes - 1 min - 59

The balloon would have covered the 12.5 nautical miles in 15 minutes, which would indicate that the actual release was at 09051. This would mean that the wind speeds as observed were at 27 ft. (8.2 m) per second. The time difference of 2 minutes can be accounted for by different factors such as different wind speeds at various altitudes.

Note: Apparent rate of a 30 pound Standard Zodiac to clear the 50 ft. to pass would be approximately 1.7 minutes.
