21 July 1952
SUBJECT: Flying Saucers
TO: Operations & Training Division
Greater Air Force Base
Sumphonette, New Harapshire
1. At approximately 2:35 hours, 17 July 1952, the undersigned was working at the "94th position" and monitoring the 1200A frequency. The aircraft was a P-47's, Raymond 35.
2. The mobile control unit was in position for runway 17 and was tuning in to the tower frequency of 126.18. The weather was 17 and visibility was good.
3. The object was at about 200 feet when it first appeared and descended before it
disappeared. The object appeared to be of a brilliant white light, and it was about 200 feet
in diameter. The object showed up on the APS-42 equipment and was. . . [ILLEGIBLE]
4. The object was in sight for about four seconds so those are the details we can furnish
on this unidentified flying object. The runway control officer and the pilot both reported
the object and the pilot replied he had seen the object and the pilot replied that he had
seen it also.
5. The tower personnel thought no more of it until General Powers called the officer who
was working that he had talked to General Cabell who stated that this object had
operations in control that he would take the necessary action. Thus, we have reported this
unidentified flying object, and I believe it will be investigated fully.
