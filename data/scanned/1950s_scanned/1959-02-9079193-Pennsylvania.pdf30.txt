There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page of text from what seems to be an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

As Air Force's third explanation of his sighting, we plan immediately to publicize his story. Apparently Captain ||||||| has been discussing his sighting of the unknown object with a number of friends and associates, and the Air Force feels that the best way to discourage further speculation and unofficial publicity is to give his story official authorization, as it were, and to the public press. Some of the details in his story appear to us at variance with the official Air Force position, but we feel that the best way to handle this situation is to give it immediate and complete publicity. Apparently, according to the Captain, his sighting occurred while he was flying an F-86 jet interceptor from Washington to relieve the pilot of another F-86 which had developed engine trouble. He said they would go, but they would have to suspend me. I told them I could not cooperate. "The Captain then took off and proceeded to the vicinity of the unknown object, which he described as a large glowing spherical body, stationary, and making no noise. He said he made a visual identification and attempted to close on the object, but it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. Definitely, in fact, according to the Captain, the object was not an aircraft, balloon, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. The Captain said he would go, but they would have to suspend me. I told them I could not cooperate. Copies of the contradictory statements have been sent to several members of Congress.
