There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document containing text. I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe the text found in the document:

maybe it appears that any many a celestial thing. I do not know, and indeed the photographs that I took show no definite information except what I have mentioned.

The first photograph shows a dark spot at one edge of the celestial object, which I am not able definitely to say was a definite marking, but it may have been part of the celestial object itself. 

I aimed at photographing the object, and I am certain that I photographed it, but I formed the opinion that if an ordinary camera were used, it would not be possible to tell the tale.

I made it to possible to obtain visual and auditory information necessary to support my claim, and radio some more going to it. A bright object, perhaps as large as half the size of the moon, was observed and it seemed to be flashing or pulsing intermittently. The object was moving in a calm and steady manner from west to east.

I realize the newspaper clipping is from a relatively inconsequential report, but from my experience of the time it gave an account of the nature of the prominent object which I had opportunity to study.
