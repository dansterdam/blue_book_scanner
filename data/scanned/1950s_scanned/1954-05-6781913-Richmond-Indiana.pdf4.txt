The image appears to contain a blurry, indistinct photograph of what may be a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. The text on the document appears to be a report or letter regarding the photographic image, but there is no clear photograph of a human face present.

Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, formerly head of the Project "Bluebook" investigation on unidentified aerial phenomena, states in the report on May 22, 1954 that while the photograph appears to show only lights, he would refrain from referring to it as anything more than an unidentified object. The report discusses the photographic evidence and classification of UFO sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

22 May 1954  
Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, formerly head of the Project "Bluebook" investigation on unidentified aerial phenomena, states in the report on May 22, 1954 that while the photograph appears to show only lights, he would refrain from referring to it as anything more than an unidentified object. I wonder if it is possible to determine to what it actually was. In the future if similar photographic evidence appears, I would be grateful if some one could make an analysis of it again. My own evaluation is simply a review of what this photograph shows, which, as mentioned, appears only as lights, but I would not like to refer to it as anything more than just that - an unidentified object.

Sincerely,
