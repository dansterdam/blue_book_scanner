8:50 PM, EST to apprx. 9:30 PM ... Wednesday, July 1, 1959
Weather Conditions: hot, humid, somewhat hazy, few if any stars, brisk breeze, not too dark.
General appearance of lights or objects: definitely circular in appearance, although during their fastest movement, they appeared to have a tail. Observer readily admits, however, that this could easily be due to a blurring effect caused by rapid acceleration and greater speed.
Color: off-white as, perhaps, the moon in half-stage as seen behind thin, hazy clouds. No specific color tone, but definitely not orange-white. Size not clearly defined, but definitely circular.
No impression of object being spherical, but cannot be positive that it wasn't three-dimensional. No impression of solidity, but cannot be positive that it was not solid.
First impression and description: Thought it (they) was some sort of light being projected into the sky as if by spot light, bason, or movie projector, although this seemed impossible: this because:
1. lights were too high.
2. moved too fast.
3. disappeared suddenly to reappear in different location, and,
4. very definitely did not show beam as from projector at any time.
MOVEMENT: followed crescent pattern...tips of crescent pointing up. Lights appeared whole at right tip, moved at varying speeds to disappear at left tip. Pattern invariable...speed varied from very fast to slow, but movement never completely stopped. When multiple lights were seen, one would disappear to chance another, resembling a game of tag. Occasionally one light would catch another and disappear behind it or mesh with it.
