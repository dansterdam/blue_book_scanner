Dear Mr. _____,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 1 October 1958 concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object on 26 September 1958 in New York City.

The information contained in your letter is insufficient for the Air Technical Intelligence Center to make an accurate and valid analysis.

Therefore, I am inclosing a copy of the USAF Technical Information Sheet with instructions for completing the form. Please send the completed form to the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.

Upon receipt of the completed forms, the Air Technical Intelligence Center will proceed with the analysis and/or further investigation.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TUCKER
