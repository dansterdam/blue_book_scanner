SUMMARY: On 8 August 1952 a Finland pilot, Captain - - - U.S.A.F. made observation of a round object flying in the sky. The object was seen at approx 10,000 feet, moving in an easterly direction at an estimated speed of 700 mph. The object was estimated to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and appeared to the witness as a luminous glowing ball in the sky. The object was under observation for a period of 20 minutes.
COMMENTS:
This account appears to be more authentic than the one reported on 6 August 1952. The witness, a Finland pilot, Captain - U.S.A.F., is considered a reliable source. No definite conclusions are being drawn at this time. However, the similarity between this and the 6 August 1952 incidents, since they are approximately 200 miles south of the Lake Huron sightings, a strong possibility exists that the 'light colored spheres' being observed over Lake Huron may be of the same phenomenon, which has intensified since 17 July, according to the local press, are being called "flying saucers". An in depth analysis will be forthcoming.
