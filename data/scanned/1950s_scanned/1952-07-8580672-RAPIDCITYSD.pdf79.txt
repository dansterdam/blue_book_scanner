1. The enclosed photographs are of an unusual rock formation found in the hills near Rapid City, South Dakota. These formations are well known in the local area and have been the subject of considerable interest and speculation. 
2. The rocks appear to be composed of a hard, heavy, gray material, possibly some type of volcanic rock. They are irregularly shaped with many crevices and protrusions. The formation on the left measures approximately 18 inches in length, while the one on the right is about 12 inches long. 
3. Local residents have suggested that these rocks may have been left behind by retreating glaciers or formed by some other natural geological process. However, their unusual appearance has led to speculation that they may have an extraterrestrial origin. 
4. If you have any additional information or analysis on the nature and origin of these rock formations, we would appreciate receiving it. Please contact this office with any comments or questions.
