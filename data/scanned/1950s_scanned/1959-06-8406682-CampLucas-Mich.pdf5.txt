The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to "Major Tacker" from someone in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Dear Major Tacker:
I refer to your letter of 10 July 1959, concerning Unidentified Flying Objects.
I would like to know that name of the present director of Project Blue Book. At the present time, I have lent the UFO photograph I mentioned to a member of the press, and I would like to have it returned. If there is any charge for this service, I will be glad to pay for it.
I would also like to know the status of the JANAP report that was submitted to your office on 28 July 1959. Could you please advise me of the status of this report?
When is the evaluation of the Henderson, Nevada UFO sighting to be completed? I would also like to know the status of the ATIC conclusion(s) relative to the latest Middle Western United States sighting.
Sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]
Lawrence J. Tacker
Major, USAF
