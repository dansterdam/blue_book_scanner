The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a sighting of several circular objects in the sky that were observed southwest of San Angelo, Texas on May 29, 1952. The text describes the objects as being higher than the observer's aircraft, and appearing as small circles in the sky. The text also mentions that the objects seemed to range in size from approximately 25,000 feet to 60,000 feet, and that they had a fuzzy, hazy appearance.

STATEMENT UNCLASSIFIED

On May 29, 1952 at 2005 hrs C.S.T. approximately 30 miles southwest of San Angelo, Texas a group of seven circular lights was observed ahead of and higher than our aircraft. The sighting was reported to the A/C and everyone within view of the objects attempted to determine what they were. Upon closer observation on my part they appeared to be very small circles such as a small jet plane might make if it were flying an extremely small circle. A better description might be of a white doughnut in the sky. There were seven such objects chinate one above the other. The altitude of the objects seemed to range from approximately 25,000 ft (the lowest) to approximately 60,000 ft (the highest). As we got closer to the objects the circular part of the objects seemed larger and fuzzier as a vapor trail might appear after it begins to dissipate. They stayed in view, still appearing ahead of us, until dark. The extreme brightness of the objects upon first sighting seemed to come from the sun which was setting. Later on the objects definitely had the fuzzy, hazy appearance of a dissipating vapor trail.
