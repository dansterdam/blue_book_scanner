Ground radar 035° at 30 nautical miles: F/Blue 2 got a contact two (2) miles from this F/Blue 2 at 050° for 2-3 minutes. Neither fighter aircraft was observed by radar. The altitude of both fighter aircraft was stated as 38,000 feet. The last radar contact with the object by any type radar. The altitude of the object was 46,000 feet. Neither fighter aircraft returned. The fighter scope return was described as very bright. No evasive action was taken by 10-. There was no other air traffic in the area.

Comments of Evaluating Officer: No definite explanation for these objects can be made. One possible explanation is that the objects are flocks of birds, in view of the 9,000 foot altitude or one of the objects plus the probability that repeated passes of the fighter aircraft would be likely to change the course of the flock or disrupt it. However, the likelihood of the 84 system maintaining lock all the way.
