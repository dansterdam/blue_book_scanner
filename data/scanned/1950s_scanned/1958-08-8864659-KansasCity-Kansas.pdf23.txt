Dear Sir:
I've heard that the Air Force collects and studies reports of unidentified flying objects. Here is a brief description of something I observed recently. 
For the 9:40 p.m., August 23, 1958, I was standing in my yard in Kansas City watching the sky. At that time, I observed a series of flashes of light which appeared to be emanating from very near the horizon almost directly north, possibly slightly east of north, which I first thought to be a meteor. However, that idea was soon eliminated as it seemed to hover there and the flashes continued for some time.
The flashes occurred, moving upward at about 15 degrees on the horizon. After another flash occurred, moving to my right, the object seemed to disappear from view. Several more flashes occurred at constant intervals of a few seconds, each one further to the right. 
The last two flashes were close to the moon which was very low in the sky, and seemed to be near it. By the time the last flash occurred, it had not reappeared.
The total impression was that something had flown overhead within less than a mile, with the flashes or lights at regular intervals. It seemed the object drifted away as the flashes were not as far apart as at first.
At 9:50 p.m. the neighbors called for me to come out and see the "spirits" that they had observed the southeast sky. However, I was satisfied that what I saw originating in the north was the same object, and assured me that what I had seen was somewhat northly and higher elevation than where the "spirits" were. The "spirits" were quite faint near the horizon and were several in number, appearing and disappearing with a pulsating motion.
I hope this information may be of some use to you.
Sincerely,
