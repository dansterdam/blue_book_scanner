Dear Mr. *****, 

This is to acknowledge your recent undated letter concerning unidentified flying objects.

Mrs. ***, Director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, forwarded your letter to me for analysis and evaluation of physical evidence she claims to have from a space object.

The Air Force Accident Board findings on the C-119 Transport accident on 8 April 1952 near Paynesville, Minnesota indicate that the accident was due to bad judgment. In this particular accident, the pilot was diverted by the lower to break off his approach due to aircraft in the vicinity. He subsequently crashed into the hillside.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
