The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch shows some symbols or notations labeled "Formation" and a "Radar Timer" along with a horizontal line labeled "Level" and an arrow pointing "North". There is also some additional text at the bottom of the image stating "Line of sight when looking at object".
