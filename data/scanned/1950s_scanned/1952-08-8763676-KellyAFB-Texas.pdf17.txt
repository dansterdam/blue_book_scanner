The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document.

Space gradually growing smaller and dimmer with distance. Each appearance would be in the general vicinity but at a different spot. The last time we saw it, the thing appeared almost directly overhead and was travelling faster than ever toward the north where it finally paled away. So far as we could tell, it must have travelled at about 1500 miles per hour and executed maneuvers that did not have hover or perform any sharp movements such as radical directional changes or quick zigzag movements.

We were all at a loss as to a logical explanation of this sighting.

I certify that the statement above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
