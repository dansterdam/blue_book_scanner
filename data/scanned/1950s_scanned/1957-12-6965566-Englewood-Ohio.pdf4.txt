Dear Captain Schaller:

Here is the report you requested in our last telephone conversation.

On Sunday, Dec. 1, 1957 at approximately 3 P.M., my wife and I were in our home in Miamisburg, Ohio when our eight year old boy and a three came in the house very excited and told us they had seen something unusual in the sky. This caused them to run in the house, frightened, and they told us that the sky contained a very large "object" that appeared to be circular in shape and of a brilliant white color. They claimed that this "object" had been hovering in the sky for several minutes.

We immediately went outside to investigate and were able to see the object very clearly. It was an oval shaped formation, moving rather slowly in a westerly direction just slightly north of our position. It held a constant speed and direction until it disappeared over the horizon. 

As soon as the objects disappeared, I phoned the E.L.A. Sheriff's Dept. They advised me to phone several other numbers which proved to be a waste of time - no further answer on Sunday.

At this point the kids came running in the house again, very excited, claiming they had seen the formation again. It was too late for any further observations.

After the excitement had died down, I separated the kids and had each of them draw a diagram of the formations, numbering the passes 1, 2, and 3. I saw only the second pass.

Why a note marked (illegible).
