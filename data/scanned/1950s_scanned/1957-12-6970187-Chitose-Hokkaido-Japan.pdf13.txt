DISPOSITION FORM
SUBJECT: Request for Prints and Analysis - UFO Film
TO: AFOIN-BE, Capt Gregory AFOIN-HA2F DATE: 1 Apr 58
COMMENT NR 2
The film strip is a color positive and the prints are in black and white negative form.
1. As requested, prints from attached film strip have been made and are included. The film strip is a color positive and the prints are in black and white negative form.
2. From a photographic analysis of the prints, the following facts are evident:
a. Exposure was definitely a time exposure made of a moving illuminated object.
b. The difference in length of exposed streaks on prints is due to length of exposure and the speed object traveled during the exposure.
c. The difference in width of objects on prints is due to the amount of rotation on film caused by the intensity of light striking it. This, in turn, was controlled by the use of different apertures as stated in data sheet.
d. Normally with an exposure made into the sky at time these photos were made, the stars will also appear on a light sensitive film similar to the object. An overcast sky would prevent this but it would also prevent a planet from appearing.
