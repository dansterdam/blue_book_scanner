Text extracted from the document:

The object seemed to move at a great speed, far exceeding any jet plane at that time. It was travelling a great distance in a very short time. It seemed to fly without sound and a certain strange quietness seemed to accompany it. While the objects were with the plane, the engine suddenly cut out which frightened the passengers. The pilots were able to get the engines started again and the plane landed safely. The pilots and another plane which they were in communication with tried to keep up with the UFO but were unable to.

San Diego, California, was the destination of the flight and they were over the San Diego, California, area when the incident took place. Pilots stated that they had a picture of the object but that this was apparently taken from the other plane as they had no camera on board. It is felt that this may be the only picture of the object in existence.
