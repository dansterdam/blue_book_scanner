1. SOURCE stated that at approximately 2030 hours on 23 July 1952, he observed about five (5) unusual flying objects but due to the extremely high speed at which they traveled, it was very difficult to determine the shape and size of them. The first object which the SOURCE saw appeared to be red (not bright red) in color. It seemed to fade to a dull white color, then it moved further south it changed to a green color. It took about one (1) minute for the object to change from red to dull white and one (1) minute to change from dull white to green. At approximately 2034 hours the object appeared to be bright orange in color as it traversed directly above the SOURCE, then the object remained in a stationary position throughout the entire sighting and for an unknown length of time after the SOURCE observed the disappearing of all objects which he observed. The second, third, fourth and fifth objects all appeared to be white in color. A total of five (5) objects were observed; however, SOURCE was not sure whether he actually observed five (5) objects or the same object on each occasion. No particular formation was conducted by these objects. The aerodynamic features, if any, could not be determined and no trace of trail or exhaust was observed being emitted from the objects. Propulsion system could not be determined. The SOURCE stated that all. objects, with the exception of the stationary object, traveled at an extremely beautiful snack heard being emitted from the objects. The first object appeared in a northeast direction, traversed in a clockwise direction and disappeared in a southeast direction. The second object appeared also in northeast direction, traversed in a clockwise direction and disappeared in a southwest direction (SOURCE stated previously that this object remained stationary throughout the entire sighting). The third object appeared in a north-northeast direction, traversed in a counter clockwise direction and disappeared in a east-southeast direction. The fourth object appeared in a northeast direction, traversed in a clockwise direction and disappeared in a northwest direction. The fifth object appeared In a north-northeast direction, traversed in a counter clockwise direction and disappeared in a east southeast direction. The times, altitudes and distances of the above objects could not be determined by SOURCE. SOURCE stated that on one (1) occasion, a white flash appeared briefly near the left side of the first object. Also, on one (1) occasion, two (2) of the above objects seemed to meet at three (3) and nine (9) o'clock in their respective course but the SOURCE could not elaborate or give further details as to what particular objects they were. Further Information was unknown to SOURCE.

2. SOURCE observed the above objects from approximately 2630 hours to 2145 hours (one (1) hour and fifteen (15) minutes) on 23 July 1952.

3. SOURCE observed the objects visually.

4. The point of observation was directly in front of Building 439, 3550th Air Base Group Supply Room, Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. The coordinates of Moody Air Force Base are as follows: Latitude: 30 58 N; Longitude: 33 09 W. SOURCE observed the objects in a westerly direction and at an attitude (overall, (could not determined altitude or distance of each individual object) of approximately twenty thousand (20.000) feet.
