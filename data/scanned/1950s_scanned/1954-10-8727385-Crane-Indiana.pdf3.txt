Friday 10-8-54 - 1930

At the time and date mentioned above, while I was sitting at water line watching my wife for company, we spotted an object racing through the sky. My wife spotted it first and called for me to look. At first sight, it seemed like a fire ball, and though it traveled in a true horizontal plane with no arc whatever.

It was ovate in shape and in comparison to conventional aircraft it appeared to be about 75 ft in length, and was ringed with a very brilliant white of bluish-white flame. A trail of fire or flame about 6 times the length of the object with occasional bursts of flame also trailed. It had a high, shrill, audible sound similar to a sound produced by a speedboat.

I estimate the height of between 1000 to 2000 feet. I can not estimate the speed but I watched it for a distance of about 4 ground miles and at that sight it was about the distance of a horizon limit. The whole incident took perhaps 3-5 seconds. The speed of the object was terrifying. I have watched jets in the daytime at altitudes of 1000 feet but this object was far exceeding that speed. The object emitted no smoke, dust or exhaust that I could see, and what sound was audible was incomparable to that produced by a jet.

The object was headed in a SE by E direction straight and true.
