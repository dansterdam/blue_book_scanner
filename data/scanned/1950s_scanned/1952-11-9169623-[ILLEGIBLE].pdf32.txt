NARRATIVE:

1. An object was sighted because of darkness, described as bright 
ball with a circular cross section, silvery white in color, with blue-
green trail, estimated to be approximately 10 to 15 feet in diameter. 
Object was seen for approximately 2 seconds, and was brightly illuminated, 
neither observed as wings nor engines. Object appeared to be traveling
at a very high speed, estimated to be 500 to 700 miles per hour.

2. Sighting approximately 0605 Pacific Standard Time 13 November 
1952. Duration of sighting very short, estimated at 15 to 30 seconds, 
possibly less.

4. Observers' position approximately 38°29'N - 121°37'W. Object 
traveled in a generally easterly direction. Observers were staff 
members of a radar station.

5. Davis police chief describes observers as reliable business 
men and students from a local college. Observers were immediately 
interviewed by Davis police chief, owner and manager of local small private airport, and Counsel Air Force Base officers. There was 
no indication for telephone interview, and all observers were willing
and cooperative. The other information available is limited due to 
the unreliability or inaccessibility of observers.

Logical natural, or seasonal phenomens which might account for 
sightings.
