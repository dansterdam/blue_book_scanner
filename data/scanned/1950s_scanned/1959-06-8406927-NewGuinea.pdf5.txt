Dear Sirs,
Have been having further experiences nightly with UFO - counted
1 large and 7 small over Saturday night,
1 large and 2 small Sunday night,
1 large and 4 small Monday night.

Hallo, it is or not exchanged hand signals
(before dark Saturday) with the occupants of the "mother" ship a little after
5 p.m. There are 4 small ships or objects the occupants of "mother" ship four men. Assuming that
men are the same size as average of earth. I have worked out size of the ship - roughly 85 ft.
Distance of operation, therefore, as we have sighted, have been, at highest altitude 2,500 feet; Nearest altitude 400 feet.

That's all for now, must away on patrol.
Yours,

P.S. No "human" activity has yet been observed on smaller UFO's, which seem
to be disks rather than saucers.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
Date., Monday 6th July, 1959

At about 8:40 p.m. I noticed a white glow through the cloud, similar to that caused by the moon. Position - North West - a few degrees above Guinea Point (the Point is about 3 miles from the College).

The glow changed to a brilliant spot of white light. It descended and moved a little to the South. The brilliant dance lasted for about 5 minutes.

After 5 minutes it glowed again brilliantly and moved in a circular motion (see sketch) anticlockwise. Then it moved further south and down until it became a point of light at 9:05 p.m.

Through the binoculars I noticed it to be orange in color and shaped like a disc.
