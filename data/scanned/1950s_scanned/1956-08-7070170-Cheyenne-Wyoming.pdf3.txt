INTERVIEW WITH
MR. AND MRS. CARL U. BARBER
CHEYENNE, WYOMING
August 7, 1956

On August 7, 1956, Mr. and Mrs. Carl U. Barber of 2720 Forbes Street, Cheyenne,
Wyoming, reported an unidentified flying object sighting to the Air Force authorities. The details of this sighting are as follows:

On August 7, 1956, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. Barber were out walking in their neighborhood. As they were walking along Forbes Street, they noticed a large, bright object in the sky. The object appeared to be hovering and rotating. They watched the object for several minutes before it suddenly shot off at a high rate of speed.

The Barbers estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. They stated that it was metallic in appearance and emitted a bright light. Mr. Barber reported that he took several photographs of the object, but the photographs did not turn out very well due to the poor light conditions.

The Barbers stated that they were extremely surprised and puzzled by what they had witnessed. They immediately reported the sighting to the local Air Force authorities, who interviewed them and obtained the details of their report.
