JULY 20, 1953 BRUSH CREEK, CALIFORNIA (BARKER P 37) 2 WITNESSES:
HAVE OBSERVED A SMALL MAN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. CLAIM TO BE OPERATING TITANIUM DIGGINGS. CLAIM TO BE PART OF THE LITTLE MAN'S CREW. MAN WORE GREEN TROUSERS, JACKET AND MOCCASINS. HIS HAIR WAS LONG AND STRINGY. THEY SEEMED ALMOST TO BE PART OF THE MAN-'S FEET. THE OUTFIT WAS TOPPED OFF WITH A GREEN SHAWL OR BLACK HAIR.
THE CREATURE LOOKED LIKE A NORMAL PERSON EXCEPT FOR THE SMALL STATUE AND SOMEWHAT ODDLOOKING. THEY HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE BELL-LIKE CHIMES COMING FROM HIM ON OCCASION. HE WAS VERY PALE, ALMOST AS BLACK PUT IT. HE LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE WHO WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE ACTIVITY OF THE LITTLE MAN, WHO WAS DIPPING AND WORKING ON THE GROUND. THE SECOND TIME THEY CAME ACROSS HIM, HE PLAINLY LOOKED OUT LIKE THE SEGMENTS OF A CONE. IT LOOKED LIKE ALUMINUM, OR SOME SHINY MATERIAL. WHEN HE CREPT CLOSER TO GET A BETTER LOOK, HE STEPPED ON A DRY STICK AND THE LITTLE MAN HEARD IT. HE STOPPED AND LOOKED AROUND. THE CREATURE RAN RAPIDLY OBSCURED BY TREES AND BUSHES. WE HURRIED TO A SAUCER LANDING IN NEARBY GROUND. IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT LOOKED LIKE TWO LARGE SOUP PLATES FASTENED TOGETHER, FORMING A CONVEX SHAPE. IT WAS A SHINY METALLIC COLOR, AND REVOLVED IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION. IT LOOKED TO BE APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER. THERE WAS A WINDOW IN THE SIDE OF THE SAUCER, BUT IT AFFORDED NO VIEW OF THE INSIDE. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF GAS OR ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE. THE LITTLE MAN LOOKED SOMEWHAT LIKE UNDERSTURES, HIS FEET, IN THEIR STEPS, SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO CRUSH HARD, CRYSTALLIZED ROCK. HIS GAIT WAS VERY STRANGE, ALMOST WOBBLING AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE OPENING. THE CRAFT ROSE STRAIGHT UP FROM THE GROUND, AND THE SAUCER HOVERED IN THE AIR FOR SEVERAL SECONDS, THEN TOOK OFF AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED. JUNGLEMAN OR SAUCERS MAY SOME EFFICIENT METHOD OF PROPULSION COULD BE OBSERVED ON THESE OCCASIONS. EITHER JUNGLEMAN OR SAUCER MADE SOME SORT OF NOISE TO GAIN CONTROL AS EVIDENCED BY SOUND WAVES TRANSMITTED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM UNTIL IT GAINED ALTITUDE. ON ONE OCCASION IT WAS SEEN TO WOBBLE AS IT LEFT.
