In this damage photo, an analysis expert holds a cable connector, which matches perfectly with one used in a three-foot object, bearing Russian writings, which the Air Force has found to be a hoax. Col. Dean R. Nance, director of the Los Angeles Office of Information Services, said the object was "definitely a hoax."
