From the Ann Arbor News, March 23, 1959

1. The U of M 85' radio telescope is clearly visible from North Territorial Rd.
2. The top of Peach Mountain is "low in the sky."
3. At the time of observation (1:30 a.m.), the dish was looking at the SW horizon and illuminated by the light of a full (almost) moon and a floodlight.
4. The WWDR radio tower with its red aircraft warning lights is directly in line with the radio telescope as viewed from the intersection of North Territorial and Peach Mountain.
5. The dish was being rotated from the SW horizon to the zenith so that an observer on the ground would see less and less of its surface and more of its bird-cage-like structure.
6. When the dish reached the zenith, the floodlights were turned off, the dish "seemed to go into the sky," and we went home.
