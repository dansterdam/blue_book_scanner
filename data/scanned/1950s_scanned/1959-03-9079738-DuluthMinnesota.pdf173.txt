Here is the text from the document:

On March 9, 1959, at approximately 10:15 P.M. CST, a sighting of an unidentified flying object was observed over Duluth, Minnesota.

The object was reported to be approximately 50 feet in diameter, cigar-shaped, with a bright white light on the front end. It was seen to be hovering at an altitude estimated to be 500 to 700 feet above the ground. The object then accelerated and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed.

No other details are available.
