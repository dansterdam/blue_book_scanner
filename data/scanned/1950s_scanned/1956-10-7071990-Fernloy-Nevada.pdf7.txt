AND HE HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY HOVERING ABOVE STATION,MON-DAYS UNTIL THEY ARE APPROACHED TO LAND.WHEN AAPPROACHED TO LAND THIS UFO IMMEDIATELY GAINS SPEED AND AGAIN CLIMBED TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION. THIS SIRE SIGHTING WAS AGAIN MADE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF FERNLEY,NEVADA. ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATED ALTITUDE AND VEHICLE DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROJECT LEAVES NUMEROUS UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, THE FACT THAT THIS OBJECT HAS OBSERVED PERIODICALLY IN FRONT AND THEN BEHIND SITE OBSERVERS IN THE COVER OF TRAVELING 30 MILES, DOES TO INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFICATION IN A TERM INTERESTED BY UNUSUAL AERIAL CONDITIONS. IN THE ABSENCE OF ADDITIONAL IDENTIFYING OR CORROBORATING DATA ON THIS SIGHTING, NO DETERMINATION AS TO POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE CAUSE CAN BE MADE AT THIS LEVEL.
