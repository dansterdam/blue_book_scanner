SUBJECT OF REPORT: Unusual Aerial Lights Seen by Guards at Anniston Ordnance Depot

Pages 2 and 3 contain a report on an unusual light seen in the night-sky by two civilian guards at Anniston Ordnance Depot, Bynum, Alabama. This is the second report on such phenomena in the last month. While no reasonable explanation of these objects is known here, it is likely that civilian guards were aware of the first occurrence, and were sensitive to any unexplained lights, etc.
