There is no visible photograph in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing text describing a UFO sighting.

As per your instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

During the turning maneuver the object did not tip at all. It remained flat during the turns. Then the object flew out of sight, going straight up.

The witness was so frightened by this experience that she could not call out to her husband, who was sleeping in the bed. She did try to rouse him by kicking with her left foot, but was unable to do so. During this time she did not take her eyes off the object.

At this same time [REDACTED], 7 years old, got out of bed to go to the bathroom. He also was attracted by the bright light. Stepping on a back register to get the necessary height to see out of the window in his room, he watched the object perform the same motions described by his mother. However, neither party testified that the other had seen the object. Both went to sleep.

The next morning [REDACTED] told his father about the sighting, to which his father replied " It was just a bad dream." Several days later Mrs. [REDACTED] joined her husband and son for breakfast. It was then that she began telling her husband about the object she saw. Mr. [REDACTED] cautioned his son to keep quiet, and heard his wife repeat the story she had told. The reports coincided in every point, even though neither witness knew of the other when the sighting took place. Thus the object was seen simultaneously and independently by two persons.

Both witnesses reported a noise like an hum and a whirr combined. "Like a jet engine warming up," said Mrs. [REDACTED], who simulated the noise by whistling and humming.
