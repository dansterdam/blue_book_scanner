The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing UFO statistics and evaluation from 1947 to 1956.

You may be interested in the rise and fall of UFO reports through the years, and to see the course of the unknowns which are obviously the prime concern of the Air Force.

CHART 2 - UFO Statistics for Calendar Year 1947 to recent past:
Note the peak year 1952 and subsequent decline.

CHART 3 - UFO Evaluation by Percentage 1955-1956:
On this chart we show the categories of our UFO evaluations, for example 1955 and 1956 by percentage. You will note that the group which includes hoaxes, psychopaths, etc., has been cut in half, and the "unknowns" from 3% to 2.2%. This has roughly held to the present. (The group marked "insufficient data" has regrettably risen from 7% to 9.9%, possibly because of increased sky watching activities - sale of telescopes have risen over 200% since Sputnik I)

It is apparent, as previously stated, that, as prompter investigation becomes possible, as more experience in UFO investigation and analysis procedures is gained, and as better utilization of the services of scientists is made, the percentage of "unknowns" decreases.
