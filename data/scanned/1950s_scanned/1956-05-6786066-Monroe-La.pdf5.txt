II. NARRATIVE: SOURCES appeared to be intelligent and were very cooperative. SOURCES stated they observed an unidentified flying object on 22 MAY 55 at approx 2000 hours in the eastern sky from Greenville AFB, Miss, while taking a navigational flight in a T-33 jet aircraft. SOURCES stated they observed the object for approx 15 minutes. Many stars were visible during the observation but the object stood out due to its superior brightness. The object appeared to be stationary and had a brilliant white light which seemed to pulsate. The object would suddenly speed up and rush through the sky, then abruptly stop and reverse its direction of flight. No sound was heard. The object did not move in front of or toward anything. "Object" was described as round or spherical in shape and was estimated to be approx 6-8 feet in diameter. No exhaust or flame was visible. The maneuvers performed by the object seemed to defy the laws of physics, as it could change direction at high speeds without any apparent slowing down or turning. The object was observed until it suddenly accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight.
