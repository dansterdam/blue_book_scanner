The image appears to contain a handwritten diagram or sketch depicting a UFO sighting. The sketch shows a UFO-like object with various annotations and explanations around it, such as "First seen from 6:20pm-7:00pm" and "Departed in red frame". There is also some text below the sketch that seems to be a description of the incident, but I cannot make out the full details.

Text from the document:

Description: On the evening of 7 Nov. 56, at about 6:30 pm, the witness [text redacted] telephone conversation with Capt. George T. [text redacted], telephone 99-23.
