Northern Lights Give Bright Colorful Show
Shimmering arcs and fiery curtains of red, green and white flared across the northern skyline and astonished hundreds of observers on the northern lights display. For hours lights writhed and flashed In fantastic designs. Most of the natives observed the display as it surged overhead and most of the reports came from Minnesota, Montana, the Dakotas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. Observers as far south as Wheeling, W. Va., saw the display. At Pierre, S.D., the display was so bright that observers said it resembled daylight. At Calgary, observers said there was a green tint to the display and at Detroit and Lansing, Mich., as at Olean, N.Y., thunderbolts accompanied the display. At Wheeling, the observers reported they were unable to operate during the display.
