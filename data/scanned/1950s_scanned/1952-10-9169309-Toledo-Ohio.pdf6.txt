The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left shows an object in the sky above the horizon, with instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

The smaller sketch on the right shows two additional perspectives of the object, with instructions to place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

There is also a handwritten note at the bottom of the image that reads "Object passed directly over head from."

As requested, I have not identified or named any humans that may be present in the image.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
