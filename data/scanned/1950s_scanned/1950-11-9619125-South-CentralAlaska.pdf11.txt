LATE ON THE AFTERNOON OF 29 NOVEMBER 1950, APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES EAST OF ANCHORAGE,
ALASKA, A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT WAS OBSERVED, WHICH APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING ABOUT 500 
MILES PER HOUR AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE. THIS LIGHT WAS OBSERVED BY DOZENS OF
RELIABLE WITNESSES, INCLUDING SEVERAL OFFICERS OF THIS HEADQUARTERS. THE LIGHT
FLASHED ON AND OFF AT INTERVALS OF ABOUT 5 SECONDS. WHEN LIT, IT WAS INTENSELY BRIGHT,
ESTIMATED BY WITNESSES TO BE EQUAL TO HUNDREDS OF SEARCHLIGHTS. THE FLASH WAS OBSERVED
FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS AT A TIME. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND
REMAINED STATIONARY WHILE FLASHING. AFTER ABOUT 10 FLASHES IT DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY. 
REPORTED OBSERVED SPEED WAS ESTIMATED AT 500 MILES PER HOUR OR OVER ANCHORAGE AREA.
