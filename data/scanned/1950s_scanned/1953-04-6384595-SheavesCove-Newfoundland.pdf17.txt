Memo for the File
6. On 5 July 1953 the *****... in*****... Constable... an interview with an indiv****. The indiv***** stated that he had observed approx****** 20 bright o****. which ***** floats and hovered over the area of Sheaves Cove, Newfoundland, Can****, for about 1.5 hours on the evening of 5 July 1953. The objects were described as round in shape, varying in size from 10 to 20 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright, whitish light. The objects would suddenly disappear and then reappear at another spot. Considerable credence is given to this report in view of the good character and reliability of the witness, who stated that he had never before reported anything unusual.
7. On 11 Mar 1953 the ********* in the ****** of St. Ann's, Ne****** to the east of Sheaves Cove, reported seeing three luminous objects, similar to those described in paragraph 6 above, hovering in the night sky for about 10 minutes shortly after 8 pm on 20 April 1953 and that he had notified the Royal Canadian Air Force of the incident.
8. Capt. ******, Dept. ****, and several other indiv***** in the area confirm the fact that many unusual and inexplainable aerial phenomena have been observed in the vicinity of Sheaves Cove on numerous occasions over a period of several years.
9. Sheaves Cove, Nfld., is a small, isolated cove on the north coast of Nfld. approximately 50 air miles northeast of St. John's. It is an extremely remote and isolated area with little or no population, and is about 5 miles from the nearest village.
10. Sheaves Cove, Nfld., is in an inaccessible area and little is known concerning the geology, vegetation, flora and fauna of the region. However, it is suspected that the area may contain one or more small meteorite craters, deposits or iron rich rocks and minerals, and/or a strong magnetic field which may account for the unusual aerial phenomena observed in the area.
