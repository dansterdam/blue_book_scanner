STATEMENT
At approximately 2120 hours on the 3rd of March, 1953 I received a call. This was a call from Sgt. T/Sgt Brungess, who was on duty at the USAF radar station. He advised me to come out and take a look so I did. I stopped outside and looked in the direction I was told. I saw an object which seemed to be about 3000 to 4000 yards away and was proceeding in a zigzag course at a tremendous rate of speed - much faster than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. It would make a sharp turn, stop momentarily and then move off in another direction. This continued for approximately 15 minutes and I noticed that each time it stopped, a faint trail of smoke or steam appeared to be emitted from it. After about 15 minutes, the object turned and headed away at a terrific speed and was gone in approximately 3-4 seconds. I have never seen anything move so fast. I called the radar station, and Lt. Del Linski, Aft 64C0170, who was on duty, stated that they had the object on radar and that it did not give any return on their equipment. It was just disappearing from their scope like turning a light off. I have no other information concerning this incident.
