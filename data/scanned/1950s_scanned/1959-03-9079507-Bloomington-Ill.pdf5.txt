CASE NO. - [REDACTED] ID: [REDACTED]
25 MARCH 1959

SUBJECT: Maj: Algia Tucker
REFERENCE:

1. The possibility of the object observing a satellite was considered. However, the subject stated that the object was too large and distant for a satellite.

2. The duration of the sighting was too great to have been a meteorite. The average time of a meteorite sighting is a second or less.

3. The speed, assuming the witness made a good estimate, is quite high for any aircraft other than jet aircraft. It is known that the object's movements were not like those of conventional aircraft.

4. It is the opinion of this office that the object was probably a high flying jet aircraft, with distance and wind accounting for the absence of sound.
