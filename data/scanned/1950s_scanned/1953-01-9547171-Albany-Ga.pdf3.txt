UNCLASSIFIED

This intelligence report is an attempt to interpret or throw light on an object which apparently was under observation.
The date, time, and location were all fairly definite and careful strides were taken to secure the report and to have the observations and interpretations as accurate as possible.
There was no chance for intercession.

Complete confirmation on details was obtained at the approximate time in the normal area.
COMMENTS OF THE REVIEWING OFFICER:
All indications were cooperative and competent. In this instance, there appears adequate basis for believing the observation was of an actual flying object of significant proportions. There could have been no confusion with any known type of aircraft. This case appears authentic.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
