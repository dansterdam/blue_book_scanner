THE 1950 HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA CASE:

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS CARRIED THIS STORY: DATELINE HAMILTON
FIELD, CALIFORNIA, JUNE 8, 1950, IT WAS 2:55 A.M. CORPORAL
LUCIAN PYRON, 26, WAS IN THE FIELD CONTROL TOWER WITH
STAFF SERGEANT ELLIS LORIMER, 25, A VETERAN WITH THREE
YEARS EXPERIENCE IN CONTROL TOWER OBSERVATION. SUD-
DENLY THEY SAW AND OBJECT SPRAYING A BLUE-GREEN STREAM
OF FLAME HURTLING TOWARD THEN FROM THE DIRECTION OF
THE NEARBY PACIFIC...

BECAUSE OF THE SPEED AND THE DARKNESS, THEY 
COULDN'T DISCERN ITS SHAPE. OPPOSITE THE CON-
TROL TOWER, IN ANOTHER OBSERVATION POST,
STAFF SERGEANT VINCI SPEARO, 30 ALSO
WATCHED AS THE STRANGE CRAFT MADE THREE
SEPARATE PASSES ACROSS THE F I E L D . . .

The story then stated "AIR FORCE
INTELLIGENCE MEN" QUESTIONED THE
THREE OBSERVERS ALL MORNING. HEAD-
QUARTERS OF THE FOURTH AIR FORCE HERE
HAD NO COMMENT. IT IS SAID A REPORT WAS
BEING MADE TO WASHINGTON. OFFICERS
WERE TIGHT LIPPED. BUT MAJOR JAMES C.
JOHNSTON, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER,
SAID:
"THERE WERE NO PLANES OVER HAMILTON
FIELD AT THE TIME THE MYSTERY OBJECT
WAS REPORTED, AND NONE LANDED
DURING THE PRE-DAWN."

"AT WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON'S
NEWS CONFERENCE... S/SGT.
LORIMER SAID:

"THE EXHAUST OR TAIL OF THE
CRAFT RESEMBLED THE FLAME
OF A BLOW TORCH. | KNEW IT
WASN'T A JET PLANE BECAUSE OF
THE GREAT RATE OF SPEED AND
BECAUSE A JET PLANE, WHICH
I |AM | USED TO WATCHING,
SHOWS NO FLAME."

THE FIRST REPORT ON THE
MYSTERY OBJECT CREDITED IT
WITH A SPEED OF 1000 TO
1500 MILES AN HOUR. LORMER
WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS, HE SAID:

IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO 
ESTIMATE SPEED, HEIGHT, AND
DISTANCE AT NIGHT."

(LORIMER) WOULDN'T COMMIT HIMSELF

WOULDN'T COMMIT HIMSELF
TO A FIGURE. A REPORTER ASKED:
„„WAS IT GOING
TWICE OR
THREE TIMES
THE SPEED OF
A JET?"

MAYBE

'"THE FIRST REPORT WEDNESDAY
MORNING FROM THE FIELD QUOTED THE
OBSERVERS AS SAYING THE OBJECT
"ROARED" ACROSS THE SKY. BUT AT
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON'S NEWS CON-
FERENCE THEY SAID:

(WE) HEARD NO SOUND."

NOTE: PARENTHESIS DENOTE WORD-CHANGE OF VERBATIN STORY TO FACILITATE DRAMATIZATION, I.E. THEY/THEM,-EDS.

DID YOU ADD THESE NAMES TO YOUR
EVER-GROWING LIST, AIRFORCE...... …
MEN WHO'VE BEEN DEEMED TRUST-
WORTHY AND COMPETENT ENOUGH
TO GUIDE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN AIRCRAFT TO SAFE LANDINGS
AT HAMILTON? DID THE "AIR FORCE
INTELLIGENCE MEN" WHO "QUES-
TIONED THE THREE OBSERVERS
ALL MORNING" "PERSUADE" THEM TO
CHANGE THEIR STORIES SO THAT
THE AFTERNOON STATEMENTS DID
NOT CONFLICT WITH THE FIRST
"ROARING REPORTS"? AND IF SO,
WHAT WAS IT YOU FOUND THAT
YOU DIDN"T WANT US TO KNOW?
