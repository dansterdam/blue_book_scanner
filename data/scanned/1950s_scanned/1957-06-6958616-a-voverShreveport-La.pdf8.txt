II. RELIABILITY: Source was reluctant to talk about objects as he was somewhat upset because he was being interviewed on the sighting. He felt that he had 
nothing to do with originating the preliminary report other than asking the AC&W site if he had company on his flight. In a roundabout way he was contacted by  
Flight Service at Carswell AFB, Texas, who sent in the preliminary report. After an explanation by the investigator he became cooperative and should be considered 
reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: One object was sighted on take-off from Shreveport, La. Airport at approximately 2030CST, 3 June 1957. Altitude of object 
was approximately 100 feet when first sighted. Source stated that the control tower called his attention to the object which appeared as a small light. Landing lights 
of Source's aircraft were flashed on and off and the object responded momentarily with a very brilliant light directed at his aircraft. Object then gained altitude, from a seemingly hovering position, at a high rate of speed. At this time another object was sighted at about the same altitude and having the same appearance as the 
first object. Source stated he then contacted the tower to ascertain whether they 
had both objects in sight. Tower had both objects in sight, using binoculars. Objects 
then paralleled course of Source's aircraft, moving at about the same speed, which 
was approximately 110 knots, only at a higher altitude than that of his own aircraft. 
At Conway, La., objects were still with them so Source decided to call GCO ATIS 
(653rd AC&W Sq) to see if they had objects on their weapon. An affirmative answer 
was received. Source compared the size and appearance of objects to that of a star; 
however, he mentioned that at one time he thought he could see the silhouette of an 
object, but would not make a definite statement to that effect. Source's aircraft continued to Lake Charles, La., where he landed. At this point, sight of objects was lost, apparently behind a cloud deck, moving in a southeasterly direction. Objects had been observed for approximately one hour.
