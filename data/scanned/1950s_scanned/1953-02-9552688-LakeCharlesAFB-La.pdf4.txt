Lake Charles AFB
I. Description of Incident
A whitish-white object with a bright-white center was observed by six Air Force personnel in a ground-visual sighting. Time of sighting was for approximately 15 seconds. The object involved estimated that the streaking object was on a level with them and 20 miles distant. The object was compared to being like a flame jet thrown in the air. There was no sound whatsoever.

II. Discussion of Incident
Weather conditions at the time of sighting (0600 CST) were CAVU and fact-limited easy spotting of meteors. This sighting was undoubtedly caused by the passage of a meteor or "fireball" through the earth's atmosphere which had unusual coloring.

III. Conclusion
Probably astronomical.
