The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typewritten document from Project Blue Book. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

TIME: 1.15 hours, 31 Dec 1952
LOCATION: Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas
OBSERVER: Captain XXXXX, 15th Air Force, Air Force Intelligence

I was driving my car on a highway at the time. Suddenly, I noticed a formation of 6 objects in the sky, flying in a southerly direction. It was much the same formation as described in the "ball of fire" incident. This formation appeared to be 30-40 yards in diameter, and was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, estimated to be around 1,500 miles per hour. The objects were visible for about 30 seconds, then disappeared.

The formation passed over me at an altitude estimated to be about 5,000 feet. The objects appeared to be circular in shape, and emitted no trails or exhaust. The objects maintained their formation throughout the time they were observed.

Due to the time of night, 2:15 a.m., visibility was very good, and the objects were easily observed against the clear night sky. However, I was unable to obtain any photographic evidence.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
