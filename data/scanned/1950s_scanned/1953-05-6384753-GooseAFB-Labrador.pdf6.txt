AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

On the night of 6 May 1953 I was the pilot of F-94C, Ser. No. 51-13451, call sign "SLICK 23". At about 2350 hours local time while flying at 25,000 feet over Goose AFB, Labrador, I saw an unidentified luminous object.

The object was first observed approximately 30 miles west of Goose AFB, and was traveling in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 1,500 knots. It appeared white in color and seemed to pulse or change in brightness at irregular intervals. The object made no sound and left no trail.

I attempted to intercept the object but it pulled away rapidly and disappeared from view within 60 seconds. I lost visual contact with the object at a range of approximately 20 miles.
