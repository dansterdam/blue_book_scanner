5. Red line denotes general direction (line of sight) at which A/C T LIGHT was joined by A/C KOACH in observation at approximately 2000 hrs. A/C states object traveled very swiftly (faster than jet) when first sighted from point (3) and then slowed down to a barely perceptible movement before arriving at the intersection of lines (4) and (5). At this point the light blinked off momentarily and KOACH (who was just inside the bldg.) was requested to come out and observe. Light continued in same general direction and very slowly with a discernable descent to line (6) at which time it again momentarily blinked out. At this time Lt. OAKLY (also in the hangar) was requested to come outside and observe. This was at approximately 2003 hrs.
