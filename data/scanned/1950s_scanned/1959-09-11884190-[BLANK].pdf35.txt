"The Unidentified Flying Objects Research Committee  
September 2, 1959

Major General W.H. Blair, Director 
Intelligence, United States Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear General Blair:

Enclosed is a complete report of a UPC sighting. It includes a description of the sighting, the conclusions of ATIC as given in your letter to Congressman Bender, and an analysis of the Air Force treatment of this case.

In the analysis of the Air Force treatment of this case our group has concluded that the investigation was insufficient. This case is typical of all UPO cases and that our charges apply generally to the Air Force treatment of reports.

You have answered many inquiries from members of the U.S. Congress indicating that the Air Force is thoroughly investigating UFO reports. We are presenting you with this report which proves that your statements have been false and that your treatment of UFO reports is inadequate for your purposes.

After reading the enclosed report, please send us your answer to the following questions:

(1) What action will be taken to discipline the ATIC investigation of this case?
(2) What action will be taken to take a proper investigation and evaluation of reports (Regulations 200-2 of Sept. 14, 1959)?
(3) What action will be taken to insure that all future reports of unidentified flying objects will be properly investigated and evaluated?

A reply to this letter at your earliest convenience would be appreciated. We await your reply to the above three questions.

Sincerely,

Fred A. Eichhart
For the UFO Research Committee"
