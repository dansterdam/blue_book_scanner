Case 197. Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, Aug. 21, 1956--For twenty minutes, six vacationers watched three strange objects cavorting over the Atlantic Ocean. First in view, the three lights appeared whitish, and according to one witness, seemed to be playing aircraft-like maneuvers including dipping in and out of the ocean. Later a third object appeared on the scene. It was noted that none of the objects made sound.
