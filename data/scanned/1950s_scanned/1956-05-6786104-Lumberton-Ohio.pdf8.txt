The image does not contain any photograph or image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with questions about the description of an observed object.

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Blinking
b. Color: Bluish-white

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image shows a handwritten sketch of an object, likely the UFO observed.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One) a. fuzzy or blurred
b. Sharply outlined
c. Other

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The document appears to be part of a standard form used to collect detailed information about a UFO sighting, though no additional objects are depicted in the image provided.
