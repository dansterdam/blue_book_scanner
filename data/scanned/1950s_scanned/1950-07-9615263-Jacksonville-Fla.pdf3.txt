Object Like Flying Saucer
Seen by Courthouse Group

A half hundred courthouse employees and as many passersby were convinced that they had seen a mysterious and rapidly growing object in the skies over Jacksonville shortly before 3:45 P.M. Monday. The object, which could be clearly "pinpointed" on the horizon, was described as round and aluminum in color. It appeared to be moving at a terrific speed as it approached the area, and was watched by the large group for several minutes before it disappeared from view.

Observers claim the object emitted no flery trail and made no sound as it moved silently through the air. A few persons claimed to have heard a faint "whirring" sound as the object passed overhead, but most of the crowd insisted they heard nothing.

The object was first sighted by a group of men employed at the courthouse. As the object came into view, others in the courthouse and passersby joined the observers. Estimates of the object's size ranged from 25 to 50 feet in diameter.

Conservative spectators claimed the object might be a weather balloon, but most of the onlookers were convinced that they had seen an unidentified aircraft of some kind. They described it as a "flying saucer" type of object.
