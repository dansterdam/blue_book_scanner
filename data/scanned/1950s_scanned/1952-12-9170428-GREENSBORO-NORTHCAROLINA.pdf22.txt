STATEMENT CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

I was in a flight of two RF-80's flying north at approximately 300 MPH at 25,000*. I spotted an object over Greensboro, N. C. at about 6:10 p.m. It was a bright silvery object (approximately 35,000') and it made an arc around to our 6 o'clock position. I called it to the leader's attention and he also spotted the object. Time was 0925. 

It was observed for approximately 45 seconds. Speed and size unknown. The object was bright silver in color and appeared to be spherical in shape with two projections on top.

I was undetermined whether the object was moving or hovering after it went to 6 o'clock position. We did not try to intercept the object.
