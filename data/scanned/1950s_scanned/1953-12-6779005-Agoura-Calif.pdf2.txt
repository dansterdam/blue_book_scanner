FROM: FLYING SAUCERS

This is an account of my experience of witnessing the presence of an object in the sky. I was flying in the lockhead [sic] LT-2 airplane with Mr. ___. At this time it was about 4:30 pm and we were flying at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. Suddenly, we noticed a metallic object which appeared to be a large silver disk or saucer-shaped craft, flying at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet and at a tremendous rate of speed.
While flying at the present altitude of 10,000 feet, I was able to observe the object for a period of approximately 15 minutes before it disappeared from our vision.
The object was flying at an estimated speed of 15,000 mph and at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. It was flying in a level course and the best of my knowledge appeared round in shape and metallic in nature. This object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. Two other objects, seemingly smaller in size, were also observed flying in close proximity to the main object. The main object made no sound and left no trail of smoke or vapor.
The following day it was revealed that Mr. _____ had seen the identical object while standing on the ground at the same time. This coincidence is interesting and it is difficult to discount the possibility that the object was real. The similarity of the descriptions by both observers and the inability to logically explain the details other than the basic outline is impossible to discern anything but the basic outlines.
