DEC 29 J952

FROM: Col 96, Commanding

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

DATE: 29 December 1952
TO OBJECT: 0630. I was sitting in front of the window looking out when I noticed a bright light approach from the northeast. As it came closer it appeared to be a solid object. The object hovered over the Andersen Air Force Base for approximately 3 to 4 minutes. It then made a sharp turn to the northwest and accelerated rapidly out of sight. The object was round in shape, about the size of a car, and appeared to have a bluish-green color. There was no trail of any kind, no exhaust visible, and no noise. It was absolutely silent. The object was at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 feet. The weather at the time was clear with no clouds in the sky.
