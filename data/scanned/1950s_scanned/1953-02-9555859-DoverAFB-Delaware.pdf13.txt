DOVER AIR FORCE BASE

27 Feb 1953

On the night of February 26, 1953, I, A/1C Richard C.
Taylor sighted an unknown and unidentified object in the sky.
When sighted the object was approximately 4000 feet high and
looked to be slowly loosing altitude. The object was moving
North West at a speed which I could not estimate because the
object was moving directly away from me.

When first sighted the object seemed suspended and was
omitting a bright red light. As I watched it, it changed
colors from red to white to yellow to green and continued to do
so but in no set pattern.

When I sighted the object I was at the base theater, leaving
for the Photo lab. With me were A/2C Charles Brown and A/2C
Karl Helgason who also saw the object. Walking toward the Photo
Lab, which is approximately North West of the theater, the object
seemed to lose altitude and slowly recede. Upon reaching the
the Photo Lab we lost sight of the object over the horizon.
The time of this sighting was approximately 2130 and continued for
about 20 minutes. Upon first sighting it I reported it to the O. D.
