With this rough timing, this plane should have been only a very
few miles south-east, with this UFO dead ahead, in clear blue
sky, and could have been seen and possibly reported by this crew.

This object positively in no way, in appearance or performance,
resembled a balloon, plane, meteor, bird, smoke, feathers, paper,
cobwebs, or a flaw or reflection in my windshield.

Two separate reports of Unidentified Flying Objects sighted
over Durango, Yukon, were sent to James Connally Air Force Base,
at Waco, in relaxed Morrowbert, 1952, and each was separately
and personally investigated by Air Force officers.

This latest sighting was telephoned promptly to the news depart-
ment of the local Temple Telegram, with an offer to fill in
any needed details for a news item of the odd event; the
news report has been ignored.

I shall be glad to offer any additional information or
clarification that I can give regarding this latest sighting.
