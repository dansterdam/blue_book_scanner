10. CONCLUSION
    Other (LENS FLARE)
    A pronounced flare spot, in addition to the main image, was noted wth the lens wide. Any camera movement caused the flare spot to move, as well as the main image. Flare images are always encountered in photography when an unusually bright object is included in the field of view, and when the exposure is not portionally reduced.
