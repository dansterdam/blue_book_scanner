Edwards AFB Case (2 May 1957)

This case received nation-wide publicity because the UFO was observed over the so-called "United States secret testing grounds", and had been photographed officially by high-speed cameras, specially designed to track aircraft and missiles. by AF personnel.

The object was observed by the camera crews, who took a series of photographs after it had moved some distance away. They later described it as disc-shaped to interrogators, after they brought the matter to the attention of others. A study of 32 photographs taken, and highly magnified disclosed the object to the size of a match head, but changing shape from round to elliptical, as the object rapidly moved upon its surface, a motion correlated with the reported speed and movement of the object, practically coincided. This pointed to the object being a balloon. Further investigations not only disclosed that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise theodolite measurements coincided with the observer's report as to its size, elevation and bearings. 

This case is considered as having been improperly handled. It did not come to the attention of ATIC until will after the Edwards AFB PIO officer made statements to the press that it was "unknown". When investigations disclosed that he was informed it was a balloon, and the local commander could have solved the case by making local inquiries of his various units.
