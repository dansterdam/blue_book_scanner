There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image consists entirely of text describing some details about an unknown metal object found in an abandoned gravel pit near Lafayette, Indiana.

Following is quotation from a letter of August 23, 1955:
"We who will be receiving for orbit scientists and nuclear safety engineers, gave the metal to their lab for a checkup. After the analysis, the metal was sent back to you. One small disk was sent for a metallurgical analysis. This was made on August 11,1955."

So as per the text, a metal object was found in an abandoned gravel pit near Lafayette, and it was analyzed by scientists and nuclear safety engineers. The metal was later returned to the sender.
