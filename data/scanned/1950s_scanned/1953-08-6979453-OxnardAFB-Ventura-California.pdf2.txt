At 2146 hours, 12 August, I was standing beside the Mobile Control
Tower on the west end of Runway 26. While watching Captain Kemo land
in T-33 #5544, I observed a light of undetermined origin cross slightly
In front of and above the airplane’s line of flight. I estimate the
light was travelling on a heading of 170° as its flight path was
perpendicular to Runway 26.

By comparing the speed of the airplane (approximately 350 knots),
I estimate the speed of the light to be about 500 knots, or possibly in
excess of that figure.

It is impossible to judge the altitude of the light since I did not
know its size, nor did I have any other object to aid me in judging its
size, shape or altitude.

I observed this light for approximately five (5) to eight (3) seconds.

The light was a yellowish-white in color and appeared to be main-
taining a horizontal flight path.

Captain, USAF
