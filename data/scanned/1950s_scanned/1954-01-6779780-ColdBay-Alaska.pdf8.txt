There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed text document that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to transcribe the text in the document:

INFORMATION ONLY (NO CASE)
Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 8 June 1954 
February 1954
Flight Between Seatchkean-Anchortge

Many similar sightings have been reported, not only by air controllers, meteorologists, passengers and aircraft pilots. They apparently are becoming more frequent. On the above date an Air Liner pilot enroute from Kodiak to Anchorage reported the same type of sighting. They reported a bright light object which they lost behind their aircraft. Its portholes extruding a "bluish-green" light. The light seemed to close the gap between their ship and the object, then it failed. They said the vehicle was "definitely unidentified."
