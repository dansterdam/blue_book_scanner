k. The following comment is submitted by the Operations Officer 688th AC&W Squadron, Emmet E. Solley, Captain, USAF:

There has been a rash of such sightings in this area in the past month and a lot of publicity about the so-called unidentified flying objects. This publicity has made many people conscious of such things and we are deluged with reports, most of which appear to be the planet Venus, stars, and such natural phenomena.
