There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a summary of information about unidentified objects detected on radar scopes at McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tennessee, on November 29 and 30, 1950.

The text in the document is as follows:

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION UNCLASSIFIED
DATE: 1 December 1950

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ON RADAR SCOPES AT McGHEE TYSON AIRPORT, KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE

On 29 and 30 November 1950, (during the presence of CIC and OSI representatives) the USAF GCI Director and the GCI Director's assistants observed a single radar target appear on the radar scopes. Following is the controllers' notes of the observations:

Time (hours) Range (miles) Azimuth (degrees from Radar Station)
1351 27 310
1354 27 310
1400 16 320
1402 14 295
1405 12 295

At this time the target disappeared from the scope.

At approximately 1630 hours, on 30 November 1950, unaccountable 1/2 points reappeared on the radar scope and these objects continued a similar pattern followed earlier. Since the radar crew, the control tower crew, the following persons were present to witness these targets:

Lt Col [redacted], USAF, NEPA, Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Major [redacted], USAF, NEPA, Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Captain [redacted], USAF, Radar Controller (off-duty)
Capt [redacted], USAF, Radar Controller, Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Mr. [redacted], Oak Ridge National Lab, Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Mr. [redacted], OSI, Knoxville, Tennessee

These "paints" as before, were so numerous that they could neither be counted nor plotted, and they remained on the radar sets until approximately 2400 hours on 30 November 1950.
