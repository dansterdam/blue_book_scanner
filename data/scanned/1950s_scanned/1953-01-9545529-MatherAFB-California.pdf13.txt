I ORIGINALLY SIGHTED FOUR OBJECTS. ONE OF WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY BRILLIANT. I FIRST OBSERVED THEM OVER THE MATHAR AIR FORCE BASE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA AT ABOUT 8:15 P.M. ON JANUARY 9, 1953. THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING ACROSS THE SKY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND WERE HEADING WEST. THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE METALLIC AND ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE. THE LEAD OBJECT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHERS, EMITTING A WHITE, PULSATING LIGHT. THE OTHER THREE OBJECTS WERE LESS BRILLIANT, EMITTING A DULL, RED LIGHT. THE OBJECTS WERE UNDER EXCELLENT VISIBILITY CONDITIONS AND WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE. THEY APPEARED TO BE AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 30,000 FEET. WHEN FIRST SIGHTED, THE OBJECTS WERE TRAVELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE, BUT LATER THEY MADE ABRUPT TURNS AND DIVES, VARYING THEIR SPEED CONSIDERABLY. TOWARDS THE END OF THE OBSERVATION, THEY SEEMED TO ACCELERATE AND DISAPPEAR FROM SIGHT IN A SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION. THE SIGHTING WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL OTHER RELIABLE WITNESSES IN THE AREA OF THE MATHAR AIR FORCE BASE.
