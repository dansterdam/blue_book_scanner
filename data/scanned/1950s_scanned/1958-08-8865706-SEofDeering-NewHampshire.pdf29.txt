The shared image contains a diagram labeled "FIG. 2" which appears to be a time-distance plot or chart depicting the travel time of an unidentified object. The diagram shows an "E" point on the left and a "W" point on the right, with a curved trajectory and angle measurements at 60 degrees and 45 degrees. The text states "TIME TO TRAVEL (APPROX) 3MIN."

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

TIME TO TRAVEL (APPROX) 3MIN.
