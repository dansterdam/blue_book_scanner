Dear Sir,
I would like to relate some details regarding a sighting of "a blue object" witnessed by residents of Woodside, California. The report indicates that on March 25, 1959, around 8:15 PM, several people observed a blue object in the sky. This object was round in shape and was not merely a reflection or a meteor. The object hovered and maneuvered for several minutes before departing rapidly. The report notes that there is no evidence that this was a known aircraft, and it was not identified as a conventional UFO. The report suggests further investigation may be warranted, as the witnesses were considered reliable. The letter concludes by stating that while Project Blue Book has no further information on this specific sighting, there is evidence that similar objects have been observed in the area.
