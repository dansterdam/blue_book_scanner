12. Base Intelligence Officer's Comments:
In addition to the observers contacted (item 9) two other persons were reported to have observed the incident. However, they could furnish no additional information to supplement that already obtained. The sighting of the B-36 aircraft at high altitudes and airspeed is considered within the capabilities of these aircraft. There is nothing to indicate the sighting of an unconventional type of aircraft, such as the exhaust of a jet aircraft or a tail light on a low flying jet aircraft.
