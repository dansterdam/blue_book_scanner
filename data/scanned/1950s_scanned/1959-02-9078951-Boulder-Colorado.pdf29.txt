April 19, 1959

Mr. Boulder, Colorado

Dear Mr. Johnson:

I must apologize for not having written earlier in reply to your letter of March 23. I have, however, been traveling a great deal and only now getting around to more pressing matters.

I am very familiar with the details you are interested in. I am very curious as to all the details concerning the sighting. The sighters appear to be very reliable people. I would appreciate very much if you would be kind enough to furnish me with the first-hand information. From the sightings I have had referred to me, I would say that, in my opinion, the phenomena you describe appear also to be of an unusual nature. The shadow cast by the object, especially of the large barn on the right, gives us some idea of its tremendous size. The angle of the sun was in February, I believe, so that the shadow may have been considerably longer than it would appear now.

I should like to obtain any additional information and data which you may know. I am, as you understand, intensely interested in flying saucers. I would appreciate your cooperation in this matter. Please let me know if there is any other assistance I can render.

Sincerely yours,
