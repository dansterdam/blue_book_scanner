"You gas is this may way. It back in 1947 we were out on the lake shrimp out. It was just before sundown as we were jig, set back on the sand bank. When I had the feeling that somebody was staring at me. I turned my head and looked around me - but nobody was looking at me. 
"All of a sudden I looked up at the sky and there was this object. It looked to me, at the moment to be about the size of a big rock. I kept my eyes on it, but all of a sudden it made two puffs of flame and was gone. It traveled a little way with the first puff, but with the second puff it was gone."
