OBSERVATION REPORT

   On 8 June 1954 at about 1215 hours, an unidentified flying object was observed over Patrick Air Force Base, Florida.  The object was first sighted in the northeast quadrant of the sky at an elevation of approximately 50 degrees.  It was moving in a southwesterly direction at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour.  The object appeared to be flat, elongated, and approximately 30 to 40 feet in length.  It had a metallic-like appearance and was emitting a bright white light.  The object was observed for approximately one minute and then disappeared from sight.  Two separate observers reported the sighting.  One observer, a Lt. Col. in the USAF, observed the object through 7 x 50 binoculars and stated that the object appeared to be completely silent and without trails or visible means of propulsion.  The other observer, a Major in the USAF, observed the object with the naked eye and stated that the object changed course abruptly at one point during the sighting.  Both observers are considered to be reliable and credible.  This sighting was investigated by the Project Blue Book staff and was determined to be "unknown".
