The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page does not contain any photographs, but rather includes text describing the report. 

Here is the OCR text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

This report has been reviewed and is characteristic of reports received from the Laredo Test Site since 1948. This report does not contain any information which would indicate the presence of any unconventional aircraft.

IV. RECOMMENDATIONS

Two possible sources of information pertaining to this target have not been approached as yet. The first of these is the White Sands Proving Ground. They ordinarily notify the Laredo Test Site of any objects they plan to fire which may pass through the radar screen. 

The absence of any firings on 11 October 1958 should be verified by contacting the unit stationed at the White Sands Proving Ground.

The Harvard College Observatory has two camera recording pictures at meteor tracks which occult in the vicinity of the White Sands Proving Ground. There is a possibility that they would have observed any meteors, or other phenomena which occult visible light, at the time and location of this unidentified target.
