bursts of speed, changing direction at high speed, spinning, and accelerating suddenly to high speeds) can be explained only by 1) a source of power unknown to Earthlings; 2) materials possessing greater strength and greater ability to withstand forces than any now known on Earth; 3) physically-recorded beings or robots capable of withstanding enormous forces;  4) a new, radical means of overcoming or screening gravity.

Two possibilities: Mars and Venus

Space ships could come here from either Mars or Venus. Other planets in the solar system are considered poor prospects for life to exist. Because of the climatic and atmospheric conditions believed to exist on Mars, it is thought by astronomers that a race of intelligence beings would be more likely to be found on that planet than on Venus. Mars has a rare atmosphere, nearly devoid of oxygen and water, and its nights are much colder than our Arctic winters. The atmosphere of Venus appears to be cloudy, and apparently consists mainly of carbon dioxide with deep clouds of formaldehyde droplets. Venus seems to have little or no water.

Despite these environmental characteristics, it is possible that intelligence beings exist on both planets. Such beings would have to be types whose body chemistry, size, appearances, and basic requirements for maintenance of life are entirely different from our own. 

When Mars is nearest Earth, it is about 35,000,000 miles away. When Venus is nearest Earth, it is about 26,000,000 miles away. Venus is nearly as large as Earth; Mars is smaller than Venus.
