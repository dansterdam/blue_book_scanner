OBJ WAS REFERRED TO AS A METEOR OR FALLING STAR, AND THAT HE HAD SIMILAR VISUAL APPEARANCE TO THAT, THOUGHT IT COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN AN AIRCRAFT OF SOME SORT, WITH OF COURSE, UNUSUAL MANEUVERING CHARACTERISTICS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF SOUND OR TRAIL OR SMOKE AND IT WAS SIMPLY A BRIGHT ILLUMINATION WHICH SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR INTO A CLOUD BANK. SINCE OBJ WAS ONLY SIGHTED FOR ABOUT 2-3 SECONDS, THERE WAS REALLY NO OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANY DETAILED OBSERVATION. 
IT IS POSSI8ILITY EXISTS THAT OBJ WAS A UAFC, WHICH TERMINOLOGY - UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL FLYING CRAFT - SEEMS TO BE MORE APPLICABLE THAN UFO, SINCE UNIDENTIFIABLE MEANS EXACTLY THAT, RATHER THAN IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT ITSELF AS NECESSARILY EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL.
