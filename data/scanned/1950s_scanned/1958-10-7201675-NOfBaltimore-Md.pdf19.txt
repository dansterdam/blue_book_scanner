EXPLANATION OF PHOTOGRAPHS 
 Photograph number 1 was taken from the point on the road that   and     first sighted the UFO. The distance from this point to the bridge 
is about 3/4 mile to 1 mile (due East from road to bridge). 

Photograph number 2 was taken about 300 yards from the North end of the bridge. 

Photograph number 3 was taken at the North end of the bridge at the point where          and          claimed their car failed to function. This is about 75 to 80 feet from the bridge structure. 

Photograph number 4 is a shot from the South end of the bridge. 

Photograph number 5 was taken from the South end of the bridge. To give an idea of the height of the bridge the person in the picture is 5' 10" and the top of the hat would be about 6' from the road bed of the bridge. Judging from this the first upright girder would be about 21 feet high.
