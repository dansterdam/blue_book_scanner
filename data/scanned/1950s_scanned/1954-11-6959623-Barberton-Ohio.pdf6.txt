21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Rapidly accelerated and moved out of sight very quickly.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you say it was made? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Aerial object in the sky. Material indeterminate. Relatively small in size.
