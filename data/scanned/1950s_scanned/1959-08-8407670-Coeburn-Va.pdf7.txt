The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an encounter with an unidentified flying object.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"I made 35 mm. camera (Kalimar A ) and regular black and white film. I did not use any flash or telephoto lens or any kind of special equipment. When I got the roll of films back from the developer I found that a print had not been made of the negative so I had an enlargement made of it and discovered that the objects had come out on it. So I reported it to the Air Force.

The photographer who did the enlargement for me said that the Air Force was supposed to pay me at least $100 for the pictures and negatives any Unidentified Flying Object that was sent to them. I hope this is true.

Thank You,"
