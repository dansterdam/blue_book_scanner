Gribbon Island, Md.
24 April 1952

Dear General:

Re: Flying Saucers

Witness: 
_____ Pratt
Baltimore, Maryland  

Scene: Ritchie Highway, opposite Herron's Racing Park near Glen Burnie
Date: Saturday, 19 April 1952. Approx. 10:30 p.m. (Corresponded to 29 March 1952)

Witness, with companion was driving an English Ford toward Baltimore. He heard a roaring sound overhead like "a huge vacuum cleaner gone wild". Looking out he saw overhead a great disk "high" shaped like a huge pancake. Suddenly it turned on edge and with great speed it plunged down till it reached about 200 ft. over the car. The disk, seen from its ends, had a large bubble with an aperture like a spotlight too bright to look at. A hissing sound was too deafening to carry on any conversation. The edges were "pale green luminescence" and a luminous after-trail pulsated. The object hovered about two minutes over the automobile which in the meantime had become immobilized. Suddenly the disk took off in a rapid flight toward Gibson Island or Annapolis. Opposite a yellow automobile proceeding toward Annapolis was similarly immobilized. Witness shouted at occupants, a young man and woman who closed their windows and appeared to look their doors, but a minute or so later started their car and took off. Witness was interviewed by Lou Corbin, a radio station (WCBM) announcer. Corbin is a reserve GIG officer and up to date is keeping the story. Corbin first phoned a technical friend at Glen L. Martin's and received an impression that he took the story seriously but did not give any logical explanation. Corbin intends to go over the car engine with a Geiger counter because the car now gives off a "rough rattle" and a garage mechanic said that the metal appears to be magnetized.
