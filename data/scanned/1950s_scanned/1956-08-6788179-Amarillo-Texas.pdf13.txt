The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, likely a UFO report.

The text in the document is as follows:

The phenomenon appeared to be masses of a parafroid and gessmanite giving it a peculiar shape. At times it would disappear then reappear simultaneously, at various places in the cloud formation. The cloud formation was observed for approximately 50 minutes, and covered an area extending from the southeast to the northeast. It appeared to explore places in the cloud formation. A flash of light was observed from the formation as it traveled. In the town of Amarillo Texas, others related that they spotted the formation at 0400 hours and it arrived over Memphis, Texas, the information had already been dispatched. The formation was observed to be traveling at a rapid rate of 10 to 20 feet from its first trajectory. Upon its arrival at Memphis, Texas, the information had already been dispatched. As directed, the phenomenon appeared to be descending into the heavens, where it was the approximate size of a star and was the only visible object in the clear sky.

During this period of (2) hours and fifteen (15) minutes, the phenomenon was obscuring at intervals 1-5 minutes, and was creating a cloud formation. Its brilliance would illuminate the area within the cloud as brighter portions would pass through the cloud at points of dissipation.

I would cooperate with the USAF authorities in any way possible.
