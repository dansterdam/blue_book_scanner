My opinion is that the sightings of these objects could in a number of instances be attributable to misidentification of common objects. However, there are a sufficient number of sightings that appear to be authentic observation of unusual aerial phenomena to warrant further investigation. There have been instances where sightings have been made of phenomena that cannot be explained in terms of any known aerial objects or natural atmospheric conditions.

There is still much uncertainty as to the nature of these objects and whether they represent phenomena of extraterrestrial origin. More comprehensive and intensive investigations will be required before any definitive conclusions can be reached. At the present time I am puzzled in an unwarranted way. We must continue our efforts to obtain all possible information from continued observation and study of these aerial objects.
