In reply to your messages of 23 Jan 53 (AFTR-1-2323 and AFTR-1-1335) regarding two independent sightings of flying objects, AFTR requests that you forward AF form 112 as per AFR 200-2. AFTR specifically desires to know if both sightings occurred on the same day, and, if so, can you confirm identical regulators from local balloon launches.
