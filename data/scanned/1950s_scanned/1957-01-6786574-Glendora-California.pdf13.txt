RECENT SIGHTING REPORTS

DIAMOND-SHAPED FORMATION OVER BINGHAMTON, NEW YORK

January 25, 1957: CSI member Mrs. [redacted], of Binghamton, New York, sent us the details of a personal observation made at 6:35 a.m. on January 25. She saw four white lights in the southeast quadrant, traveling slowly east parallel to the horizon and 6 to 8 degrees above it, in a diamond-shaped formation. "The sky was overcast, so that the lights were diffused; at times the lights at the front and rear of the formation flashed brighter." They were in sight for about ten minutes, and were then lost in the thick overcast. As they moved away toward the east the lights became less bright, but did not diminish in size. Mrs. [redacted] was quite certain they could not be planes because of the intensity of the front and rear lights.
