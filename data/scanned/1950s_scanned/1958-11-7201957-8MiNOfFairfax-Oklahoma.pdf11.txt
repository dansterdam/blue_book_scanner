(1) The observer is that of a young man of 29, with apparently average intelligence and observation for a man of that age. His story checks out and he appears sincere. He stated that he and other employees working at the Windmill Inn observed the object as described, and that it seems to hover or remain stationary at various altitudes and then take off at a high rate of speed.  

(2) The observer stated to this officer that he does not believe the object was a true aircraft. He stated that it was much larger and quite different in appearance from any known aircraft. The object was also relatively silent compared to any conventional aircraft.

(3) The observer stated that he does not drink, and that that day had been very normal for him. There was no indication of any reason to doubt the truthfulness of his statement.

(4) The object that caused the sighting was due to some unknown phenomenon which could not be explained or identified as a known object.
