OPERATIONS REPORT - 3 - 7 August 1953

Several reports on unidentified aerial objects were received this week including several calls from the Dayton area. Two interrogations were completed and both proved satisfactory toward solving the identity of the objects. One of the objects was explained as a weather balloon launched at Sulphur Cove and the other was determined to be astronomical.

The ATIC Duty Officer called A/1C Futch on the operation immediate secret message at approximately 1530 hrs EST 6 Aug 53. The message contained a detailed report on an unidentified aerial object observed by several personnel on duty at the Rapid City Filter Center a few miles northwest of Rapid City, S. D., at 2003 MST, 5 Aug 53. The message seemed important enough to take immediate action. Capt E. J. Ruppelt, advisor to Project Blue Book, was advised to come out to the Center to review the message. He called the 740th ACM Squadron at Ellsworth AFB, Rapid City, S. D., and talked to W/O Bennett who was the night controller. W/O Bennett stated that he was on duty the night of the incident and was very familiar with the sighting. Capt Ruppelt was sent out to interrogate the observers. This is one of the best reports ever received on this project.
