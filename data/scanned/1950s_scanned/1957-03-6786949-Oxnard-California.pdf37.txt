The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing a UFO sighting incident.

(1) A bare was located in a field under the area of the reported UFO. Red lights were found installed on each corner of the roof.

(2) Detailed line-of-sight photos from the sources observed the lights and confirm the sighting. There were three objects viewed through these crosses on 1.5-inch crossbars on the telescope, and the line-of-sight is obvious.

(3) Directly in the line-of-sight, as pointed out by source, and beyond the lights on the barn, was a very brightly star. Arcturus, in the sky. This was corroborated by a professional astronomer.

(4) The sighting was observed through a window. Again, the objects of the red lights on the barn with a reddish-orange appearing star in the background, observed through a mass of trees and shrubs to circumscribe no further comment.

(5) It is interesting to note that the objects reported were described as being very stable, very slow movement. Yet, no report of any unusual phenomena was received by others reporting.

This report is typical of the many received by the Air Force, which upon investigation results in the UFO observed being identified as conventional objects or natural phenomenon. We do not publish any details which may serve to indicate the thoroughness with which any UFO sighting is investigated, if properly reported, a fact not often known to the general public.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.
Sincerely,
