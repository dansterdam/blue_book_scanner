Possible in order that the facts as I received them could be recorded without distortion, I asked Capt Guzi and obtained information that was summarizing. This summarizing gave a signal of tremendous size and that the random motion of the signals precluded from motion calculations. The further stated that the range of the signal covered 50,000 feet and was spotted from 20-30,000 distance in range. These reports varied until 1140, at which time he lost track of the object as the object came closer to the field than fifteen miles.
