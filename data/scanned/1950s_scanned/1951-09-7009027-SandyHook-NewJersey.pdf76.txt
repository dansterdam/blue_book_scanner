bound of 35 ft diameter and upper bound of B-17 diameter. (a) The time of sighting was 11:35 EDST and the object was lost at 11:37 EDST, on 10 September 1951. However, all the foregoing observations concerning the conclusions from the interrogation of Lt Rogers are in the assumption that it is impossible to demonstrate criteria necessary to establish their sighting as one of a balloon. Now these criteria are considered to be something like the following: 
a. Opportunity - that is the presence of a balloon in that geographic area.
b. Similarity - that is points of similarity between balloons and observations made.
c. Absence of a negative component - that is, the pilots themselves verified on a balloon or the subjects who were viewing from the ground did not see a balloon. However, this could be elaborated upon. 
It is believed that essentially that these factors would effect the decision. 
Now as to opportunity, we have information that the Evans Signal Laboratory released two balloons at 11:12 EDST 10 September, that these balloons were in the air until 12:32 EDST on 10 September and that they burst at 104,000 ft and the diameter of the balloons at burst were 35 ft approximately. It is to be noted that between Signal Laboratory at Belmar, N.J. and the location regarding points of similarity the following must be considered:
Considering that the pilots disagreed radically, interrogations or Lt 2 of the EADF and interrogations by ATIC personnel as in their written statements concerning ground tract that they are not sure or more than this fact that the
