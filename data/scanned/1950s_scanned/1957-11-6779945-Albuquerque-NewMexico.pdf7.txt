Locks uncommunical: Geauga Alive with Probers of Reports on 'Space Crafts'
MONTVILLE - If there was any doubt in the minds of some persons about Geauga County being a hotbed of observation of "space crafts" it was dispelled during the last few days when investigators from the Air Force, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and newspaper reporters converged on the area to check out reports.
A number of persons in the Montville and surrounding area reported seeing strange objects in the sky which they said resembled flying saucers, and these reports brought the investigators into the area.
Some of the persons who reported seeing the objects said they were brilliantly lit and moved at incredible speed. Others said they hovered for a while and then disappeared.
The investigators did not disclose what if any conclusions they reached as a result of their visits, but it is understood that the Air Force is still keeping a close check on reports of "unidentified flying objects" in that section of the country.
