CASE 190. Cleveland, Ohio, July 24, 1956 - 2:15 p.m. Two witnesses, Paul Turner and James Pryor, were in a car on Route 20, just west of Wakeman, Ohio, when they observed a silvery object in the sky to the north. It was flat, circular or elliptical in shape, approximately the size of a quarter held at arm's length. It did not appear again. Speed was stated as being approximately 700 - 800 mph. To the naked eye the object appeared to be blue-white in color and was very bright and shiny, reflecting the sun's rays. It was observed for approximately 7 seconds and disappeared through the clouds in a horizontal flight. The object was comparablt to the moon for size when first sighted. Minute later, a jet plane could be seen in the vicinity but was unrelated to the object observed. This case is evaluated as a good sighting, the witnesses being quite reliable and the observation being reasonably detailed.
