On May 22 or 23, 1952, at 2:15 a.m., Robert Andrews, of Terre Haute, Indiana, saw a strange light in the sky near the north end of the Indiana State Teachers College campus. The light was disc-shaped and about 150 feet in diameter. It hovered above the second story front apartment. At 3:15 a.m. it moved off and disappeared in the north. The sound was described as a rushing noise, similar to a jet plane, but it was silent.

The material burned brilliantly and continued to glow for a considerable time after the object disappeared. The flight path was 3 miles long and left no trace. The object was brightly illuminated and visible for a considerable distance. As it moved away, the intensity of the light gradually diminished.

The material was quite unlike anything Andrews had ever seen before. He concluded it was not a comet, meteor, or any conventional aircraft. The glow from the material was so brilliant it lit up the area as if it were daylight. The object was estimated to be 150 feet in diameter, and the glow was estimated to be about 3 feet in diameter.
