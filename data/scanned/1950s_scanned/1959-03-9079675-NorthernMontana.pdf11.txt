MEMO TO: AF PR 23-73
SUBJECT: (12) Analysis of UFO Report

FOR: AFOIN-4E2
APRIL 523 JUN 59

References is made to the additional data included in the Air Defense Command letter of 19 March 1959. A review of this additional material indicates that there is not sufficient factual data to justify modifying the existing evaluation of this case. The original determination that the material are more likely of natural origin still prevails. However, there is not sufficient conclusive information from the data contained in the report to definitely establish the identity of the objects observed.
