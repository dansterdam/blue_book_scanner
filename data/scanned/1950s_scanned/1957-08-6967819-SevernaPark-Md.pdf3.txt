Subject: Two unexplained brilliant lights sighted in the sky.

Mrs. _____ and myself were taking an evening stroll around the house on Hatton Drive to talk for a few minutes. At about 10:20 p.m. our attention was attracted to the sky by two brilliant lights that seemed to be stationary in the sky about (Rev. - or my work which I follow say about) 300-400 feet up. They were moving very slowly around to look out but didn't see anything and went on about our business. The lights looked to be about the size of a baseball and had a thin cloud which was alone in the sky and was nearly overhead. We watched the lights for about 20 minutes until they disappeared and it was about 10:40 p.m. when we went back into the house. There was no noise, no exhaust trail, and no other lights around except for the two. The reflection of movement of the two lights on the thin cloud which was alone in the sky was plainly visible. We have no idea of what the lights were but it was a strange sight as they just seemed to drift around with no sound or trail. Both myself and Mrs. _____ were impressed by the strange behavior of the lights and could not explain what we saw.
