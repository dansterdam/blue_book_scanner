SUBJECT: Request for Analysis - UFO Photographs
TO: AFOLN-LL FROM: AFOLN-H2F DATE: 9 APR 58 COMMENT HR 2

Due to recent transfer of photographic services responsibility to ADI, it is no longer possible to initiate a request for analysis for inclusions or untraresed UTO prints or transparencies. 

2. Analysis of attached transparencies is as follows: 
a. The black objects in transparencies appear to have been created during processing, probably caused by air bubbles clinging to emulsion during first development, which prevented uniform density from developing and resulted in black image areas.
b. These images show no shape or gradation which would result in case of objects actually flying in the sky, even if they were black.
