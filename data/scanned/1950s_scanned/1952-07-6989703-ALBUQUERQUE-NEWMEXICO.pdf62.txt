Jet vs. white object:
Jet was first observed about 1430. The object was traveling East. They looked like a white flare and were intermittently visible. They looked about 5,000 to 7,000 feet altitude. The object was motionless, then moved slowly and then took off at a high rate of speed. I saw several.
