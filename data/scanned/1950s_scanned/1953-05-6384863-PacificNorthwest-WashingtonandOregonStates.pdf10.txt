STATEMENT

At approximately 0l:32 hours (about 1:32 am) were sighted on the north-south radar of the Ground Observer Corps station at Grant's Pass, Oregon, a target of moderate intensity. The target was followed by Shelton in the Radar Operation Room for approximately 8 minutes when it faded from the radar screen. It was estimated that the target covered a distance of approximately 20 to 25 miles during this time.

The target reappeared on the radar screen about 10 minutes later and was followed for an additional 15 minutes. At times the target was lost and then regained, leaving the impression that it was manuvering or changing altitude very rapidly. Subsequent observation from the station indicated that the target was apparently off the southwest at an estimated azimuth of 210 degrees to 220 degrees and appeared to be at a relatively high altitude.

The operator stated that the target seemed to be traveling at a speed that appeared to be greater than that of any known aircraft. The radar set was functioning properly and was checked thoroughly during the time of observation. The operator of the radar set stated that he had never seen anything like it before.

The incident was reported promptly through channels, and all pertinent information was forwarded to the Air Defense Command. The radar data and visual observation was the only report received from this area covering this incident.
