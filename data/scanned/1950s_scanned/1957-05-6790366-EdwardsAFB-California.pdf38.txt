The image contains a photograph of text, but no other visual elements. The text states:

"THE SIGHTING OF A UFO PHOTOGRAPHED AT EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, MAY 3, BY TWO THEODOLITE OPERATORS AT THE TEST CENTER. OFFICIALS AT EDWARDS HAVE ADMITTED THE UFO WAS TRACKED BY SPECIAL CAMERA EQUIPMENT, AND THAT THE FILMS WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, DAYTON."

As an OCR system, I have extracted all the text found in the document.
