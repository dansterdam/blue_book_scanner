Richmond, Indiana
November 9, 1966

My experience with a UFO occurred 10 years ago, on September 15, 1956. On this day I was scheduled to address the Woman's Press Club of Indiana as its after-luncheon speaker in the French Lick-Sheraton Hotel at French Lick, Indiana. (I am a Doubleday author and frequently serve as a speaker for church, civic, and women's groups, conventions and service clubs.) Because of the distance from Richmond to French Lick, my husband and I left early in the morning. It was a very unpleasant morning, extremely dark, with pounding rain and beating winds. At daylight we were in southern Indiana, and it was there that we saw the UFO.

At the time, we were approaching Salem, Indiana. I do not know the exact time, but it was between 6 and 7 a.m. The rain was now only a misty drizzle, but the morning was wet and gray.

We came up an incline to a sort of hilltop (I do not know the exact location) which looked out over a flat area of fields and fences as I recall. My husband was driving, intent upon the road. I looked out to the left and saw, hovering over the flat area, a flying saucer!

At first I was too surprised and startled to speak at all.
