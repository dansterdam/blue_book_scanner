(2) The radar units at Highlands, N.Y., E. Turo, Mass., and at Montauk, N.Y., also picked up the same track. However, these units could not make contact with the supposed targets.

(3) F-102 aircraft were scrambled from George AFB (AD) (Victorville), California, but made no additional contact. The track faded at this point. The tracks were considered genuine, as a prescribed track in that direction. No contact made.

(5) On 25 September, a series of blips was noted on the radarscope at Benton, Pa. These blips disappeared after 20 seconds. When the channel (frequency) was changed the blips disappeared. They reappeared when the original frequency was restored. This phenomena was unidentified, but having a non-rotating antenna was considered the most probable cause.
