Coast Guard Ship in Gulf Sees Strange Light
The Coast Guard reported today that an object giving off a strange light was spotted by the crew of a Coast Guard cutter in the Gulf of Mexico. This latest report follows similar earlier similar reports by other military and civilian observers.
The Coast Guard said the object was tracked on the cutter's radar for several minutes, and that the cutter's commanding officer reported that the object was maneuvering and appeared to be under intelligent control.
At Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, an officer said the object was not an airplane and that the Coast Guard was keeping a close watch for any similar objects.
The Air Force said its investigators were attempting to determine the nature and origin of the object. As to the reports that the object was under intelligent control, the Air Force spokesman said the investigators were working under the Air Defense Command to determine if this was the case.
As to Flying Saucer
The spokesman said that to his knowledge the object was not a "flying saucer" in the sense in which that term is commonly used. He added, however, that the investigators were looking into all possibilities, including unusual weather phenomena.
An Alexandria, Egypt, University professor was quoted today as saying that what appeared to be part of a missile or satellite had landed in the desert near Alexandria. The director of a private organization concerned with space exploration said the object seemed to be about 15 feet long and seven feet wide, and that it gave off a brilliant glow.
The director said that the object fell to earth about 300 miles west of Alexandria and that his organization was attempting to recover the object for examination. He added that the object must have come from outer space, as there are no facilities in that area capable of launching such an object.
