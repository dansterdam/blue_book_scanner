AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[REDACTED], Cpl (E6) 67 Broad St.
Norwalk, Lt. 

Connecticut. Mother of the witness had seen the object at close range; that she was very frightened and firmly believes it was a strange circular aircraft not at all like any known type. She stated that about three (3) days after her daughter had seen the object, she saw it again from the window of her home and that it was moving very slowly and silently across the sky, making no noise whatsoever. She stated that it was about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length and was luminous or illuminated. She further stated that it appeared to be about the size of a medium-sized piper cub aircraft, and when it passed in front of the moon it obscured a portion of the moon. It had no wings, tail, or other visible means of propulsion, and gave no indication of any exhaust or trail of any kind. It simply glided silently across the sky.

12. Attached as paragraphs are a drawing of object, prepared by special agent, and a map showing the location of the sighting, Connecticut, should of course be considered as unknown objects, correlation, showing of course of unknown objects.
