FLAMING RED SAUCER

Saints Preserve Us, I Had It In Me Mits, Then Poof!

MONEYMORE, Northern Ireland, Sept. 8.--An Irishman named Thomas Hutchinson reported he saw and captured a flaming red flying saucer-- but it got away.
"I had difficulty in holding it down," he explained.
Just as the incident happened this way: He was sitting at home with his wife Maud about noon yesterday when an object dropped from the sky and hit the ground in the middle of a bog 200 yards from his home.
Hutchinson said he hurried to the bog and found the object lying motionless. "It was bright red," said Mr. Hutchinson, "and it must have been about three feet high and 18 inches in diameter."
He put a hammer lock on the thing but it was pretty powerful and "it kicked me over," said the Irishman. "That is returned to the original position."
When he got down on his hands and knees to capture the baffling object, "it shot up suddenly and disappeared into the sky," he said.
He put a hammer lock on it but it was pretty powerful and "it kicked me over," said the Irishman. "That is returned to the original position."
When he got down on his hands and knees to capture the baffling object, "it shot up suddenly and disappeared into the sky," he said.
The police at Lotp, Hutchinson had to get through a thick hedge, "down for a moment," he said, "and what do you think? It started spinning again."
Before he had time to throw himself on the queer colored invader again, it disappeared into the rain-laden clouds.
The cops at Lotp called the Royal Air Force station at nearby for help, but the commander said the object did not belong to the R.A.F. When the Royal Air Force officer arrived, "he did not believe me," said Hutchinson. "I would not even hazard a guess" as to what the object might have been.
