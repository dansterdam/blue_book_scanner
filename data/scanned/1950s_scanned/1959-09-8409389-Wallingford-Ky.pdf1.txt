10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Object gave off a glowing phosphorescent light, seemed to be down to the bottom of the sky in distance. It would suddenly brighten and fade alternately - probably a hoax. Obj. left by moving straight up out of sight leaving blue fire in its wake. This was watched for the entire 10 min.
11. COMMENTS: This report is from a reliable source, the parent of the school teacher who lives and teaches in the area where this was observed. It seems to describe the physical characteristics of a balloon, even though the initial impression was that it was unconventional. This is probably a standard balloon.
