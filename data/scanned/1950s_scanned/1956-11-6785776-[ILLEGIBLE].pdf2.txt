NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

14 NOVEMBER 1956
MOBILE, ALABAMA

BY ROBERT SERLING 
UNITED PRESS STAFF CORRESPONDENT
WASHINGTON, D.C. - PILOT WHO ONCE DENOUNCED "FLYING SAUCERS" AS "BUNK" HAS REPORTED ENCOUNTERING A MYSTERIOUS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT NEAR MOBILE, ALA.

CAPT. FULGHUM OF CAPITAL AIRLINES DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT IN A NATIONAL INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE COMMITTED TO AERIAL PHENOMENA. 

HE SAID THE OBJECT APPEARED "PERFECTLY ROUND" AND WAS PULSING BRILLIANT COLORS. LOTS OF PEOPLE. THOUGHT IT WAS TITLED "THE GIANT AIRLINERS STRUCK BY METEORS".

INVESTIGATOR WHO TOOK PLACE NOV. 14, 1956 SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT MAN OR ANY MAN-MADE OBJECT WAS INVOLVED. HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A NEW TYPE OF BALLOON. 

HE SAID WHEN HE AND HIS CO-PILOT SPOTTED "WHAT WE THOUGHT AT FIRST WAS A METEOR" IT WAS DESCENDING RAPIDLY. BUT INSTEAD OF BURNING OUT, IT BEGAN A SERIES OF VIOLENT MANEUVERS. FASTER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT.  

HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE OBJECT MIGHT BE A JET FIGHTER. TURNING AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEN IT BEGAN A SERIES OF VERY SHARP TURNS, "MUCH SHARPER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT", ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATOR.  

HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT FINALLY BEGAN A SERIES OF VIOLENT MANEUVERS, SHARPER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT, AND SHOT OUT OF SIGHT. PRECISION FLIGHTS OF SEARCHLIGHTS FROM BELOW SUDDENLY PLAYED ON CLOUDS. BUT THIS WAS NOTHING REMOTELY RELATED TO THE OBJECT WHOSE BRILLIANCE OUTSHONE EVERYTHING. EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT WE SAW IT, I CAN'T GET OVER IS WHY IT DID NOT APPEAR ON OUR RADAR. IT MUST A REPLY UPWARD.
