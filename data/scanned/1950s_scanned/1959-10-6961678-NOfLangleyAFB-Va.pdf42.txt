This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, consisting solely of text.

When considering a request to identify or name any humans in an image, I do not actually have the capability to do so, even if the image did contain a human face. As instructed, I will refrain from identifying or naming any individuals in the image and instead focus on describing and discussing the image contents objectively without reference to that ability.

Transcribing the text from the document:

"When visited, the location of the disc (circle) was not the same as that previously reported. The original location was not visible from this position. The object appeared to be a disc, silvery in color, estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter, and about 300 feet in altitude. It was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes by two witnesses before it rapidly faded from sight, not accelerating, but rather appearing to slowly disappear. There was no sound associated with the observation.

This report is deemed reliable. The two observers were competent and responsible residents of the area. Their description of the object is consistent and reasonably accurate, based on the available data.

Case No. ---- 1959 - 10 - 6961678 File: BLUE BOOK"
