The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS

ACTION

The object appeared to be moving across the sky and maintaining level attitude on a rapid climb without material change. The attitude was clear and appeared to have a velocity altitude approach approaching as might be determined by a radar operator.
