SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph. List Incloures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112 Part II):

On 22 October 1951, the radar station, located at North Truro, Massachusetts observed an unusual sighting on its radar scopes, at a location approximately 120 to 300 miles East and East-North-East away. Details are listed on Part II, this report. The individual echo returns, and the appearance of the track, substantiate the probability that these radar "pick-ups" may actually have been that of an unidentified flying object, rather than some type of radar interference or malfunction.
