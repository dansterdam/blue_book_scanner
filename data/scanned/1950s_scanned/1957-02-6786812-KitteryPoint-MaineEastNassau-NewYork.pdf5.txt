AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
NEW HAMPSHIRE
UNCLASSIFIED
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 18 March 1957
DATE OF REPORT: 19 March 1957
OBSERVER: Capt. USAF, 8608th Movement Control Squadron, Portsmouth, N.H.
LOCATION: Kittery Point, Maine, and East Nassau, New York
DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
Observed an unidentified flying object report. The object was first observed at about 2015 hours, 18 March 1957, by the observer who was watching a celestial body which he took to be the full Moon. The object was observed for approximately 3 minutes.
The object was initially seen in the northeast, but moved downward and to the observer's right as he watched it. The object appeared yellowish-orange in color and gave off a brief flash of light as it moved downward. When the observer first saw the object, it appeared to be the size of a basketball at arm's length. As it moved downward, it appeared to decrease in size. The object moved downward and to the right at a steady pace, appearing to the observer to be descending. The entire observation lasted approximately 3 seconds. Mr. Condic hurried to the corner, but the object had disappeared.
The observational data indicates the possibility of a fireball-type meteor. More or less fireball-like objects are included in the hope of obtaining added information of value.
DISTRIBUTION: As directed.
