The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report describing an observation of an unidentified flying object.

Text from the document:

That so far in horizontal diameter,above a slightly curled-up "pear" that extended outward for 12 or 13 feet from the bottom of the main or inner ring and about 10 feet high or wide,possibly about 50 feet total,it may be called oval smoothly and completely,in a gentle curve,with no signs of ports or windows or vents of any kind,of which I could see none anywhere else on the entire object.

That ,in the absence of any openings in it,I could see no beings,persons,or creatures,into the object sliding,just the sides who might be operating and riding in it,and no crew or passengers were visible on the object's exterior during its visit.

That the color of the object,all over,was a uniform white,dull but clean,with no spots,striai,or other markings whatever. Its texture was apparently non-reflective but like a fine-grained pipe clay.

That a moderate breeze,from the northeast I think,was blowing in which the object hovered quite stationary except for a gentle rocking motion,like a boat at anchor on water. As the object rocked and fell irregularly.

That beneath the object,extending vertically toward the ground,I seemed to see,and then not see,and then was again,a lot of streamers or lines or some material(or force) that twinkled like the fragile sprays of tinsel on a Christmas tree.

That without any marked change of sound except a soft rush of air,sucking away and not blowing toward me,the object abruptly ascended almost vertically,northeasterly,as it increased speed into the entire lost contour(contour 3.0 feet up) and was instantly gone.
