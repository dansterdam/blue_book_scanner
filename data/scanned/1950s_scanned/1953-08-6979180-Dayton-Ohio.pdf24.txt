AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 1
PAGE 3 OF 3

The report contains the following text:

We were going along the upper Bellbrook Road and I noticed what appeared to be an illuminated object in the sky. At first I thought it was just an aircraft, but as I kept my eyes on it I noticed that it stopped, hovered for a short while and then took off at a terrific speed. It was still high in the sky, and I would estimate about eight or ten thousand feet. As it took off, it made a circle to the left and then zoomed straight up and was out of sight in a northeast direction. It just disappeared somewhere over Xenia. They turned the lights out of it.

I have never seen anything else of an unusual nature. This thing didn't make any sound that I could distinguish, and it was certainly not an aircraft as we know them. The lights were so brilliant that they illuminated the ground beneath it. They appeared to be clear white lights, evidently, from the glow, some kind of a light or instrument on the object.
