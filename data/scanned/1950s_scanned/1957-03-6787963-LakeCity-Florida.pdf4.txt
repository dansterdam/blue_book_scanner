Dear Miss [REDACTED],

This replies to your letter in which you reported an unidentified observation you made approximately ten years ago. 

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will be sure your letter becomes a part of our project files. At this late date, it is impractical to investigate the individual report in detail; however, your observation as soon as possible. This enables Air Force analysis to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Your interest in the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects is appreciated. I have included the 1957 report on our project.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. PESARE, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
