The image contains a diagram labeled "Official U.S. Air Force" that appears to be an observation chart or sighting report form. The diagram includes a circular compass-like diagram with instructions for indicating the direction of sightings, as well as a text section below the diagram.

The text of the document is as follows:

37. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the course line to show how the object appeared to be moving. Place an "X" on the compass when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you last saw it.

38. Draw a sketch showing the shape of the object made, and the nature of the motion observed. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course of the observation.

29. If there was a CHRISTIAN one object, then draw a cross (X) to indicate the direction they were traveling.
