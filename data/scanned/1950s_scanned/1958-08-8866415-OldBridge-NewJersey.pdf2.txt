To Whom It May Concern:

Last evening about 9:00 a few friends and I were observing an object in the sky for about 3 hours. We would like to know what it was.

Our location is Central Jersey, and the object appeared not very far above the North East horizon. It seemed to follow the same pattern of movement, going from side to side, covering a short distance. It would appear in the same place and disappear in the same place. It was very bright. Once it seemed to move in a complete circle.

We are all very curious and anything you can tell us would be appreciated.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
(Mr. & Mrs.) [redacted]
Old Bridge, N.J.
