MEMORANDUM FOR MR. ____________
SPECIAL ASSISTANT FOR RESEARCH & ENGINEERING, OASD

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting

1. This memorandum is in answer to your unidentified flying
object sighting of 7 October 1958 at Alexandria, Virginia. The
sighting was referred immediately to the Air Technical Intelligence
Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for analysis and/
or evaluation.

2. In the opinion of the Air Technical Intelligence Center
personnel, the phenomenon you saw was created by the reflection of
the sun from either ice crystals or a very thin cloud layer. As
the sun lowered behind the horizon it illuminated less and less of
the reflector, the decrease in size creating the illusion of
motion. The wind had a component which was generally toward the
north; therefore, the reflector drifting toward the witness could
help account for the apparent increase in altitude.

3. The fact that the object was reported as first stationary
then moving lends to the above conclusion. There would be no
apparent motion until the amount of reflected light began to
noticeably diminish. Further weight is lent to this conclusion
by the fact that this object was reported as being approximately
600' in length and investigation failed to uncover another witness.
