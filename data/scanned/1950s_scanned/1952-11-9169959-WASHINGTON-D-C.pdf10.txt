The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can output the following text found in the document:

DO 230-230. Subject: Unidentified Aerial Object Observed at 0255 Hours on 15 Nov 52 over Washington, D.C. Observer: Observer, 1st Dist Code 051, FIX OB IT.

1. No further action is being taken in this matter by this District office.
