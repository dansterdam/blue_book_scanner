1. The object enclosed has apparently been made of yellow brass tubing and hand-turned.
2. Yellow brass (approximately 65% copper - 35% zinc) is used for architectural detail work, lamp shades and ornamental hardware. It is darkened after polishing usually by heating to 1000Â°F. in a furnace, or by the application of hand-tight objects, normally by spraying in cold and burning this oil on the surface. The latter method was apparently used since the inside is slightly lighter in shade than the outside which appears to have been darkened by an oxidizing action.
3. The lettering on the aluminum cap which has been brazed to the one end is hand-engraved. Under a glass, it was found to have been "MHAG" or "MHAS".
4. The object could have been used for any number of purposes such as a flashlight body, handle, etc. The tubing well, however, is much too thin for cartridge shells.
5. It is felt that a laboratory examination of this object is not justified.
