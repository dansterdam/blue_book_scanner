UFO PHOTOS BY STATE POLICE UNDER SECRET AIR FORCE STUDY
The existence of authentic UFO photographs taken by Louisiana state policemen has been officially confirmed by authorities of England's Air Ministry. It has been officially stated that their names be withheld, as the objects close 1/20 of a second are considered "Top Secret". The file in question was forwarded to the Alexandria, Louisiana TOWN TALK. The chief of England's Air Information Services then confirmed that photographs taken 1953 or 1954 were under investigation in England and may be considered of top priority. The Air Force has investigated and certified the photographs as unclassified.

NICAP Comments: This is incorrect. Air Force gun camera pictures, the White Sands films, and a number of other official and private photographs of UFOs have been taken, but by the close-up pictures and the recovery" reports of the UFO craft films and disappearance of the films, the Air Force has publicly and frequently denied the existence of the photographic evidence and reports, the Air Force authorities refused even to investigate them.
