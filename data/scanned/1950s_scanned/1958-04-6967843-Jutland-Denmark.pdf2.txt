SUBJECT: Release of Information in Unidentified Flying 
Object Reports for Civilian Analysis and Possible 
Publication 

TO: Commander 
1700th Test Squadron (D.Development) 
Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico 

TO: Office of Information Services (AFOIS) 
Secretary of the Air Force 
Washington 25, D.C.

1. In accordance with paragraph 3, AFR 200-2, dated 5 February 
1955, I hereby request permission to release for civilian analysis 
and possible publication, my Unidentified Flying Object sighting 
report to the 4602d Air Defense Observation Squadron, Air Defense 
Command Center, Kirtland AFB, on the evening of 
22 April 1955. The sighting was conducted by █████████ to the 
satisfaction of this office. Further instructions for 
approval of this request are as follows: 

	a. In accordance with paragraph 18, AFR 200-2, no classi-
fication is necessary to protect any information of the kind listed, 
nor does any of the data reported under paragraph 15 require classi-
fication.

	b. The reports do not fall into any category restricted 
under paragraph 1b and 2a, AFR 190-2, dated 1 December 1955, or 
paragraphs 3, AFR 190-16, dated 24 July 1957. Therefore, these reports
meet the requirements of paragraph 2, AFR 190-16.

	c. Accordingly, I would be very grateful if, in keeping 
with this policy expressed in paragraph 1A, AFR 190-2 and paragraph 
2, AFR 190-16, you would release the aforementioned reports as 
requested.

2. I would also appreciate further clarification of paragraph 
11, AFR 200-2. Does this paragraph restrict military personnel from 
unofficially interviewing civilians who have sighted Unidentified 
Flying Objects, such interviews being for the purpose covered under 
paragraph 1a(3), AFR 100-2, which states that the military without 
worldwide intelligence access to information as civilians have, 
would not be restricted in respect to civilian interviews?

3. Above requests have been referred to you at a by-level consultation 
with the Office of Information Services at base level.

 █████████ ██████████████
 (Mr. John ████████ Test Squadron (Day))
