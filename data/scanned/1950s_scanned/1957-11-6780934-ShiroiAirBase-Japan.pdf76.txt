I was approximately 18:30 hours 7 NOV 57. I was in the Military Personnel Division, T-112, when I observed a very bright light moving rapidly above the Misawa Air Base. It appeared to be approximately circular in shape and was white or bluish-white in color. The object made two complete circles over the base and was extraordinarily fast. This phenomenon lasted for approximately 8 to 10 minutes, and it disappeared going due north. I did not hear any sound from the object, and it appeared to be just above the cloud layer at the time. It was a rather remarkable sight, and I believe a considerable number of people on the base observed it.
