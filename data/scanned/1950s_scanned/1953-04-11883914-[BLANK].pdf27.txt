Lt E. J. Ruppalt and Col Kirkland conferred with members of the Intelligence Division on 6 December 1951 in regard to Project Grudge. The question of whether a report that would warrant a detailed scientific study was discussed. It was concluded that there is no indication that any unidentified aerial objects to warrant a detailed scientific study was discussed. It was concluded that there is no indication that any unidentified aerial objects that were recently observed give sufficient evidence to warrant a detailed scientific study. However, a proposal to furnish consultants in the field of astronomy and astrophysics to evaluate sightings would be considered. They will also attempt to make a specific recommendation as to whether or not a field investigation of a particular object or phenomenon is necessary. It is very reasonable to believe that some types of unusual objects or phenomena have been observed on occasions. Qualified sources can attest that some reports indicate the existence of some type of unusual object or phenomenon.
