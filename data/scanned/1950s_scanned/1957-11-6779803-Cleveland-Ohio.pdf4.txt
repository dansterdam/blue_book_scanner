The image does not contain any photographs, but it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes a report of sightings of unidentified objects over the Cleveland, Ohio area on November 6, 1957. The report mentions that the objects were contrail level to 32,000 feet and that searchlights from Cleveland were reportedly reflecting off the scattered clouds, causing many similar UFO reports at the time. The report is signed by 1st Lt. William J. Schreiner, an intelligence officer.
