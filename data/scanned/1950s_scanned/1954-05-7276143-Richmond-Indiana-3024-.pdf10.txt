Dear Sir:

For the past several months I have been quite interested in the matter of unidentified flying objects. I have read many reports on the subject and also have talked to a number of people who have actually seen these objects.

Sometime ago I was in the vicinity of Richmond, Indiana, and noticed a peculiar object in the sky. It appeared to be round in shape and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. It was about 1/3 the size of a full moon and was very brilliant in color, appearing to be a reddish-orange.

The object was in sight for approximately 15 to 20 seconds and then suddenly disappeared. I would very much appreciate it if you could give me any information you might have on the subject of unidentified flying objects. If there are any reports on file concerning the incident I described, I would be very interested in obtaining copies of them.

Thank you very much for your consideration of this matter.

Sincerely yours,
