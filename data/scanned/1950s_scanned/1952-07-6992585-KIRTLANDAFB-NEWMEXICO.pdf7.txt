MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE
ALABAMA

31 July 1952

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

1. At about 2310 hours, 30 July 1952, at Maxwell Control Tower I
observed an object about twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) miles west of
Maxwell. This object was about thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) thousand
feet in altitude and traveled from S3 to 77Â°. The object seemed to change
colors from white to bright red. It was in sight for approximately ten
(10) minutes.

2. I will not eliminate the possibility of this object being some
form of astrology, however, in my opinion it was not.
