The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet.

The text in the document is as follows:

A bright, opaque, round motion was noted at about 3:30 pm. The object was moving in a flat, level path, parallel to the ground, and appeared to be some 200 to 300 yards in diameter. It moved rapidly, from horizon to horizon, in about 30 seconds. The object appeared to be metallic, reflecting sunlight. No sound was heard during the observation. The object disappeared behind clouds, and did not reappear.
