At __2320__ 5 August 1952, A/3C Llody West and A/3C Walter Outowskl, 1956-1 AACS Detachment, whle crossing the ramp on their way to work at the Haneda Air Force Base eontrol tower, (35째33'N-139째5S'E), sighted an exceptionally bright light in the sky to the NE of Haneda Air Force Base. Upon reporting for duty, they brought the object to the attention of N/2C Walter Jackson and A/3G George Latassy, who had not previously noticed it because the operating load had been keeping their attention elsewhere.

a. The four operators agreed on the appearance of the object and watched it through 7 X 50 binoculars for a total period of about 50 minutes to 1 hour. The light was described as circular in shape, with brilliance appearing to be constant across the face. The light appeared to be a portion of a large round dark shape which was about four times the diameter of the light. When the object was close enough for details to be seen, a small, less-brilliant light could be seen at the lower left edge, with ewe or three more dim lights running in a curved line along the rest of lower edge of the dark shape. Only the lower portion of the darker shape could be determined, due to the lighter sky which was believed to have blended with the upper side of the object. No rotation was noticed. No sound was heard.

b. The object faded twice to the East, then returned. Observers were unable to judge whether disappearance was due to a dimming of the lights, rotation of object, or to the object moving away at terrific speed, since at times of fading, the object was difficult to follow closely, except as a small light. Observers did agree that when close, the object did appear to move horizontally, varying apparent position and speed slightly.

c. Three of the operators indicated the size of the light, when closest to the tower, was approximately the same as the small ceiling balloons (30 grams, appearing 24 inches in diameter) when launched from the weather station, located at about 2000 feet from the tower. This would make the size of the central light about 50 feet in diameter, when at the 10 miles distance tracked by GCI. At the greatest distance, the size of the light appeared slightly larger than Venus, approximately due East of Haneda and slightly brighter. A lighted weather balloon was launched at 2400 hours. The balloon's light was described as extremely dim and yellow when compared to the brilliant blue-white light of the object. Observers stated that their eyes would fatigue rapidly when they attempted to concentrate their vision on the object.

d. Shiroi GCI was contacted, (35째49'N-140째02'E), and after visual vectors were given, were able to track the object. An F-94 was in turn scrambled for an attempted intercept.

e. The control tower at [Tachikawa Air Force Base] called Haneda tower at approximately 2350/I to bring their attention to a brilliant white light over Tokyo Bay. The tower replied that it had been in view for some time and that it was being checked.

f. A C-54 entering Haneda traffic was requested to check the object. The pilot replied that it looked like a brilliant star and dismissed the sighting as such.

g. The F-94 appeared over Haneda just before the C-54 landed. After the C-54 turned North, the tower called Shiroi to direct the F-94 to turn right. No visual contact was made by the F-94.

h. The F-94 was vectored to the radar contact maintained by the Shiroi GCI. A radar contact was made by the F-94, but was lost after 90 seconds. Soon after loss of radar contact by Shiroi and the F-94, the tower lost visual contact as the object either faded, moved away, or was obstructed by clouds.
