the Press and, accordingly, when he was requested by Aurelio for permission to inter-view Lt. Rogers, the request was granted.
3. Mr. Dick Aurelio was interviewed on 1 October 1951, and his story is as follows:
At about 1400 hours 10 September 1951, he overheard a couple of airmen, rank unknown, talking about a report of an unusual object sighted by two pilots who had landed at Mitchell AFB. This conversation was overheard in a diner located at Hampstead, New York. At 1500 hours, 10 September, Aurelio called Major Eugen and sought him about a report of an unusual object carried by a jet aircraft. Aurelio was told that he had no information on a jet landing at Mitchell AFB. Aurelio was satisfied and thought there was some basis for the report he had overheard and contacted Lt. Rogers at Base Operations, Mitchell AFB. Rogers told him that he had "spoken to a Lt. Pearson at Base Operations, Mitchell AFB and Pearson was a coordinator for Project Blue Book at Mitchell AFB. Aurelio thought that he (Lt. Rogers) should notify Lt. Pearson of the incident as it was, in fact, reported by Lt. Rogers and his passenger, who was a Captain Swain. Lt. Aurelio stated that he was granted permission to interview Lt. Rogers, which was granted.
4. An initial report of investigation is being prepared by OSI Special #2, which goes forth details on this matter to the Director of Intelligence, USAF, and will be reflected in your Directives and AUC upon receipt by this office.
