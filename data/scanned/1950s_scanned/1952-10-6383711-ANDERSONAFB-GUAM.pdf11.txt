AIRCRAFT AND RELATED TECHNICAL INFORMATION
APRIL 28, 1952 - C/0 - NAVAL AIR STATION, Fillmore, California

30 October 1952

SUBJECT: AIRCRAFT OBJECTS OR PHENOMENON OBSERVED
ANDERSON AIR FORCE BASE, GUAM

1. The following report is submitted as requested. At approximately 1315 on 27 September 1952, the attention of the undersigned was directed to a strange phenomenon in the sky over Anderson Air Force Base, Guam.

2. On the evening of 29 September 1952, 1 was on duty in the control tower at Anderson Air Force Base, Guam, when my attention was directed to a strange object which appeared to be in the vicinity of the airbase at approximately 30,000 feet elevation.

3. The object appeared to be approximately four or five times the size of a B-29 or B-50 type aircraft and was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. It was observed for a period of less than 30 seconds and appeared to be traveling in a straight line at a tremendous rate of speed, and then disappeared from view.

4. It was clearly observable and appeared to be a metallic or highly reflective type of object. No lights or other identifying marks were discernible. The only sound which was noticeable was a very low frequency "hum" or vibration which could barely be detected.

5. I contacted the Radar Section locally and the Director of Operations was advised, but the object had disappeared from view before it could be tracked on the radar.

6. There was no visible means of propulsion and the speed at which the object was traveling precluded its being any known type of aircraft in our inventory. The object was observed at other times subsequent to this incident but never with the clarity as on this occasion.

7. I can't testify to the operation, and asked the director to make the determination to have the object investigated.
