and so obviously silent. I am a late night person, fond of star gazing from my back yard during the short periods of mild weather. I have a large telescope and I am very much interested in this disappearance of a direct observation. I noticed after turning on the porch light to see if it would make any difference and then this seem to say when a first silent, quick, grapy observation and very rapid movement closed in on it. This seem to say so. The drawing and disappearance behind some trees which I fell into view. The man in the next house to me was apparently looking at the light source and I at the direction of the motion by the light source. This lasted some 10 seconds to the 30 seconds and the direct movement. I am somewhat disturbed by this incident yet I feel it is an observation well worth reporting. The witness is a highly educated man of fair to wide experience in the technical field of an electronics and I believe to be an individual of good credibility when it comes to object. The apparent size of the glowing object was that of a small high compass and it moved rapidly at right angles to the direction of the movement of the object. The apparent speed was from 500 to 1,200 miles per hour. As to the color being a pale blue (pale green or white). There was no noise and only with no feeling of acceleration. The object disappeared behind some trees and was not seen again.
