There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically the 1955 Fall 6973047 Melbourne, FL case.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 10 Day MAY Year 56
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I find it difficult to associate the characteristics and some significant details furnished by this witness with a typical A.F. Captain report.

I feel that his report was influenced by the UFO program he said he watched on TV.
