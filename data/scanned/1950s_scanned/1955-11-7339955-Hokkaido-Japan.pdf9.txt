JOINT MESSAGEFORM
FROM: AFOIN-424
TO: D/I HQ USAF WASHINGTON 25 D C
INFO: AFOIN-241
Reference your message 42775 dtd 011922 Dec concerning UFOB sighting by F-86 pilot over Hokkaido, Japan. Preliminary evaluation by ATIC as follows: Probable reflection of moon through cloud layer.
Moon at that time of year was in first quarter and set sometime around midnight. The reflection of sunlight from the moon through a cloud layer would result in the cloud filtering the blue from the reflection and thus leaving a reddish-orange glow. The moon would not be visible to the observer due to its low position on the horizon and its obstruction from view by existing cloud layers.
