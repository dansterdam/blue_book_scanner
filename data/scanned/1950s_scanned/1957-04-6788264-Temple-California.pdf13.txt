Big 'Unidentified Fallen Object' Hunt in Murphy Backyard Fails
SAN GABRIEL, CAL.-(A.P).-A small boy-said to have noticed the strange object during the night on the Murphy estate-reported seeing the strange phenomenon to his parents, It proved to be a cylindrical object about 3 feet high by 1 foot in diameter. A depth of 13 feet Army demolition experts stopped digging when they encountered the concertmetal hull of a 'flying object', and then as the hole opened they discovered there was no "buried treasure" after all."It hurt nothing if it is," they said, and so the mystery remains. His father, Oscar Murphy, called the affair a disaster. They called the Department ot Army and ordnance specialists pronounced the hole an "impact crater".
"We would tell by examining the hole that it was caused by an object plunging from the skies," the Army spokesmen said.
Apparently, according to the Murphy's, the strange object rested in the ground for some time after its arrival. A house cat had been missed and the discovery of the object came about through the searching for the pet. The cat, incidentally, was found by searchers at the opposite side of the estate, unharmed.
The Army unit at nearby Fort MacArthur decided something dangerous was at hand, and they decided to dig down to find it. The Murphy yard was heaped with tons of sandy soil and crowded with soldiers, their jeeps, and trucks. Earth-moving machinery ripped up the vegetation, pausing only when the concrete shell was encountered.
For in two days of digging nothing was found except the material shell, and the promised "spaceship" or "buried treasure" was not discovered.
Three are conflicting explanations as to why the Army dug this 15-by-13-foot hole, ranging from a "flying saucer" to "a meteorite".
Lt. T. D. Smith, of Salem, Ore., who directed the digging, remarked: "And there is, say, a rocket motor gone astray-and I'm not saying there is. It is a mystery, and I candidly admit we're puzzled."
