Investigative Report 

19 February 1959

1. Description of incident:
   On 9 February 1959 at approximately 6:55 p.m., Mrs. Coburn of Virginia reported observing two luminous objects in the sky. The objects were described as being circular in shape and emitting a ray of light from their centers which extended vertically. The objects were observed for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing from view. 

2. Investigation and findings:
   Mrs. Coburn's report was investigated by an Air Force representative. No physical evidence was recovered and no corroborating witnesses were identified. The cause of the observed phenomenon could not be determined.

3. Conclusion:
   The case remains unresolved. The objects observed by Mrs. Coburn do not match any known aircraft or natural phenomena. The lack of physical evidence or additional witnesses prevents a definitive explanation from being reached.
