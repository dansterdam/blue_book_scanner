Dear Buck,

Reference your letter of 30 September, forwarding copies of your booklet on "Aid to Identification of Flying Objects". ATIC reviewed this material and felt it was a commendable effort toward solving one of our UFO headaches. However, they felt it would have been more advantageous to you if it had been reviewed by them before publication. It seems that the philosophy of the UFOB's has changed since the publication of your booklet, and we are now emphasizing certain key points, significant clues and leads to UFO identification, and other explanatory items.

We are in the process of revising AFR 200-2 in order to incorporate some of these new ideas, and to delineate responsibilities for various aspects of the UFO program.

I am sending along for your information the material prepared by ATIC regarding your booklet.
