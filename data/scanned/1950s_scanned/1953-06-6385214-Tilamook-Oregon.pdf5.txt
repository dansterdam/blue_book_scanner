1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC -- Wright-Patterson AFB
Dear Lt. Olsson:
Of the last batch of 5 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is any question is the Detroit 11 June case. I can't wrap
this up and don't see how the analysis can be made until a film is
available of this so-called Detroit 11 June incident. Can you tell me
for us?
Regarding the Detroit 11 June case, there is nothing in this that
indicates a good landing sight would be confirmed. An an analysis
indicates that the object was reflecting from a probable clear weather
mirage, with faulty radar. I assume that the GGI had radar available.
And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and
unequivocally Venus.
Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up
questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.
Anything new on:
5 March
Shaw AFB
17 Feb.
Fort Austin -- film?
28 March
San Antonio
12 April
Stead AFB
I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's comments to see if any more business-like manner of handling these cases can be developed. I hope that through your successor measures can be appointed.
Cordially,
Allen Hynek
