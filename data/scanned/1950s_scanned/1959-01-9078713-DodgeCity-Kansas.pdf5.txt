HANPTON, KANSAS

Dear Sir,

In order to satisfy my engineering curiosity I wish to report a sighting I made a few nights ago. My friend and I were driving back to our home in Kansas. We had just left an area known as Battle Hills near Syracuse, Kansas. As we were driving back, at approximately 7 p.m, a bright object appeared in the sky. At first we thought it was an aircraft. However, upon closer observation, the object appeared to rotate and emit multicolored lights in a pulsating manner. It moved at a tremendous speed and quickly changed direction, far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. Because we could not estimate the height, the object seemed so bright that it blinded us and emitted a strange humming sound. The object seemed to glide motionless for several minutes, and then suddenly disappeared. Will you please let me know if you have any explanation for this sighting? I would appreciate your analysis of this strange occurrence. I believe it may be something which warrants further investigation. I would be glad to provide any additional details that could aid in your analysis.

Respectfully,
