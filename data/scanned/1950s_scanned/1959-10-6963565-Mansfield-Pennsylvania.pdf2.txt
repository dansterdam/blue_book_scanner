Dear sirs:

On Sunday, October 25, 1959, and at 6:38 P.M. E.S.T., I observed from a hill outside Mansfield, Pennsylvania, a long white streak in the sky. It began in the S.E.W. and traveled west to the horizon, taking about ten seconds. Two minutes later, at 6:40 P.M., a green glow appeared almost due south. This had an erratic bounding motion at first, then settled down to a steady glow - still with a greenish tint, and also traveling west. This second glow was visible for about four seconds, and seemed to burn out before it met the horizon.

I am sorry I am so late to inquire,( I lost the paper I jotted the information on, and just found it again), but would you or anyone else be able to explain what this could have been?

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely yours,
