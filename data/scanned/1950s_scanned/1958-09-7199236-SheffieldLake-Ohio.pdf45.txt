Monday Eve.-

Dear Mrs. -----,

I have written up your story for this weeks paper, and if I do not find that you have sent for a subscription will send you a clipping. Because you asked me to let you know if they printed and they have asked me to make no noise but now and then they do, so it is quite important. ALSO I'm wondering whether the Air Force or anyone will get to you and suggest you do not give out your story. This happens, and I'll surely appreciate it if you will keep me informed. If do wish we had time for me to go into the matter more fully, but I find that generally no one believes you anyway, so it's almost useless.

Am almost tempted to drive up to see you as yours is one of the best sightings. Do let me hear from you on any points you have forgotten to mention, no matter how slight. Sometimes they have more importance than you think.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
