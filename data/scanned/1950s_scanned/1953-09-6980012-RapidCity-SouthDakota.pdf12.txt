SUMMARY: (Enter unknown information in each numbered paragraph. List indicators at lower left. Details of report on AF Form 112 Part III)

An unidentified object was sighted at approximately 1945 MST and again at 2300 by Miss [REDACTED] and Mr. & Mrs. [REDACTED] all of Black Hawk, South Dakota. Miss [REDACTED] noticed the object when she happened to glance toward the sky and saw this red glow which was traveling back and forth from north to south. The object did this for quite some time and then disappeared behind a hill. This object gave off a red glow and then changed to a whitish yellow glow. The time of this was approximately 1945. Mr. & Mrs. [REDACTED] noticed this object at the time and reported the same as Miss [REDACTED]. They then went to a drive-in movie and saw the object again. They said it seemed to hover over the screen and then changed to a brilliant white. After a few minutes, it suddenly disappeared.

On 5 August 1953, an unidentified object report was submitted to this organization from The Rapid City Filter Center and it stated that these people had seen the object. Either these people have seen something or it is merely a figment of their imagination due to the long hours they spend on the GOC post in Black Hawk.
