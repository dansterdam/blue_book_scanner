REPORT OF "UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA"

At 20:25 a woman called to report the sighting of "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena". Advised her that while she did not have to identify herself, it would be helpful if she would do so, she gave her name as "Mrs. ___, Dayton".

She stated that at approximately 19:00 she heard her son, who was playing in the yard, call telling her to come look at something in the air. She went in the yard. Her brother-in-law also came out going something. At first she saw nothing, but then in the southeast she saw "disc shaped" objects. Objects were out in the open, moving slowly on a rather flat basis. After a brief period of time they disappeared over the trees.

As something over an hour had passed since observing objects, due to trying to decide whether to report them, then trying to find out how to report them her information was inexact, she had great difficulty trying to describe objects as to size, distance, and number.

It was still daylight at the time of sighting, yet they saw the objects. Asked if any familiar fixed objects were within her field of vision at the time which would give comparison, she could not specify any.

Feeling that further questioning on my part gave promise of little return, I terminated conversation. Then checked the phone book to see if anyone by the name of the woman was listed. I called the number listed and verified the fact that the woman at this residence had in fact been the person who called.
