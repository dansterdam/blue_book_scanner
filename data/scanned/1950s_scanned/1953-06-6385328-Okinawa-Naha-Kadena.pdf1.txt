11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Case appears to be one of radar tracking of an aircraft, causing optical illusion. The object was observed to be very fast, moving at approximately 1300 MPH, with estimated size of one foot in length. The radar contact made the object appear larger than it actually was. The conclusion is that this was probably a very fast aircraft, causing an optical illusion.
