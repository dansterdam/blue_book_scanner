FROM: (Name/Address) Lt. Looen Atae 
Duluth, Minnesota  
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting near Duluth, Minnesota on 22 Dec 58
I. SOURCE: 1/Lt James R. Ryans, A/C 17455331, USAF
Address: 75dth ACAW Squadron, K.I. SAC (ATC 4545), Minnesota  
Date: 29 Dec 58
Occupation: Intercept Control Technician (ICT) at K-63 radar site
Education: High school graduate - radar operator's course, Keesler AFB
II. SYNOPSIS: On the night of 12 March 1959 (2300) subject sighted an unidentified aerial object from his radar site near Duluth, Minnesota. The object was tracked on radar and visually observed for approximately 15 minutes. It displayed characteristics of an aircraft, but was unable to give complete data on its speed, altitude and direction of flight due to interruption of radar contact. The object subsequently disappeared from radar.
III. DETAILS: On 12 March 1959 at approximately 2330 hours, Lt. James R. Ryans, A/C 17455331, of the 756th ACAW Squadron, K.I. LAND (GCI 4555), Minnesota, was on duty as an Intercept Control Technician (ICT) at the K-63 radar site. While performing his normal duties, he observed on the radar scope an unidentified object traveling at an estimated speed of 1100-1500 knots at an altitude of approximately 38,000 feet. The object was observed on radar for about 15 minutes and was also visually observed during this period. It was described as glowing white in color, about the size of a large aircraft, and traveling in a straight and level course. During the time it was tracked by radar, the object made several abrupt turns and altitude changes, which were noted on the radar screen. Although the object displayed characteristics similar to those of a jet aircraft, Lt. Ryans was unable to obtain positive identification or give complete data on its speed, altitude, and direction of flight due to interruption of radar contact. The object subsequently disappeared from radar.
Lt. Ryans stated that the object was definitely not a meteor, balloon, or any other known type of aircraft. He had several years of experience as a radar operator and was thoroughly familiar with the normal indications of various types of aircraft on the radar scope. He is convinced that the object observed was of an unidentified nature.
