38. IN YOUR OPINION WHAT DO YOU THINK THE OBJECT WAS AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED IT?
It could have been a balloon. BUT IT DID NOT SINK with wind currents and its speed was fantastic. Went from 12 o'clock high to the horizon in less time than it takes to read this. The T-33's flying around to the east gave a good comparison. This object was obviously three times as fast.
