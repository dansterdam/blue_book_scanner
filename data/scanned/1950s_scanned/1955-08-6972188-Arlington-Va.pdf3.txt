III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On the night of 3 Jul 55, 10:45 PM, EDT, my friend (Rev. - Deleted) and I were standing near the south side of my house, facing to the south. Suddenly a light appeared traveling from the east to the west. At first it appeared to be a bright star but it soon exceeded the brightness of any star I have ever seen. It traveled in a straight line and disappeared in about ten seconds. It turned east and disappeared in about ten seconds more. The whole observation lasted about fifteen seconds. It turned east and disappeared again. Subsequently we saw it again. This time again it appeared in the east and disappeared in the west. This course the other did not repeat. The other object seemed to be moving much slower and had a steady light. When it did so it continued on its regular course. While it was standing still, it looked like one of the stars. When the motion started, the light seemed to increase. Above it was a 'saucer-shaped' object; since they didn't appear to lose latitude as they moved along as objects ordinarily do, I think it was due to reflection from the sun.
