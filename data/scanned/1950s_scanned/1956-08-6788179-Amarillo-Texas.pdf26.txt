FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH OF AUGUST 1953:

For the most part, information concerning UFO reports is available to the public, but due to required classification, some are not. It is the Air Force opinion that the basic answer is contained in the question itself. These sightings are intelligence reports, and as such, in certain instances contain other information apart from the UFO portion which may require classification.

Mr. Air Force is open minded on the subject of space travel, and aware that space visitors are a possibility. The present Air Force position is not to deny this possibility, but waiting to state that to date no evidence has been discovered to substantiate that UFO's are interplanetary or interstellar space ships.

1. No lunar exploration, telescopic or space probes, has revealed any additional information concerning UFO's.
