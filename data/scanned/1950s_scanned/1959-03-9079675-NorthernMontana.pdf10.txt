The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

SUBJECT: Request for Evaluation 
TO: AFOIN-H84
FROM: AFOILN-231

The text in the document states:
"Subject UFO appears to have attributes of a normal aircraft both in speed and maneuverability. Other than being in a horizontal position, it would indicate no other type of airborne vehicle such as a balloon. Neither does the information indicate any electronic propulsion, weather phenomena or celestial bodies from this standpoint."

The document is signed by "GEORGE C. MORGAN, Colonel, USAF, AFOLN-231".
