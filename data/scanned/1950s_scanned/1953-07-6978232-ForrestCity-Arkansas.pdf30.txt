On the day of July 10, 1953, an object drew my attention shortly after sunrise. It appeared to be at an altitude of about 8 miles. The object was rounded in shape and was of a metallic or glazed finish. It did not appear to have any means of propulsion. The object remained stationary for about 3 or 4 minutes and then started moving in a southeasterly direction at a very high rate of speed, disappearing in about 30 seconds. The weather conditions were clear at the time, and I was unable to hear any sound from the object. It was a very impressive sight, and I wish I could have had a better look at what it might have been.
