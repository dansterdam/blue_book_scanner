We were heading south on Military Trail about one quarter of a mile south of Loxahatchee Road when we saw a big glare of white light and then it went out. We stopped the car and got out to come back to the car and we started south again.
We had gone about a half mile further south when we looked back and saw six red lights where we had seen the white light. We turned around again and headed north. Then the two lights that had gone into the woods showed up again. We stopped the car and seemed with a magnet and the two lights went back into the woods. It seemed to me like some flame throwing device or something that I looked like Roman Candles except there was no noise and no sparks falling from it. It was shooting flame or something that I looked like Roman Candles almost silently for a few seconds every minute or so. We waited a few minutes and then we drove on down to the nearest house and called the highway patrol.
