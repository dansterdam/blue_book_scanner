I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE ITS SIZE, BECAUSE AT THE TIME I DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLOON IN SIGHT FOR A COMPARISON.
"SHORTLY AFTER THIS WE SAW ANOTHER ONE, BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T HANG AROUND. IT APPROACHED FROM THE WEST AND DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST, NEITHER ONE LEAVING ANY TRACE OF VAPOR TRAIL."
"THEN I SAW THE SECOND ONE I CALLED OUR TRACING STATION AT THE U.OF M. AIRPORT AND THE OBSERVERS THERE ON THE THEODOLITE MANAGED TO GET GLIMPSES OF A NUMBER OF THEM, BUT COULDN'T KEEP THE THEODOLITE GOING FAST ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM IN THE FIELD OF THEIR INSTRUMENTS." BOTH DOUG SMITH AND DICK DORIAN CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF THESE OBJECTS IN THE THEODOLITE AFTER I NOTIFIED THEM OF THEIR PRESENCE BY RADIO.
