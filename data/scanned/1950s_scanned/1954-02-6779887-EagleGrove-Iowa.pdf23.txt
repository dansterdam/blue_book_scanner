AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
SUMMARY: (Give details of object and circumstances e.g. time, location, description, movement, behavior, etc. If appropriate, indicate reliability of source and evaluate report.)

On 7 April 1954, an unidentified object was reported through the Des Moines Filter Center to be 21/2 miles South West of Eagle Grove, Iowa. The sighting took place between 5:08 PM and 5:35 PM, Central Standard Time. The object was observed by one (1) source.

The object was reported to be moving slowly in the sky at an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 feet altitude. It was described as a bright light, flashing and changing color from white through various shades. Object appeared to be circling and covered a considerable area during the observation.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: The reliability of the source can be considered RELIABLE, since the officer employed was a WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPHER, 12-17 years' service, starting in December 1933. Object has appeared in the NORTHEAST for the last four years and has been observed in the NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, and CENTER of IOWA except one (1) time when it was observed in the NORTHEAST on 7 April 1954. SOURCES have reported only three (3) of the sightings to the Air Force authorities. Each time the sightings lasted approximately 25 minutes and the object disappeared into the sky.
