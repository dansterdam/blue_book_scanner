This image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this image. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Then the background of this and mountains a lighter and more orange. 

This is about all the information I can give on this. I repeat this is not a "hot" or false case, but an account. Remember, there was no motion, no another vapor trail, so the object seemed to come and go without any apparent activity, although we are not certain at all why they should thus suddenly appear or disappear or to make such flight as this - if it was not a hoax or misidentification. It is not clear at all what this means, but we are the puzzled and cannot offer any explanation, so please record this for whatever it may be worth.

Sincerely yours,

WITNESSES:
