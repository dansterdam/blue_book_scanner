At approximately 11:55 p.m. on March 13, 1956, a circular, silent, self-luminous object was observed by the witness. The object appeared to be stationary at first, then accelerated and proceeded to make a steep upward climb and disappear. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes.

The witness is a retired U.S.P.O. employee from Paris, Illinois, and has excellent eyesight and hearing. He had no explanation for the object he observed, and stated that it was unlike anything he had ever seen before. He reported the incident to the local police, and they in turn reported it to the proper Air Force authorities.
