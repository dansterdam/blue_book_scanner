At approximately 2100I, 25 Feb 53, an unidentified airborne object was reported seen by several members of an ACAW Squadron. The object changed colors from red to pink-orange and then to white. Sighted by several members of the detachment. The object appeared to move slowly toward the horizon then abruptly disappeared. Azimuth and elevation readings at 2155 hours on the 25th was 285 degrees from true north and 18 degrees 12 minutes above horizontal.
