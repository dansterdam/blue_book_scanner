SUBJECT: (S) Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program
TO: Lt Col Bernard A. Schriever  
ATN: Research & Development Division
USAF Headquarters Washington 25, D.C.
1. The Air Force Regulation SR 200-2, "Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO)," dated 14 September 1959, requires the investigation and analysis of "unidentified flying objects" and establishes procedures to be followed in the conduct of such investigations.
2. In compliance with the requirements of this regulation, it has been decided to intensify the program directed toward determining the scientific, technical, and operational characteristics of these reported objects. To accomplish this, it has been necessary to determine the extent of any threat to national security which these reported objects may represent.
3. It is my opinion that any future value to the Air Force lies in the possible scientific or technical characteristics of these objects. I therefore recommend that action be taken to transfer the aerial phenomena program which now involves ATIC, ASD, AFOIN, AFCIN to the Research and Development Command.
