9,000 to 10,000 knots. Assuming the observer's time estimate to be accurate, the object was obviously moving even faster. As the observer's line of sight (the angle between) moved from 50 degrees to this direction, the further removed from 50 degrees to this direction became the object's path, and an equal angle must have subtended even this path.
