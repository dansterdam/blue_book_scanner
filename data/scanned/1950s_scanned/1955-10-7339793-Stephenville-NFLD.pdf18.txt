And describing the incident: On the evening of 9/8/54, at approximately 7:50 P.M., I was doing some yardwork at my home in Stephenville, Newfoundland. As I was working, I noticed a bright light in the sky, moving in a southerly direction. It was a very clear night, and the light seemed to be quite a distance away. At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but it was moving much faster than any airplane I had ever seen. The light seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed, and it had no blinking lights or other identifying features of an aircraft. I continued to watch it for several minutes as it moved across the sky. It seemed to be gliding rather than powered flight, and it made no sound that I could hear. I've never seen anything like it before. After observing it for a few minutes, it simply disappeared from view. I have no idea what it was, but it certainly did not appear to be any type of conventional aircraft.
