SUBJECT'S STATEMENT
"I was on GOC watch from 12:30 to 4:30 AM on Oct 1, 1955 here at Soledad, California. At 1:17 AM I noticed a bright object in the sky to the south, approximately 15 degrees altitude. It was observed for about 2 minutes, then it disappeared. At 1:45 AM it was observed again, it came back to the same position and then moved in a straight line to the east, all the time. We went off watch at 4:30 AM and the object was at 1:00 o'clock high 30 of the post."
