"Brigadier General Harold E. Watson 
Commander, Air Force Intelligence Center 
Dayton, Ohio

Dear General Watson:

On Thursday, May 9, 1957, The Los Angeles Times reported the following:

'AIR FORCE STUDIES PHOTOS --- Cameras Track Flying Object'

'Cameramen Studies of an unidentified flying object photographs were analyzed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base yesterday.

'Spokesmen at the secret report test center north of Los Angeles said the object was spotted by cameramen.'

'They tracked the object and took pictures with the cameras and information were dispatched immediately to the intelligence center.'

'It caught the morning sun and that it moved but not at any tremendous speed, the witnesses said. The object appeared round, that was spotted by more than one camera crew.'

'Edwards officers would not hazard a guess as to what the object was, although one said it could have been a weather balloon.'

'This desert air does crazy things,' he said."

A request is hereby made for prints from the negative film on this incident, to be distributed by USAF to the technical and scientific community as fully as possible. If this is not feasible on a short-term basis, or through the local USAF, the writer would appreciate a copy of the photo-analysis report and any other material that might be available on this incident, in cooperation between the Air Force and civilian interested parties. Such an exchange would be in the public interest.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
