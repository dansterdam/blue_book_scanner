The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved line and an object or shape drawn above it. The smaller sketch on the right shows a road or path leading towards a distant horizon and mountain range.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where it was in a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
