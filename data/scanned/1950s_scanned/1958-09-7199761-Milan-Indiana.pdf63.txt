Drove looking around the sky. Could see several formations; the one that I watched for about 2-3 minutes was disc shaped, appeared to be hovering, and moved rather slowly. Its path was erratic, up and down, and side to side. It would pause, then move on a little and pause again. It travelled in my sight about 4-500 yards and then went behind some trees. It gave a brilliant orange light. I timed it for about 45 minutes.
