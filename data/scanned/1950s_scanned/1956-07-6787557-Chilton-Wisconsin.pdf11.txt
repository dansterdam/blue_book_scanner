Case 177, Cadillac, Mich., July 28, 1956—"A brilliant white light” was reported in the sky by tourists and police, but air force radar and interceptors could find nothing. According to the Detroit Free Press, the first report on the object was made by Willard Wood at 3:30 a.m. “At first I thought it was a plane so I stopped my car and got out hoping to hear the motors—but I didn’t hear anything,” said Wood. He said the light looked like a clear glass light bulb. He then went to the Cadillac Police station and reported it. Two officers, John Langley and Merrill Taylor, were sent out to look. Langley said the object approached and withdrew several times and as night faded and stars disappeared, it seemed to grow brighter. “Suddenly it faded right out in the matter of a few minutes,” Langley said. Taylor said there was no doubt in his mind that it was not a star. Wood said that he saw occasional red flashes in the intense white light. He said the light appeared as close as 300 feet from the ground. The object was also seen near Bad Axe, Mich., according to the port Huron Times-Herald. Three Detroit men driving into the “Thumb” area stopped at the State Police post and. reported a “brilliant” object to Trooper Calvin Gissendaner. Said Gissendaner, “When I looked at it with the men, it was shining steadily although they told me that the light was on and off as they drove from Marlette to Bad Axe."
