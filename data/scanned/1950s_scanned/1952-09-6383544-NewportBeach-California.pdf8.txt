SEP - 7 1955
This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you claimed you observed.
Since this matter is still under investigation, it is not possible for us to compare your report with other reports from the California area during that period.
The books by Donald Keyhoe are considered to be science fiction by the Air Force UFO project. I hope this information will be of interest to you.
Sincerely,
JOHN E. BAILLIEUL
