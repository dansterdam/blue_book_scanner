RESEARCH ON Unidentified Flying Objects
By Lillian Crowner Deguln
Bob Adkins of WTYN radio is responsible for bringing this item to the attention of the press. In his Monday morning newscast he mentioned it. This was in the Sheffield Lake, Ohio, Herald of Sheffield Lake, Ohio.
Feeling that this event deserves wide-spread discussion, I put in a long distance call to get further details.
A follow-up shows that there is a house here that is certainly the scene of development where there are unusual things going on. There is an elderly couple living in this modest bungalow-type home. She had gone to bed, and he was still up watching television.
Suddenly the drapes blew apart with such intensity that she was forced to get up and close the windows. When the light returned to normal, they saw the large light beam in her pillow. The light faded out and than flashed on again. Mrs. Fitzgerald knew something unusual was happening.
Not being much good on guessing, she did not know what to give this strange light name. How powerful it was can be judged from the fact that it lit up her bedroom about eight feet in diameter and three feet through.

Mrs. Fitzgerald said the light was sufficient to show off.
