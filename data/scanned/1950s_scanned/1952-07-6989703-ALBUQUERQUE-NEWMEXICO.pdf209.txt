There is no photograph present in the image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

CASE #8 (contd)  
RADAR equipment and sightings of Opalla, but this is stretching probabilities too far.  
A balloon can be discarded since the speeds are too high for even a jet stream.  
Ground control inquiries were noted above 10,000'.

Conclusion:  
Unknown

1956 Comments
The "lock on" is not considered to be significant since it lasted for only 30 seconds.  
Permit contact lasted for 20 minutes; therefore, the speed of the target was not greatly in excess of that of the pursuing aircraft.  
There is no radar description to make a very vivid picture of this type of aircraft.
