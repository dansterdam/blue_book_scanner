This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a military document, specifically a "JOINT MESSAGEFORM" used for communications. The text in the document discusses an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation, providing details about its characteristics and movement. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

JOINT MESSAGEFORM
FROM: (Originator) SPACE ABOVE FOR COMMUNICATIONS CENTER ONLY
DATE/TIME GROUP: 6 JUL 52
SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED
TO: ATTACHE AIR AFA JIF SO JA
INFO: ... we had no out of sight of identification except that the sky was clear with clouds and visibility was good. This OVNI flew rapidly at high altitude, straight and level, and crossed our sky from the west to the east in about 10 minutes. It was observed by two officers and one airman at NOUASSEUR AFB, MOROCCO. One of the officers tracked it on radar at a speed estimated at 750 mph and an altitude estimated at 35,000 feet. This OVNI appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape and was observed to be shiny or luminous. There were no sound or trail visible. The radar plot shows a straight course with no change in speed or altitude during the observation period. From previous reports, this seems to be one of the many similar type objects reported by observers at various locations. As a matter of interest, the officer tracking this OVNI on radar stated that the time of observation coincided with the overflying of the base by a scheduled USAF B-36 aircraft, but the radar target did not correspond in any way to the B-36 either in speed, altitude or course.
