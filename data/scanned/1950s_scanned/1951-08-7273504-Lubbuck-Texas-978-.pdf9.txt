The image provided appears to be a black and white photograph, likely a scanned document from Project Blue Book, as mentioned in the context. The photograph shows a dark, starry sky with some faint markings or scratches on the image. There is no clear depiction of a UFO or any other identifiable objects in the image.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text found in the document, as requested.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

Lubbuck, Texas,
