The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter on letterhead from the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, United States Air Force, to an unnamed recipient. The letter discusses sending a picture for evaluation, and the author suggests that it might be something interesting to look into further. The letter is dated April 5, 1960 and is signed at the bottom, with the signature redacted.

Here is the full text of the document:

Panhandle, Ill.
April 5, 1960

Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

It was suggested to send this picture to you for evaluation. If you find it to be nothing at all don't think I'm nuts because I am not, it's just that I'm curious to find out what it is.

I think it might be something I will look for the negative. However, I'll be in touch please return the picture.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]
