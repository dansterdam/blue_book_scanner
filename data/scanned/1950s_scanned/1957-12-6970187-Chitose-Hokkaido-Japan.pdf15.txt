SUBJECT: Report of Sighting and Attempted Interest of UFO
1. Approximately 0930 16 December 1957, I left the mess hall to return to my BOQ. When passing the NCO barracks Sgt. Pinkerson asked if I had seen the object. I went to the window and noticed what at first glance seemed to be a very bright light directly to the west and slightly north. It was round and appeared to be hovering. I immediately turned on the instrument beacon and notified the operations officers. We watched the object for thirty (30) seconds then called operations hill and requested that the sighting be reported. The senior director has informed me that they were painting the object on the radar. It was separately so registered.
3. I very definitely feel that the object I saw visually was not a star or planet. This being very brilliant and seemed to fluctuate small orange or red pinpoints of light from underneath.
4. Shortly after the contact lost by our radar equipment it was determined the radar did become inoperative due to a bad crystal. This could have caused the observed disappearance of the object.
