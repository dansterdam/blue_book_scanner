1. During the past several weeks a large number of unidentified aerial objects were observed and reported in the Thomaston, Connecticut area. These observations were made by various reliable civilian and military personnel, and were reported to the Commanding General, EADF, for evaluation.

2. Two (2) aircraft of the Connecticut Air National Guard, while on routine flight training, observed a metallic, disc-shaped object under visual contact on 19 July 1952. The pilots stated that the object appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter, and was hovering at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10 minutes, and then accelerated at a terrific speed and disappeared from view.
