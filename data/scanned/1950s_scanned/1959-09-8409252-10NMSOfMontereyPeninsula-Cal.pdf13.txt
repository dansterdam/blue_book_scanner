On 1 September 1959 at approximately 2015 hours (0315Z 2 Sept. â€™59) Maj. John W. Sherwood, Jr., USAF AT Stanford and 1st Lt. Roy C. Gill, Hq Sq. Sacramento Air Material Area (SAMARS) were over the Monterey Peninsula at 30,000 feet in T-33 #53-4973 out of McClellan AFB where both pilots are attached for flying. A light was observed in the eastern horizon which they believed to be another aircraft after it was ascertained that it was moving. They were on a northerly heading and as the light approached it was observed to be above and slightly to the south of the T-33. The pilots turned to the east to keep the light under observation as it bobbed to the south of their position. The light was about the intensity of an aircraft landing light and as the PB was observed to be trailing 3 or more very faint bluish-green squares. The T-33 continued its turn to get behind the object but was unable to due to its high rate of speed and estimated altitude of 40-50,000 feet. The object went out over the Pacific where the light extinguished for about 10 seconds, came back on for a few seconds, then disappeared and was not seen again. The object was under surveillance for 3 to 5 minutes as it passed from east to west.

On 1 September 1959 at 2015 PDT two pilots in a T-33 over the Monterey Peninsula, California at 30,000 feet observed a single source of white light about the intensity of a landing light fly a course from east to west at a very high rate of speed and at an altitude of 40-50, 000 feet and disappear just off the coast over the Pacific Ocean.
