I left St. Louis Lambert Field at dusk January 5 with my passenger, Louis Lambkin. We climbed VFR to 5000 and flew SW. We were using Omni Range stations. At a speed about 160-175 MPH abeam Terre Haute, Terre Haute, Tom (can't explain) called this object below us in flying saucers? I'd passed it off and didn't even listen. This time I saw a very bright intermittent light that at first appeared to be a jet. But the light just seemed to stop and then start again like a jet but stationary. First reaction was that another aircraft was passing us very close above us, nearly lighting. Seconds later it was gone. Nothing to judge by - no horizon. We were at West Cook Airport. It was called Indianapolis radio and asked what that light might have been. Over Chicago called me and said "Glad you asked what that light was, I'm over Chicago and I saw it just like you described and it just disappeared." It seems the object was in the air because we had to be on the ground, at least 24,000 feet altitude, to see it.
