I, J. L. THOMPSON, STATES: 

On July 11, 1952, at approximately 9:15 P.M., I was outside of my home located at 1 2215 Olive St., Las Vegas, Nevada, looking up at the clear sky. I observed a bright light, silver in color, traveling at a fast rate of speed in a straight line from north to south. The light was much larger than any star I have ever seen and its brightness was much greater than any aircraft light. It was visible for about 10 seconds.

The light appeared to be oval in shape and was approximately the size of a ping-pong ball held at arm's length. It did not blink or waver in its course but kept a straight line of flight. I was startled by this unusual sight and called to my wife, who also observed the light as it passed across the sky. We were both amazed by the speed and brilliance of the object.

As the light passed, it diminished in size and brightness until it disappeared from view. The sighting lasted for approximately 10 seconds. I have never seen anything like this before and I am unable to account for what I observed. It did not have the characteristics of any known aircraft.
