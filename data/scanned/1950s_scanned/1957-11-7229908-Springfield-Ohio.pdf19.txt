Two Springfield Policemen See Mysterious Light

Reports a a mysterious blue high speed object disappearing in the Ohio sky tonight. While on routine patrol at 4:55 A.M. Patrolmen Walter Ginn and Lester Dix saw the object speed by at the same time. 

According to the officers, "It was a blue light and it was traveling very fast." They estimated the light's speed at 600 to 700 miles an hour. 

The light was first seen by the officers in the east and was traveling in a westerly direction. It disappeared within a matter of seconds about 4:58 a.m. And as suddenly as it appeared, it vanished.

Patrolmen Ginn and Dix said that the light flash seemed to illuminate the whole sky. They could not determine the object's size but said "It was amazing that we could see it so clearly in the sky during the past week."

The patrol car's radio squelched and a buzzing sound was heard during the sighting. The object's speed and the direction of its travel led the officers to believe it was not any conventional aircraft. An investigation of the sighting has been ordered by the Air Technical Intelligence Service.
