6. Extracted from Fifth Air Force "Perintrop", 19 May 1952:

A balloon sighting: At 0900D-1, vicinity of CT 0035, an F-80 crew observed a balloon approximately 30 inches in diameter. Counter-measures were observed by beacon and radar and the F-80 was directed to close on the balloon to 20,000 feet. Estimated rate of climb of balloon was 2000 FT/MIN. At 20,000 feet the balloon was shot down over target area. The balloon was shot down over target area. The balloon was shot down at 12000 feet. Again by means of a steady burning light suspended from the balloon, it came down at CT 1010. The white light, described as "very powerful," was still burning at the time it hit the ground.

COMMENT: This report of lighted balloons may be a basis of explanation for many of the sightings reported over this area of Korea.
