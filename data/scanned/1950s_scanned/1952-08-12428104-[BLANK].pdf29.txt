There does not appear to be any photograph or image in the provided document. The document appears to be text describing a UFO sighting and investigation as part of Project Blue Book.

The officer plotted the location of his balloon during the last part of its flight. The bearing of this plot from Benson Airfield was the same as the bearing the pilot instructors had reported. The angle of elevation was within 10 degrees of that estimated by the observers.

The UAO was marked down to reflection of the sun from Rawlinson's balloon flying several miles away from the observers. Intelligence officers can quickly see, from this story of the UAO sighting at Benson, the value of requested information (see inside front cover). In some instances, for example, a balloon-launching station might lose contact with a balloon. If the reporting officer includes winds aloft as high as they are recorded, it speeds up the investigation. The possibility of the UAO being identified as an aircraft is dependent on the data in the wire from the reporting officer. It is difficult to obtain data on a straight flight in the case of the sighting several days after a report is made. The "fix" on an object at the beginning and end of its flight is among the data that the astronomer uses.

A report of an unidentified radar return is handled as a special case. All such sightings are referred to the electronics branch of ATIC. The officers at ATIC look forward to receiving radar scope pictures with reports of radar sightings. A special electronics questionnaire is in the mill.

Some are not so easy. The sighting at Benson was comparatively easy to solve. Others are not. The now-famous case of the Lubbock Lights* was investigated for weeks.
