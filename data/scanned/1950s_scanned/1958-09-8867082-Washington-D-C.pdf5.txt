FTD (TDEM)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433
9 MARCH 1965

Washington, D.C.

Dear Miss ____,

The sighting which you reported in the Air Force as an object observed in the air does not constitute sufficient evidence of a bona fide unidentified flying object consistent with an aircraft. The duration of flight and the circumstances of the sighting do not indicate a definitive observation.

Without an exact time and date we cannot rule out an observation of the Sputnik satellite. However, the data presented is more in accord with an observation of a high flying aircraft. Also, the spacing of time precludes an unambiguous identification of a specific aircraft flight.

Sincerely,

VICTOR J. QUINTANILLA, JR.
Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
