The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, likely describing a sighting of the planet Venus.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Those orbits are smaller than that of earth have phases the same as the moon. To the naked eye Venus appears as a very bright star. -4.3 magnitude at brightest. It is brightest, but with a 20 percent less than its actual size would be apparent. On the date of this sighting only ~350 of the surface of Venus was seen from the earth was illuminated.

On the day and at the time of this sighting Venus was in the exact position of the object of this sighting from the horizon to the WSW after approximately twenty minutes.

It is not unusual for persons viewing the interior planets for the first time through an optical aid to be struck by the fact that it appears as a small moon, phases and all. Our every day experiences have left us with the impression that Venus is a life and originates its own light rather than reflecting sunlight the same as the moon.

There is no reason to believe that the object of this sighting was anything other than the planet Venus.
