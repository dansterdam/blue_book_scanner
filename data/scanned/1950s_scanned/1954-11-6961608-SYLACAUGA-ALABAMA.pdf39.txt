8 December 1954

On 7 December 1954, ATAI-5 was visited by Dr. Taylor and Mr. Castillo from the G & N Laboratory, WADC. They visually examined the meteoritic and agreed with Dr. Robinson's original evaluation. Mr. Castillo stated he has been monitoring effects of ionization on HF radio signals through an oscilloscope for the past two years. He has been especially interested in the returns he has been receiving from meteorite trails. He continued that during the month of November, 1954, there had been a mark increase in the meteorite activity. The attached photograph is one that he obtained on the night of 21 Oct 1954 which vividly depicts a fair size return of a meteorite trail. Mr. Castillo operates a station VHF in Springfield, Ohio. He continues that during the week of the Athina incident, he received unusual amounts of meteorite returns on his graph.

One set of the meteorite photographs were given to Dr. Taylor upon his request.
