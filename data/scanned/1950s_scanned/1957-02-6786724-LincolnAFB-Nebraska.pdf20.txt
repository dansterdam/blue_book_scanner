III. RELIABILITY: Source was sincere and eager to help. His ability to describe the sighting was considered outstanding, considering the length of time elapsed at the time.

IV. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 13 Feb 57 at 0315 CST, Source was a B-47 aircraft in the CCA pattern preparing for a landing at Lincoln AFB, Nebraska. The control tower operator advised Source to continue outbound from the field, as there was a known commercial air liner in the area. Source continued outbound and was at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet when he observed an object about five-to-six miles to the east of his position, traveling twice as fast as the commercial airliner he had been advised about. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball (approximately) and Source witnessed it moving twice as fast as the commercial airliner. Source continued to observe the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. At the time there were some scattered clouds in the sky and visibility was good. Objects were interrogated on three passes of IFF with no response. Source stated he could not identify the shape of the object, however, the blip on his scope was about the size of a 100 degree blip. The single object observed was last seen at approximately 0320 CST when it disappeared from his scope.
