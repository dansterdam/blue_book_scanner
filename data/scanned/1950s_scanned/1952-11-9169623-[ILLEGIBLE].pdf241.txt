This image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document. There is no photograph present on this particular page. The text on the page is handwritten, and it appears to be a continuation of some previous comments or observations.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the full text from the document:

At first it appeared to the witness a rather briskly moving object, irregularly round and moving at high speed, which apparently changed position and shape as it moved. This change in position and shape, and shape, and direction of movement, was so rapid that the witness could not say definitely whether it was one object or a group of small objects. The witness is an elderly and very intelligent person, sure in his judgment, and his observation was not influenced by imagination or any other external factor. He feels it was an extremely unusual phenomenon, quite different from any aircraft or natural celestial body. It was observed for 4 or 5 minutes and was of great interest and excitement to the witness. He was impressed also by the complete and mysterious silence of the phenomenon. He viewed it as a craft or crafts of unearthly origin.
