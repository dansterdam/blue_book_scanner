INFO:
FROM: CAPT RUPPELT FOR 00J/I
REFERENCE telephone call from Maj Sedowick to Capt Ruppelt on 22 Dec 52. Proposed tour to brief your forces and divisions has been postponed and is tentatively scheduled for late January or early February. Postponement was necessary due to time being taken up by meetings with and preparing data for CIA. CIA has made survey of some of the sightings in the ATIC file and has arranged for a panel of several top U.S. scientists to review them. Although plans are not completely firm, this meeting is tentatively scheduled to take place in early January. CIA's interest is from standpoint of reports similar to present reports of unidentified flying objects being used as psychological warfare and to aid confusion in psychological attacks. They believe a system for rapidly sorting out false reports or reports of known objects and phenomena should be established. Referenced briefing tour is being given high priority and you will be notified as soon as it can be started and of the planned itinerary.
