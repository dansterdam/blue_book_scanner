The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved line with an "A" and "B" labelled on it, along with an object above the horizon line. The second sketch contains two panels - the left panel shows a landscape scene with a person standing on a road, while the right panel depicts a smaller landscape sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
