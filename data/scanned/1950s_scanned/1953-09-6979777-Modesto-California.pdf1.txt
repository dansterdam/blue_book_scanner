11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Just after dark a bright light appeared high in the western sky moving rapidly toward the east. It flashed on and off several times and had a pulsing effect. No sound was heard and the light disappeared from sight after about 2 minutes. Local radar operators stated no unidentified targets were observed on their scopes during the time the light was observed. The light was described as being brighter than a star and having a distinct reddish-orange color. Weather conditions were clear and visibility was good. The observers were two police officers on routine patrol.
