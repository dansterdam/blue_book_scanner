REPLY TO AFOIN-4-22

SUBJECT: UFO Letter - Congressman R. C. Pucinski

TO: SAFOI-3X (Major Tacker)

1. A search of the ATIC UFO files reveals no case reported for Illinois on 4 November 1957. However, there is there is a case on the 3rd or 5th of November 1957 that could be the one to which you referred to as the points of the object, position of the sun, and wind vector substantiate the conclusions that the sighting was probably a balloon with a parachute closure moving along in the wind.

2. The case referenced as taking place on 29 July 1959 actually occurred on 20 July 1959. The description of the observation substantiates the conclusion that the object, position of the sun, and wind vector were the characteristics which moved the object in the observed manner, accounting for the relatively short duration of the sighting.
