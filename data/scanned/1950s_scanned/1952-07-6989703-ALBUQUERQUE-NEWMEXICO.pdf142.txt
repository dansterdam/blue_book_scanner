The image appears to contain a photograph of a UFO-like object. The document appears to be an old Project Blue Book report from the U.S. Air Force, discussing the sighting of an unidentified flying object on July 28, 1952 near Albuquerque, New Mexico.

RESTRICTED
SECURITY INFORMATION

Force 1-1/20 air force, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On 28 July 1952 at approximately 1210 MST, I saw an object 30,000 to 40,000 feet in altitude traveling at an extremely high speed. The object was 1-2 minutes in color - not dull, it was all white and very bright. The atmospheric conditions in the area at the time were bobbing back and forth, and at times, it appeared to be flattened up and down. It started descending, then ascended, then descended again, and at times, it completely disappeared.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 30th day of July 1952.
