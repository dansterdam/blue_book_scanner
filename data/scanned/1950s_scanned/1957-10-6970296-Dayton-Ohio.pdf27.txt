The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" to indicate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with two positions marked "A" and "B" to indicate where the observer saw the object.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
