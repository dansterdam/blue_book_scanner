There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text, which I will transcribe below:

Witness: Univ. a a classic writer

Location: Gt. Miami river w/o
a C-47 was seen 1 Â¾ miles down river from landing
strip at the time of the sighting.

9/8/54

Yb F-26 or T-33, etc.

[Redacted] says he has seen
many of the balloons with and without
lights. Also he saw a DC-6 clearly
circling high about 6 or 7 minutes.
He saw the "thing" as a small
shimmering mass. Good.
