FLYING SAUCERS:
The page describes observations of flying saucer-like objects that were seen slowly moving eastwards. The objects were first observed at a distance of about 6,000 ft, and appeared to be maneuvering without any visible means of propulsion. The passage notes that the objects were seen clearly for about 3 minutes, covering a distance of about 60 miles. It mentions that the objects were "bell-shaped" and seemed to have a "sort of a halo" around them. The passage also discusses the possible explanations and theories that were considered regarding the nature of these objects.

FLYING SAUCERS.

When taking photographs, the first thing began to move slowly eastwards, rising at first, and rising as it did so. Before it reached 6,000 ft, white it had a sort of a halo around it. It had a bell-shape looking object was such clearly to the sides of the "window"; whale-like objt wre seen quite clearly through a binocular, with a curious appearance slightly restoring.

The day being exceptionally clear, there were no cloud formations to mask the strange thing. As she watched for the 3 minutes of its visible movement, the bell-shaped object covered 60 miles; that is, it traveled at a speed of over 1,000 m.p.h. during the period of observed flight. It appeared to be nothing lust nothing as vapor trails and no visible means of propulsion.

During an interview some days later, Capt. Bicknell said that his impression was that the unidentified thing was some kind of flying machine, and with this belief he and the local villagers unanimously agreed, unhesitatingly agreed. "It was suggested as the possible mirage", was discussed as "mirage" are rarely seen without cloud", he stated, "nor would that explain the object's movements which were those of a flying machine. "It was 500 yards ahead of anything we have today".

Major Keyhoe finally said: "If this report had come from a few isolated individuals it would soon be dismissed, but it came from nine ordinary travelers". It too, dismissed both the balloon and mirage" theories, and concluded that this "natural" experience had begun to fade. Other theories ranged from Martian visitors to the sun-controlled hallucinations.

Fragmentary evidence accrued since then increases the sum total of knowledge about this little-known phenomenon. U.S. "Flying Magazine" early in 1952, published a sketch of the object, which showed it to closely resemble a "submarine-like" outline with a defined top and fins recently, in connection with learning the whereabouts of the photographs taken in East Africa, the authorities Flying Saucer Bureau learned that "the only known public photograph of the object" shows a "disc-shaped mass on the film". A relation pic shows the object with light emanating from underneath, or possibly, symmetrically. It is hard to tell which, that the man with the film is supposed to have disappeared.

So the case stands, at present, one of the most puzzling and enigmatic unexplained Saucer Sightings recorded in Australian Flying Saucer Files.
