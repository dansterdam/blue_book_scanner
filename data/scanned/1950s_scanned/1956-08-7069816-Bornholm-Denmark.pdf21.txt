There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned document, specifically a memorandum for Col. Johnson and Col. Green regarding a Bornholm Radar UFO Sighting on 4 October 1956. The text of the document is as follows:

MEMORANDUM FOR COL JOHNSON AND COL GREEN
SUBJECT: Bornholm Radar UFO Sighting

Gen 2-12-9-90 USARRY, informed me that a recent visit was made to Denmark to verify the status of an unidentified object tracked on the Bornholm radar site. The limited information submitted is that these objects which present a well defined size of high intelligence on the radar scope, were the result of a detailed and exhaustive investigation by informed sources. The reports of sightings and radar tracking was confirmed, but no cau se of conventional propulsion could be ascertained.

AFCIN's evaluation is that the existence of several artificial satellites being guided missile, none of which could account for the characteristics of observed phenomena, does not exclude the possibility of guided missiles or other Air Force devices, this particular incident would appear to remain unexplained.

It is requested that the Bornholm Radar UFO incidents be followed up with view to arriving at a more firm conclusion.

I could appreciate it if the above information is submitted to Gen Cabell for his consideration.

GEORGE F. GREGORY,
Colonel, USAF.
