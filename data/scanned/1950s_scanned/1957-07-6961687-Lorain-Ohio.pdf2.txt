GROUND OBSERVER CORP 
FILTER CENTER
SAGIWAW, MICH.

GENTLEMEN:

ON THE ADVISE OF MR. WEBER, ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR CORP IN THIS CITY, I AM REPORTING THE UNUSAL OBJECTS OBSERVED AT 5:15 A.M. TODAY BY MY HUSBAND, 24 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND MYSELF.

OUR HOME IS SITUATED ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF EAST ERIE AVENUE WHICH PARALLELS LAKE ERIE. OUR DAUGHTER HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT TOWARD LAKE ERIE. SHE THEN OBSERVED THREE BRILLLIANT STARS IN THE NORTHEAST. SHE THEN DECIDED THEY WERE NOT STARS FOR CONTINUED OBSERVATION REVEALED THEM TO BE MOVING. THE FOUR POPPED INTO VIEW FROM BEHIND A ROW OF TREES ON THE OUTER SHORE OF THE LAKE. THEY TRAVELED IN A STRAIGHT LINE MAINTAINING THEIR RELATIVE POSITIONS TO EACH OTHER. THEY SEEMED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND TRAVELED AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. WE WATCHED THEM UNTIL THEY PASSED OVER OUR HOME HEADING SOUTH. 

AN ACCURATE TIME CHECK COULD BE MADE FOR A PLANE FROM CLEVELAND HOPKINS AIRPORT WAS PASSING OVER OUR HOUSE HEADS NORTHBOUND.

WHAT DID WE SEE? FOUR DAZZLING WHITE LIGHTS, EXCEEDINGLY HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH'S SURFACE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL AND TRAVELING IN THE FOLLOWING POSITION.
