PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: April 9 1950 1855Z
2. LOCATION: Williams AFB, Chandler, Arizona
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 Seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
7. COURSE: North
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: Astro (METEOR)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The witness saw a meteor, one of the rare daylight sightings of this type. The object showed sharp outlines, almost similar to horizon at North. The object moved at constant velocity far greater than the reported 1,200 mph.
COMMENTS: The fact that this was a daylight observation probably accounts for the precision in describing the position and motion, which can be seen just as easily as the moon or visible planets. The magnitudes of these meteors is as bright or brighter than 3 magnitudes, which makes them very noticeable during daylight.
