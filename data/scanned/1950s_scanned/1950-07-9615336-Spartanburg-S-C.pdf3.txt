Flying Something Seen Saturday
The Spartanburg journal dated 24 July 1950. (Afternoon Edition) Spartanburg, South Carolina.

Reporter S-es Flying 'Thing'
Vernon Smith, a Spartanburg journal reporter, today reports that on Saturday night a "cloud-like flying object, glowing a dull red in the night sky near the Star-lite Drive-in Theater" was observed by him and others. 
The object, Smith says, was about the shape of a disc but seemed to be surrounded by a "cloud" that obscured its outline. It appeared to be about 2,000 to 3,000 feet in the air, traveling an estimated 500 to 600 miles an hour. During the 5 to 7 minutes the object was in sight, it moved to a point over another section of the city and then disappeared. Smith said the object made no noise and gave off no trail of any kind. He estimated its size to be greater than that of a conventional aircraft.
Smith says he saw the object again about an hour later, this time in another part of the city. He said the "cloud" around it seemed more pronounced on this second sighting and that the object appeared to be maneuvering or changing direction. Again it disappeared from sight after a few minutes.
The Spartanburg Journal report states that several other persons in the city also reported seeing the object.
