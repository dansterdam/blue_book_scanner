UNCLASSIFIED 

On the 19th of May 1952, at 18,000 ft. 45 minutes out of Kelly APB, 30 miles southwest of San Angelo, Texas, I observed seven unidentifiable glowing objects ahead, on course. We continued on course and approached these for about 30 minutes. 

On closer observation they appeared to me to be vapor trails, the highest at approximately 40,000 ft, spaced down at 1,000 ft intervals as sketched below*.

The trails were approximately one mile in length.
