PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: New York, New York
DATE: 23 July 1952

PHOTOGRAPHY
PURPOSES: This photo analysis report is in answer to #0 #64-62 submitted by Sergeant E. M. Moody, USAF. The image was viewed in the upper right quadrant of the photo appears to portray an object that was probably astronomical in nature.

ANALYSIS: From a technical standpoint, the analysis of the object suggests a close proximity to the centrally located light source, and reflected light distribution on the object. The similarity of the object's appearance between the front telegraph pole and back telegraph pole, and the estimation of the object's size leads to the conclusion that the object would be approximately 3 feet in diameter.

From the above evaluation and associated imagery, the object appears to have a spherical or elliptical shape and was probably astronomical in nature.
