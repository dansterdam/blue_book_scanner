The text can be extracted as follows:

The following is a translation in full of the contents of the attached enclosure in regard to the reference of "unidentified flying object" case. 

The Director of Scientific Investigations:
17 February 1954. We have been directed for a request on behalf of several citizens of Chihuahua, Mexico, regarding a report of an unidentified flying object, and later it produced a white light above it (attached copy of report.) 
The writer may have some additional information which I would be glad to receive, and I will pass it on to this office for whatever action may be deemed advisable.
As it appears to be materially credible, it is because similar reports have been coming to the attention of this command and others for some time. If you have any additional information about this case, I would appreciate very much receiving it, as a more complete report would allow us to evaluate the matter more thoroughly.

With materialistic greetings,
Sincerely yours,
