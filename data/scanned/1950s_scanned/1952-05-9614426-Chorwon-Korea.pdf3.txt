AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Det 1, 600Eth AISS, APO 970 22-93 1 June 1952
STATEMENT:
On the morning of 31 May 1952, about 0900 hours, the guard at Post #6 called me by first telephone and called me to investigate a sighting of a unidentified aerial object in the sky North-East of my position. At this time I was on guard duty at Post #4. It seemed that the sighting was at first telephoned in and called my attention to a bright object in the sky at approximately 2000 feet above sea-level in elevation. The object stopped falling at about 2000 feet and went straight back up to about 3000 to 4000 feet. It started its fall from approximately 3000 to 4000 feet. The object started to head toward the East for about one half mile, then it stopped and reversed its course and headed back to the Northeast in a smooth flight at a speed of about 100 to 150 miles per hour. Then it reversed its direction again in a backward motion and started to climb at a 45 degree angle away from my position. As it headed away it picked up speed in a jerking motion and then faded from sight. The facts stated in this statement are all true to the best of my knowledge.
