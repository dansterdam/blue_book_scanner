Elongated Object Hangs in Dallas Sky
DALLAS, JAN 9 - A bright, elongated luminous object with a reddish-brown color was observed in the Dallas sky at about 7:30 a.m. today. The object was visible for about 15 minutes and was stationary, except that it pulsated and changed in intensity. After about 15 minutes, the object suddenly disappeared. Several persons reported the sighting to officials of the Civil Aeronautics Administration control tower at Love Field, Dallas, but the object was not detected on radar.
