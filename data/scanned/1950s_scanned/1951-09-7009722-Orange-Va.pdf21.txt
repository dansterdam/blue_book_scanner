PAGE  2   OF   2    PAGES

The text in the document is as follows:

This report indicated that at approximately 7:15 hours on 9-21-51, a resident of Orange, Virginia, advised that about an hour earlier she had observed an unidentified flying object in the sky. She stated that the object was about the size of a baseball at arm's length, was orange in color, and was traveling at a high rate of speed in a northerly direction. She stated that she watched the object for approximately three minutes before it disappeared from view in a northerly direction. 

The object was described as looking like a yellow vapor-trail against the sky. As the object came into view, the witness stated that she could see a small, bright, light-green light at the rear of the object, which appeared to be the source of the propulsion. This light pulsed or flickered at a very rapid rate.

The witness stated that in her opinion the object was airborne and not a conventional aircraft of any kind. She stated that the object made no sound and moved at a speed far greater than any conventional aircraft.

It is the opinion of this officer that the object observed may have been an unconventional type of aircraft. This opinion is based on the physical description and characteristics of the object as reported by the witness. No other supporting evidence is available.
