The text in the document reads as follows:

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter received at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on 6 March concerning an investigation of sightings objects sighted in Bloomington, Illinois, on 2 March.

The findings of the Air Technical Intelligence Center reveal the following:

1. The speed of the object was too great and the duration of the sighting too brief to be a satellite. 
2. The duration of the sighting was too great to have been a meteor. The average life of a meteor is 3-5 seconds or less.
3. Objects of this nature have been estimated to operate in other than a straight line course and it is known that they operate in a zig-zag manner at high speeds as to make the structure arranged in a perimeter so they can be seen from almost any single angle.
4. It is the opinion of the Air Technical Intelligence Center that your observed a high-speed object with distance and visual accompanying for the absence of sound.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
