The text in the document reads:

"Buzzing sound from above, This object, shaped about the size of two of these ordinary clouds can't see their movement, Suddenly a bluestain appeared as if torn apart and became hazy and vanished - In about an hour, same buzzing sound appeared again in the same direction, looked like a light colored cloud converging, the sky was clear but the light looked hazy and separated and vanished - About an half hour later, the object reappeared along with the buzzing sound, this time larger and appeared to be spinning, as it came closer the buzzing grew louder and then vanished - Definitely not an ordinary cloud formation."
