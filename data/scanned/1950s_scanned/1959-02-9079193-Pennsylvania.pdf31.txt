Here is the text extracted from the document:

The information of the foregoing description was obtained from the informant by the Air Force who had it from his local Air Force contacts. He was an Air Line Pilot and his statement tallies with the report of the USAF Air Force Base. His statement indicates that he did not see the object, but was informed of the incident by the Air Force. The Air Force indiea~ed to him that the object was the type they had sighted on numerous occasions over a long period of time and that a preliminary analysis of data collected over these years indicated the likelihood of such an object's existence. The Air Force informant stated further that they were well aware of public interest in the matter and that there were continuing efforts along the lines of scientific investigation to determine the nature of these objects.
USAF informed the informant that the object was first sighted by their radar approximately 50 miles southwest of Harrisburg, PA, at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet, traveling at a speed estimated by radar to be in excess of 1800 knots. The object was picked up on USAF radar and simultaneously observed visually by the crew of a USAF jet plane flying a routine training mission in the area at that time. The jet attempted to intercept the object but it maneuvered at a speed far in excess of the jet's maximum speed and the jet was unable to close on it or obtain a positive visual identification. The object was tracked by radar for a period of approximately thirty minutes during which time it maintained a relatively constant altitude but traveled a considerable distance.
The Air Force concluded that the object was not identifiable as any known aircraft and, while its origin and nature remained unknown, it appeared to be a physical device rather than any type of atmospheric phenomena. The Air Force did not reveal to the informant any further details regarding the size, configuration or internal structure of the object as observed on radar, nor did they indicate whether any photographic or other physical evidence was obtained. The Air Force representative stated that the object remained unidentified and that continued investigation was being carried on.
