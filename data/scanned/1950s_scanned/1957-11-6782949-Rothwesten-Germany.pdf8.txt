SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
Originating Agency Report No.
601st ACWRON, Rothwesten, IR-2-57
Germany Page 6 of 6 pages

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

    The radar maintenance officer explained the unusual interfer-
ence cited in Lt. Rumstein's observations as being caused by the 
excessive rotation rate and PRF relationships between Gunpost's
AN/MPS-11 and our Native Son radar station's AN/GPS-4. The latter
is located 58 line of sight miles at 50 degrees 29 minutes 54
seconds North and 09 degrees 57 minutes 17 seconds East. Other-
wise there does not seem to be answer for the phenomena in the 
targets being reported.
