24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you were examining the object that you saw. Of what type material would you judge the object to be, and how large would it be, and what other characteristics would it have? Describe in your own words what the object which you saw would give the same appearance as the object which you saw up in the sky would give.
