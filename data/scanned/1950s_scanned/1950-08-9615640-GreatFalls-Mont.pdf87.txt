Because of the above described effects, the proportions of bright objects seen from a distance may also be distorted (cf. figure 9(a) where a cylinder of light is made to appear almost like a circular dot). In spite of this, fuzziness of edge definition from planes appears to be a general characteristic of these films as there is evidence of a long continuation hazy effect from the edges of objects. In the case of the Montana films (the subject's line of motion being parallel to the line of sight) the image that appears uniform white dots cannot serve as a valid deterrent to an airplane reflection hypothesis. However, this perhaps leads one to think that the object would have to be even closer than three miles. In Figure 9(c) the jet plane motion made an angle of only about 30° to 60° with the observer's line of sight and the image definitely appears oval.

Examination of figures 10(b) and 10(c) would indicate that airplanes as close as this would certainly appear on the film.
