The page contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above it. The instructions ask the reader to imagine that the object is above the horizon, and to indicate its position using the curved line marked "A" and "B".

The second sketch contains two illustrations. The larger one shows a person standing on a road with trees and hills in the background. The smaller one shows a more detailed landscape with mountains in the distance and a person in the foreground.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that the object was at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
