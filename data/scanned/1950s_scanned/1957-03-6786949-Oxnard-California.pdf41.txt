JULY 19, 1957
UFO SAUCERS from Page 4
SPECIAL REPORT OF UFO SIGHTING (southwest of Los Angeles). Between 0130 and 0430 hours (local time) of July 19, 1957, several UFOs were observed in the sky over Los Angeles, California. The sightings were made by many Californians in the vicinity. The eyewitnesses were able to identify the locality of the UFOs as the San Gabriel Valley.
The descriptions in the area indicate that probably several thousand persons observed the UFOs. During the latter part of our observation, Air Force officials arrived to investigate the incident. According to a statement given to Hess (background by the Project Silver) - Captain Josef C. P. , who was in command of the Oxnard Air Force Base control tower at the time, verified that the UFOs were picked up on radar, at a distance of 2310 (11:10 p.m.) and at a height of 7700 feet.
The above mentioned Captain Fry notified Air Force Headquarters, Washington (2330 & 2334 hours) of the sighting. Captain Fry declared to the tower that the UFO was completely strange, unfamiliar with any known aircraft. When the objects were observed, they made a distinct sizzling or buzzing sound, and appeared to give off a pulsing light. It was further stated that the objects would often change direction abruptly at high speed, something not possible with any known aircraft.
The Air Force, Filter Center, was less Wagner, whose regular job is that of a civilian dispatcher at the Oxnard Air Force Base. According to Mrs. Brentnall's statement, the UFOs were estimated to be twice the size of a standard aircraft. They were observed flying at an altitude of about 7700 feet. According to the details given, there were two or more objects observed at the same time, flying in close formation, and that the combined observation period was more than one hour. The two men admittedly were in command of the Oxnard AFB control tower when the sighting took place.
Near midnight, the shapes of UFOs seemed to exhibit two distinctive parts. It was noted that the objects emitted a distinct flashing light at intervals. Even while stationary, all these visual reports may have indicated activities or maneuvers of varying speeds of the unidentified objects observed.
