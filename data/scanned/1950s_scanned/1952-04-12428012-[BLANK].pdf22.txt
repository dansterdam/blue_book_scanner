(Briefing Officer) 

Thank you, Mr. Kobernuss.

As we have seen from what Mr. Kobernuss has told us, there is no real evidence pointing to unconventional aircraft, range extension techniques, or developments of known power sources, as a possible explanation of the unidentified aerial phenomena. We do not say that we cannot find any evidence to support them at present.

And now as to the present operation of the investigation, specifically as to methods of collection and methods of analysis.

I shall now introduce ___________, an aeronautical engineer who is project officer in charge of the investigation, who has been working with it for quite some time and is thoroughly familiar with all of the operational details. ___________.
