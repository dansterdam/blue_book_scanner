DATE 9 Feb, 1956

2 dry 34 Louis Paumley Field at about 4:30p.m. with my wife, we observed VFR a 5000 rpm OBJECT in the air coming from the West & hovering about 10 miles toward the North & descending to a point near the Horizon then would start to climb again - This object was disc-shaped with a red top & a bright light on bottom & about the size of a pie plate & seemed to do a "Yo-Yo" movement about 10 miles from our position & would stay in view for about 1 minute at a time then disappear & reappear - while it was there it remained absolutely motionless - there is a an other OBJECT in the air that was moving very close to this one & was much larger in size and shape in the form of a torpedo which would remain in view for only a few seconds at a time.
