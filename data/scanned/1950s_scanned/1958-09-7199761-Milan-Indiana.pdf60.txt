Thank you very much,

This case sir,

In your reply to my unidentified flying object sighting, you stated that the information I gave you would be used in your continuing analysis. 

Could you please send me any information you have released since Sept 5, 1958 on this analysis? Or on the information released since Sept 5, 1958 on UFOs?

Thank you very much,

Cols, 13, Char
