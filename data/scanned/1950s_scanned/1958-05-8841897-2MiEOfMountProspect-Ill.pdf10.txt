Dear Miss Cormack:

Thank you very much for your kind letter of July 24, about the report on Flying Saucers. I have just returned and wanted to reply and also to return to you the original pictures.

The report as given is far too lengthy for my attempted identification. Nevertheless, I think it might be wise if you could give me what the witness has to say.

Thank you for your interest. I am glad to add this to my file which, as you have access, is voluminous. 

Sincerely yours,

Donald H. Menzel
Director
