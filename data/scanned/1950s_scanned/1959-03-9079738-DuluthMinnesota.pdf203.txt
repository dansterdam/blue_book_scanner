I had this contact. The first contact The ground cigaretter. Look up was made hovering over a ground cigaretter and was about 15 to 20 feet long and appeared to be at about 200 feet up. As it appeared to us and crossed in front of us and passed to the rear at possibly no more than 200 feet up. There was no noise or any visible means of support.
In the pilots opini√≥n, certain airborne objects were seen on the radar, however no interception was possible.
