I, [name redacted], was in one office around 1530 when one of the boys came in and asked if I had seen the strange saucers that I told him. I did not believe what he was telling me, as I was just kidding, I did not believe what I was telling him, so the boys went out to investigate. I then told them that I had no idea, that I was just fooling them,  When I got back to my office, I called H. [name redacted] and asked if he had seen anything. He said no, that he had not seen anything either. I then told him that I had told the boys that I had seen something, but that I was just fooling them.

At approximately 1620 MST two objects came in and we went out to look at them. They were fuzzy and seemed to be adjustable to the tower and it was the same size and distance as the first one. One could not watch constantly, as my eyes would get blurry.
