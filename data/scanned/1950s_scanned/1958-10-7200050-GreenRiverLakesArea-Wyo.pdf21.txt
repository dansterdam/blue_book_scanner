The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified aerial object. The sketch shows a roughly circular shape with a trail or vapor trail behind it, indicating that it was in motion. There are also some handwritten annotations around the sketch describing the object's appearance and movement.

16. None
b. Color - Pale Green (Light Neon Green)

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially outline any exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like a bright light
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Describe them in words, tell how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
Occasionally a small swarm or group of the lights was seen, but usually there was only one or two lights. However, I believe this represented a positive altitude adjustment to my observation.
