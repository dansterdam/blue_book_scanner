In studying the characteristics of these high-speed radar tracks, it was found that much of the information pertaining to them appeared to be unrelated or contradictory. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult and often impossible to arrive at positive conclusions. None of the possible causes considered in the study could be supported indisputably as the one responsible for the tracks. The evaluation did show that certain of the explanations were more tenable while others were rejected almost entirely. Therefore, the conclusions presented concerning the cause of tracks RB-6 and RB-111 are not stated in unequivocal terms as one would prefer conclusions to be, but rather they are statements of the relative probability that the tracks were the result of the various possible causes evaluated.

a. Despite the apparent track correlation between the two segments of track RB-6, it is highly probable that these two tracks resulted from separate, unrelated causes.

b. The most probable cause of track RB-6 carried by Montauk is believed to be either a circuit malfunction or interference from a radar.
