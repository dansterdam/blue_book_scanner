The image appears to contain a photograph of a blurred and indistinct object, described in the text as a "sphere" that "if viewed soundlessly, became a blur and vanished from sight." The text discusses the phenomenon of "flying saucers" and how these objects are often unpredictable and difficult to capture in photographs.

It's the Flying Saucer Season Again: Sphere Is One of Those Things
TV Technician Takes Pictures
The flying saucer season is usually as unpredictable as the things themselves, but this year it opened with a bang. And the bang was centered in the Union Square area of New York City. 
A TV technician, whose name is not disclosed, was walking along the street when he saw the sphere in the sky. He quickly snapped several pictures of it, and according to the report, the sphere, if viewed soundlessly, became a blur and vanished from sight.
According to the description, the sphere was elliptical in shape and its surface appeared to be corrugated or striated. The technician said it was about the size of a basketball and seemed to be moving swiftly. When he gasped and cried out, the sphere disappeared. The technician's pictures, when developed, showed only a blurred image.
Obviously, if it was in fact a flying saucer, its angular structure and swift, silent movement would account for the blurred image on the film. Flying saucers have a habit of appearing and disappearing rapidly. And the Union Square area has been a familiar hunting ground for these mysterious objects.
