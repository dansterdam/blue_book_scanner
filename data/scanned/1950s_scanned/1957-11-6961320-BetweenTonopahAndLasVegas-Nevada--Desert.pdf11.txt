DEAR DR. ROTH:

THIS LETTER HEREWITH SUBMITS A CASE FILE CONTAINING THE ORIGINAL REPORT OF A SIGHTING OF A CIRCULAR OBJECT OVER THE DESERT BETWEEN TONOPAH AND LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, ON THE EVENING OF 25 NOVEMBER 1954.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN YOU AND CAPTAIN GREGORY, THE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER HAS RETAINED CUSTODY OF THE ORIGINAL REPORT AND SUPPORTING DATA, INCLUDING PHOTOS, SINCE IT IS STANDARD PROCEDURE TO SAFEGUARD SUCH MATERIALS AS A PART OF THE FILES OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK. REGARDING THE POSSIBLE USE OF YOUR SERVICES, CERTAIN PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE MATERIAL HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE OF SOME INTEREST AND VALUE TO YOU.

THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED SO FAR, BASED UPON A DETAILED PSYCHOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED IF YOU COULD REVIEW THESE DATA AND COMMUNIONS RESULTING FROM YOUR ANALYSIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

WE SHOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO HAVE YOUR UTILIZATION OF THIS REPORT ON THE BASIS OF YOUR PREVIOUS WORK IN THIS FIELD, IN WHICH YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OR REPORTS ON UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS WOULD BE OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST TO US.

BACKGROUND MATERIAL AND CERTAIN POINTS WHICH MAY BE HELPFUL TO YOUR ANALYSIS AS FOLLOWS:

1. A "LARGE CIRCULAR OR 'SAUCER' AND 'CIGAR-SHAPED' OBJECT," SUCH AS OUR UFO PROGRAM HAS ENCOUNTERED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS SOME TIME AGO, WAS REPORTEDLY OBSERVED BY A USAF PILOT OVER THE DESERT BETWEEN TONOPAH AND LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, ON THE EVENING OF 25 NOVEMBER 1954.

DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT, AS GIVEN BY THE PILOT, GENERALLY INDICATES IT TO BE OF A TYPE WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS "FLYING SAUCER", GENERALLY DISC-LIKE IN SHAPE, WITH A SLIGHT DOME OR PROJECTION ON TOP AND BOTTOM, AND A COLOR VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS SILVER, METALLIC, OR WHITE.

ALTHOUGH THE PILOT'S REPORT CONTAINS CERTAIN OBSERVATIONS AND IMPRESSIONS REGARDING THE OBJECT'S PERFORMANCE AND BEHAVIOR WHICH CORRESPOND TO CHARACTERISTICS GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH UNCONVENTIONAL AERIAL OBJECTS, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO CONTAIN ANY CONCLUSIVE OR UNAMBIGUOUS EVIDENCE WHICH WOULD SERVE TO IDENTIFY THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT.

ORIGINAL REPORT IS ON FILE AT THIS CENTER, AND SUPPORTING DATA INCLUDING PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE BEEN SECURED, THOUGH NOT REVIEWED IN DETAIL AT THIS TIME.
