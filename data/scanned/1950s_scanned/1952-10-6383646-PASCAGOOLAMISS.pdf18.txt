PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI

As an extremely close object passes over them, two witnesses sighted a round, dull-metallic appearing object. Looking up into the sky, they noticed a bright light approaching and a moment later it passed over them at an estimated altitude of 500 feet. The object was described as about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and shaped like a shallow bowl or saucer with a slight dome on top. As it passed over, it made no sound and did not appear to be rotating. The object was observed for about 20 to 25 seconds before disappearing from sight to the north. Both witnesses were very alarmed and frightened by the experience.
