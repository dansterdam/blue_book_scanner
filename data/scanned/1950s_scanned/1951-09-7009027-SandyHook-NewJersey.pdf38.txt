Pilot Says He Saw Odd Object 
Speed Over Coast at 900 M.P.H.

M/Sgt. Rollin S. Rogers, RM.,Air Force Base, reported the pilot sighting a mysterious object
about 900 miles an hour. 

The object disappeared after the pilot had followed it for about 3,000 feet at 1t.

The object did seem to be sinking to the level of the sea, and was moving in a southeasterly direction, 
said Lt. Wilbert S. Rogers, 23, attached to the Air Force base at Dover.

Lt. Rogers told officers here Lt. Rogers said: "I don't know whether it was a plane, rocket, or what, but I've never seen anything like it before."

The World War II veteran from Columbia, S.C., was reminded that various units of the armed forces have conducted down reports of flying objects which have since been explained as weather balloons.

Lt. Rogers couldn't have been a balloon, he said. "And besides, no balloon could have gone that fast."

What he and Capt. Ballard saw while flying in a T-33 jet trainer at an altitude of 20,000 feet at 1:30 p.m. yesterday was something utterly different, he declared. The object was below them at about 12,000 feet, going at a terrific speed. 

As they followed the object, it moved in at the from Sandy Hook, New jersey, then out to Asbury Park. The speed appeared constant.
