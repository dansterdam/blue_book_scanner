NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
12 February 1957
LaGuardia A/P, New York

February 12, 1957. At 7:10 p.m. a New York Airways helicopter, approaching LaGuardia, noticed that they had an object "ship-shaped" like a blimp with a red light in sight over the Aquacade of the old World's Fair site. The tower replied that about 15 minutes before they "had one there ... with an explosive, wide light." It went up and down for a while. Some pilots saw it, others didn't. (Credited: LaGuardia A/P)
