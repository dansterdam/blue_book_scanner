The image contains two hand-drawn sketches that appear to be representations of the observed object. Based on the instructions, there are no human faces present in the image, so I will describe the sketches without identifying any individuals.

The text in the document states:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Whistling sound
b. Color - White in color, glowing in a bright glow

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as the time, position, color, direction and speed of travel, shape, etc. Place a mark beside the drawing to show the direction from which you saw the object.

The two sketches provided show two oval-shaped objects, with one appearing more elongated than the other. The sketches appear to be hand-drawn and are labeled "Changed to" and "Cloud-like".

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
                b. Like a bright star
                c. Sharply outlined
                d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
