Dear Capt. Harding:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just now gotten down to looking over the large batch of accumulated reports related to the interesting incidents of 21 July and 1 August of this year. The details and following of these cases are more recent.

With present information I have no suggested explanation. 

The details of the sightings are consistent with the observations from the standpoint of maneuvers and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by military personnel. However, there is not more information on these cases than four immediate days. There is probably additional pay dirt in these cases.

It is true there is not more information on Creole, Ala. These cases cover four immediate days. There is probably pay dirt in these cases.

Finally, the did slinmane sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably have to remain on the books as unexplained.

As for the remaining 39 or so cases there is so little information concerning those which do not have obvious explanations that there is no pertinent information to include.

Thus, out of the total number there are 8 independent sets which, if staff and time were adequate, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I vote for sticking with the Black Hawk case until we have squeezed it dry. I hope others would follow suit.

Concerning the Black Hawk case, we are proceeding slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence and radar. It is important, in my estimation, that we continue to pursue this case fully until a satisfactory and substantial solution is achieved in our defense set-up. I hope to have a preliminary report on this case for you soon.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek
