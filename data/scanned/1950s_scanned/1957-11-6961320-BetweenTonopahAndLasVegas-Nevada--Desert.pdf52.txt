Request for Psychological Analysis - UFO
Sighting by USAF Pilot

AFCIN-43b 
ATIN: Mr. Whitcher

1. Request that a review and analysis, from the psychological point of view, be made of UFO data and evaluation associated therewith. It is desired that this be accomplished through the established facilities of Project White Stork, and a report of the results be forwarded to this office as expeditiously as possible.

2. It is strongly recommended that Dr. Paul M. Fitts, Department of Psychology of Ohio State University, perform the required review and analysis. Mr. Fitts made a very fine contribution on this particular project, and having performed our analysis, is well acquainted with the background and requirements of this report on the subject for the Air Force.

3. For the sake of expediency, and in accordance with your suggestions informally indicated between your office and this office, it is recommended that the necessary arrangements be made to expedite this work during the courier runs to Columbus, Ohio.

4. Funding for the proposed consultation services shall be obtained from the AFCIN-43c and is not contemplated that the contract services will exceed $500.00.

5. The matter will require discreet handling.
