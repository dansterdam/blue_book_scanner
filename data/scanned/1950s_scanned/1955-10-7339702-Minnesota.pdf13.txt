The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a diagram. The diagram appears to be a radar plot or target tracking system, with concentric circles and radial lines forming a polar coordinate grid. There are various annotations and labels on the diagram, such as "IF SCOPE PHOTOS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, PLOT TILL TARGET TRACK AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE. GIVE THE TIME AND ALTITUDE (IF MEASURED) FOR EACH POINT PLOTTED. BUT THE NECESSARY RANGE SCALE ON THE DIAGRAM."

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

IF SCOPE PHOTOS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, PLOT TILL TARGET TRACK AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE. GIVE THE TIME AND ALTITUDE (IF MEASURED) FOR EACH POINT PLOTTED. BUT THE NECESSARY RANGE SCALE ON THE DIAGRAM.
