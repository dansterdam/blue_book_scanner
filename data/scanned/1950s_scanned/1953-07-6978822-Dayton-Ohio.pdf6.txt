U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and acted upon as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you have already given in your initial information report, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

The handwritten text on the form describes an unidentified bright object that was observed moving over a farm. The object was initially bright and white, and then changed shape to a circular form with a red glow on the underside. It then went off at a high speed and did not shine in the sunlight. The observer states that the object was difficult to believe and would have trouble getting anyone to believe what they saw.
