There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This seems to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Calumet, Michigan                                 19 April 1953

I. DESCRIPTION
On 10 April 1953 between 0112 and 0215Z a series of targets were sighted by the 66395th Air Reserve Squadron, Calumet, Michigan. The plots originated approximately 50 miles from their station, from 020 clockwise to 251 degrees. Speed was estimated from 1600 mph to 5000 mph. This situation was radar sighting only and appeared intermittent. No visual targets were noted. Several individual target tracings were noted varying in apparent size and speed. The general weather conditions at the time of sighting were three miles visibility, snow and overcast. Northern lights were clearly visible during this period.

This is another of the better type of FLYOBFT. The intelligence officer is to be commended for the initiative shown in making as complete a report as possible under the conditions. The model the preliminary evaluation as to the time he prepares the report, saving Project Blue Book the problem of later correction of faulty observation.

III. CONCLUSION
Other (radar interference).
