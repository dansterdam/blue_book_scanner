The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a scanned page from a document that appears to be a Project Blue Book report. The text on the page describes a sighting by four astronomers in Greenville, South Carolina, who reported seeing several "objects" flying in the sky. The text states that the objects were "silently overhead, doubling several times before they went out of sight". It also mentions that the objects "had an oval shape, like that of a disc" and that "the disc was flying on its side".
