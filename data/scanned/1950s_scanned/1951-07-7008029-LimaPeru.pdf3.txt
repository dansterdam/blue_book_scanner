The following is an excerpt translation of an article appearing in a Lima daily newspaper:

"Together with the photograph printed above, we have received a copy of the covering letter from the Aviation Corporal of the Peruvian Air Force, which states: On 15 August 1951, at about 12:15 P.M., the pilot of an Air Force C-47 transport, flying between Lima and Pucallpa, Peru, reported sighting a luminous disc which was seen over the Andes Mountains. The direction was south to north, and it was visible from 3 to 5 minutes. The object was disc-shaped, luminous, and appeared to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. The pilot estimated its distance to be approximately 8-10 kilometers. After the observation the pilot continued his flight without incident."

Our informant adds that this disc was seen again on 16 August in the Callao, Peru area, and estimates that the disc was visible for about 30 minutes during this sighting. The report states that the disc was first sighted at an altitude of about 13,000 feet and descended to an altitude of about 8,000-9,000 feet before disappearing. No further details are given.
