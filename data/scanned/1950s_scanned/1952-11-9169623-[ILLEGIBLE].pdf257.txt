I, James H. McCauslin Jr., Captain, USAF, A-1435732, do hereby make the following statement and is true to the best of my knowledge.

On the 9th of November 1952 at 1800 P.M. I was notified by the 2108th Air Base Squadron on the telephone that a person had reported a strange object in the sky over Donaldson Air Force Base, Greenville, South Carolina. This person stated that a silver object was seen shortly after darkness and that it was maneuvering and hovering at an altitude of approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet. The object appeared to be of large size, approximately 30 to 40 feet in length, and cylindrical in shape. It was observed for approximately 10 minutes and then disappeared.

I immediately proceeded to the area to investigate. However, upon my arrival the object had already disappeared. This sighting was reported to authorities for further investigation.

The above statement is true to the best of my knowledge. I have been in radar 32 months and have been familiar with the appearance of various objects in the sky. I am quite familiar with the appearance of meteorites and am quite familiar with my work.

s/s/ James H. McCauslin Jr., Captain, USAF

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 10th day of November 1952.
