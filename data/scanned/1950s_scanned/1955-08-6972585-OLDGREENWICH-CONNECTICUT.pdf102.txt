"I ROSE LATE THAT PARTICULAR MONDAY MORNING...AS IT WAS MY DAY OFF FROM WORK. BEING AN AMATEUR RADIO OPERATOR, I DECIDED TO WORK ON MY RADIO UHF JUST FOR THIS...I DECIDED I WOULD NOT EVEN RAISE AN AERIE TO GO OUTSIDE THE OBSERVATIVE I DID. I RAN INTO A TOUGH PROBLEM, AND DECIDED TO SEEK THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CHIEF ENGINEER AT THE RADIO STATION WHERE I WORK.
