The image appears to contain a photograph, but it is not visible in the provided screenshot. The text in the document describes several sightings of unidentified objects observed on May 8, 9, and 13, 1952 at George AFB, California. The descriptions include details about the shapes, colors, and behaviors of the objects, such as disc-shaped, flat, white in color, moving in a circular or zig-zag pattern, and an unidentified round, silver object observed on May 9. The document also mentions that only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately, and that these balloons are the only ones with which the sightings can be associated in some cases.

APPENDIX VI 
George AFB, Calif. - 9, 13, 14, 20 May 1952

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
The sightings on 1 May 1952 at George AFB, Calif., was the first of a series of the sightings there in a three week period. These sightings were all by military personnel. 

1. 1 May 1952 - 2300 PDST - Two or three round, disc-shaped objects, flat white in color, which gave no reflection, were observed by tower personnel. These objects appeared to be of very high speed, much faster than jet aircraft, and maneuvered in a circular zig-zag manner. 
2. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - An unidentified round, silver object was launched vertically from the ground and from this rose to about 50,000 feet in 10 seconds, and then was observed to remain stationary. 
3. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Two unidentified objects moving with the current or breeze appeared to be hollow, disk-shaped. They appeared to be silvery in color with a dark spot in the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright glare.
4. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - Object was of dull color like a thundercloud. It was shaped like an arrowhead but had no known aerodynamic features.
5. 13 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Object looked like a white paper plate dipping and over end with an initial speed comparable to a jet although later it reduced speed.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which the sightings can be associated. These balloons are released regularly thus accounting for some of the unusual sightings reported in cases which are probably balloons.
