The object was elliptical in shape and about 30-40 feet in width. It was observed for 1-2 minutes. The object suddenly accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. There were no noise or trail of smoke observed. The witness states that he has been trained in identification of aircraft and that this object was not an aircraft, meteor, or any known type of natural phenomena. He requests that this sighting be investigated."
