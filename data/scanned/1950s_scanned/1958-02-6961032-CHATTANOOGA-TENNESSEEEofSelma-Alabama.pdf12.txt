AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE OF INFORMATION: 15 May 1958
LOCATION: CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE 
EVALUATION: 
DISTRIBUTION: COPY NO. 

SUMMARY:
At 2200 hours on 29 March 1958, a "round, luminous, orange-colored" object was observed in the sky over Selma, Alabama, by a witness. The object was approximately the size of a dime held at arm's length and appeared to be about 500 to 1,000 feet in altitude. It moved in a generally westward direction at a rapid speed, with a "gliding" motion, and climbed slightly during the observation. No sound was heard. After approximately 10 to 15 seconds, the object disappeared from view.
No rational or logical explanation was found for the sighting. The witness was considered to be a reliable observer. No further information or investigation is planned.
