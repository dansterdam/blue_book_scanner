[Sketch of an object's path]
more from usntain horizon is still quite low to the ground. The object rose very rapidly to much higher altitudes, moving in a vertical plane. I could not tell wheher it was round or oval, as the details were indistinct at the distance it was observed. It seemed rather small in appearance but I cannot estimate its actual size or distance. The sighting lasted only about 30 seconds from first to last sight. It was observed against a clear sky.
