The text in the document discusses the account of the photographer who was interrogated by OSI (Office of Special Investigations) regarding his observations of unidentified aerial phenomena. The key points are:

1. The photographer had previously been interrogated by the FBI and had observed lights that he could not identify. He and others had observed these lights on several occasions.
2. The objects observed were not bright enough to be photographed.
3. One school of thought was that the objects were experimental aircraft being tested, but several people reported that they observed the objects performing maneuvers that were not characteristic of any known aircraft.
4. The college professors do not believe the theory that the objects were experimental aircraft, as they would have been detectable by radar and other methods.
5. The document mentions a Federal Wild Life Game Warden who was familiar with the incidents and interviewed people who had observed the objects.
6. The document discusses the possibility of the observations being related to the ducks in the area, but states that if the photos are authentic, the objects are likely not ducks.
7. The document mentions an analysis of the photographs by the Photographic Reconnaissance Laboratory of USAF, but the results of this analysis are not provided.
