The image does not contain a photograph. It shows a document from The Brown-Bridge Mills, Inc. in Troy, Ohio, with handwritten text on it.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Dear Mrs. Gardiner: The enclosed self-explanatory letter is now returning to you. The flight was made on January 2, 1956. I would recommend that the following be investigated: 1) Obtain exact time and date from the pilots. 2) Obtain photographs, if any, taken by the pilots. 3) Attempt to locate the actual path, altitude, and speed of the object over a time period. 4) Attempt to determine the size, shape, and color of the object. 5) Attempt to determine if the object was observed by any other parties. Please let me know if any other information is required. The next time I may be able to provide more definitive data.
