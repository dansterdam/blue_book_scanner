Hypo-cerebls BULLETIN

Third Officer Barry W. Pillinger of the American S.S. Alcoa Regency reports as follows: 

Among the large number of meteors observed on the morning of November 9, 1952, the following was the most unusual: At 0510 N.A., a bright metallic object originating in the constellation Leo, having a duration of 3-4 seconds, descended diagonally from the upper left toward the lower right, becoming brighter as it appeared to slow down, and then suddenly disappearing. At the flash, a large ink of sparks seemed to fan out around the vessel. After the flash, a large ball of reddish gas became visible as a crescent, following the track of the object, which then disappeared. This crescent remained visible for 20 to 30 seconds. Estimating the distance of the object, Pillinger judged it to be over 50 miles away. The object was of such brilliance that it was plainly visible to the naked eye for the entire 3-4 second duration. Weather clear, excellent visibility, wind NE force 3, slight sea.

Barometer 29.92 inches, air temperature 72 F.
