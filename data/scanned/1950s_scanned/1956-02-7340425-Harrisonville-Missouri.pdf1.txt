10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
    This object seen by observer three
    times, late in Jan, 10 Feb 56, and 13
    Feb 56. Source stated that the object
    resembled a flying saucer (?) that was
    very bright and moving slowly. The
    first time the object disappeared to
    the north after appearing in the east.
    The object circled Harrisonville
    during the sighting on the 14th of
    Feb. Source described the object as
    being brighter than any star and did
    not disappear as would a star.
