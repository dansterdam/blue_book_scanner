The text in the document is as follows:

finally felt that predictions of this nature would be necessary for the individual observing stations. This has not proved to be the case. Due to the comparatively large amount of machine time required for these predictions, and the fact that they will be made only in particular applications when actually required.

The charts of predicted satellite positions, described by Jean B. Fairman and George Yeis, were originally intended for interested news agencies in the form of a daily bulletin. Its use has now been extended to interested observers of the satellite paths, such as the amateur radio operators and broadcast observers over the Civil Air Patrol Communication Network, thus enabling rapid dissemination of predictions. Arrangements have been made whereby observing teams are contacted daily by CAP units stationed at satellite passage points. To a great extent, this arrangement has been occasioned in distributing predictions by mail. This is necessitated in distributing predictions to those instances in which it is impossible to make accurate predictions for more than 3 or 4 days in advance due to fluctuations in the rate of a satellite-life's acceleration.
