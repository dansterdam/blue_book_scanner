Study the Corona 
Although it is no longer necessary, as it was a few years ago, to wait for a total eclipse to observe the sun's outermost layers - the corona, this feature can only be seen and photographed in its greatest detail and extent at such a time. Many of the observaitons will be made in connection with the 11-year cycle of solar activity, which changes in step with the 11-year cycle of terrestrial weather, but observations will also be made to study the nature of the high disc we see ordinarily, just as the beginnings and end of a total eclipse. This will be done with the aid of spectrographic, photography and other means, and will yield many valuable data.

Of course, such observations require a clear sky, and the U.S. Weather Bureau has estimated that the chances of clear weather at college time are 60-70%, but such clouds as will be present are likely to be thin, allowing good viewing of the corona. Two packages of rockets that will be fired to high altitudes on Oct. 15 and 29 may also aid in studying the corona, as they will provide platforms for cameras and other instruments that can escape the obscuring effects of the lower atmosphere. Attempts will also be made to determine changes in the high atmosphere as it is momentarily in the shadow of the moon.
