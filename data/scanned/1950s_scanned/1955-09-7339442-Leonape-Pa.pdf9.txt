III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE stated that on 23 September 1955 at 12:30 EDST a circular daylight to dark purple-blue-gray object appeared on the horizon but was unable to see the aircraft. She began scanning the sky, when suddenly she noticed the appearance of a strange flying object, oval-shaped and char-coal gray in color, moving across the sky.
SOURCE watched this object perform a continuous counter-clockwise rotation which continued as the object moved away and out of sight. The time of sighting was between 3 and 5 minutes.
SOURCE could discern no sound being emitted by the UFOB during the time of sighting, but there was much attention to the sky, during the UFOB sighting an unidentified airliner, flying low at what Ã™OURCE estimated to have been 4,000 feet, followed and to the right of the UFOB.
In addition to the oval-like configuration of the UFOB already noted, SOURCE described that she had thought it due to get a set of 7 to 8 individual pulses or oscillations, well as a circular object just off the right side of the UFOB. UTJRCE was certain that the smaller object was moving independent of the larger one.
SOURCE described the UFOB'S physical appearance to have resembled the cover of an alligator skin purse with slightly irregular protruded and visible.
The condition of the sky was overcast with an approximate 3500" ceiling.
No photographs were taken of the UFOB.
