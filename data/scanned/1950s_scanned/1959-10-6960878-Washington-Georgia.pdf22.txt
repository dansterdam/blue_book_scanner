The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that includes various maps and city plans, including for Augusta, Columbus, Savannah, and Winston-Salem.

Transcription of text from the document:

Augusta, Ga. 
Columbus, Ga.
Savannah, Ga. 
Winston-Salem, N.C.

There is also a grid-like chart or table on the right side of the image, though the text within it is not legible enough for me to transcribe accurately.
