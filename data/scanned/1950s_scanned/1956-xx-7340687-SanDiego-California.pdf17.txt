NOTE: THANK YOU FOR YOUR NICE AND KIND LETTER OF MARCH 21, 1956. SIGNED GEORGE J. FREEMAN, JR.
CHIEF CIVIL BRANCH, COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
BY THE WAY, THERE WAS A CIVILIAN RADIO SCHOOL AND COLLEGE NEAR THE SITE WHERE THIS SIGHTING OCCURRED THAT I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EVER MENTIONED. IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELEVANT OF YOURS. THAT WAS IN 1942.
IN REPLY TO T.C. SODA, THERE WAS A YELLOW FALLING OBJECT, BUT I CANNOT GIVE YOU A SATISFACTORY ANSWER. PLEASE CONSIDER THIS LETTER'S RETURN AS YOUR ANSWER.
