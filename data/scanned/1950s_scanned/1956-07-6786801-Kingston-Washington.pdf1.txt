10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    One object size of dime at arms
    length, unknown shape. Appeared in
    ESE at 50 dgrs elevation and disappeared 
    in the same position. Object faded.

11. COMMENTS
    Concur with the opinion of the
    reporting officer that this
    sighting was in all probability
    caused by a star. Although the
    Air Almanac fails to reveal any
    bright star at this exact spot,
    it is felt that any heavenly body
    in that same relative portion
    of the sky could have been the
    object in question.

12. CONCLUSIONS
    ☐ Was Balloon
    ☐ Possibly Balloon
    ☐ Probably Balloon
    ☐ Was Aircraft
    ☐ Possibly Aircraft
    ☐ Probably Aircraft
    ☐ Was Astronomical Star
    ☐ Possibly Astronomical
    ☒ Probably Astronomical
    ☐ Other______
    ☐ Insufficient Data for Evaluation
