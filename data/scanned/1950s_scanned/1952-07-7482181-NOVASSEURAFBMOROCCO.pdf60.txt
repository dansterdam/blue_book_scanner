The text in the document says:

"Agree with your conclusion that these sightings were of the 13 January events.

I am further aware of the fact that a few people in the Air Force, mostly in a position to evaluate such things concerning my books, do not agree with the conclusion arrived at by Project Blue Book at the time. This is not the reason why it is brought up here, but rather to state the whole UFO business.

The situation is due to the bad questioning of the pilots by the various investigators. This is evidenced by the inconsistencies of the incompleted information of the group at that time. But the group now believes us at ATIC are doing a pretty good job. And one by one, to agree at least with my help, the classic cases are being eliminated.

You have made public statements, as have I, I claim that my friend is much changed from what I knew or saw from NIC? that I have heard from you to date.

Yes desire UFO's as I indicated, in a rather special way, so that an object change in the U.S. could be an unknown - but I enclose with this some reasonable close explanation as to why we should not call variable air line pilots, unusual, confused, many of them started by reliable airline pilots, experts, conscientious, etc. I cannot insist many reports where an airline pilot has pulled his plane up to try to avoid a sighter sighter I think that the trouble with the NIC viewpoint is the influence that desires should be withheld on the books have withheld on certain related. Certainly correct, will never settle for anything less than a completely contesting the Air Force and insist from there that flying saucers have stopped from other space father than UR's I frankly prefer the Blue Air term general phenomenon."
