The image contains a hand-drawn diagram or sketch. It appears to be a diagram showing the movement or trajectory of some object, possibly a UFO or aerial phenomenon. There are annotations on the diagram, including the text "North" and "Still water, Okla" as well as descriptions of the object's movements and characteristics such as "two lights" and "apparatus resembling clouds". However, there does not appear to be any photograph present in this particular image.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text present in the document:
