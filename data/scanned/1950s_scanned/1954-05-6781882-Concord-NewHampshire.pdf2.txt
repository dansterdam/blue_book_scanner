Dear sirs:- 

On the night of June 8,
a metallic can easily 6 feet in diameter
and 2-3 feet high was observed, rotating,
and emitting pulsing lights, as it passed through
the sky at a high rate of speed.

So here goes: June 31
Lit offondantw to 19:15 m Concord & Laconia N.H. shen
my attention was caught by a bright light
hovering motionless for about 5 minutes,
at an estimated altitude of about 5,000 feet.
It was going in a northerly direction 
at an estimated speed of 500 mph.
It flashed at intervals of about 10 seconds.
All of a sudden the object disappeared, not
just disappearance, but definite point of
point extinction.
