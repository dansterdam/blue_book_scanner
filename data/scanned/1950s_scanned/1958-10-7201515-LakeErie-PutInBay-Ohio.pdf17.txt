Here is the text from the document:

"Mr. Commanding Officer:

This is to state that, on two occasions, I witnessed a strange object in the sky over my property near Put-In-Bay, Ohio. My cousin, who was with me on these occasions, also witnessed the same object.

The first time was on Sunday afternoon, September 21, 1958. My cousin and I were sitting on the back porch of my home when we noticed a strange object in the sky. It appeared to be about the size of an automobile and was moving silently at a high rate of speed. It was a bright silvery color and reflected the sunlight. It changed direction several times and made a sharp turn at one point which seemed impossible for a conventional aircraft to make.

The second time was on Sunday afternoon, October 5, 1958. My cousin and I were again sitting on the back porch when we noticed the same strange object. It appeared and behaved in the same manner as the first sighting.

As I stated, I have no information that would identify the object. It is definitely not a conventional aircraft of any kind that I am familiar with. I would be glad to discuss this further with you or provide any additional information that may be helpful.

He is also going to fill out an information card and mail it for your people."
