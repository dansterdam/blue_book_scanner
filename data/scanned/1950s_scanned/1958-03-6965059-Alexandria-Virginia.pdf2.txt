"Dear Sir:

at about 11:30 P.M. this evening a strange obect apparently came. I realized it at strange myseft--an object passing which I could not identify immediately, as it was some distance from me. 

The first clear view was as it approached on the horizon. It seemed to be at an altitude of between "25,000" and "50,000" feet. As it passed directly overhead just east of the home where I was standing, I observed it closely and could see no wings or propeller. The object had an apparent diameter of 40 or 50 feet and seemed to be lit up internally. It made no noise and traveled at tremendous speed (possibly some 1,500 miles per hour) passing between the second and third star in the handle of the dipper from the first to the last in the space of about 6 seconds.

I step forward to observe more closely, but as it drew near the house and seemed to be heading toward the city of Alexandria, I decided it would be unwise to continue watching and returned to the house.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]"
