TWO HUNTERS SEE ERIE SKY LIGHTS
The two hunters were hunting for elk in the mountains near Mount Cameron, Oregon, on the night of October 7, 1958 around 3 a.m. Tuesday morning. For about 20 minutes, as they were hunting for a campsite, a white and red light seemed to keep pace with them, hovering over a mountain or a camp fire.

Then the light, alternately bright and dim, sped toward the car, suddenly halting and nearing the ground to the right and slightly ahead of them. As the ground became illuminated, the lights went out.

Both men said the white light was the most brilliant with the red light beneath it.

They refused to remain in the area and returned to Sisters. There, they said, a wildlife inspector reported other groups had also seen the lights in the same general area. Bob Brant is employed by Southern Pacific R.R. and his brother is home on leave from the AIR FORCE.

Both said that they considered reporting the event to the state police, but did not because they thought the police would not believe them.
