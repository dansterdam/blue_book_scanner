AIR FORCE ARIADA CHASES, MISSES, DOGGES OVER ATLANTIC
May 11, 1957: Several of our members who are with local COG posts volunteered the following information, independently from both Brooklyn and Manhattan posts:
In the early morning hours of Saturday, May 11, a jet scramble involving a large number of military planes took place. Our Manhattan informant first reported that the planes were headed in the general direction of New England, but he was advised by official personnel that two jet squadrons (about 16 planes) had been dispatched - one from Stewart AFB in Newburgh, N.Y. and the other from a base on Cape Cod (presumably Otis AFB) - to investigate under observations by coastal radar patrol planes and picket boats, of three bogies heading inland south of Cape Cod in a southwesterly course. No contact with the unknown was made by the jets, and radar lost track of the objects.
