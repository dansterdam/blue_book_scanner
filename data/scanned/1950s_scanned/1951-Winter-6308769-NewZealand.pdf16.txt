Dear Sir,
Today I received your letter dated 20th April 1950. I have been very much interested in forwarding of magazines which I know always have it among my Kensipheir.
I am a simple man and live alone. Paid to wooly war II I had a small life on on the land in the mountains and that country in both north and south island of New Zealand. Since then I have not seen or even received news letters as they are, and I know words as other people do not bother to write to me, meaning and interesting feeling is now no more.
