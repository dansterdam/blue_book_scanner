11. Commander, Detachment 2, 500th AISS, Ladd AFB, Alaska.
A check with the Geophysical International Airport and at Kotzebue and with the Ladd AFB Weather Office revealed that no unusual weather conditions existed at the time of sighting and that no radiosondes balloons had been sent aloft at the time of sighting. The Geophysical Institute reported that no unusual atmospheric or astronomical disturbances had been reported in the Kotzebue area, and there was no seismic or magnetic activity recorded in the 11th Air Division at the time of the sighting. From the information obtained it is believed that the object could possibly have been a meteor but due to the brilliance and duration of the sight and the subsequent vapor trail, the sighting appears to have been unusually significant.

12. Negative.
