Dear Sir:

I am a member of the NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA, and my interest in flying saucers is very great.

About the sighting of a UFO photographed at Edwards Air Force Base? I was told that no such photographs were taken. I would like for you to verify this information, and that the films were immediately impounded by special agent equipment and that the films were forwarded to Air Technical Intelligence Center in Dayton, Ohio.

Well, if the film of the UFO should be exceptional, I would like to know what ATIC thinks about the films. If they do show what ATIC thinks about the films, if they do show what ATIC thinks are genuine UFOs, then it would be most important for the public to be told.

Also I have learned that well-known magazine writers were assigned by a national magazine to investigate the truth about flying saucers from the standpoint of the Air Force. But the article apparently never appeared. I would be interested in the results of this investigation, if any.

If I just can not understand why ATIC turned down the offer to print "the truth about flying saucers" or why ATIC could not have a book and demand "tome "to be well known of an official government report on UFO information is making to be more fantastic than the UFOTs "Mr. May" a report will make the Americans public even more confusing.

Most sincerely,
