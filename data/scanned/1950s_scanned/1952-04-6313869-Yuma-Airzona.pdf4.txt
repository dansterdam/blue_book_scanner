STATEMENT OF OBSERVER

On the 27th of April 1952, between the hours of 2030 and 2230, my wife and I, while sitting in our automobile at the Yuma Drive-In Theatre, at Yuma, Arizona, noticed what appeared to be a bright star-like object, but upon reflection it became apparent that this object was descending quite rapidly. After the object had descended to within approximately 1000 feet of the ground, it made a definite abrupt change of altitude disappearing in the clouds. Some 10 minutes later this object (C-2) similar objects reappeared, one at a time; after a few seconds one continued straight ahead the other veered slightly to the North and proceeded out of sight, disappearing into the clouds. All the objects sighted which numbered approximately 7 or 8 were traveling from East to West and appeared to be maneuvering in a very orderly fashion. 
Being a tower operator and being familiar with Jet Aircraft and other types, I can very sure it could not have been an aircraft of any sort as objects have been an aileron or any other object reports on flying saucers or such as they are more distinct and can very definitely state that their abrupt change of direction was not normal appearance.
