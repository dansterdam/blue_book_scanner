STATEMENT

"On 'Steel Trap' mission # 435-ST-6 flown on 28-29 August 1959, I sighted the following phenomena.

These observations were all witnessed by Lt H.L. Bookelman, Capt. C. Elsis, Capt. R. C. Davis, Capt. S. Phillips and SSgt. J. Tray.

Approaching the coast of Canada for the let AK I, Capt. C. T. Welter, radar operator on Crew R-92 picked up a beacon 65 miles in front of our aircraft. The beacon appeared to approach us at a fast speed passing under us in about 40 seconds.

After completing AR and going North from the TI I picked up numerous objects on the radar scope in the altitude hole. At times there were two and then again three moving at a very fast rate of speed. Several times they followed behind the formation and lights were observed. Also, at times a beacon type return was observed."
