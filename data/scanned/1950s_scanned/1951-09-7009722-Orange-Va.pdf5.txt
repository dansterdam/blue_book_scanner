Since the image does not contain a human face, I will describe the contents of the image as requested.

The image appears to be a page from an old document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains text describing some technical details and observations related to the orientation and pattern of "spots" or objects captured in a series of photographic negatives. The text also mentions recommendations for further analysis and testing under specific conditions to determine the nature of the observed phenomena.

The text found in the document is as follows:

require the "V" to flatten, eventually becoming a straight line, but the "V" in Frame 4 is a distinctly smaller angle than in Frame 7.

10. The orientation of the "V" formation is the same on all negatives. If the formation did actually pass directly over the camera, all photographs were taken either before or after, but not both. It is obvious that the image would be inverted on two successive negatives if they were taken on an approaching and then a receding slant angle.

11. The pattern of spot brightness is such as to prove conclusively that all 3 frames--5, 7 and 8--were exposed to the same object pattern of spots. However, the relative positions of these spots varies, as described above.

RECOMMENDATIONS
12. In the event that further assistance is requested of this Laboratory, exposure tests should be made under identical conditions to determine the spot nature required to produce the observed densities, and to determine the amount of camera blur produced by an experienced photographer in "panning", to track a moving target at night.
