The image appears to contain a grainy, black-and-white photograph. The photograph depicts what seem to be multiple indistinct objects or shapes floating in the sky against a hazy, cloudy background. The objects appear to be somewhat blurry and difficult to make out clearly.

STATEMENT OF ROSARIO A. FUENTE, 342 EAST 114TH STREET, NEW YORK 29, NEW YORK 
On July 7, 1952, at about 10:25 p.m., I was standing in front of 342 East 114th Street, New York, looking up at the sky when I saw some strange objects in the sky. 
The objects were round and white in color, and were traveling at a high rate of speed. They were visible for about 2 or 3 minutes. 
I was so intrigued by what I saw that I called the police station at 115th Street and Lenox Avenue. The officer on duty told me that they had received several other calls about strange objects in the sky, and that they were dispatching someone to investigate. 
I remained outside for about 15 minutes, but the objects disappeared and did not return.
