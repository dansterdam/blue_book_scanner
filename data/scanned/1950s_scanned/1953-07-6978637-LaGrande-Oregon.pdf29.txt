AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (STATION) NNR 5962 AISS 
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
22 JULY 1953

ON 12 JULY 1953 AT ABOUT 10:15 PM MST, TWO INDIVIDUALS, CIVILIAN OBSERVERS FROM LA GRANDE, OREGON, REPORTED THE OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.
THE OBJECTS WERE FIRST SIGHTED IN THE NORTHEAST SKY, MOVING IN A GENERAL WESTERLY DIRECTION. THEY WERE FLYING AT A RAPID RATE OF SPEED AND APPEARED TO VARY IN THEIR ALTITUDE OR SPEED. THEY WERE OBSERVED FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 15 MINUTES.
THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND EMITTED A BLUE-GREEN LIGHT. THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECTS.
IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE OF UNCONVENTIONAL NATURE AND WERE NOT CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, BALLOONS, OR ANY OTHER KNOWN OR EXPLAINABLE PHENOMENA.
THE EXTREME SPEED AND ALTITUDE VARIATIONS OF THE OBJECTS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WITHOUT DOUBT WHAT THEY WERE. THEY COULD HAVE BEEN CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OBSERVED UNDER UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT IN VIEW OF THE RELIABLE NATURE OF THE WITNESSES AND THEIR INSISTENCE THAT THE OBJECTS WERE OF UNCONVENTIONAL NATURE, WE ARE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THEIR REPORT AS AN OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.
