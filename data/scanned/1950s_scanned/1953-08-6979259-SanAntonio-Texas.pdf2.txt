The image contains a photographic depiction of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object is depicted as a dark silhouette against a lighter background. The image is accompanied by text, which I will extract verbatim below.

On Aug 5, 1953, I was working with Mr. [REDACTED] at the home of [REDACTED] on [REDACTED] in San Antonio, Texas, at about 1600 hrs. Mr. [REDACTED] called my attention to an object in the air, which was indistinguishable to the naked eye. I verify that the object gave off no trails, disintegration, or smoke, and that it remained in the sky for some time. It moved back and forth several times of an arc of about 180 degree can't be estimated, and it moved back and forth over me. I would say that the object was about the size of a B-29 and was it moved fast and was extremely fast in its motions.
I carefully that this statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
