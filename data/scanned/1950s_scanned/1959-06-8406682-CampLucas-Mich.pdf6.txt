UFO REPORTED
BARNES (Major L. T. Fanslow)

11 AUG 1959

1. The following information is in answer to items checked in Mr. XXXXX's letter:

A. Your office is aware of the identity of the present project officer.
B. The information provided with the original submission was supplemented with the following additional Information:
(1) Type of sighting.
(2) Type of lights.
(3) Character speed.
(4) Diagram drawing.
(5) In what direction was object sighted? 
(6) Location of sun, if taken during the day.
(7) The exact time of day.
(8) Sky conditions.
(9) Location of observer.

The white light was seen to expand and contract as it changed position. It appeared to be at an altitude of 3000 to 5000 feet and was moving rapidly in a northerly direction. Two yellow and one white light were observed flying in formation at a high altitude. On some occasions, such as the report, the lights would suddenly increase their speed and disappear from sight. The observer is readily, if the white light is behind the other smaller lights, only the yellow lights will be visible. This may account for any discrepancy in the number of lights observed at any given time. The purpose of this information is to clarify the original report as completely as possible.
