SUMMARY: (Some details omitted or illegible) On the 28th of July 1952, at 1915 CST, Mr... (illegible) of the 440th AC&W Squadron, Williams Bay, Wisc., observed five (5) objects flying at a very high altitude in the vicinity of Milwaukee. The objects appeared to be circular in shape, in the (500) size range, and were traveling at an estimated altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet. The objects were moving at a fast rate of speed, were operating individually, and showed no exhaust or contrails. All maneuvering of the objects was abrupt and erratic. The aerial phenomena was observed for a period of 15 to 20 minutes.

The visual sighting was confirmed by radar. The range of the objects was 3,500 to 4,500 yards. At one point, the objects formed a circular pattern and then separated to individual flight. The radar operator stated that the blips were very clear and distinct. The altitude shown by the radar was 20,000 to 25,000 feet.

Aircraft reported flying were two-way planes in the local area.
