Dear Sir Force Base, Delaware
22 February 1952

At approximately 2:00 hours, 22 February, acting in my capacity as O.D., I received a call from a [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] who reported that a strange object was observed and was moving in a strange fashion in the area. He estimated the object to be 4-5Â° above the horizon from his view-point, moving further to North and approximately over the town of Frederic, Delaware.

He further stated that the object appeared to be approaching and that it was predominately yellow in color. However, it also appeared to be slowly changing color, turning white, green, and red at various times. 

I immediately contacted the Dover AFB Tower to see if the tower personnel were able to observe this object. I was informed that they could not see any object to the above description in the direction I gave them.

I then stepped outside of the Base Theatre and was able to see this object due West of the base.

I estimated the object to be moving at approximately 500 to 600 mph and over the town of [redacted] which is West of the base.

I advised the ATIC of this phenomenon. Mr. [redacted] had further information on this incident that I do not have.

I feel that the object was manned and of a superior performance. The gradual change of color was quite odd and may have been some form of propulsion or control operation.
