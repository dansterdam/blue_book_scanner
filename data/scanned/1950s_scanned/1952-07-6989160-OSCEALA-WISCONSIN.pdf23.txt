CASE # (contd)
of first sighting due to a SOC report of visual sightings of unidentified flying objects.

One P-51 aircraft was sent to sighting area for purpose of intercepting and/or
identifying unknown targets. The--e ,--  /ee-ere Pilot did report visually sighting
unidentified flying object but interception and/or identification was not possible.
This action occurred between 0138C and 02580. 

One P-51 aircraft was in an area 50 to 70 nautical me me miles S and SSE of
N'/31-92/38-5 ,,4Z between the altitudes of 6,000 to 10,000' during the sighting period.

ATIC Comment:
Reports indicate that anomalous propagation was affecting the radar performance.
This condition would allow detection of ground targets which are not normally detected.
This would not explain movement of targets unless weather conditions were such that
every target (ground) was not detected in each sweep of the antenna thereby causing
an apparent movement of stationary targets.

A firm analysis cannot be made.

Conclusions:

Unknown
