30 JULY 1952
TRUE S.CB. STATEMENTS CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING AIRCRAFT
On 27 June, July 22, 1952, at 9:10 a.m. we observed two silver or 
aluminum colored objects for several minutes in an easterly direction. 
The objects were in formation, appearing to be controlled aircraft.
They were silvery bright, some elongated and others rounded in shape.
They moved in a jerky, erratic fashion, accelerating rapidly, their speed
being far greater than any jet aircraft. They were clearly defined and, in our opinion, no controlled aircraft as we know them could perform such maneuvers. They appeared to be about 1000 feet high and
traveled for some 30 to 60 seconds, then disappeared from sight in a 
rapid upward motion.
I was an airplane spotter on the east coast during the last war and did have a total of 1,150 hours doing this work. I am familiar with all presently qualified to fly aircraft and what they can do. These objects were, in my opinion, something strange and, while I cannot
offer any solution, I can state that they were not of a conventional
nature in any way, shape or form. They presented a strange and baffling
phenomenon to us both.
