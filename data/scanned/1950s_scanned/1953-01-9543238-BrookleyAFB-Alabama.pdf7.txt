STATEMENT OF: Captain Douglas G. [REDACTED]

I certify that the following was observed by me while attending a drive-in movie, between 2015 and 2030 on the night of 1 January 1953.

I saw this light when it was approximately 90° to my left. It was traveling at a constant altitude of 2000-2500 feet on a bearing of north. The object appeared to be 1 to 2 feet in diameter of bluish white in color with a small exhaust trail. The speed of the object was estimated at 250-300 knots. It traveled through approximately 80° of an arc in 30 seconds and appeared to short a climbing turn and disappeared, just as though someone had turned off a light switch.

The object was approximately 1 mile away and it looked like the exhaust of a F-84 with afterburner going. As it approached, the windows of the car were up and the loudspeaker was on. I could not see anything at all to identify it as an aircraft, as there were no lights on the object. Weather at the time was clear with unrestricted visibility.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
[REDACTED] DIG $20.10
