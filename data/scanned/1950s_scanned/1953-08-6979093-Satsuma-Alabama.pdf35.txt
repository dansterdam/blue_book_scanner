The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is titled "AEROSPACE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER UNITED STATES AIR FORCE" and is dated 4 MAY 1960.

Transcription of the text in the document:

AEROSPACE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER 
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
OHIO

SUBJECT: Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO)

TO: SAFOJ-34 (Maj Tacker)

1. Reference attached letter with enclosed current issue of APRO Bulletin to APRC from Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, dated 20 April 1960.

2. ATIC is interested in any physical evidence or data which will assist in determining the nature of the phenomena. It is requested that APRO furnish a sample of the material and the technical report concerning the incident described in the bulletin. This material should be forwarded to ATIC as soon as possible.

3. A search of reference material in the ATIC technical library failed to reveal the name of the organization or the article on the incident carried in the APRO Bulletin.

4. For your information, the details of the Satsuma sighting closely resemble those of the incidents of a similar nature which took place on Santa Rosa Island, Florida, on 23 June 1952. However, the fact that the Satsuma incident is claimed to be a hoax should be borne in mind.

5. ATIC files reveal no record of the New Haven, Connecticut case mentioned in the APRO Bulletin. This case would be relatively unreliable, and probably quite useless.
