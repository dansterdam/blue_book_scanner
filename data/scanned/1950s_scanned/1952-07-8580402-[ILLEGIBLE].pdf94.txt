Air Force Intelligence:
Dear Sirs,
I want to report a strange object I saw at 11:00 p.m. on the night of July 23-52. Also I have a rough sketch of the object and will enclose with this letter. Below is how I saw it.
After listening to the Democratic Conv. at 11:00 p.m. of 7-23-52 I went outside about the sky, for I had read in the past week of flying saucers reportedly seen over Louisville, and after that I begin looking for them, for I had previously saw them in 1948 & 1949. I live in Russel Co. which is located in the S. Eastern part of Ky. At time I saw object it was S. West of me, at a range I would say of from 50 miles to 150 miles., and at a height of around 5,000 ft. Its movement was West North West while I watched it. It moved in a bouncing line to the North for what I thought to be 5 to 10 miles, then it seemed to make a xxx slight swinging motion, and then it begin a dive toward the earth for what seemed to be 500 ft. and it looked as if it just stopped, but as I watched on it begin to fade into the distance.
There was no sound, and the distance I was from it. It looked about 2 to 3 ft. across.
What I have said and the sketch I have submitted resembles what I saw here in Russel Springs, and so I am writing to report this.
Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
