Output of the text in the document:

about the size of a head peach, it had a light on it somewhere. i cant be sure, but i believe it might have been a little larger than a canteloupe. i guess about how a night light looks like a smaller bright oval light source in the darkness. i dreamed last night, and oh heavens the light on this thing just lit up the whole woods around me. the light was intense, bluish white, and the other side a reddish glow. i saw it move, at first slowly, then it seemed to shoot up into the sky and out of sight. my gosh the cold chills i got just thinking about it now. i don't know how long i lay watching this thing, must have been a half hour or more. i just feel so lucky to have seen it, yet at the same time, i wish i had never seen it. i feel my gir not be very trustworthy about what i saw as she would think i was just seeing things. i told her a little about it, but only enough to say there was a strange light in the woods i saw last night, and she said i must have been dreaming. but i know what i saw, and it wasn't any dream.
