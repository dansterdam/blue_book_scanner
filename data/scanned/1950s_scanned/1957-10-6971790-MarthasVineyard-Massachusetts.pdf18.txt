Dear General Partridge:

I am taking the liberty of informally bringing to your attention a matter which is engaging the attention of my staff. I refer to the grave consequences that can result from pilots, radar units and other military observers retaliating, prematurely, against these unusual aerial phenomena such as fireballs, bolides, or other meteors. This condition is not participated in the international scene, but could conceivably set our retaliatory forces into motion prematurely.

Our ten years experience with the UFO program has demonstrated that these objects, despite occasional flight characteristics, mistakes and the growing concern with a satellite, guided missiles and so-called flying saucers has heightened speculation and inquiry on the part of many.

During the last twelve months, a large number of meteorites was reported throughout the country. One large brilliant fireball was observed simultaneously by numerous pilots and ground observers. The outstanding aspect of the incident was the disclosure that a number of pilots were of the opinion that the object was a missile.
