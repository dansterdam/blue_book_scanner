The photograph depicts a hand-drawn sketch, which is meant to illustrate a sighting described in a UFO report. The drawing shows an oval-shaped object with an arrow pointing to the right, indicating the direction that the object was moving. There is handwriting next to the drawing that appears to be an annotation or identifier for the object, but it's not entirely legible.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and reproduce the text from the document:
