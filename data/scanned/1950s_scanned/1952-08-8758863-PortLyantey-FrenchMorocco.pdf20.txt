"Near Waok, I'm, D.C. a circular object, to me, by a U.S. observer on that date I also notified you can see to over and why instant the result.

I have received no acknowledgement of these things from those in the Air Force.

In my opinion, not being skilled in the matter, the object must be intelligently directing. While several of these things in the heavens have been mutilated during the missile testing for some little or on some other things in an area one near object to me on to me with other and other.

Very truly yours,
