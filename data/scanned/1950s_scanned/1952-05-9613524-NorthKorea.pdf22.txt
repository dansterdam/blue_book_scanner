COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
1. The unidentified object sighted by Lt. McCarthy was also seen by 2 other men in the control tower. They described the object as "flat-oval" and "aluminum in color". The object was larger than a fighter plane and it made no noise as it crossed the sky. This corroborates Lt. McCarthy's observation.
