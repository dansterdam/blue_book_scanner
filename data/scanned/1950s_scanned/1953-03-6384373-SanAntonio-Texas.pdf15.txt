The witness describes seeing a bright object in the sky that moved in a north and easterly course at a very high rate of speed. Occasionally one would change course and circle the city at approximately 15 mile radius in a clockwise direction. The speed appeared to be faster than any aircraft known at the time. The witness states that one of the objects passed through the hole light of the moon and a trail similar to a comet appeared, but the trail did not persist for long.
