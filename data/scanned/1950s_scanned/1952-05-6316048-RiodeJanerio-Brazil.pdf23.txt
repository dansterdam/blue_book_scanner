About 8:15 pm, May 7, 1952,
President Garcia EL CORONADO, accompanied by General Franco, Brig. Gen. SANTOS DUMONT. and others, were flying at an altitude of about 2,000 feet in an army plane from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Belo Horizonte, Brazil. 
They suddenly saw a strange light in the distance, and as their plane approached it, they could clearly see a disc-shaped craft of tremendous size hovering motionless in the air.
The President ordered the pilot to take the plane closer to the object, and when they were within about 300 yards of it, they could see that it was a huge, circular craft, estimated to be about 150 feet in diameter. It was completely silent and was emitting a faint blue glow. 
The President and the others in the plane were greatly impressed by what they saw. They continued to watch the object for about 4 or 5 minutes, during which time it did not make any perceptible movement. 
Then, suddenly, the object Shot upward at a fantastic speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. The pilots and passengers were completely bewildered by what they had witnessed.
President Garcia EL CORONADO, General Franco, and Brig. Gen. SANTOS DUMONT, who were highly respected and credible witnesses, provided this report of their sighting.
