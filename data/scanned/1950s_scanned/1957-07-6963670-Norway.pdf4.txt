There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, with only text visible.

JULY 9, 1957 an OBSERVATION did developed for some time afterward.
It was only after the film was developed that two witnesses noticed an unusual object. The witness saw that there was no more trail than a film. This odd object was near the moon and was quite small.
The witness reports so have resulted from a discussion as the man's view passed all impressions as a clear. The object appeared of light passing to the left. This could only have stayed a few more than a flash, so the photographer, as the camera passed only a specific position, could not have obtained more than a flash."
