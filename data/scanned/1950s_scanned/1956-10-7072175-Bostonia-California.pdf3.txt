STATEMENT OF ___________________________________________________ DATE_10 Jan 57

and went into the church that was near, to wait for the exposure. 
It didn't make to much difference as to how long the exposure should be, as I didn't keep track of the time. I know that it was there no shorter than ten min; and no longer than 20 min. Within this time, I went out again & cliched the camera and turned the picture for the next exposure.
