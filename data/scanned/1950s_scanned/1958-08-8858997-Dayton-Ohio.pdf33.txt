The image appears to contain two hand-drawn sketches. The top sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with a series of lines emerging from one point to illustrate how high the observed object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it.

The bottom sketch depicts a landscape scene, with a person standing on a road and two different perspectives of the same landscape, one with the object higher in the sky and one with the object lower.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the image:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was when you last saw it.

In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
