Dear Sir:

I have received a letter from George Kenney of the Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C. (GKW:mh 2 March) suggesting that I contact you concerning some information that I received in this connection.

Could you please give me your opinion on this matter? - or my knowledge on this better? As I advised Mr. George Kenney I received a letter from Mrs. Lorenson, giving you the facts of the case.

I would also like information on the U.S. transport air force plans with respect to some of the recent reported sightings of unidentified flying objects - as I remember reading in the newspapers.

I would like to receive an answer as soon as possible pending a news broadcast. I wish to thank you for taking this in the reading of this letter.

Kindest Personal Regards,
News Director of Radio Station _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
