7. CONCLUSIONS: There are numerous sightings similar to this one on file with the USAF and are attempts to explain them as celestial objects or astronomical phenomena but no definite identification or explanation has been made.

8. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Negative.

9. TEMPERATURE: Aircraft was under control of GCI on another mission so it could not maneuver closer for a better observation.

10. AIR TRAFFIC: Other traffic in the general area included a C-54 aircraft that was 25 miles NW of the object's position. This aircraft also reported the unidentified radar track.
