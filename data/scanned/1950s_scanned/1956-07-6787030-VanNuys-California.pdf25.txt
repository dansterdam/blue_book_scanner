AT APPROXIMATELY 9:40 P.M. ON JULY 6, 1956, A LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY WAS PATROLLING NEAR VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA, WHEN HE OBSERVED A LUMINOUS OBJECT MOVING ERRATICALLY ACROSS THE SKY. THE OBJECT WAS REPORTEDLY ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE AND GAVE OFF A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT.

THE DEPUTY STOPPED HIS CAR AND WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. HE REPORTED THAT IT SEEMED TO MOVE SILENTLY AND CHANGE DIRECTIONS ABRUPTLY. AS HE CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THE OBJECT, IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

THE DEPUTY IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO HIS STATION. OFFICERS WERE DISPATCHED TO THE AREA BUT WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE OBJECT UPON THEIR ARRIVAL.

THIS INCIDENT WAS INVESTIGATED AND REPORTED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK, THE AIR FORCE'S OFFICIAL PROGRAM FOR INVESTIGATING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.
