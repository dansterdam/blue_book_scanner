My sister, my children and I first saw the object while watching a favorite television program. It appeared to be a circular object much larger and more brilliant than a television screen. At first we thought it was an airplane but as it came closer we saw that it had no lights on it and made no noise. It did not have the usual appearance of an airplane.

The object seemed about 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was white or silver in color. It appeared to be glowing or illuminated from within. It moved slowly across the sky at an estimated speed of 200 to 300 mph. As it moved, it changed directions and stopped and started several times. After watching it for about 10 to 12 minutes it suddenly accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared from sight in about 2 to 3 seconds. We all stood and observed it and discussed it for about 10 minutes then we said the thought it was other than any ordinary aircraft we had ever seen before. It was quite alarming but also interesting. We watched the clock to time it and believe the total time it was visible was about 12 to 15 minutes.
