I have a story of sighting which is of some interest. On the evening of 19 February, 1954. I was travelling on a Rangitane bus between Christchurch and Timaru, and I noticed at a place some 25 miles south of Rangitata a strange object in the sky. This was quite unlike anything I had seen before. It was roughly circular in shape, a reddish brown color, and was moving at a tremendous speed across the sky from north to south. I would estimate its length to be approximately 100-150 feet. It was a most impressive sight. The object left no trail and made no sound. It seemed to be high in the atmosphere, possibly some 10,000 feet or more. After about 3 minutes it disappeared from sight, not descending, but simply appearing to vanish. I am certain that what I saw was not an aircraft of any type, either civil or military. I reported the incident to the R.A.F. at Christchurch, and later to the U.S. Air Force Intelligence officer at Timaru. I was questioned at some length, and was asked to make this written report. I am satisfied that what I saw could not possibly have been an aircraft, meteorite, or any other natural phenomena. I am convinced that I witnessed some kind of unidentified flying object. I should be interested to know if any other reports of a similar nature were received at about the same time and place.
