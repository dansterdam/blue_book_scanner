There is no photograph present on the page. Below is the extracted text from the document:

And there is another photographic procedure which we will soon put into use, again with Air Defense Command assistance. In this we will employ ordinary still cameras equipped with a special diffraction grid. Any photographs thus secured will be subjected to spectrum analysis in an attempt to analyze light sources.

  I believe that is all. We will remain here for as long as you like for questions. Are there any questions?

  Thank you.
