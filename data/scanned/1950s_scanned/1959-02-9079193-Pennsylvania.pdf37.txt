HELL SOUGHT BY RICKCYER
According to Venus Pinkell, From Feruson, Pereia
Washington, March 30, 1959 -
A woman in Ferguson, Peoria, claims to have been left unharmed after a hellish encounter with a strange object she says hovered above her home recently.
Mrs. Venus Pinkell, wife of a local salesman, says the object appeared to be "like a huge glowing ball" and left her with a strong odor of sulfur.
The object, according to Mrs. Pinkell, seemed to seek her out and hover just above the trees near her home. She says she was overwhelmed by a strong feeling of terror.
"I have never been so frightened in my life," she told reporters. "It was as if the object wanted me."
Despite her fear, Mrs. Pinkell says she was not physically harmed in any way. The object, she says, simply hovered for a time and then sped away at a tremendous speed.
Local authorities are investigating the incident, but so far have been unable to offer any explanation for Mrs. Pinkell's strange experience.
