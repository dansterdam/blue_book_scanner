The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page of text from a Project Blue Book document discussing the Chesapeake Bay case and the Nash-Fortenberry and Tombaugh sightings.

The text states that these two UFO cases have "never been completely explained" and that the details are "fully described" though the "probable type of mechanism involved is clear in each case." It mentions that on July 14, 1952, a Pan-American DC-4 was flying from New York to Miami, carrying ten passengers and a crew.

The Chesapeake Bay Case. 
Two of the most famous UFO cases, the Nash-Fortenberry and 
the Tombaugh sightings, have never been completely explained 
even though the witnesses have usually competent, the incidents 
fully described, and the basic facts not in dispute. Although the 
probable type of mechanism involved is clear in each case, determining specifically what factors combined to exactly what way to 
produce the phenomenon has so far proved impossible. Neither case, 
however, supports the theory that the UFO had an extraterrestrial 
origin.
On the evening of July 14, 1952, a Pan-American DC-4 was flying 
from New York to Miami, carrying ten passengers and a crew.
