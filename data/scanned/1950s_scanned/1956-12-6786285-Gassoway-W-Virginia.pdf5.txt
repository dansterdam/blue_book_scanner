OBJECT AND DESCENDED SO AZIMUTH AND ELEVATION WAS NOT DISCERNIBLE.
D. THE OBJECT CAME IN FROM A WESTERLY HEADING AND PILOT, THINKING IT WAS A B-47, TURNED DOWN AND INTO THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT PROCEEDED WHEN HE WAS UNABLE TO CLOSE WITH IT AND IT CONTINUED TO TURN WITH HIM ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TURN. THE PILOT KNEW THERE WERE NO OTHER FIGHTERS AIRBORNE AT THE TIME AND OTHER AIRCRAFT STATIONED IN THE VICINITY COULD NOT TURN OUTSIDE THE FIGHTER'S TURNING RADIUS. THE OBJECT PASSED BETWEEN THE INTERCEPTOR AND THE CITY OF AGANA, GUAM, AND AT THIS TIME NO SILHOUETTE WAS SEEN. THE OBJECT PROCEEDED SOUTH FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES AT THE PILOTS ALTITUDE (20,000 MSL) THEN IT CLIMBED TO ABOUT 30,000 MSL AND CAME DIRECTLY OVER INTERCEPTOR. PILOT TURNED AIRCRAFT TO KEEP IT IN SIGHT AND IT STARTED CIRCLING HIM. THE INTERCEPTOR WAS PLACED IN AFTERBURNER AND TURNED IN TO THE OBJECT TRYING TO HEAD IT OFF. IT CONTINUED TO TURN AROUND AIRCRAFT AND HE WAS UNABLE TO GAIN ON IT OR CLOSE WITH IT. THEN IT PROCEEDED WEST AT AIRCRAFT ALTITUDE AND RETURNED OVER FIGHTER AT 10 TO 15,000 FEET HIGH. PILOT AGAIN TURNED TO KEEP IT IN SIGHT AND IT CIRCLED FIGHTER AGAIN. AT THIS TIME PILOT HAD TO BREAK OFF AND RETURN TO ANDERSEN AIR FORCE BASE DUE TO LOW FUEL REMAINING. E. CONTACT WAS
