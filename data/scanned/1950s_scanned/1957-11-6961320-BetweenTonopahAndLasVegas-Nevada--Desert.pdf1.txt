Project 10073R Record Card
1. DATE: 2 November 1957
2. LOCATION: Between Tonopah and Las Vegas, Nevada - Desert
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 23/1312Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. DURATION: 20 minutes
6. SOURCE: Military-Air Force
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 20 minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 4 
9. COURSE: Straight
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Four disc-shaped objects observed from a ground radar station. The objects approached Las Vegas at a high rate of speed, when source approached objects they slowly disappeared behind nearby low hills with an almost unnoticeable climb that became completely invisible even when radar continued to track them. Objects reported as resembling targets of opportunity that were neither positively identified.
11. COMMENTS: Considered an optical illusion similar to a mirage, possibly due to wind, heat and dust conditions, half light conditions and flat country with poor horizon cal which makes distinction difficult.
