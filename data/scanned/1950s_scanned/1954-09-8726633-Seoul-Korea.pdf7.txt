AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The text in the document reads as follows:

AT. CORP INTELLIGENCE AFG 74 - IS MED 27451 REPORT 1:

HEADQUARTERS 51ST FIGHTER INTERCEPTOR WING, APO 970

The fighters were scrambled from the airbase. The pilots were called and then went to their aircraft, started the engines, and then went to the scramble area radioing their control that they were airborne and ready to intercept. Additional pilot fighters were airborne shortly after the first fighters. They were unable to sight the unidentified aircraft due to the poor visibility and the failure of the previous pilots to obtain precise navigational information. After about an hour and a half of fruitless searching the flights were recalled. It was estimated that the unidentified aircraft had travelled at a speed of about 600 knots. The nearest city is about 75 miles from the airbase and there was no report of any civilian air activity in the area at that time. The pilots described the object as being several times larger than a B-29 and traveling at a very high rate of speed.
