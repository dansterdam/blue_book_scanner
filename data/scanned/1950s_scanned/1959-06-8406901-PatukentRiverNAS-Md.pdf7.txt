Memo Routing Slip
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: Patuxent River NAS, Md.
DATE: 9 June 1959
SUBJECT: 

Larry Rafferty, this letter which we discussed on 14 June 1959 and which was treated as a CIRVIS report in Hamilton, Ohio 114, was from the Patuxent River, and called to our attention a TACAN as a CIRVIS. It was reported in the local newspaper, but our efforts to pin it down were not successful. The case was filed and no further action was taken. 
The sighting from the Patuxent River is similar but I do not believe we want to take any action on it at this time. A helicopter there is said to pick it up. We reported a TACAN-1 type earlier, but they could not duplicate it. 
This would be unidentifiable otherwise. It is possible this is the light 29 April 1959 concerning Patuxent River which was filed the same as the present one. In any event, it is being filed in accordance with routine procedure, and no action is contemplated.
INDICATED ACTION: FILED DED   TELEPHONE:
