A typewritten slip attached to my report of the previous evening, under date of April 16, 1954, states that a final report on this matter is enclosed. I regret that I was mistaken complete detail as to my exact recollections and what I actually saw and heard, which is of course diminished and certain matters in question.

As of 10:30 minutes next night, I would state with my problem son view was not obstructed noticing a rounds of the same objects seen previously evening, circling and maneuvering over the vicinity as though on patrol or inspection. I am satisfied I could identify the objects if seen again.
