CASE No. 6287
LOCATION: COBURN, VIRGINIA
DATE: FEBRUARY 6, 1959
STATEMENT OF MRS. VIRGINIA COBURN:
On the evening of February 6, 1959, at about 8:00 p.m. EST, I was looking out of the window of my home in Coburn, Virginia, when I observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be moving in an erratic manner, zigzagging back and forth. I called my husband to come and look at the object. He confirmed that he also saw the strange light in the sky. The light disappeared from view after a few minutes.
