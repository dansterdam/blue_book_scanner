Velocities. Those which partly survive the friction of the earth's atmosphere and fall to the ground, frequently with the startling light and sound effects reported by our observer, are called meteorites. Unusually brilliant meteors are called fireballs. These often leave luminous trails that may persist as long as an hour after the fireball itself has disappeared. Daylight meteors frequently do not appear luminous, but do leave a trail, and often no noise is heard. Sometimes meteors explode in mid-air. These are called bolides.

Of the meteors which fall daily, about 25 million are visible to the naked eye. Most of them appearing as the "shooting stars" that occasionally dart across the sky at night. Yet very few of these are ever found, for it is probable that most meteors are a body no larger than a pinhead. One no larger than a golf ball may appear as bright as the full moon. Small wonder, then that meteors and their derivatives suggest themselves as likely explanations of many UAP sightings.

Another astronomical phenomenon which may provide an answer to some of these sightings is the recurrent brilliance of our nearest planet, the familiar morning and evening star -- the planet Venus. It outshines all celestial bodies except the sun and the moon, and, near the times of its greatest brilliancy, it is plainly visible to the naked eye even at midday, when attention is directed to it. It outshines Sirius, the brightest star, by fifteen times. Venus, when as bright as this, and shining through atmospheric disturbances, could easily give the effect of a flaming object with a tail -- a description featured in many UAP reports. So could Mercury, or the red planet Mars.
