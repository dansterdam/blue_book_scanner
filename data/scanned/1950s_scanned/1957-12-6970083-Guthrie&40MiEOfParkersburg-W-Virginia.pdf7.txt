10. Lockbourne AFB operations stated that several E-47's had landed shortly after 0330Z, 12 Dec 57, and were possibly in the local area for a period of time before landing.

11. It seemed like an aircraft. I thought that I had land ship on the scope at 10 miles, but when turning from 060° to 310° the object went from 060° to 310° in a matter of seconds. This movement was not consistent with any type of aircraft known to us 'n'-33 or an F-86L.
