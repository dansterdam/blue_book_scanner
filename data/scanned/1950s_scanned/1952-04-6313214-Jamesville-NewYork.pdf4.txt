AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. Information came to the attention of this office that about 10:15 pm on 23 Feb 1952 an object described as brilliant, round and approximately 50 feet in diameter was observed in the sky over Jamesville, New York. This object was seen to be silvery in color and to descend slowly from about 4,000 feet altitude to about 2,000 feet, at which point it hovered for a few minutes and then accelerated rapidly upward out of sight.

2. On 29 Apr 1952, after a further investigation of this report, the following additional information was obtained: The witness who first reported this observation was a [REDACTED], who was a member of the New York State Police and a part-time deputy sheriff. He stated that he and [REDACTED] were driving from Syracuse to Jamesville when they observed the object. They watched it for a period of about 10 minutes and both stated that the object appeared to be completely under intelligent control. [REDACTED] also stated that the object made no sound and that he could not determine its exact distance or size. He said that the object's movements were not erratic, but rather controlled and purposeful. The report and the investigating officer's conclusions were forwarded to higher headquarters.
