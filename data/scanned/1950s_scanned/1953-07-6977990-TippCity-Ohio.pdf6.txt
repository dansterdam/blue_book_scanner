SIGNAL CODE:

DATE: 8 July 1953 

Upon stepping outside of enclosed porch at about 6:15PM, attention was directed upward by a passing personal plane. The object was of such brilliance that it was immediately noted above and ahead of the plane which was flying NNW. The three others of my family were called and also observed the object. At this time it was stationary. After the plane passed, the object moved rapidly upward at high speed, turned to the south at a sharp angle and continued to move away rapidly finally disappeared either because of distance or in the clouds. Clouds were lower in the south than over Tipp City.
