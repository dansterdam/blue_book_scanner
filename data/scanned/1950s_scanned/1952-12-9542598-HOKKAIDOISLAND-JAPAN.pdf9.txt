STATEMENT

On 29 December 1952, I was the pilot of a night-scrambled F-94, orbiting at 15,000 feet over the Hokaido area, Japan. My radar scope showed the usual pattern of ground targets and aircraft when suddenly a brilliant light, which was apparently below the altitude of 15,000 feet, appeared in my line of vision. This light was stationary and shaped like a star. As I watched, its color changed from red to white to green to blue, finally returning to red. The changes in color were complete and rapid, taking place in a matter of seconds. The light remained stationary for 2-3 minutes, then suddenly it accelerated at a speed which I estimated to be over 1,500 mph and disappeared from sight. I immediately notified ground control of what I had observed, but was informed that they had no apparent movements on their radar whatsoever. From 17:01 until about 19:55, when I returned to base, I continually kept a sharp watch, but saw no further indications of this object.
