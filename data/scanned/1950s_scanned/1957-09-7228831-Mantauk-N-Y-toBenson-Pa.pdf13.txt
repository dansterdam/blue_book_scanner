EVALUATION
Operational Procedures: Operational procedures as demonstrated
by the NORAD system and its subordinate elements were as specified by
appropriate operational directives. Weapon commitment procedures were
appropriate to the speed, altitude and radar tracking characteristics of
the target track.

a. Montauk AFS: The actions of the radar surveillance personnel
were commendable in that during a 2-minute period the target was detected,
instituted as a track, five position plots recorded and forward told to the
26th CONAD Air Division, and to adjacent radars.

It was noted that the height-range indicator at Montauk is
physically located so that it cannot be used on short notice. It was also
noted that radar scope photo equipment was not readily available to obtain
a photographic record of this track.

b. Benton AFS: The operation at Benton, Pa., was in accordance
with current operational directives. The target was detected and passed
to adjacent radars and to higher echelons. A determined effort to collect
data was made.

It was noted that radar scope cameras were committed to a
training program and were not employed to record this track.

c. 26th CONAD Air Division: The control center personnel promptly
noted the track, assembled personnel of authority and passed track information
