SATSUMA, ALABAMA 

On the night of 1-2 August at approximately 12:30 A.I local time, I was on my way home from Creola, Alabama, on Highway 43, heading south. I was approaching the town of Satsuma, Alabama, when I saw what appeared to be a bright light in the southwest sky. At first I thought it was an object in the sky which I had never seen before. The light was bright and seemed to be rotating or flashing. As I got closer to Satsuma, the light seemed to move closer to me and get brighter. The object was disc-shaped and seemed to be about 20 feet in diameter. There was a red glow around the outer edge of the object. The object appeared to be about 500 feet in altitude. I saw the object for about 1 minute. Then it seemed to move off at a high rate of speed in a westerly direction. There was no sound associated with the object. The night was clear and the stars were visible. I saw no vapor trail and the object made no noise. The object appeared to be disc-shaped and was a bright silvery white color.
