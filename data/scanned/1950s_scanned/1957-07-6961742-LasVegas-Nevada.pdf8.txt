1. Check of personnel familiar with the AN/FPS-3A radar indicates that it is possible to obtain various radar videos and targets due to display.

2. The extreme speed of the alleged target eliminates the possibility that it is a normal aircraft.

3. Normally, the reflection from the target aircraft is observed, although weaker than the LRP returns.

4. This appears to be another case of a radar sighting for which there is no satisfactory explanation, due to lack of sufficient data.
