On 6 October 1956, at approximately 10:20 p.m., two unidentified flying objects were observed by three individuals in Cincinnati, Ohio. The sightings were reported to the Cincinnati Police Department and to the Air Force.
The three witnesses, Mr. John Doe, Mrs. Jane Doe, and Mr. Richard Roe, were outside their home when they observed two brightly illuminated objects in the sky. The objects were described as circular or elliptical in shape, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and moving in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 miles per hour.
The witnesses stated that the objects emitted a bright, pulsating light and occasionally changed color from white to orange. The objects were observed for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing from view.
Photographic evidence was obtained, and the three photographs are attached to this report.
This incident is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation and analysis.
