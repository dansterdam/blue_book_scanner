2. As a representative of this office, interviewed the observer on 26 September 1952. The (identity) and 4/75 service number of the observer was established as genuine. He (the observer) and 4/75 were on the main base as a town patrol in the base fire truck. He told them he had seen a number of lights in the sky and wanted them to investigate.

3. They then proceeded to a point some hundred yards north of 5th Street, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, where they observed the objects. He stated that the object was first sighted at approximately ten (10) miles south-southeast, and the lights were approximately ten (10) miles in the sky at the angle of approximately five (5) degrees above the horizon. He stated that the objects began to approach them and closer and looked very strange.

4. The objects maintained a steady light, and moved at a uniform speed which would not be judged by the observer.

5. Bounds determined that the objects appeared to be the same size as stars in the vicinity.

6. Bounds detected no sound, vibration, smoke, or other indication of proximity or motion other than the visual observation.

7. Bounds stated that the objects during his observation, a large jock of light appeared to come from the southwest direction and passed between the objects and his position. This did not seem to interfere with the continuance of the sighting.

8. Bounds was not under the influence of intoxicants at the time of observation.
