This image appears to be a technical diagram or chart, likely from an old UFO report document. It does not contain any human faces or identities. The chart seems to depict various angular measurements or trajectories, with a compass-like orientation mark in the lower left corner indicating North. There are no photographs present in this particular page.

Now, I will proceed to act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and output all the text found in the document:

240°
210°
180°
