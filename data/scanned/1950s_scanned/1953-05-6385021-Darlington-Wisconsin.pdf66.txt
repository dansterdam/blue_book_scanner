The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above the horizon. The instructions ask the reader to imagine that the object was seen above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it, and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon.

The second sketch contains two parts. The larger portion shows a road or path leading to a town or landscape in the distance. The smaller portion shows a more distant landscape with mountains or hills.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
