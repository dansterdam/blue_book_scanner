The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with questions and fields to be filled out.

How large would it be, and what other shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
