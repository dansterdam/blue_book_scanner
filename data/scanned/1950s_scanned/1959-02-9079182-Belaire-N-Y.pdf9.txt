ASTRONOMY

Venus Brightens

Mars will fade in February skies as it travels farther from the earth. Meanwhile, the planet Venus can be seen in the southwest until about two hours after sunset.

BY JAMES STOKLESY

MARS is drawing farther away and rapidly fading. Mars is increasing in distance from the earth and will disappear in the southwest by February evenings until about mid-March. 

Meanwhile, Venus can be seen in the southwest for a couple of hours after sundown and is becoming brighter. Venus will reach its greatest brilliance around the middle of February. This is due in part to the fact that the planet is nearing its closest approach to the earth.

Sirius is brighterHowever, even brighter than Venus is the star called Sirius. This is the "Dog Star," the great dog in the south. Directly above this group is the faint constellation Lepus, the hare. The bright star just above that is Rigel, and the lesser dog is just above that; in it is another first-magnitude star, Procyon. The seven faint stars marking Canis Minor, which Pollux stands, Castor, the other twin, is designated by the Greeks as Gemini.

As seen in the sky at present, Orion, the warrior, the most brilliant of all the constellations, is in the southwest. In the northwest, there are two first magnitude stars. One is Betelgeuse, above, and Rigel, below.
