Air Force Checks Data
On Presumed Meteor
(Continued from Page 1)
it was learned that the tremor had rocked the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle, approximately an hour before the first sighting was reported.
Garland and Carlson said that about 1:08 a.m. (PST) they saw a bright light "move across the sky from north to north." The light, they said, was followed by a burst of light and a report.
Lt. Col. Donald E. Keyhoe traced the course of the object and said that it was estimated to be traveling at a speed of 1,200 to 1,400 miles per hour.
"This speed and the explosive nature of the burst of light indicate the object was not an airplane or meteor, and the fact that it was observed from several different points rule out the possibility of a hoax or hallucination," Keyhoe said.
OVER WIDE AREA
The flash was seen and the report heard over a wide area including the Seattle and surrounding communities. The flash and report were practically simultaneous, indicating that the object was not far from the ground.
"Typical of hundreds of Seattle residents, John Lovelady stated, 'I was working in my backyard when the flash came. We went to the windows, pulled back the curtains and saw the rumble and flash which seemed to come from the ground near Green Lake.'"
5 4 FT. FLASH
The flash was estimated to be 54 feet long and was visible for about 2 to 3 seconds. The report or explosion was heard 4 or 5 seconds later. It was described as a low rumbling roar.
Though flight was seen, there were no reports of any aircraft in the area. The Air Force and the Civil Aeronautics Administration checked thoroughly but could find no record of any planes in the vicinity.

Engineer Reports
On Meteor
An air force report stated that the object was "larger than Don E. Johnson's flash camera." According to the report, the object appeared to be traveling at a speed of between 1,200 and 1,400 miles per hour.
The object appeared to be about 54 feet long and the flash lasted for 2 or 3 seconds. The explosion or report was heard about 4 or 5 seconds later.
"The tremor which shook the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle, had occurred about an hour before the sighting was reported," the report stated.
The report concluded that the incident was "an extremely intense and spectacular meteor" and that it had caused the tremor felt in the area.
