APPROXIMATELY 3,000 YARDS DIRECTLY OFF THE HIGHWAY AND APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER A SMALL HILL. IT ESTIMATED THE HEIGHT OF THE HILL, IS [REDACTED] FEET, THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT TO BE 5,000 TO 7,000 FEET, HOWEVER, THE OBSERVER ESTIMATED THIS ESTIMATE WAS ONLY A GOOD GUESS. SHORTLY AFTER SIGHTED OUT OF HIS SIGHT TO BETTER OBSERVE THE OBJECT, IF CONTINUED TRAVELING IN A NORTHEAST DIRECTION AT EXCEPTIONAL HIGH SPEED. IT APPEARED TO BE WELL DEFINED AND SOLID LIKE METAL. IT ALSO TRIED TO FOCUS HIS BINOCULARS ON THE OBJECT AND GET A MUCH CLEARER SIGHTING. IT WAS THROUGH THIS STUDY THAT HE DETERMINED THE OBJECT TO BE CIGAR-SHAPED AND SAID HE OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE OPENINGS OR APERTURES ON THE FUSELAGE BUT DUE TO THE RAPID SPEED OF MOVEMENT, HE COULD NOT GET AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF SUCH OPENINGS. ACCORDING TO HIS ESTIMATE, THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE FLYING FROM A DISTANCE OF 329 TO 352 MILES AND ACCELERATED RAPIDLY TO A TREMENDOUS SPEED ABOUT 3 OR 4 MINUTES FROM THE START OF SIGHTING UNTIL THE OBJECT WAS OUT OF SIGHT APPROXIMATELY 7 TO 10 SECONDS ELAPSED. OBJECT TRAVELED ON A LEVEL COURSE AT A CONSTANT HEADED SPEED, CUT OF SIGHT. [REDACTED]
