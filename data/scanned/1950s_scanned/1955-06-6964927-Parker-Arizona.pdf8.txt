THE UNIO REPORTED POSITION, HOWEVER, AFTER FLYING ONLY THIRTY
TO FORTY MILES WEST OF THE UFOB POSITION, HIS SLANT GYRO HAD
PRECESSED TO 32 DEGREES. WHEN PASSING THE SMALL TOWN OF VIDAL, CALIF
WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE UFOB REPORTED LOCATION, THE PILOT SIGHTED
THAT HE THOUGHT TO BE AN EXTREMELY LARGE STAR. THE OBJECT APPEARED
HIGH TO HIM (PILOT'S ALTITUDE WAS 29,992 FT., BROKEN LAYER OF CL-
OUDS WERE AT 32,200 FT.). THIS WOULD SEEM TO FIX THE ALTITUDE OF THE
OBJECT BETWEEN 29,992 FT AND 32,200 FT.) PILOT ESTIMATED THE LENGTH
OF OBSERVANCE OF THE OBJECT AT THREE MINUTES. THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED
SUDDENLY. HE DID NOT NOTICE ANY UNUSUAL COLORING OTHER THAN THAT THAT
NORMALLY SEEN WHEN VIEWING A STAR. HE STATED THAT THERE WERE NO
OTHER STARS VISIBLE.
ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT APPEARED STATIONARY TO HIM AND HIS STUDENT
CADET, THE HEADING OF THE T-33 WAS WESTERLY AS WAS THE DIRECTION
OF FLIGHT OF THE UFOB AS REPORTED BY THE GCC POST. THIS COULD
ACCOUNT FOR A STATIONARY APPEARANCE TO THE PILOTS OF THE T-33.
SUMMARY: IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BOTH THE GCC POST AND THE T-33 PILOTS
SIGHTED THE SAME CONSTELLATION MOMENTARILY. IN THE EVIDENT-
ALLY WEIRD LIGHTING EFFECT FROM THE SUN FILTERING THROUGH THE
UNUSUAL CLOUD FORMATION, THE CONSTELLATION MAY HAVE APPEARED QUITE
STAR-LIKE.
