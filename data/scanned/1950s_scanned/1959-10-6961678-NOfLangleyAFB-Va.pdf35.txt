TEXT OUTPUT:
This report concerns the sighting of an unidentified flying object by two Air Force officers on 6 October 1959 at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The details of the sighting are as follows:
At approximately 1510 hours on 6 October 1959, two Air Force officers, Capt. Edgar J. McGuire and Lt. Robert C. Smith, were walking across the base when they observed an unusually bright, circular object in the sky at approximately 20 degrees above the horizon to the southwest. The object was silvery in color and appeared to be slowly rotating. It remained stationary for approximately 15-20 minutes before suddenly accelerating and departing rapidly to the northeast, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.
Both officers closely observed the object through binoculars and reported it as definite, solid, and metallic in appearance. They estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. No other air traffic was observed in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. The weather was clear with unlimited visibility.
This sighting was reported to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation and analysis.
