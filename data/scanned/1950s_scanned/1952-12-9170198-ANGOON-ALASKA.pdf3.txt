Angoon, Alaska

I. Description of Incident

An Air National Guard pilot sighted an object consisting of two shiny globes connected by a solid rod proceeding in a southerly direction. The pilot attempted to overtake it but the observing pilot was unable to distinguish any lights, vapor trails or exhaust smoke although he claimed the object was apparently accelerated and disappeared in the sun. The pilot estimated also comparable to a Grumman Goose aircraft.

II. Discussion of Incident

This report is very sketchy and vague and there is not sufficient information to come to any conclusion. The description of the object is quite similar to reports of known upper air search balloons and the fact that it appeared to climb would lend credence to this explanation. However, a much closer sighting would be necessary to rule out other possibilities, such as a disturbance in the object's path and upper air wind currents.

III. Conclusion

Insufficient data to evaluate.
