                                                            Columbus, Ohio

police and military officials were at a loss last April 7th to explain reports
of a bright flying object with a long red tail minutes apart between 7 and 11
p.m. near Hamilton-Middletown. Traffic on a road near Columbus was stopped as
drivers halted to watch the object, which flew around the east and south sides
of the city before disappearing in the west.
