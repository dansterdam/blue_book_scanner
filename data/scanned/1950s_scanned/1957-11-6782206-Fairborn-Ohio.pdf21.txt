Transcribed text:

Bright disc observed at 6:37 to 6:55 AM through seeming downward moving doors, gave impression of a searchlight or strong beam of light of some sort beaming straight down to the ground. It was about 20 ft in diameter and paced aircraft at 10,000 ft for a few minutes. It then disappeared behind trees. Seemed to be metallic.
