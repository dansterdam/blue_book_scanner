Rep. A. D. Baumhart
House of Representatives 
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Baumhart:

You no doubt have read the accounts of my experience with a "flying saucer" on the morning of Sept. 21. Articles appeared in the Lorain Journal and Plain Dealer. I have sent a summary of the sighting to the Air Force UFO Center in Dayton, Ohio.

Will you please check with the Air Force to find out their conclusion in this case?

If these objects are landing in populated areas, it will not be long before disaster strikes. This is definitely a menace to ordinary people. So if this was a government missile, can you stop them from being flown in populated areas? If it did not belong to our government, this fact should be made public, and proper steps should be taken to insure the public safety.

I have talked to people who have investigated similar sightings. These people tell me that usually no real investigation is made by the Air Force, and when one is made the results are ridiculous.

I would not have written this letter if I did not feel sincerely that the matter must be studied closely by authorities. The object which came down in my yard had no business there, under any circumstances.
