Dear Sir:

This report is a little late but I hope you will be interested enough to help us out. The enclosed clipping will explain what I am after. Is it just another in a series of reports you are compelled, due to lack of information or release, to add to the heap? Or is there some light you can possible shed here? Any help you can give will be appreciated.

Yours very truly,

[REDACTED]
