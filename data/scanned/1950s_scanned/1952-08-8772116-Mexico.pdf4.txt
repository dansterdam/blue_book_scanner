THE FOREIGN SERVICE 
OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Address Official Communications to
AMERICAN EMBASSY, VENERABLE AUGUST 29, 1952.

The Honorable  
William O'Dwyer,
American Ambassador, 
American Embassy,
Mexico, D.F.

Sir:

Reference is made to the Embassy's Airgram No. 423, dated March 19, 1952 (Embassy File No. 123), on the subject "Flying Discs". In compliance with the provisions of that circular, the following information is given:

The Veracruz morning daily "El Dictamen" reported in today's edition (August 29) that during last night (night before last) there was seen yesterday over the city. It is stated that the disc was larger and flew lower than those seen in other parts. The report is translated:

A flying plate blue-green in color and of an uncommon size discovered the sky over Veracruz yesterday morning at 2:10 a.m. with a tremendous speed. Several persons saw it pass over a house in the city and it gave the impression that it was just like the moon when this is in its fourth phase in mid-sky.

The variations given here by these same persons who saw the flying plate is very important because it adds new data to those already received in reference to these strange phenomena which seemingly have no satisfactory theory to explain them.

Our informants agree that the flying plate's passage was marked by a blinding court, clearly perceptible, very similar to that made by a high voltage transformer when it is illuminating the load.

The trajectory of the flying plate was from northwest to southeast and lasted over Veracruz in eight seconds before losing itself in the sea. Even after it had disappeared the blinding could be heard and there remained a curious greenish reflection.
