NOVEMBER 5, 1957

Colonel Kenneth W. King
United States Air Force
Detachment 105
Office of Special Investigations
Offutt Air Force Base
Omaha, Nebraska

Dear Colonel King:

This is to confirm telephonic advices on change in status concerning an alleged landing of a vehicle in the vicinity of Kearney, Nebraska. November 5, 1957, concerning which our Resident Agents, Joseph H. Daring, as Greets Island, Nebraska, by Chief of Police, Thurston Nelson, advised us.

On November 5, 1957, a local citizen, as the report states, stated that on the afternoon of November 5, 1957, he was driving along a country road approximately 15 miles west of Kearney, Nebraska, when he saw a peculiar object on the ground. He stopped his car and approached the object, which he described as appearing to be about 30 feet in diameter and about 12 feet high, with a dome on top. He stated that it appeared to be made of a metallic material and seemed to have a reddish glow.  

The citizen further stated that as he approached the object, he heard a humming sound and saw a bright light flash from the object. At this time, he stated, he became frightened and hurried back to his car and drove away. He said he did not turn his car around and did not see the object again. He said he lost no time in reporting the incident to the Chief of Police in Kearney.

We have instructed our Resident Agent to keep us advised of any further developments in this case. If you desire any additional information, please advise.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
