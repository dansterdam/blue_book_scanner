The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, consisting of a letter from Lawrence J. Tacker, Major, USAF, Executive Officer of the Public Information Division, Office of Information Services, to an individual named Mr. Hilbert. The letter is dated 13 April 1953 and acknowledges a letter from the recipient dated 13 February 1953, concerning unidentified flying objects and the Bendix Aviation Corporation. The letter states that the Bendix Corporation did not identify the individuals who sent the fragments referred to in the recipient's letter, and that the Bendix Corporation did not report them as part of a flying saucer or object.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

SAFIS-3/MT2 Tacker/jmr/03328
