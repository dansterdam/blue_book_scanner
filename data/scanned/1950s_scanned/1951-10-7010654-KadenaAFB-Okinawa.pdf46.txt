The image appears to be a graph or chart, likely from a technical document or report. The graph shows a line or curve representing some kind of measurement or data, with numerical values along the horizontal and vertical axes. The legend at the bottom provides additional information about the graph, indicating a "Maximum Search Range (CPS-1) - 4,000" and mentioning an "Inclosure" with a "FEAF HS - 20-52" reference.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document as requested:

MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE (CPS-1) - 4,000
INCLOSURE
FEAF HS - 20-52
