World 'Flying Saucers' Day

Although the phenomenon of "flying saucers" is still a mystery, today marks the 12th anniversary of the sighting over Mt. Rainier, Washington, on June 24, 1947, which sparked the world-wide interest in "unidentified flying objects."

On that day, Idaho businessman Kenneth Arnold said he saw a formation of strange, shiny objects flying at a high rate of speed near Mt. Rainier. The police report of the incident was the first tangible evidence of "flying saucers," and ever since, these strange aerial phenomena have been a constant source of controversy.

In recent years, the "flying saucer" craze has subsided somewhat, but interest is still keen, especially among amateur astronomers and "saucer clubs." Scientists, too, remain concerned, and a number of prominent physicists, including Dr. Donald Menzel of Harvard, have attempted to explain the "flying saucers" as natural phenomena.

However, the controversy continues, and periodically new reports of "flying saucers" come in from all over the world. The latest incident occurred only last week in Japan, where three airline pilots reported seeing a strange light in the sky.

This evening, Professor Mitani of the Astronomical Society of Japan will give a lecture on the subject in Tokyo. Professor Mitani is considered an authority on "flying saucers" and his views are often mistaken for those of the scientific establishment. Actually, many scientists remain highly skeptical of reports of "flying saucers."
