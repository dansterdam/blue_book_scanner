3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 2 Objects
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 Seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual

9. PHOTOS: No
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
1 luminescent object pale gold. One sighting at 2:35, one at 4:07 AM. Sound like soft breeze. Second object was quite far away. Objects came directly overhead. 11-15 objects in formation at 1st sighting. Flight North to South. Flight straight line.
Witness 62 year old lady. Reported the objects to GCA. Letter to USAF in 1955. No investigation. Sighting too old.
Observation is characteristic of a flight of birds at night reflecting light from the ground. Duration, formation sound and areas of are through which the objects passed all consistent with this analysis. Also directions to South tends to add to theory of migratory birds such as ducks or geese being in formation.
10. CONCLUSION: BIRDS
