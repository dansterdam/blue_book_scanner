Transcription of text from the image:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. If the object remained at a constant altitude, place an "A" and "B" at the same point.

28. Draw a picture there will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" or "C" any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
