I VISITED THE SCENE OF THE LANDING AS SOON AS I WAS NOTIFIED TO DO SO. THERE WERE SOME 75 TO 100 PERSONS PRESENT WHEN I ARRIVED WHO HAD ALSO GONE TO THE SCENE SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED. THE OBJECT HAD LANDED IN A PASTURE ON THE LAND OF MR. P. H. WARD, AN ELDERLY RETIRED FARMER WHO LIVED ABOUT ONE HALF MILE FROM THE VILLAGE MAIN STREET.
THE OBJECT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, ABOUT 30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND APPEARED TO BE MADE OF A METALLIC MATERIAL SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO ALUMINUM BUT HIGHLY POLISHED AND REFLECTING THE SUNLIGHT. IT WAS RESTING ON A TRIPOD-LIKE LANDING GEAR ABOUT 3 FEET HIGH. THERE WERE NO WINDOWS, DOORS OR ANY OTHER VISIBLE OPENINGS IN THE OBJECT. AS I WALKED AROUND IT I NOTICED THAT IT WAS SLIGHTLY WARM TO THE TOUCH AND A VERY SLIGHT HISSING SOUND COULD BE HEARD, APPARENTLY FROM SOME INTERNAL SOURCE.
ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE WITNESSES, THE OBJECT HAD FIRST BEEN SIGHTED HOVERING OVER THE PASTURE AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 100 FEET. IT THEN SLOWLY DESCENDED AND CAME TO REST ON THE GROUND. THERE WAS NO SMOKE, EXHAUST OR OTHER VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF PROPULSION. THE ONLY VISIBLE CHANGE WAS A SLIGHT RIPPLING EFFECT AROUND THE RIM OF THE OBJECT AS IT SETTLED ON THE GROUND. THERE WAS SOME SLIGHT DISTURBANCE OF THE GRASS AND WEEDS UNDER THE OBJECT, APPARENTLY DUE TO SOME TYPE OF FORCE OR SUCTION CREATED DURING THE LANDING.
