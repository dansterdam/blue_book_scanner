Subject: "Fireball"

Date of Occurrence: September 28, 1952.

This event occurred in Hampton Bays, L.I., on Sunday, September 28, 1952, at about 6:37 P.M.

10,000 feet up in the air, a fireball, quite large, appeared to be moving at a tremendous speed. It looked like a streak of light. It passed over the middle of Smith's Creek and was heading north-northwest over the middle of Smith's Creek. It was flying at a terrific speed and made no sound. Never having seen one before, I rushed in and called the sheriff at about 6:45 P.M. I was interviewed later several times by State Police officials. The fireball was creek-like in shape and was blue-white, and it passed over rapidly in various directions.
