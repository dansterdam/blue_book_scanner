"Shooting Stars" Seen 
By Two Men At Dillon

DILLON, S.C., Aug. 1 (AP) - Two men, E.L. Wells and H.S. Mann, reported seeing two objects like "shooting stars" falling near Dillon about 9:30 p.m. yesterday. The South Carolina Highway Patrol said the men told them the objects were a bright reddish orange and were traveling in a horizontal direction. They said the first was larger than the second and was only visible for about 30 seconds. The second was even smaller and was discovered in less time. 
The men said the objects appeared to be about 10 miles distant and were just above the horizon. The men said they may have explained the recent crater discovered near Dillon which has not been accounted for.
Today a dillon man was to take samples to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for analysis.
