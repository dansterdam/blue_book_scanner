STATEMENT OF 
MRS. FRANK GOODY

24 September 1952

About 10:00 P.M. on September 23, 1952, while I was in the bedroom, I noticed a bright light moving swiftly across the sky. For first impression it looked like a helicopter because of the very broad lights I saw. As it approached I suddenly realized it was not a helicopter, but some sort of craft which I will call flying objects. I called my husband and he also saw the same objects. There were six or eight objects in a group formation that passed over us in an easterly direction. They were flying very high and silently. I could see no outline or shape of the objects, only the bright lights. The sound we did not hear. The objects passed over and disappeared in the distance, sort of melting away. The impression they gave to me was that they were not attached to each other, but were separate independent units. I watched them until they were out of sight. The lights became dimmer and dimmer until they disappeared completely.

I am submitting a small sketch of what I observed. The lights at the bottom represent a small airplane-like object which I saw. This object was flying lower than the group of lights, and did not belong to the group of lights. The size of the lights of the small airplane were slightly larger than lights of the other group of lights, and the flight path of the small object was slightly different from the group of lights. I cannot account for the small airplane-like object I saw, nor can I account for the group of lights. I only know what I saw and I would be glad to discuss this with you further if desired.
