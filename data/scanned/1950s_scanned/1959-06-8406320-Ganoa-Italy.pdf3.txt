GANOA, ITALY 
8 June 1959

I am a captain, tourist officer employed in the military office of the Legon. 
At about 10:00 PM on 7 June 1959 we were a small village field in front of Ganoa, we saw a bright object falling vertically at great speed. 
This object was observed for 3 or 4 minutes and when it was at a position and was disappearing, it seems to spit out a long bright tail and exploded, then it was extinction. 
The phenomenon was very impressive and arouse terror. All persons present, about fifteen, were very surprised and frightened by this spectacle.
The location where it took place is a field located to Cavalettoli, at about 20 kilometers from Ganoa, on the road that leads to the village of Marina di Massa.
I do not see anything with the launching of the spacecraft HID
