The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a report form titled "R INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION RECORD" from Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document:

LOCATION: BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
DATE OF REPORT: 4-2-55
DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 4-1-55
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT NUMBER: 31-54/53-2253

SOURCE OF REPORT: (AF affected, Command, etc.): ANDREWS AFB, SECURITY FORCES CONTROL CENTER, ANDREWS AFB, MD.

USABILITY OF REPORT:
EXCELLENT
USABLE
TOO GENERAL

COMMENTS: (If narrative style, expand on your evaluation as checked above. Point out deviations and include pertinent guidance and related criticism.):

1. The two objects, which accompanied the report, were clearly examined by both the personnel and several specialists from the Dayton, Ohio, following the results of the analysis:

a. Characteristics of the objects:
(1) The two objects, weighing 13 3/4 and 1 1/2 lbs are definitely "A" grade quality cans from containing less than an addition in composition.
(2) From close examination it was found that the marking is not an old variety and tracers of corrosion indicate it had been installed more recently.
(3) The objects are "PROBABLY" from a larger valve control used on certain vessels, cranes regulating operating and/or water and sewerage systems.

(4) The hole located at the break on the ring-like piece was found to contain a considerable amount corrosion, suggesting that a former "handle-type" assembly was once installed there.

2. Possible cause of the incident - It is very difficult to determine what caused the incident; however, after consideration of various possibilities, the following conclusions were obtained:

(1) It is very unlikely that any aircraft in the area at the time could have dropped the particular pieces recovered. If the whole "object" had been dropped, it would have remained in one place until found.
