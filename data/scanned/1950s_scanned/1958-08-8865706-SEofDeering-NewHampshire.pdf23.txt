Dear Sir:

I wonder if you would be interested in the unusual sighting of an object over Deering, New Hampshire, on August 7, 1958.

The object was observed by a man and wife, at about 7:00 PM on that date. It hovered for some time and then moved off at a terrific speed. I have no facts as to size, shape, color, or exact time duration, but have obtained the name and address of the observers, who would be willing to be interviewed if you are interested in this case.

Please let me know if you care to investigate this sighting, which had all the earmarks of an unusual and possibly significant incident.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
