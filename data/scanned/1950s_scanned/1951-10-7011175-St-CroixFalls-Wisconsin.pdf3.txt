FOOTNOTE ON C. B. MOORE
CHARLES B. MOORE, THIS NAME U.S. DISPATCH INFORMED US, WAS "THE MAN WHO FIRST GAVE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO THE EXISTENCE OF THIS OBJECT." THIS STATEMENT IS BASED ON THE U.S. AIR FORCE CONCLUSION THAT THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THIS CASE IS STILL INCOMPLETE.

THE OBJECT WAS ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE, ABOUT 100 FEET IN DIAMETER, IT CROSSED THE PATH OF THE BALLOON AT A VELOCITY OF FROM 600 TO 800 MILES PER HOUR... AT A DISTANCE OF 4 MILES PER SECOND...THAT'S 14,000 MILES!

GLOSS QUESTIONING OF MOORE AND THE OTHER MAN HAVING WITNESS UTE FAGIN'S LANDING
(FAGIN WAS THE BALLOON PILOT)

THE PILOT, STANDS NEAR MEXICO FOR THE FASCINATION PLANE....IT TURNED RIGHT AND
FLEW OFF AT A SPEED AS HIGH AS THAT OF THE BALLOON ITSELF.

DIDN'T THE AIR FORCE
TAKE KALISZENSKI'S
AND MOORE'S ADVICE - 
DIDN'T IT ORDER 200
GRID CAMERAS TO BE
SENT TO STRATEGIC
POINTS...AIR BASES
A-PLANES AND OTHER SPOTS...WHERE SAUCERS
HAD BEEN SIGHTED?
