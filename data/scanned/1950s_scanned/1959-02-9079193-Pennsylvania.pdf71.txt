about 15 hours before the sighting of the UFO reported here. 
The color of the meteor at first appeared as orange, changing to blue, green and white, and then apparently the object exploded. It was visible in the northwest, and disappeared in the northwest. It was visible in Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota. Except for the longitude and latitude, the details are quite similar to the sighting
some observers believed they watched it for 15 to 30 seconds and had time to stop their cars and get out before the object disappeared. This was a meteor.
It was not, apparently, a temperature inversion.

THE HUMAN MIND is a strange instrument. It seeks constantly to explain the inexplicable in terms of the familiar. It resists the unfamiliar almost automatically. Thus it seems that Mr. Puscas, a civilian with the Air Force, who had enthusiastically signed a contract with Killian, was relieved to accept the Air Force explanation of jet tanker operations.

Our old friends the Detroit Times, "I don't know," says the man, "but the facts that they may have been more familiar - but I'm surprised to the fact that they may have been more advanced than ours, declared Colonel James. 

The fact that the others did not seem surprised, as Killian and the other airline crew and passengers really saw what they reported the UFO's would have to come from a civilization far more advanced than ours, declared Colonel James.
