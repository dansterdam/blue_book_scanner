A flying object was reported sighted in the Lumberton, North Carolina area on 12 September 1952 at 2359z. Four witnesses at four different observation points confirmed its appearance. This report covers sightings from Lake Waccamaw to Fayetteville, North Carolina. The object was traveling 32 to 34 mph. The object was of small shape with a trail three times the length of the body. The speed was so fast that most witnesses only got a hurried glimpse. According to local newspapers, a meteor was observed at approximately the same time, day, place, and direction of flight.
