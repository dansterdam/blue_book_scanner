b. Location: Zeigler Apartments area, Warner Robins, Georgia
c. Date and Time: 25 January 1951 at 1824 hours EST.
d. Weather C A V U: Clear visibility 10 miles on 25 Jan 51 at 1828 hours. (Official Report of Base Weather Station)

2. Mr. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ was interviewed by the Intelligence Office on 29 January 1951. He stated that in the late afternoon of 25 January 1951 he was lying on his couch in his apartment when his young son came into the house and shouted, "Daddy, there's an airplane on fire." He rushed to the window, which faces east, and looked up. He observed the phenomenon and has associated details. He identified the time as 1824 hours.

3. Mr. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ thought at first that the object in the sky was a jet plane. But the object did not appear to be moving but just sat there. He then realized that it was not an airplane but some kind of "flying disc." The object did not seem to have any wings or tail fins. It was shaped somewhat like a sphere, but flattened on top and bottom, and it was surrounded by a bright blue glow. The glow was not flickering but maintained a steady flow. In color it was "blue-white," and the light did not flicker but maintained a steady flow. In color it was "blue-white," and the light did not flicker but maintained a steady flow. In color it was "blue-white," and the light did not flicker but maintained a steady flow. Unlike anything he had ever seen before.

4. The object is estimated to have been 6,000 feet up and was stationary over the Zeigler Apartments for several minutes. Mr._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ estimated the length of the object at approximately 150 feet. In color it was a dull, greenish-black, and it was not round but more triangular in shape.

5. Mr._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ detected no odor, saw no smoke, and heard no noise.

6. The light seemed to be projected from the entire unit, not just the center. The shining was most brilliant when the glow intensified. The point of light would move slightly with this change, but in general the object would remain steady and maintain the same relative position. This would happen approximately four times. Attached is a drawing made by Mr._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in an attempt to present in pictorial form the movement of the object.
