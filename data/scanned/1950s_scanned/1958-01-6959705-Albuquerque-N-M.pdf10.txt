There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document containing text about a UFO sighting.

Alista, the first man to sight the object, had called it "a big sea urchin". No officer or crewman of the Brazilian Navy reported seeing the UFO, in addition to the photographer, only two persons saw the UFO - the two friends of the photographer, neither of whom had any connection with the Brazilian Navy. The reporter had ample time and many opportunities to take the pictures. A series of double exposures was taken against a dark background could be recalled and the trick.
The final paragraph from a United States Intelligence report provides a comment on the affair: "It is the reporter's private opinion that a flying saucer piloted by very friendly Martians has been spotted, since everyone know that Martians are extremely comforting creatures."
