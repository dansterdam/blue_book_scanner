     About 0200 hours, Saturday, 9 August 1952, I was standing 
on a lawn one block east of the Cola Bottling Headquarters 
building when I spotted a round-shaped object moving toward the south 
until it crossed the Main Base. When it stopped and hovered for 
approximately 10 seconds, then moved off in a direction due east 
of where it disappeared. The sky was cloudy in spots, but this 
didn't hamper sighting at all. The object seemed to be below the 
clouds. It seemed to be at about five thousand (5000) feet. There 
was no sound, but it did have terrific speed.
