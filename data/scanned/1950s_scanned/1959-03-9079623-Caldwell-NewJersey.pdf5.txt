25,350 miles #4 Assuming one object rather than moon up to 34. 
*From one mile distance and up speeds are supersonic.
*This is the distance of the moon, an average of 238,856 miles.
*This is about 7.5 million million miles away, or over 60 million million miles in 1/25th sec.
PERTINENT DATA ON COMPUTATIONS
The diameter of the moon is 2,160 miles. The approximate distance of the moon is the same as the distance of Hayden Planetarium. The apparent diameter of the moon is calculated to be 34.4' or .573 degrees. The line of the image is calculated to be .50 degrees by comparison with the moon image, or 3,600 miles.
If the object or objects are revolving to produce the sporadic image (assuming continuous path) they are revolving at an average rate of 51,000 RPM. There being two facts reflecting the rate is halved, therefore the rate is 17,000 RPH, etc.
