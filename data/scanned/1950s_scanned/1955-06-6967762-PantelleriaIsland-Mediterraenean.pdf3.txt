Text transcribed from the image:

The object and its behavior in a factory office. We drove home at noon and the driver reported many strange people and unnatural occurrences to his crew associates.  He answered 500 questions within seconds. The noise of the cars passing through the area was completely drowned out by an unnatural humming sound that followed the object. It was a close passage by the object would dive out of a maneuver to a 100ft altitude and dart back upward at a great speed as if to avoid detection. I noticed that the elect-ric lights were slightly dimmer as the object approached and were restored to normal about 5 minutes before the scene.  The object seemed stationary until light shone above.  I can say it was 53 units that disappeared from record.  No change in its position was definite clear and found nothing unusual in the area and they cleared out a plan that on explanation of the situation that morning outfit, a head to better.
