The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page of text from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

GROVI wants to make a statement about this case: due to the pereonality of the observer, its story was carefully investigated.

The case can be considered true; it does not have contradictions and the circumstances be described are of a flying saucer. They are the first observations of a new series that started in Uruguay in the second trimester of 1958.

This case is very clearly described to the observer's information. Some things have to be pointed out: such as 1) the shape; 2) displacement; 3) sudden acceleration; 4) increase of the temperature, and 5) the will-known oscillation, all characteristic of a flying saucer.
