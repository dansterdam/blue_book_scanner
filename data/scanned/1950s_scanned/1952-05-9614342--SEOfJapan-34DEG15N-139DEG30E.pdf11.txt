STATEMENT

SUBJECT: AIRCRAFT #42-72372 (A) ON 30 MAY 1952 AT APPROXIMATELY 1930 HOURS ON A COURSE OF 110 DEGREES OVER VICINITY OF WEST OF HOEI, KOREA.

"The co-pilot, Captain Test, first sighted, and called to the attention of the pilot a bright white light, which appeared to be a smooth object as three times the size of a pilot light at about 10,000 feet. It was estimated to be about 30 or 40 miles away. Its position was in the center of a saudle-back mountain formation and was reported by Base Operations to be over the coast at that time. We continued to observe the object for about seven minutes which was apparently hovering. Upon reaching Okinawa we changed our course to 270 degrees, and it finally disappeared in less than a minute."

"It is appeared to me on a round shape with a short tail as the only break in the outline which was clear in definition."

I, T/Sgt. Andrew J. Ross, hereby affirm that I make the above statement with regard to my recollections and observations on the 4th day of June 1952.
