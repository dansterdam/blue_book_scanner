11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
One object traveling at a speed estimated as faster than jet a/c was observed traveling from NW to SW at 2,000 ft. altitude. It was metallic silver in color, round, and about the size of an F-80.

COMMENT: Position of the ship was NW of the Hawaiian Islands within range of jet fighter a/c. Observers say "object appears to remain stationary for a few seconds". An a/c at a distance making a sharp turn could appear stationary. Also a/c at a distance frequently appear round.
