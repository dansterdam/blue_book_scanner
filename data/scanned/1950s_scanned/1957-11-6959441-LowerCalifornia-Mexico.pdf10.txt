UNCLASSIFIED 
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Attachment 10, 1006th AISS
A13-UFOB-779-57
PART - THREE Page 13
1. SOURCES reported the fact that he had no film in his camera and that he did not take any pictures of the object he observed on the road or mark the spot on the road for later reference.
2. The investigator does not believe that the incident was due to misinterpretation of any natural or man-made phenomena. 
3. Based again on the same information, it is the investigator's belief that the characteristics of the object may have been complex enough to prevent reliable identification by SOURCES as LEINSTER, Bradbury, Mainling, Sturgeon, Limov, etc. 
4. The investigator was able to ascertain that SOURCES was not unfamiliar with such objects as LEINSTER, Bradbury, Mainling, Sturgeon, Limov, etc. 
COMMENTS OF THE APPROVING OFFICER:
1. The description of the Approving Officer, SOURCES' reliability cannot readily be questioned for the following reasons:
a. SOURCES' experience and background "speaks favorably" of SOURCES' ability as a fighter pilot and of his character.* 
b. The Approving Officer states that SOURCES' report is for "possibly unknown aerial phenomena".
Therefore, in view of the above, the Approving Officer forwards this information.
