23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
The object was visible for about 2-3 minutes, then suddenly just disappeared very rapidly, almost like it just faded out.

24. In as much detail as possible, describe the object that you saw. Of what did it consist? What were its color and size? How did it compare with anything else with which you are familiar? What was its motion and speed? What were any special features which you observed in the object which you saw.
The object was round, about the size of a basketball, appeared silvery-white in color, and was traveling very rapidly. It made no sound as it moved very silently. At times it would seem to almost stop or hover, then move off again at a very high rate of speed. The size and shape were consistent throughout and did not seem to change during the time it was visible.
