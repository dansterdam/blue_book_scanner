The attention of the observers is called to the incident described herein. The observers were instructed that they should not identify any individuals or persons in the case of their observance as the witnesses. There was no description of any individuals made in this case.

On 17 August 1952 at 2355 hours local time, two observers reported observing a bright, orange-colored object moving slowly from the north to the south. They estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and 8 to 10 feet thick, elliptical in shape. Both observers agreed that this object was silent, and at the time of the sighting was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet and traveling at a speed of approximately 150 to 200 miles per hour. The object was observed for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing to the south.

No interrogation was attempted since the sightings were late in being reported. 

The weather is reported as in Inclosure #7.
