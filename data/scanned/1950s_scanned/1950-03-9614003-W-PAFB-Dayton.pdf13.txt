Shortlyafterwards, however, a National Guard pilot from Vancouver, Colonpl Cooney, sighted an object whieh he was on duty. H eclaimed at first to be observing a meteorological balloon, but after he had watched it for some time he decided to pursue it. After he had chased it for about 30 minutes, he reported that the object displayed speeds and maneuvers which were far beyond any known aircraft. At approximately 11:30 A.M. I received a telephone call from the Airforce intelligence Station. The director reported that the operators had an unidentified object on their radarscope 55 miles east of San Francisco, and that it was travelling at a speed of 2500 m.p.h. at an altitude of 10,000 feet and on a course of 245 degrees. He stated that the object turned, accelerated and made 100 mile turns in 12 seconds. At this time I called Colonel Watson, Military Intelligence Division, and relayed this information to him.

I wish to report that I contacted the Case Operations Officer of the Eastern Air Defense Command and advised the operations officer on the radar search and devised the operations officer on the radar search and devised the operations of the search on this occasion.

At 10:00 A.M. I contacted the Public Relations Officer of Headquarters, AMC and notified the officer that a report of an unidentified object had been made and been under observations. I also notified this officer that no additional information was available to be released to the public at this time.
