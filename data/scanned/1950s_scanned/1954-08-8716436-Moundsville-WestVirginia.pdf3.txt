The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet, containing handwritten text.

The text in the document is as follows:

"On August 19, 1954, my sister, cousin, and I were driving in a car between New Martinsville and Wheeling. There was a bright strange object in the sky. It was shaped like a discus and of a reddish-white color. It moved rapidly at high speed."

"The object maintained a fixed position for a few seconds. It then suddenly accelerated to the left and streaked out of sight with tremendous speed. It was visible for approximately one minute. I have never seen anything like it before or since."
