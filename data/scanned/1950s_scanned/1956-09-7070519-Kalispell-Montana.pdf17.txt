September 3, 1956 - Montana - An unidentified flying object, described as a glowing, cone-shaped object, hovered and maneuvered over Kalispell, Montana for about 15 minutes and then disappeared in a westerly direction.

The report states that the object became brighter and dimmer alternately, and at times it faded out of sight entirely. It was sighted at 5:30 a.m. and disappeared at 5:45 a.m.

The report also mentions a "shining triangle" surrounded by a yellow glow, which hovered in the sky throughout the night. It disappeared westward early the next Tuesday morning.

The Air Force and civilian officials viewed the objects, but were unable to explain them as natural phenomena. The report indicates that the objects were picked up on radar.
