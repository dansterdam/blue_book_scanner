Air Intelligence Information Report
17 October 1952

STATEMEN T
Subject was sighted by a ground observer in the vicinity of the French Fold, DR 2645 at 0612Z, 16 October 1952. The observer reported a luminous object appearing silver in color and about twenty-five feet in diameter. It was first observed at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet over the ground and was descending in a zig-zag motion. The object remained stationary for about 10 to 15 minutes, and then shot upward at high speed in a vertical direction, disappearing from sight.
The pilot of an Air Force aircraft was observing it with the naked eye, and reported that the object could be identified as an aircraft type and that the motion and altitude were inconsistent with a normal aircraft. The pilot stated that the object was at an approximate altitude of 1,500 feet. The object was under continuous observation for about 35,000 feet in such a short space of time.

It was further reported that a large group of aircraft and B-29s of the Air Force were operating in the immediate area at the time, but the object was not identified as being associated with this air operation. The circumstances as outlined against the background position indicated clearly that the object was not a normal type aircraft.
