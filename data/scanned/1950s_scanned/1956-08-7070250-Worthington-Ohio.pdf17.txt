NO CASE (Information Only)  
23 August 1956  
New Orleans, Louisiana  

Case 198, New Orleans, La., 8:35 p.m., Aug. 23, 1956--
Richard Hall writes: "We have been on the watch for several nights because of increase in UFO reports, and tonight we were rewarded. We had seen several meteors and were familiarizing ourselves with the appearances of planes at night, too high to be heard. Earlier, we had seen two or three such planes, and now were 100 startled to see an object moving overhead in the night sky. We raised the binoculars and commented that it could be no known aircraft lights. In fact, it appeared to be luminous. Abruptly, the object made a 90 degree turn which brought it out of my chair. Then it made another sharp turn and continued to the NE. It proceeded about 20 degrees before it was lost to sight. It was impossible to reconstruct. At this point, the object repeatedly flickered out or disappeared, returning momentarily as if struggling against an unseen force. Here and there its path was marked by impossible changes of direction. Gradually the field of motion diminished and the object became smaller and smaller until it disappeared from sight. I lost sight of it when I tried to locate it in the telescope, and we didn't see it again. Using the star it passed, and the landmark above which it was last seen, I estimate its maximum size as 50-75 feet in diameter and its maximum speed as 600-800 miles per hour.".
