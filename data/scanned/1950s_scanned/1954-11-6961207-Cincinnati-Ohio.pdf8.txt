The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and asks the viewer to imagine that this represents the object they first saw, and to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was. The second sketch shows a larger view, with a person standing on a road and a curved horizon in the distance, as well as a smaller inset sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
