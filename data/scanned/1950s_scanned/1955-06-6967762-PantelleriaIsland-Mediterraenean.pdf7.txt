Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects.

The investigation of unidentified flying objects reported to the Air Force has indicated that the bulk of such reports are easily explainable as known types of aerial vehicles or phenomena. This type of project is like the old "foo fighters" of World War II about which we have no detailed information.

In 13 years of investigation over 5,000 reports of unidentified flying objects have been received. Extensive investigation of these reports had disclosed little or no evidence of a technology superior to our own civilian and military aircraft. No physical evidence, either in the form of crashed or grounded vehicles or parts thereof, has been obtained. Reliable witnesses have been interviewed but the results have usually been fragmentary and inconclusive.

We are unable to evaluate your report due to the great time lapse.

Sincerely,
GEORGE J. MADARAS
1st Lt., USAF
