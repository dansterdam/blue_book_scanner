In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object or objects which you saw. Of what type material would you make it, how large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. A balloon or either a small ball would be stmilar.

After bringing the wife's attention to the object (she was sewing with a machine on a table in our back yard) I called the weather office at Williams AFB and they did not release a balloon that day. They did venture an opinion that Davie-Monthan AFB (to the South about 80 miles) did not release one that Saturday.
