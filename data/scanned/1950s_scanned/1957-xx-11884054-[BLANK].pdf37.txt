Transcribing the text:

We are open to suggestion constantly in our daily lives. Advertising in daily newspapers, radio and television concepts, modern-day science fiction, propaganda, exaggerated film versions, publicity on perpetrated hoaxes, and the insinuating of serious and fantastic all react upon the consciousness in the form of suggestion. When we seek an explanation for the unusual and unfamiliar, and attempt to devise some integration instead of rational explanation, innumerable unrecognized suggestion influences our thinking.

Physiological changes due to fatigue and intense strain enhance the susceptibility to suggestion and may induce psychological manifestations which a more rational state of mind would reject. The analysis of these characteristics he has observed, in relation to the conditions under which they were seen, will assist in identification of the unfamiliar object and result in more accurate reporting.
