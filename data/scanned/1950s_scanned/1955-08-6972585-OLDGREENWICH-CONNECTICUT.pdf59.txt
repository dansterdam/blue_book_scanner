There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a document, possibly related to Project Blue Book, that contains text describing a UFO encounter.

The text reads as follows:

"Not too long ago, I was reading Miss Jacqueline Saunders' article in Gray Barker's The Saucerian Review, under the title, 'Panic in Kentucky'. It is an able account of the Hopkinsville, Ky., family who did battle for several hours last summer against some little men from a flying saucer. While I read this dramatic report (being pretty much a critic of such things), a persistent question kept voicing itself in my mind: 'Can this really have happened?' Suddenly in telling how the 'little men' approached the house from a landed saucer, the writer said: 'According to some of the witnesses they were not walking, but seemed to float toward the house.' Those words, it seemed to me, 'rang a bell'. Where had I heard them before? Then I knew! I dug into some of my files and came up with a letter which I had received from one John J. Swaim, a farm boy from near Coldwater, Kansas, who in response to our request, had written me in October 1954, to tell of an encounter he had had with a 'little man' and a saucer while discing in a field some weeks before. Here is a line taken from his penciled letter: 'I came on a terrace. He was crouched behind it. He jumped up and looked at me, and kind of floated as he jumped into the saucer and it lighted up and took off. It went out of sight. ... ' Had the folk from near Hopkinsville read John Swaim's description and used it to dress up their own hoax? I very strongly doubt it! To me, this is one of those subtle similarities which make us think twice before saying, 'This story is just a story and nothing more!'"
