DATE: 17 JANUARY 1952 
LOCATION: NENANA, ALASKA
REPORT NO.: 6310218

On 17 January 1952 at approximately 2200, local time, a brilliant, steady light was observed in the sky over Nenana, Alaska, by a number of residents. The light was described as being very bright, circular in shape, and at an estimated altitude of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of about 30 minutes during which time it made several irregular movements, hovering at times, and at other times moving rapidly in various directions. No sound was heard and no trail was observed. The object eventually disappeared from view in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed.
