Two Air Force pilots, 1st Lieutenant Kenjiro Yoshida and 2nd Lieutenant Isao Akita, were on a training flight in a T-33 jet aircraft over Chitose Air Base, Hokkaido, Japan, when they observed three unidentified flying objects. The pilots reported that the objects were round in shape, approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter, and had a metallic or aluminum-like appearance. The objects were observed to change direction and speed rapidly, with the pilots estimating their speed to be approximately 600 to 700 mph. The pilots also noted that the objects appeared to be under intelligent control. The sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes.
