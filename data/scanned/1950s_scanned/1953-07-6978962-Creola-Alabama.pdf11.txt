Attached hereto is a report submitted by Mr. [redacted] who investigated reports that a strange object was seen at Moomba on 27th September, 1952.

The contents of the statements are all reliable witnesses and it would appear that an object of circular shape which was observed, was strange and it is considered that further investigation of this matter would be justified.
