STATEMENT, 5/5/52, USAF, 1412th Air Traffic Squadron
Then at approximately 2345 MST the Associated Press reporter told me that be had a telephone call from some town in New Mexico, stating a man had reported seeing an unidentified flying object in the Albuquerque area. He said the AP had contacted the base and asked if we had any information or reports of objects over Albuquerque. I then told the AP representative that we had no reports of objects over Albuquerque, and that I personally had not observed any such objects.
