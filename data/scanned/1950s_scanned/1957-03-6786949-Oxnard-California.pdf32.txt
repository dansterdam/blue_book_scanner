Lt. Col. Green:

I received a call from Capt. Gregory, UFO project Officer at ATIC on May 29, 1957 to report of a UFO sighting at Oxnard, Calif on 23 March at 11 P.M. Capt. Gregory phoned this report in because it has gained up considerable interest.

Brig. Fly here are the details:

1. A wife of an Air Force Officer observed an UFO near Channel Islands Harbor off-duty Coast Guard Station at Channel AFB.

2. The duty officer called the Air Police, Highway Patrol and local Sheriff all of whom conversed on Mrs.____ sighting which naturally attracted the newspapers and curiosity seekers.

3. A preliminary investigation by the AISS of Norton AFB discovered these facts:

a. Mrs.____ husband was on TDY and she was alone with a sick child.
b. Her house is located in an isolated area and in one of the heaviest travel air lanes in the U.S.
c. Upon investigation it was found that by looking in the direction that the object was supposed to have been visible, a combination of objects were seen. These were some low hanging clouds with a dim light coming through them which gave an appearance of a very bright star (arcturus), in addition, several aircraft passed the area with standard navigation and landing lights. It was determined that perhaps Mrs.____ being in an emotional state thought she had observed an UFO.

4. Capt. Gregory pointed out that the duty officer at Channel AFB did not follow the correct procedures for handling this UFO sighting. If he had, it would have been cleared up with out any publicity. The fact that he contacted the Air Police, Highway Patrol and Sheriff is instead of the proper channels created a situation that required quite a bit more explaining.
