       KEARNEY, NEB. NOV. 5 -- (UP)--A CALIFORNIAN SAID TONIGHT HE CAME
UPON-A AIC-CIGAR-SHAPED SPACE *?=,HN IN THE NEBRASKA PRAIRIE AND CHATTED
WITH THE FOUR MEN AND TWO WOMEN INSIDE IT.
       REINHOLD SCHMIDT, 48, A GRAIN DEALER FROM BAKERSFIELD, CALIF., SAID
THE INHABITANTS OF THE "WAITINK" SPOKE IN ENGLISH AND GERMAN AND
TOLD HIM "IN TIME YOU WILL FIND OUT WHAT WE ARE DOING."
       AFTER 30 MINUTES OF PLEASANT CONVERSATION, SCHMIDT SAID, HE GOT OUT
OF THE FLYING MACHINE AND IT ROSE SILENTLY UPWARD, "LIKE A HELICOPTER."
       AN FBI AGENT FROM GRAND ISLAND, NEB., WAS DISPATCHED TO KEARNEY
TO INVESTIGATE THE STORY.
       POLICE CHIEF THURSTON NELSON MEANWHILE BACKED UP SOME DETAILS OF
THE CLAIM.
       HE SAID HE FOUND THE FOOTPRINTS OF TWO MEN APPROACHING A SINGLE
SET OF FOOTPRINTS, PRESUMABLY (i) IN A SANDY EXPANSE OUTSIDE
KEARNEY.
       THE THREE FOOTPRINTS THEN ADVANCED TOGETHER AND SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED,
AS IF THEY HAD BEEN YANKED UPWARDS, NELSON SAID.
       POLICE SAID THEY ALSO FOUND A GREENISH, GREASE-LIKE FLUID ABOUT THE
AREA WHERE SCHMIDT SAID HE VISITED WITH THE "WAITINK" INHABITANTS.
       SCHMIDT DROVE INTO KEARNEY LATE TODAY, WHITE-FACED AND ASKING TO
SEE A MINISTER.
       HE SAID HE WAS DRIVING NEAR KEARNEY IN SOUTH-CENTRAL NEBRASKA
ON A GRAIN-BUYING EXPEDITION WHEN HE SPOTTED A SILVERY OBJECT WHICH
LOOKED LIKE"A NAVY BLIMP."
       "I GOT WITHIN 60 FEET OF IT AND MY CAR STOPPED," HE SAID. "I GOT
OUT AND WALKED CLOSER. IT WAS 100 FEET LONG, 30 FEET WIDE, AND 14
FEET HIGH, AND STANDING ON FOUR POSTS.
       "AS I APPROACHED, A RAMP LIKE A STAIRCASE CAME OUT. TWO MEN
EMERGED AND ONE FLASHED SOMETHING AT ME LIKE A FLASHLIGHT. FOR
SECONDS I COULDN'T MOVE. THEN ONE SAID "WE'LL HAVE TO BE HERE A
LITTLE WHILE—YOU MAY AS WELL COME INSIDE."
       HE ENTERED THE CONTRAPTION, SCHMIDT SAID, AND FOUND TWO MORE MEN
AND TWO WOMEN. THEY SEARCHED HIM AND SPOKE WITH A GERMAN ACCENT, HE
SAID. SCHMIDT SAID THE WOMEN WERE BRUNETTES, ALL OF THEM WERE
DRESSED IN EVERYDAY CLOTHES, AND TWO OF THE MEN WERE MUSTACHES.
       THE WALLS OF THE BLIMP, WERE TRANSPARENT FROM INSIDE, SCHMIDT SAID.
THE WOMEN APPEARED TO BE WORKING ON THE SHIP'S WIRING AND ALL THE
PASSENGERS SEEMED TO MOVE ABOUT THE SHIP ON A CONVEYOR OR MAGNETIC
FIELD, HE SAID.
       "THEY TOLD ME TO (i) LOOK AROUND BUT THEY WOULDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE SHIP," ((((( SAID. "ALL THEY WOULD SAY IS 'TELL THE
PEOPLE WE'RE DOING NO HARM.'"
       ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT TALLY, WITH COMMON CONCEPTS OF SPACE TRAVEL,
SCHMIDT INSISTED THE BIG BALLOON WAS PROPELLED BY TUBES FITTED WITH
HUGE PROPELLERS.
       FINALLY, HE SAID, THE "SPACE PEOPLE" TOLD HIM TO GET OUT, ASSURING
HIM HIS CAR WOULD START.
       AS HE RETURNED TO HIS AUTO, HE SAID, "THE THING JUST TOOK OFF IN
THE AIR LIKE A HELICOPTER. IT SEEMED TO CHANGE COLOR AND BLEND
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT I THINK IT WAS GOING SOUTHEAST:"

THE "SPA

INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT I THINK IT WAS GOING SOUTHEAST."
THE "SPACE PEOPLE" KEPT THEIR PROMISE, SAID. AS THE
'WHATINK" FADED AWAY, HE TRIED TO START HIS CAR AND SUCCEEDED ON
THE THIRD TRY. OTW
