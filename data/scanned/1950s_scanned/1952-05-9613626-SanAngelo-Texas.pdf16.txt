While returning from TDY, Kelly AFB on May 17,1952 at 2005 G.S.T. I observed out of the left blister a peculiar formation of bright spots (5) under the wing (left) at 12 o'clock. They were in a vertical line. As we came closer the spots appeared to be becoming smaller and gradually left a vertical line. They appeared as diagrammed below this. As the aircraft climbed, I was able to see what was causing the spots. It appeared that some aircraft had left vapor trails in a spiral ascent or descent. The brightness of the spots appeared to be caused by the sun's reflection from these vapor trails. Altitude appeared to be some 15 to 20 thousand feet above our altitude of 18,000 feet.
