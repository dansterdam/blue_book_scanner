USAF Tech Info Sheet 
TO: APOIN-454 FROM: APOIN-4B1 DATE: 6 AUG 55 COMMENT NO 2

1. Based on the information reported, it is the opinion of this office that the signal reported was caused by ground clutter. A variation in the index of refraction in the troposphere, caused the R.F. beam to bend and strike the ground. The phenomenon reported in Sweep three is not caused by changes in the index of refraction.

2. In future reports involving radar detection of UFO's, it is requested that the radar be identified, if possible, and the target size seen on the radar indicator.
