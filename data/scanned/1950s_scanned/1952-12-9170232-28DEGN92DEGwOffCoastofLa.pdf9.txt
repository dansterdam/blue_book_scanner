COAST GUARD SHIP COMMANDER AND PILOT OF 10 DECEMBER 1952, PILOTED BY CAPTAIN JOHN HARTERJEVAS 150 MILES OFF COAST OF LA. COAST GUARD CUTTER "SEBAGO" CALLED RADAR OFFICER LIEUTENANT 
CASSIDAY. COLLINS AND CAPTAIN HARTERWATCHED MAIN RADARSCOPE TO SEE IF UNKNOWN OBJECT WOULD JUMP.
IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT IN INDIGO FORK, HARTERWPRE CALLED THE RADAR OFFICER LIEUTENANT CASSIDAY, WHO CAME TO THE RADAR SCREEN. LIEUTENANT CASSIDAY SAID THAT'S THE DARNEDEST THING I EVER SAW.
AT THIS EXACT MOMENT THE UNKNOWN OBJECT HAD GONE 10 MILES. IT JUMPED.
FOR AN INSTANT IT SEEMED THEY WOULD MEET HEAD-ON, THEN COLEMAN SAW THE OBJECT STREAKING TOWARD
THE S.20 0 NW. IT SEEMED THEY WOULD MEET HEAD-ON, THEN COLEMAN SAW THE OBJECT STREAKING TOWARD S-20 NW.
COLEMAN SAID,JJELP ME TRACK THIS THING." THE STAFF SERGEANT SWIFTLY COMPUTED THE
IT WAS 5,243 MILES AN HOUR.
CAPTAIN HARTERWATCHED IN AMAZEMENT, THEN COLEMAN GRABBED HIS INTERCOM MIKE AND TOLD
CAPTAIN HARTFR, "YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS - IT WAS MAKING 
CLOSE OVER 10,000 FEET." (WHEN COLEMAN HURRIEDLY WENT TO WORK, MASTER SERGEANT BAILEY BENT OVER THE SCOPE TO WATCH, AND A SECOND LATER LIEUTENANT CASSIDAY, THE NAVIGATOR, CUT IN ON THE INTERCOM, SAYING, "DID YOU SEE THAT? IT'S GOING LIKE AAARRGH RACING ACROSS HIS SCREEN ABRUPTLY. HARTERJOCRISPVOICE CAME THROUGH THE INTERCOM
"THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A PASS AT US." WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
CASSIDAY SAID, "COLEMAN, YOU TELL ME, IT'S BREAKING ALL THE RULES. NO STREAKS, OR BLIPS CROSS HIS SCREEN. STRAIGHT AND REALS SHARP. ONE APPROACHED ON THE RIGHT, HE CALLED OUT, "HAS THAT SOMETHING STREAKED OUT THERE?"
COLEMAN SAW A BLUR,IT SEEMED TO FLASH BY, THEN HE SAW A BLUISH-WHITE PROJECTHADING FROM FRONT TO REAR LIKE A COMET. IT HAD HARDLY DISAPPEARED WHEN ANOTHER GROUP OF ALIENS CAME. 
THEOUGH THEIR COURSE WAS EVEN FASTER. LONGER ENOUGH TO VERIFY THE BOMBEK LIKE SHAPES, THEY WERE GONE IN A FLASH. ALTHOUGH THEIR COURSE WAS STUDIED, NOTHING COULD BE DETERMINED EXCEPT THEY WERE IN FRONT 10 HIS SCOPE AT EACH 20 SECONDS.
AFTER THE CRISIS LIGHTING, THERE WAS A SUDDEN LULL. THE CREW AND SKIPPER WERE AMAZED. THREE MINUTES PASSED, THE MEN WERE SLOWLY RETURNING TO RELAX WHEN THREE MORE OBJECTS APPEARED ON THE SCREEN.

THESE OBJECTS WERE ROCKETING BACK AND FORTH ON THE SCREEN.ON THE NEXT FOUR O'CLOCKS HE BAWLED INTO THE MIKE," OPEN-MOUTHED, HE WATCHED THEM DART AND FLASH, OUT-MANEUVERING ANYTHING HE HAD EVER SEEN. MASTER SERGEANT BAILEY'S FACE
WAS BLUE, A GHASTLY TINT, STRANGE TINTS OF BLUE-WHITE LIGHT APPEARED TO PLAY OVER THE FORMS.
THE OBJECTS SWERVED,HEADING STRAIGHT FOR THE S. 20 O CENTER. HART ER FROZE 
AT THE CONTROLS. AN INCREDIBLE THING HAPPENED BEFORE HIS EYES - THEY VANISHED.
THESE CAME IN - FEW SECONDS - SLOWED DOWN AND PRACTICALLY STOPPED. THE SKIPPER
AT THAT MOMENT WAS WATCHING, AWESTRUCK, AS THE UNKNOWN OBJECTS PULLED OFF TO ONE SIDE.
THERE WAS A SUDDEN STILLNESS, THE OBJECTS MOVING AT OVER 9,000 MILES AN HOUR. THE SMALL OBJECTS 
MERGED WITH THE LARGER. THE PILOT GASPED, "DID YOU SEE THAT?" OUR CUTTER WAS A TOY. WE CLOCKED IT, SAID COLEMAN. "YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS - IT WAS MAKING OVER 10,000 FEET."
