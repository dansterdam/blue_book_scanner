Secret Balloons Are
The secrets could be seen through binoculars, or their contrails could be traced with radar, or they could be photographed. They were called radar balloons, and radar reflectors were used on them, but they were not ordinary weather balloons.
An Australian man had this method which involved prolonged gazing at the sky, as a result they 
found, the object or flying saucer they had seen was actually a balloon.
In New Mexico turned out to be a weather balloon. Another case in New York, was just a guided missile.
