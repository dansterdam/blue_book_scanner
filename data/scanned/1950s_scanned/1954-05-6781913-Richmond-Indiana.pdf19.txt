SUBJECT: (UNCI) Unidentified Flying Object Information

1. An unidentified flying object was sighted and photographed near Richmond, Indiana on 19 May 1954 at 2255 hrs (EST) by Capt. Hardin of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, while on a photo mapping mission. The object was bright and luminous and appeared to be circular. It was estimated that the length of the object was 30-40 ft and the width was 15-20 ft. The object was observed to the right of the aircraft and was moving at a high speed over the ground (500 mph) disappearing to the left of the aircraft. The object was observed for a distance of approximately 6 miles over the ground (500 mph).  

2. The photograph as well as the description by the observer, indicate the object could have been at an altitude of approximately 6,000 ft or could have been at 5,000 ft if at ground level.

3. Major [redacted] is considered to be a very reliable and accurate observer.
