MINNEAPOLIS STAR-TRIBUNE
"OBJECT SPOTTED - SPRING - 1958"

STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN (AP)-A flying object, which was observed in the sky over Sweden on April 7 was officially described today as a strange phenomenon.
The object, described as a long, dark cigar-shaped object with flashing lights, was seen by several persons, including a Swedish air force pilot. The air force said the object was not an aircraft and that it remained a mystery.
The Swedish Defense Staff said the object was observed by competent observers at a number of places in Southern Sweden and that it flew at a high altitude.
The report said the object was seen for about 10 minutes and then disappeared.
