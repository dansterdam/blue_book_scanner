"Friday November 18th 1949 on Lark Dog mission, I sighted what appeared to be a reddish colored, disc-shaped object, at approximately 12:20 - 12:25 hours, at a maximum altitude of approximately 18,000 feet at 0240 GOT. We sighted what appeared to be a reddish object traveling at a great rate of speed. It appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet traveling at a slight descending heading of 270 degrees. I called the object to the attention of the pilot, but the object disappeared in the cumulus clouds in a few seconds."

2. On 21 November 1949, First Lieutenant, DELETED, Reconnaissance Squadron (VIR) Weather, Mc Clellan Air Force Base, California, made the following statement relative to an unusual sighting on 18 November 1949:

"On 18 November 1949, 1840 hours Pacific Time, I observed what appeared to be either a rocket or a highly maneuverable generally westerly heading. The object was traveling at a great rate of speed and trailing a flame which was extremely bright, its speed and trailing flame made it impossible to estimate accurately. It appeared to be our same altitude or slightly lower and either burned out or disappeared into a layer of clouds."
