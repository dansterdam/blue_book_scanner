21 July 1952, F-94, 50275, Pilot: Capt Henry S. Anthony, Jr. - (B-2), Radar Observer: 1st Lt. John T. Lawkins (B-2)

At 21:20Z in the Beluga Lake area, 61°55'N and 105°35'W, while at 19,000 feet, a radar contact was made at 18,000 yards. Lock-on was accomplished at 12,000 yards and an intercept started. Target was level with the aircraft's speed greater than 100 knots to 6,600 yards. At this point the target disappeared and contact could not be re-established. Pilot did not make visual sighting.

At 22:37Z another attempt was made to contact the target observed earlier. While at 16,000 feet, contact was made at 12,000 yards. Lock-on was accomplished and target overtaken at 50-60 knots. At 1500 yards, set action resembled normal break-look and target was lost due to an abrupt upward action as seen in pilot's scope. Contact was re-established at 6,000 yards and followed to 700 yards where target and aircraft's speed were the same - 300 knots. Intercept was continued to 400 yards at which time the target moved out rapidly to 5200 yards where speeds were again approximately the same as the target. Pilot posed the aircraft down and as the speed increased to approximately 400 knots, the target was overtaken to 1500 yards. At this time the radar broke lock due to a rapid downward movement of the target. Contact could not be re-established. Again, no visual sighting was accomplished.

During this incident, the weather was exceptionally clear with practically a cloudless sky.
