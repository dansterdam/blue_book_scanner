FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS OF PAST SIGHTINGS
RINGED CYLINDER OVER PATERSON
Late July, 1955: On a weekday evening late in July 1955, 19-year-old Daniel K. (Omitted) of Paterson, New Jersey, was sitting in a park off Main Street at about 9 p.m. when he saw a peculiar object of a grey metallic color in the sky. He described the shape as a cylindrical ring moving horizontally around the center of the object. Within this circular ring was a rotating light (see diagram). The object was about as wide as his outstretched arm's length. Its edges were clear and sharply defined. Seen in the southern sky, the object was retreating at a moderate speed to the west and finally became just a pinpoint in the clear view for about 10 minutes. The sky was clear. Mr. (Omitted) reported that others had also seen the object, but no names and addresses were available. The details were obtained from the witness by CSI members Arthur Shattuck and Frank Parrishes.
