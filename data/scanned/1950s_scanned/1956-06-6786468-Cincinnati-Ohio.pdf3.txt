On the morning of June 21st., at 0636, two meteorologists and an electronics engineer were watching the radar scope to observe clouds moving in from the west. An echo appeared at 065 degrees, with the center of the reflective cloud on the 20 mile range ring. The brightness of the echo was the same as that of the ground clutter. On the second sweep of the scanner(6 sec.) the center of the reflective echo had moved about 4 to 5 miles. The first echo still retained much of its brightness. The second echo was due north east of the first. By the time the scanner made another sweep the sharp echoes had disappeared and for the next few sweeps the area went completely blank.
