Transcription of the text in the document:

19 October 1950

The "contract guards" at the guard the buildings on the ORML project were warned to be on the alert for possible sightings of objects in the sky. This warning was issued as a result of previous events concerning objects seen over Oak Ridge, but some of these events had apparently grounds during the evening of 16 October 1950.

Independent reports from different guards were received by the Security Section, ORML at Oak Ridge. These reports were submitted by guards and described by them as identical fly the same and described as similar to a jet fighter aircraft. Each noise lasted for about three and one half (3 1/2) seconds and would recur approximately every 40 to 50k hours on 16 October 1950. Each noise would sound like a jet plane which had increased its thrust almost vertical. None of the guards could see an object in the sky.

On 17 October 1950, Major Ronniger, Security Officer, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, returned from Nashville, Tennessee, and visited an official of the Security Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Major Ronniger was amazed when informed of the fantastic sights that some of the guards had seen on Oak Ridge during Monday and Tuesday, which had taken place except for the time about which he was being told (which had taken place on 16 October 1950 which he described as a noise at about 1450 hours on 16 October 1950 which he had heard a noise at about 1450 hours on 16 October 1950 which he had heard a noise at about 1450 hours on 16 October 1950). Major Ronniger, accompanied by his daughter, attempted to locate the father but could not verify whatever.

The Radar crew of Detachment #2, 662nd AC and W Squadron, McGhee Tyson Airport, Knoxville, Tennessee, did not have any change on their scope during either of these occurrences, according to Major R. 0. Carr.

NOTES: The above information was obtained on 17 October 1950 from Major F. E. Ronniger, Assistant Security Director, ORML, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Mr. George Gross, Deputy, NEPA, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and John E. Davis, Agent, Counter-Intelligence Corps.
