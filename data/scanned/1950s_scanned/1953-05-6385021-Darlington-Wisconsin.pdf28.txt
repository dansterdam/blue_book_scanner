The shared image appears to be a page from a UFO report document and contains a chart titled "THE KOCH CHART FOR ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS". The chart displays information about how altitude and temperature affect aircraft performance. There is no photograph present in this image.

THE KOCH CHART FOR ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS

TO FIND THE EFFECT OF ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE 
CONSULT THE TEMPERATURE AND AIRPORT ALTITUDE
BY A STRAIGHT LINE.

READ THE INCREASE IN TAKE-OFF DISTANCE AND THE
DECREASE IN RATE OF CLIMB FROM STANDARD SEA
LEVEL VALUES HERE.

EXAMPLE: The diagonal line shows that a 20% must
be added for a temperature of 100F and a pressure
altitude of 5,000 feet. Therefore, if your standard
temperature sea level distance is 1,000 feet, your
take-off distance at 5,000 feet and 100F will be 1,200
feet. In addition, the rate of climb would
be decreased 15%. Also, if your ground air speed
is 100 knots at sea level, it would now be reduced 
to about 95 knots.

This chart indicates typical representative values for "personal" airplanes.
For exact values consult your airplane flight manual.
This chart may be conservative for airplanes with supercharged engines,
the performance of which may be more on power and can easily double
your take-off distance.
