FTD-5        -8-M. . . . . . In compliance with the request of Major Herman on 2 August 1952, 
the Los Angeles Country Sheriff's Sub-station was contacted on that date and the two (2)
sheriff's deputies who reported sighting the "flying saucers" on 1 August 1952 were 
interviewed. The interviewing officer was Captain Paul E. Shoemacher of the Air Force
Flight Test Center. The written report made by the two (2) deputies is inclosed with
this message as well as the report of the interviewing officer. It has not been 
possible to correlate this report with any operation from Edwards Air Force Base. The
only operation of the Air Force Flight Test Center during the approximate time period
was a flight of one (1) F-94C in the general area of the sighting. However, this
aircraft landed at Edwards Air Force Base at 1115 Pacific Daylight Saving Time whereas
the initial sighting was reported at 1118 Pacific Daylight Saving Time. It is believed
that the enclosed reports are self explanatory.
