A comprehensive wind tunnel test program was run on the DM-1 by the NACA at Langley Field. The original tests were started upon the recommendations of Theodore Von Karman in answer to a request as to whether or not it would be safe to flight test the DM-1. Considerable work was done by the NACA to find the maximum lift coefficient available for landing and to determine sinking speed of the glider.

With triangular wings of aspect ratio of about 2, maximum lift coefficients of the order of 1.2 can be obtained. The corresponding angles of attack, however, will be considerably greater than those for conventional airplanes. Furthermore, since the lift-drag ratio at high angles of attack is approaching 1, the angles of descent without power are likely be prohibitive and airplanes using this type of wing probably will not land safely without power.

The Lippisch P-12 delta wing aircraft was designed as a high performance interceptor and was to be powered by a liquid fuel ram-jet.
