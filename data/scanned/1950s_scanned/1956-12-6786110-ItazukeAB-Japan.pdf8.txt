AFOIN-4A
20 Dec 56
AFOIN-4X2b

In accordance with existing policies for the study and analysis of UFO reports, subject report is submitted for a possible explanation. This report was obtained from the Far East Air Force and related visual sightings.

This information is intended to influence your particular phase of the evaluation. Preliminary analysis by this office, based on the information given, is outlined below:

Two aircraft - First aircraft reported both radar and visual sighting. Second aircraft (wing man) made no contact, visual or radar.

The general area of observation (34-00 N, 131-00 E) is between south-east Korea and slightly east of the Japanese Islands.

The general wind direction was from the west-northwest at the altitude of observation.

The weather on the night of the incident with launch both scheduled and unscheduled balloons at Pusan, Chinhai and Taegu in Korea. These units are located northwest directly under the location of the UFO sighting, Tsushima Island.

Experience from unscheduled balloon cases show that under certain conditions, only stop particles may be visible, particularly when observed at long range. On the basis of the above, and other related information supplied by this office, it is the opinion of this office, at this phase of the evaluation, that the observed phenomenon was probably a scheduled or unscheduled balloon. WITH REGARD TO

Reference item 2a of attached report stating blip moved rapidly to top of scope upon close approach of the aircraft. Could this have been caused by a malfunction of the radar and/or aircraft antenna affected by the UTO? Though the report was under continuous observation at all times, the UTO/unidentified visual sighting could not be tracked or identified.
