There were at least 6 men and 1 woman officer on board. Book number 10 of the air force was on board and being hauled with the boat. However, the officer in charge did not seem to be taking it seriously and only scanned it briefly. He seemed more interested in getting the boat going in proper direction.

The boat was (scheduled) to leave at 6:30 P.M. so it was obviously a hurried affair. I am sure the fat Boston could supply directions, but just a boat was rapidly outfitting and offloading mostly gear - nothing could be seen or discovered under those circumstances. In short, the whole affair was most casual and the officer on the boat was only a short time in the position his rank would indicate was proper. It is significant that the patrol who picked up the object was some distance from the position where the object was first seen.
