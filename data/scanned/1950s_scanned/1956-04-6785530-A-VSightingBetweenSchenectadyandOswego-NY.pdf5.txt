Foster: Well, I doubt if it could....did it appear to change color at all?
Yes it did. It changed color after it got to the west of us, probably to a lighter color, and the light went out. And we knew there was something up there, and now here we are with a load of passengers with something on our course up ahead, and what are we going to do; so we watched this where the light went out and this change color came on-
Miller: Did you think back at it?
No we didn't...
Miller: Just what did you do Captain?
We looked at one another a little bit amazed, so we decided we'd call Griffin Air Force base, and I thought they had the radar on. Course on a Saturday night I guess not very many people are calling at an air force base. And they didn't seem to be much interested.
Foster: Do they not usually have those on?
I assumed they did; I thought they did...
Miller: Maybe we'd better not get into that discussion...
Oh probably not. We'd get a little bit off the track on that.
Neff: They asked us to keep it sighted and we did, and we keep calling our radio station, and as we could see them where we were and they could see us, and we turn them off and they could see us, and they asked if this object you see....
Miller: This is after it turned on I understand.
Yes. They said we have a definite silhouette in sight south of the field. Now those fellows are in the tower. They said that they could see a silhouette.
Miller: How would they be looking with the eye?
I imagine so, yes.
Miller: What kind of a silhouette did they see, a silhouette of light?
Well, usually on a radar screen they're referred to as a large or a blip. On a radar screen, a silhouette usually refers to something that you see, like a silhouette of...something black.
Neff:
