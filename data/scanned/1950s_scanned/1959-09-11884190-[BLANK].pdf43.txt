Dear Senator Frickers,

Col. J. L. may a "ake an inquiry with the U.S. Air Force
intelligence concerning the questions I wish answered concerning the Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.
"QUESTION 2"
"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects"
Captain Ruppelt tells of a "100 feet diameter object" of the
"Elliptical" shape with a "dull-orange glow" projecting from it. 
According to Ruppelt, this report states that the UFO are apparently space vehicles. This report was time in late 1949, and Ruppelt says that "No one knew what it was, and no one knows what it is today".

Question 2 - I referred to another report which describes the
sighted on January 7, 1953. It appears that (1) that the reports more than 6 years old, (2) that the details are sketched and may not be accurate, and (3) that the public be given an
the facts in the UFO mystery. The "Project Blue Book" report which is to be unidentified
 Flying Objects" released April 9, 1956 by the Air Force is descriptive but does not give the actual facts.

The public in my opinion is entitled to the true facts known to the Air Force. I hope you can take this matter up with the Air Force to have the actual facts made available to the public.
