This sort of whip effect. It puzzled me because it was as high as 2 telephone poles yet made no noise what so ever. Strange still was its inability to shed any light. It was just a mass of green flourescent green, which light.

I would like to know what this might have been. In my opinion I do not believe it was a so called flying saucer. It didn't add bad. It just acted strange matter. It just _________.
_________, _________.

Please send me an explanation; I simply was absolutely clear. This happened at the time I lived in Tampa, Florida.

P.S. Since then I have no flying saucers look to me or it might be something far important; I believe not. What is amusing part still is that it makes no noise.

Thank you again.
