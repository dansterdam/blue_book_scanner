SIGHTING

At approximately 9:55 hours 12 January 1953 I was riding as a passenger in the private automobile of my superior, Mr. *****, Chief Investigator, Air Police Office, Kelly Air Force Base. As we turned southeast on Truker Drive, on Kelly Air Force Base, one of us observed two objects flying southeast of the base. One remarked, jokingly, "Look, flying saucers," and then added, "they are flying saucers." We stopped near Gate 3202 and watched the objects. One was apparently 7,000 to 9,000 feet above the earth, the other about 2,000 feet below the first and probably 2,000 feet to our left. They seemed to be about as large as a medium-sized plane. No vapor trail was visible, and no sound could be heard. The objects disappeared from sight in about four minutes.

At first we thought we were observing two jet aircraft in flight with the sun reflecting off their flight surfaces, but soon were convinced that such was not the case.

While we were watching, a twin-engine airplane circled the airdromes and passed between us and the objects.

Mr. ****** checked with the Kelly Tower and was told that no jet aircraft was in the area, and that the pilot of the twin-engine plane we had seen stated he had seen nothing.
