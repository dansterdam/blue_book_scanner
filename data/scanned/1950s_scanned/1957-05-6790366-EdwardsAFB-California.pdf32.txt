The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes an unidentified object sighting at Edwards Air Force Base on May 2, 1957. The text states that the sighting was investigated by civilian photo-theodolite operators who took pictures with "specialized camera equipment", but the results were inconclusive and no estimates were made regarding the size or altitude of the object. The officers involved were unsure of what the object was, although one said it could have been a balloon.

MAY 2, 1957: An unidentified object was sighted over Edwards Air Force Base in California. Civilian photo-theodolite operators were dispatched and took pictures with the "specialized camera equipment." Results were dispatched to intelligence headquarters, but the Intelligence Division reported that the results were inconclusive and there were no estimates as to its size or altitude. Edwards officers would not hazard a guess as to what the object was, although one said it could have been a balloon. Others, such as Lt. Isabel Epperson, of L.A., for California clippings.)
