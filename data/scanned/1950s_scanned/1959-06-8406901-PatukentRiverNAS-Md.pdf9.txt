10 December 1959

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 25 October 1959 concerning our report on the sighting of this object in the vicinity of Cincinnati.

I regret that we misunderstood this request as we did think they were sighting and had witnessed.

The 21 June 1959 incident at Hamilton, Ohio, was not a sighting. The Hamilton Laboratories had contacted the Air Force Base at Patterson Field when one of their employees reported hearing a sound which was thought to be a jet aircraft. Consequently, the Dayton-Patterson Air Force Base did not send a helicopter as requested, as there was no sighting.

All Air Force witnesses interviewed indicated no unusual objects were observed, and it appears that the sound was probably from some normal source and did not indicate the presence of a meteorite. The pieces of the object were definitely parts of a meteorite. The places where the object was found were examined with a magnetometer and no unusual magnetic readings were obtained. The letter outlining the Air Force conclusions followed.

We have no record of the 19 June 1959 sonic boom reports as carried in the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
