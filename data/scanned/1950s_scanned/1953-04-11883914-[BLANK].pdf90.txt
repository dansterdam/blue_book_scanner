this requirement would not permit many trained observers (scientists, pilots, etc.) to present important technical data, therefore it is recommended that a different questionnaire be used or that different channels be employed for communicating with this select group of individuals.

Whenever possible, the questions were written in multiple-choice form, so that they could be easily answered and accurately recorded. If it appeared that too many categories would be needed to cover all possible responses, or if the categories would lead to doubtful or erroneous interpretation, then the question was worded so that the observer could fill in his own answer. A large number of the questions permit the observer to give a "Don't Know" or a "Don't Remember" response, and thus do not force an incorrect answer.

It was decided that the observer should be asked to circle the correct answer to the multiple-choice items, thereby allowing minimum ambiguity in the instructions and maximum objective scoring. Systems such as checking or underlining the correct answer are often misinterpreted by the respondent because of previous experience with various ambiguous checking and "X-ing" systems, such as voting procedures.

It is anticipated that when a sufficient sample of replies has been received from the second questionnaire that further minor revisions will appear necessary.

FUTURE WORK
