BACK GROUND OF SYSTEM

There are at present no reliable, conclusive facts regarding so-called "Unidentified Flying Objects." The apparent intangible nature of the phenomena coupled with the wide range of conflicting observations and reports make it very difficult to obtain factual information. Moreover, many reports have been found to be due to misidentification of known natural and man-made objects.

Although the USAF has maintained a continuing interest in the reports of these objects, the lack of definite, tangible evidence precludes any final conclusions being drawn at this time. Further intensive and continued investigation, however, may eventually produce conclusive evidence as to the source and nature of these phenomena.
