I witnessed a sight I shall never forget. Even to this day, I have never heard or read any news report where anyone saw what I did as close or as clear or as long. No photograph nor description on my part, could ever do justice to my experience, nevertheless I endeavour an attempt to phrase it. Mildly, I saw: A tremendous, enormous, and huge object directly in front of me. It encompassed the whole lake & The corner of its edge is beyond reckoning. The tip seemed to be as high as anyone could see in the sky; however, the bottom was so low that it seemed it would have been possible able to be touched, if I could have been in about an eight story building & reached out to it. In shape, it was the most perfect roundness conceivable. To color, were or white, it was faintly a blue white. More or a silver diluted, so clear in color, there wasnt a speach [speck] or mark or shading in it. However it shone or slightly it seemed to glow with a luminous light. Aside from the delirious and explained, it reminded me of a full moon that had come down from the sky, enlarged incredibly and fallen into the atmosphere filling half the space in the air in front of me.
