This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which describes an incident where a man named Mr. Hams attempted to photograph birds flying over the Lubbock Avalanche Building in Lubbock, Texas.

Text from the document:

OF NOT THEY WERE MIGRATORY FOWL CAME UP. MR. HAMS DECIDED TO TRY TO GET A PICTURE HIMSELF SO HE STATIONED HIMSELF ON TOP OF THE LUBBOCK AVALANCHE BUILDING WITH A 4 X 5 SPEED GRAPHIC LOADED WITH A TUNGSTEN ASA 80 FILM AND A GE #22 FLASHBULB IN A CONCENTRATING REFLECTOR. HE NORMALLY USES THIS SAME EQUIPMENT TO PHOTOGRAPH NIGHT FOOTBALL GAMES. HE CAN GET A NORMAL EXPOSURE BY SHOOTING F 16, AT 1/100 OF A SECOND AND DEVELOPING TWICE THE NORMAL TIME IN DK-60 A DEVELOPER. THIS NIGHT HE SAT ON THE ROOF AND HAD HIS CAMERA SET AT F 4.7 AT 1/10 OF A SECOND. HE WAITED SOME TIME AND A FLOCK OF SOME TYPE OF BIRDS FLEW OVER. THEY WERE VISIBLE IN THE LIGHT OF THE SODIUM VAPOR STREET LIGHTS USED IN LUBBOCK. HE SHOT AS THE FLOCK WAS OVERHEAD. HE ALSO STATED THAT HE KNEW THEY WERE BIRDS BEFORE HE TOOK THE PICTURE BECAUSE HE COULD SEE THEM DIANLY OUTLINED. THEY WERE IN A V-FORMATION AND SILENT, WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR DUCKS OR GEESE, IF THEY WERE DUCKS OR GEESE. HE DEVELOPED HIS NEGATIVES AND FOUND THE IMAGE SO WEAK HE COULD NOT PRINT THEM. ON THE NEXT NIGHT HE ATTEMPTED THE SAME THING USING A KODAK REFLEX AT F 3.5 AT 1/10 WITH SUPER XX FILM, A #22 BULB AND THE CONCENTRATING REFLECTOR; THE RESULTS WERE THE SAME. MR. HAMS ASSUMED THAT WITH HIS EXPERIENCE HE SHOULD KNOW THAT HE WAS IN A POSITION IN THE CITY TO SEE A MAXIMUM OF LIGHT ON ANY BIRDS FLYING OVER HIM. FROM THIS, HE IS CONVINCED THAT WHATEVER HE TOOK A PICTURE OF WAS MANY TIMES AS BRIGHT AS THE BIRDS HE UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED TO PHOTOGRAPH.
MR. HAMS ADDED THAT SOME TIME BACK HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO PHOTOGRAPH AN ECLIPSE OF THE MOON. HE RAN INTO DIFFICULTY GETTING ENOUGH EXPOSURE, FURTHER INDICATING THAT THE SHOTS WERE OF A BRIGHT OBJECT. (THIS WAS LATER DISAPPROVED BY TAKING PHOTOS OF THE MOON. IT IS POSSIBLE HIS STATEMENT WAS MISINTERPRETED.)
MR. HARRIS IMPRESSED THE INTERVIEWERS AS A TYPICAL NEWSPAPER EDITOR. HE MADE IT VERY PLAIN THAT HE WAS NOT ONE TO HAVE SOMEONE USE HIS PAPER TO PERPETUATE A HOAX. HE HAS THOROUGHLY CHECKED BOTH THE PHOTOS AND REPORTS AND BELIEVES THEM TO BE VALID.
