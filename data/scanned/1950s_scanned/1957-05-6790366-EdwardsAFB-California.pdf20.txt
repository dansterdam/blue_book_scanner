Mr. [redacted]

Denver 3, Colorado

Dear Mr. [redacted],

The UFO photographed at Edwards Air Force Base in May was a balloon which was launched as a nearby launching site. 

The Air Force does not have sufficient personnel to furnish detailed information regarding each case files to the many persons who wish to write for profit on the subject of UFO's. Any attempt to publish such details would certainly curtail the essential functions of the Air Force and would be an unwarranted expenditure of public funds. You may recall however, that some time ago the Air Force in the interest of public information, cooperated with the national magazines, Life and Saturday Evening Post, in the preparation of articles on the subject of UFO's.

Sincerely, 

WALLACE W. ELWOOD
Captain, USAF
Assistant Adjutant
