Gentlemen:

I assure you or staff that I am writing this letter in a completely rational and logical frame of mind. I have made every possible attempt to lay aside prejudice, panic, hysterics, and over-zealousness of purpose.

I have been conducting personal investigations of VFO phenomena for two years. As yet I have not formed a definite and positive opinion as to the nature, purpose, or absolute practicalities of VFO sightings. I do not tend to form quick an opinions, for quite some time, if ever! An opinion formed about a this is controversial and sensitive to many people should not be formed with any amount of haste. The "truth" warrants unbiased and exhaustive analysis and research.

I have just read the book, Flying Saucers and the U.S. Air Force by Lieut. Colon Lawrence J. Tacker. This is a very good attempt to explain and clarify fly the "Flying Sauc up ot between June, 1947 and 1960.
