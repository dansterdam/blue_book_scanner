SPECIAL INQUIRY

Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

1. On 2 December 1950, this office received a letter from UNDERHILT STUDIO, 17 Park Place, New York, which contained an inquiry concerning the identity of an object discovered on a photograph. The letter stated that the picture had been taken on 20 May 1950 (later determined to be 20 May 1950) but this date was recently printed.

2. On 4 December 1950, Special Agent JOHN H. SMITH of this office, interviewed Mr. UNDERHILT of the UNDERHILT Studio. In a joint interview, the following information was obtained:

The photograph, a night view of Manhattan, was taken on 20 May 1950 (not on 20 May 1950 as stated in letter) from the roof of the UNDERHILT STUDIO building. At some time between 1950 and 1953, when the photograph was being processed, an unidentified object appeared in the sky near the Queensboro Bridge and Welfare Island, from East 59th Street in Manhattan. The photograph was taken with an Exito view camera. Another photograph taken immediately prior to the one in question did not reveal such an object.

The photograph titled "MIGHT LIGHTS" from Queens-boro Bridge view, requested by and delivered to Mr. Coventry E. Covert of the Herbert F. Covert Company, New York, N.Y. was later downgraded at a year interval, declassified at their 12 years.
