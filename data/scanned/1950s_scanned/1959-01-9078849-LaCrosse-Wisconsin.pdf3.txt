19 February 1959

This is to acknowledge your letter of 26 January 1959 concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object seen over La Crosse, Wisconsin, on 19 January 1959. 

A thorough search of our records indicates this particular sighting was not reported to the Air Force.

A check with Air Force radar and weather stations in the area failed to disclose any vehicle or balloon in the area at the time which would cause the effects described in the news article.

The fact that civil Aeronautics Administration personnel and local airport officials saw nothing unusual is also considered significant.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
