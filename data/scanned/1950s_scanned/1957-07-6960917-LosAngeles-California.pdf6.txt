On Sunday, 29 September 1957, the following incident involving sightings of a light craft took place over the Los Angeles area. The witnesses were a teenage girl and her boyfriend who were driving in a car on a country road at about 10:55 p.m. According to their report, they suddenly observed a light craft hovering over the road about 200 yards ahead of them. The craft appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and had a brilliant white light in the center. As they watched, the light dimmed and the craft moved away from them at a high rate of speed, tilting as it went. After it had passed over a hill, the light went out and it was gone. The witnesses stated that they were quite frightened when the craft first appeared and that it made no sound as it moved away.
