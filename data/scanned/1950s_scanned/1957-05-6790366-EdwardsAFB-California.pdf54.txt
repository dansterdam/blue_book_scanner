The image does not contain a photograph, but instead appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. The page includes instructions and questions for the observer to fill out, such as drawing a picture to show the motion of the object, estimating the size of the object, and describing the object's appearance compared to common objects. The text states that the object was an "aluminum color" and "150-175 feet in diameter".

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. If possible, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
(Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime

e. Quarter 
f. Half dollar

23.1 (Circle One) of the following to the best of your ability, how certain you are of your answer to Question 22:
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? It simply went too far out.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could hold up something in the sky which you saw. Describe, in your own words, a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
