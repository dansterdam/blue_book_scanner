Enclosed you will find a drawing which I made of the area in which we were when this object was sighted. It outlines the area of the beach, the objects, and major buildings. The flight path of this object is also outlined on this paper.

You may also mention that we have heard reports of two additional sightings of the same object? One sighting was reported to us by an elderly woman. She described it as the same which we had seen, claiming that this happened about two weeks prior to our sighting. I do not have the names of this persons at this time. This object was also sighted again on Labor Day of this year by some of the persons who witnessed the first sighting. Both sightings were reported to be at the same time of night; around 11:15 P.M.

Please feel free to call on me at any time if I can be of any assistance that may be able to discuss this matter with anyone of the others who were present. I am sure that arrangements can be made. I can be reached at the following phone number during the day; between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M.
