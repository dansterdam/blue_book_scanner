SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO:
Commanding Officer
Air Technical Intelligence Center

3 July 1952

1. The following information pertaining to the above captioned
subject is transmitted to your headquarters, as received by this office
from the 5th District OSI, Louisville, Kentucky Attachment:
"On 27 June 1952, Captain JACK WEBB, 109th CIC Detachment
Louisville, Kentucky, advised that Special Agent EDWARD J. LAMMER,
109th CIC Detachment, interviewed on 26 June 1952, Mr.
DRPP, Contractor, Greensboro, Kentucky, concerning instant matter.
DRPP is a former Major (Reserve USNR) and presently a Lt. Colonel
in the Kentucky National Guard. DRPP stated that he saw his first 'flying saucer' on 23 June 1952 at approximately 1000 hours. The
sighting took place 3 miles east of Greensboro on U.S. highway 60.
DRPP was walking north when he heard a noise similar to a flight
of aircraft but high altitude. Upon looking up and ahead of the noise,
he saw two round objects resembling giant soap bubbles that reflected
the sun in a yellow-lavenderish light. The objects were proceeding
north, flying in trail (one behind the other) and passed out of
sight in about five (5) seconds. DRPP sustained the objects were
at 15 to 20 thousand feet altitude. The sighting took place on a
very bright, clear day. DRPP added that he was accompanied by
C. C. RYAN, who saw only one of the objects. No further pertin-
ent information was obtained from DRPP by Special Agent LAMMER."
