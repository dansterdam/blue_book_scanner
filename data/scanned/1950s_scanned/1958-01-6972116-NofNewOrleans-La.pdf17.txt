Efforts to obtain the data requested by Senator E. (cont'd)

UNCLASSIFIED. 

This case was referred to the Air Force to obtain more data on the sighting and to locate the witnesses, in order to obtain a more detailed report since the original report was incomplete. 

Congressman E. is brief, after all, the case is a farther example of the difficulty in getting reliable information on the few good cases which do come to our attention. In this instance, it is apparent that if the original witnesses had been properly interviewed at the time, a more complete report would have been obtained. As it is, here is another example of a case where, due to the passage of time and the difficulty in locating the witnesses, the report remains with skepticism.
