There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed letter on the letterhead of "Winder's Feed and Seed Store" located in Longview, Washington. The letter is dated July 9, 1964 and is addressed to "Cap't. Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio" from an unnamed writer.

The text of the letter discusses a previous newspaper article and the writer's views on unresolved UFO cases, as well as the writer's belief that the reported movement of the "saucers" may be due to some natural electrical phenomenon. The writer also requests a copy of a report that they believe may be related to their theory.
