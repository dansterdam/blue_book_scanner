There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

EDWARDS: 
Still ... a rather neat job ... for those of us not up on our Sputniks.

WHEDON:
The important thing here is that this type of hoax besides being a violation of federal law, it is a rather expensive joke. A single UFO investigation may well cost the government $10,000. The perpetrators of these childish pranks might think twice about it when they remember it's their own tax money that's being wasted ... money that could go into serious research so badly needed at this time.

EDWARDS:
In the total picture, Colonel, what percentage of current UFO reports does the Air Force classify as hoaxes?

WHEDON: 
We lump this category into a general heading, along with sightings.
