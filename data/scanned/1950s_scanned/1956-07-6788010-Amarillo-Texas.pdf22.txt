COMMENTS REGARDING PIXLEY CASE

1. This Center has no report under that identification. 

2. Numerous alleged UFO sightings are reported directly to, or are collected exclusively by, unofficial UFO groups. The majority have periodic publications, usually a monthly paper, which describe the incidents.

Many UFO sightings are reported only to newspapers. Where such "sightings" are reported to the Air Force, an investigation is difficult or impossible to conduct directly. As a matter of policy, the Air Force cannot consider cases not officially reported to it, as we must confine our investigations to bona fide incidents.

6-8 weeks or months later, when conclusions are reached, information is no longer possible, the Air Force is often queried regarding the status or explanation of the incident.
