The provided image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on what appears to be an old document. I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

"Indicating rapidly the time elapsed was my opinion. The object gave off a very bright light which cast shadows of the main body as it passed swiftly overhead. The light was so intense that objects in its path were clearly visible. The object apparently was from 40 to 80 feet in length and was observed through a clear sky for approximately 80 seconds as it passed out of sight to the south. At no time did the object alter its course or speed, maintaining a constant velocity and direction until it disappeared from view. This case is of particular interest in view of the detailed description of the object, the estimate of its size, and the duration of the sighting."
