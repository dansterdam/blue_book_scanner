There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing sketches and instructions for drawing the motion and shape of an unidentified object.

The text from the document is as follows:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details or parts of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
