It is believed that this picture is of the same one which was secured and shown to sgt. allen which are located at washington, d.c.
the image of the object is progicted to be a conventional one of which the shape does appear in the photograph.
which are considered to be the apparent size of the object.
the shading of this area in the pictures is of the similar amount observed in washington, d.c.
