The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from a Project Blue Book report, likely describing a UFO sighting incident.

The text in the document reads as follows:

believe it varies and 200 to 600 feet is closer to the truth and, in addition, the timing of the appearance atmospheric conditions may also help determine
The interceptor pilot continued to try and shake the UFO for a considerable time (we could not communicate occasions! ly and we could not reach him over the radio, how long he was attempting to intercept the UFO we are not certain)
He finally said, "I'm returning to Station Lakenheath." As near as we can determine this was at 0122 Z. The pilot was never able to overtake the UFO and it finally disappeared from his radar.
Now let me report something which I have just learned. The officer who drove the interceptor (who stopped and chased the UFO) has been interviewed here (in London) and he advised the interceptor that the UFO target lost all power during the chase, that it appeared to stop and hover, then suddenly accelerate to a fantastic speed.
 number two interceptor pilot could not get closer than about 1 mile, he was never able to close on it.
whatever it was, it was maneuvering in a most incredible fashion - like nothing we have ever tracked before. I am disturbed because we had his radar on it and yet he could not get within range to do anything about it. He felt quite certain that this was a solid object - not some freak radar target.
