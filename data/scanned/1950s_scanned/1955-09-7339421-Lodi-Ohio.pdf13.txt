AF FORM 112â€”PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948
(UNCLASSIFIED)
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
(REPORT NO. 3B-UFO3-1-55 PART FIVE)

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER;

1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the objects seen by the observers can be resolved as known objects for the following reasons:

a. In the case of the sighting by ROSE M. PRESZNICK and ELAINE M. FONACHINO there were two objects observed. One a known object and the other unknown. The known object was the outline of a searchlight going into the overcast to the East of them. The unknown object was described as the "biggest fireball" vaguely. The direction of travel was Westerly from the South East to the South West. Sound of the object was faint and steady with the exception of "two explosions like that of a firecracker." Even the sounds of the "explosions" were very faint. It is therefore considered that she cannot be absolutely sure they didn't come from another source, possibly on the ground. A possible, and more logical explanation is considered the resolution of the sighting and became apparent during the conversation with JOSEPH F. LEATHERMAN.

b. In the case of the sighting by JOSEPH F. LEATHERMAN there were also two objects seen. One a known end the other unknown. The known object was that of an aircraft passing overhead from the East to the South West. Direction of travel was West by South West. Altitude was high but the sound was still distinguishable as that, possibly due to his AF experience. It seems that this is the UFOs reported by ROSE M. PRESZNICK. The unknown object in this case, was described circling in a very definite pattern. Although Mr. LEATHERMAN was certain that the object was an air vehicle of some sort, it seems that he was mistaken as all evidence as received from MTS PRESZNICK and the Akron Airport point to the fact that what was actually seen was a light from a searchlight beacon projected on the overcast.
