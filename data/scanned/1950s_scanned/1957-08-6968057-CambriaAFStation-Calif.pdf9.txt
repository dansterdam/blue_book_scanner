27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (the first line). If you first saw it, please an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was at its highest point. If it passed on, place a "C" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.
28. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
