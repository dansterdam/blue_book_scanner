Although these effects seemed impressive, I am quite familiar with airplanes, ships and other conventional objects. There is no doubt that what I saw was something unusual and quite novel. It appeared to be a metallic object suspended in the sky some distance above ground level, and was observed for ten or fifteen minutes as it moved silently around.
