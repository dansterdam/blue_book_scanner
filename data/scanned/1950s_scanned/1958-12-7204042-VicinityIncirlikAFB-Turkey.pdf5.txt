ASTRONOMY

Winter Stars Shine

The December skies offer the astronomer much to observe. This brilliant display continues for several months, making December an ideal time to become better acquainted with the constellations.

Although rapidly drawing away 
from the earth, the planet Mars is 
still fairly prominent in the western 
sky after sunset. It is now about 67,500,000 miles distant from 
the earth, and its brilliance is waning. The star Arcturus in Bootes, the herdsman, is high in the sou-
thwest and a conspicuous object.

Sirius, the dog star, in Canis Major, the big dog, is the brightest
of all the stars and reaches its highest position in the south about 
8 o'clock. Orion, the hunter, with his three belt stars, is one of the
most prominent constellations. Aldebaran, the bright star in Taurus, the bull, is low in the eastern sky. The Pleiades, or seven sisters, are high overhead. Cassiopeia, the woman, is in the northeast, and the two bears, Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, are well placed for 
observation.

In the northwest there are still visible two stars, Vega in Lyra, the harp, and
Arcturus in Bootes. These set slowly as winter progresses.

The planet Venus, as bright as it is, really pales in comparison with Sirius, 
the dog star. This brilliant star makes an impressively dazzling appearance 
in the evening sky. At the end of December it is the highest star in the sky,
reaching its greatest brilliance for the winter.

Jupiter, the largest of the planets, is also high in the southwest, and at about 
the same altitude as Sirius, but Jupiter does not glisten with the steady 
brilliance of Sirius. Saturn is a morning star, rising shortly after 3 o'clock. 
In the early morning, just before sunrise, the brilliant planet Venus will be at 
the position closest to the sun for this season, between the 15th and the 16th 
of December. This is called inferior conjunction, and Venus will then pass 
from the evening sky to the morning sky.
