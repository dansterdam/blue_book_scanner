August 24, '64

Major Maston M. Jacks,
Dept. of the Air Force,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

I have filled out the questionnaire sent me on August 18th and am returning it herewith.

I am still very much interested in reporting this sighting. After twelve years I have no reason to change any part of this letter except for two minor corrections which I have noted.

I still recall with amusement some carefully disguised considerations in the original questionnaire which suggested that I had been drinking before the sighting. My reply was that I hadn't been drinking before, but that I sure went up to the cabin and took a good stiff one afterward.

I was considerably "shook up", and still am whenever I think about it. 

My interest in this matter has not been renewed, and I will be glad to have any further information you may be able to give me.

Yours sincerely,
