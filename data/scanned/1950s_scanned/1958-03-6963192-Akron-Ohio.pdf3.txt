Sir:

This message is being forwarded to you as requested for your information. For your general information it was first observed at 8:55 p.m. or about 9:00 p.m. on February 28, 1958 by State Police Trooper, Ohio, on the Ohio Turnpike, near Ohio toll plaza 17.1, which is located 7.2 miles south of the Akron Depot.

This trooper, at about 9:00 p.m., observed the alleged matter floating and gliding in the sky about 250 feet to 300 feet in altitude near the Ohio Turnpike, and 7.2 miles south of the Akron Depot. This unit was assigned the complaint and arrived at the scene at 12:15 a.m. This unit was able to observe the object as it was first sighted, but it disappeared after about 10 minutes. The troopers attempted to contact the object using the patrol car spotlight, but it did not respond. The troopers then received permission to switch the pursuit car to the control tower at Akron-Canton Airport.

Respectfully yours,

Sgt. Jf. J. Martino 
Ohio Highway Patrol
