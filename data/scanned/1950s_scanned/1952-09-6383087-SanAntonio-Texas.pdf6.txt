STATEMENT
At approximately 2230 hours, CST, 7 September 1952, my wife and I were visiting friends at [redacted]. We were just leaving the residence when we noticed an unusual phenomenon in the eastern sky. A dark orange explosion-like flash appeared and remained visible for approximately three seconds, then went out. This explosion appeared to be approximately fifteen miles distance at approximately twenty thousand feet altitude and appeared to be the size of a pea held at arm's length.
I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
