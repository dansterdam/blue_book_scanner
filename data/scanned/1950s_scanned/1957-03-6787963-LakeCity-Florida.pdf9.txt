March 8, 1957. Victor Hancock and Guy Milier, pilots for Tennessee Gas Transmission Company, were flying a company DC-3 from Beaumont to Houston, Texas, when they encountered a UFO. At about 7:15 PM, as they were flying over Palacios at 1,500 feet, an object with three large, white, brilliant lights started in front of their aircraft. The object was going south, it was said, "and veered off high and fast, lost by us easily." He said that it hovered, then sped off, had no navigation lights, and acted under complete control. The brilliance of this object's lights kept the pilots from getting a definite idea of its shape. "I still don't know what it was," Milier said, "when it wanted to, it seemed to stop, just under us. I would bank around, get close to it and it would be gone again." They got further details of the object's lights keeping the pilots from studying its shape. At the time the object vanished, "it was just massing around with us." The report was approaching Ellington Air Force Base's main runway by the pilots, and it "cut across military traffic." At the time the object vanished, it was said to be "200 feet over runway." One Ellington AFB, and Houston International Airport and Ellington officials were investigating. Hancock said the civil helicopter's power plant scares radar operator reported to him by radio that he had picked up an object close to the plane's position, then lost it, but up reported that the twin force was unable to pick up the target.
