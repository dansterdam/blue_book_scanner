MEDITERRANEAN SEA
Third Officer Kaminski, of the American S.S. Atlantic Seaman, Captain Martin E.Dahl, Master, reports that while on route to Port Said, G.M.T. October 15, 1952, he observed a comet-like streak which appeared in the north at an altitude of about 10°, which moved in a curve to the east and then curved upward and downward in an undulating fashion. After about 5 seconds, at an altitude of 340°, it exploded with a blinding flash which illuminated the entire area for about 4 seconds. A trail of smoke then curved upward and broke up into scattered particles. This trail was visible for at least 10 minutes before it disappeared.
A similar observation was made by Mr. Kaminski on the night of November 16 in South Seas Bay, but was brighter and in more of a southward direction. It was visible for about 5 seconds.
