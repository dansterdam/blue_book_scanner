Dear Sir:
Recently I submitted to you a strange object sighted near here. As stated a strange object passed the immediate vicinity and from the direction and actions appeared to be of a metallic nature.
A round shaped craft was observed passing over us at a high rate of speed, as nearly as can be estimated from 3000 to 4000 feet in altitude. It made a sound like a normal aircraft, but the lack of propulsion method or wing formation was quite obvious. As it passed over again, there appeared to be a slight protrusion or small dome on the upper surface, and the speed and maneuverability were astounding.
I have seen ships of flight before, but this certainly was a strange occurrence.
Sincerely yours,
