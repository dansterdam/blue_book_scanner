Strip : I was returning from
Cai if. to my home in Elizabeth 
Ohio, my girlfriend on the state 
of New mexico, on a very clear 
day , in the distant sky I 
saw what appeared to me 
to be a very fast object which 
seemed to be traveling away from
into space at a extremely
fast rate of speed. I have
seen airplanes travel at a 
very fast rate of speed, in
instant spots. I effect that I describe
moving faster than anything
I have ever seen, in the 
sky.
