The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document containing a list of questions and instructions related to investigating an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

1. Can Dr. Hynek. Is there any specific poop he wants?
2. Get questionnaires filled out by all people who observed objects. I think Questionnaires were sent but talk is support.
3. Get poop on backgrounds - are the people experienced at reading theodolites.
4. Get story of circumstances, who saw what first, who called who, etc. 
5. Description of what object did for the five hour period. (Should be in questionnaires.)
6. What were the arrangement of lights and what were comparative size?
7. Has it been seen since or was it ever seen before?
8. Were there any radar pick-ups? N/o
9. Did all people see the same thing?
10. Any opinions as to what it was.
11. Calibrating theodolites at Presque Isle and Limestone.
a. Pick out a known celestial body in the general area or where the object was seen.
b. Get the exact time by getting a time tick if necessary.
c. Take ten theodolite readings at two minute intervals noting exact time, elevation and bearing. Be sure to which body you are shooting.
12. Find out if readings we got are true or magnetic. If they should be magnetic set variation for this area.
13. It would probably be a good idea to talk to each observer along, especially as to the description of the object.
14. Leave a couple dozen questionnaires at both places. Also take a few radar questionnaires if they are finished.
