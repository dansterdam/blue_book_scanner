The image appears to contain three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marked on it, indicating how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second and third sketches are larger and appear to show the position and shape of the object the observer saw, with one sketch labeled "Furuville".

Now, I will perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
