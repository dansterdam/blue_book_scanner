Transcribing the text from the document:

At approximately 6:00 a.m. on 6 April 1952 this unidentified flying object was observed by the undersigned and several other interested parties of this area. The object was observed for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes until it disappeared from view, moving in a southerly direction at high speed.

The object was circular in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and appeared to be metallic in nature. It remained motionless at first, then suddenly accelerated to a high rate of speed, made several abrupt changes in direction, and then continued on a southerly course until it was lost from view.
