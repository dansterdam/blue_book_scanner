Re: Memo Fro,

I believe that you have received a memo from
me April 15 regarding an object seen by him and his brother.

I talked to Officer ,,) about this before 
he sent to the memo and instructed him to send it. it is an 8-page memo
unusual conditions. Then i referred a copy to the 118 ARROMT staff
on April 21th regard memo.

1 believe that this incident should be reported
to the Air Force as they are interested in these conditions and have
a creen designed to such event with us. I understand this has been
investigated by them and that I would like a further report on the
extent of the data when this is prepared for future reference and also
the description of the object.

We have not mentioned the incident around here
and only learned about it after the memo reached us. Anything of
this particular nature is too late as they are more than a few
it as there are none as this as only way to see if
we first saw it when it was seen in this horizon as a was
not first few as usual at dinsnpeared from the view.

Yours very truly,
