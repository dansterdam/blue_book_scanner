Civilian U. F. O. Research

(chicago, illinois)
9 September 1960

Office of Information Services
Department of the Air Force
226 W. Jackson Blvd.
Chicago, Illinois

Gentlemen:

I have been trying to learn the conclusions by the Air Force of two sightings of unidentified flying objects in this area.

Correspondence with Lt. Col. L.J. Tacker, Office of Information, Washington, has brought a statement that they were not reported to the Air Force at ATIC. Since the sightings were reported to officials at O'Hare AFB, an identification must have been made by these officials, thereby ending the necessity of forwarding the reports to ATIC (as per AFR 200-2, section 9).

If, however, they were not identified and not reported, this would constitute a violation of AFR 200-2, section 4, paragraph 2.

Information regarding these sightings follows:

(a) 4 Nov 1957 - Elmwood Park, Ill.--early morning. Two policemen and a fireman in a patrol car saw and attempted to follow a red-orange object that, at times, manuevered at low altitudes. At one time, the lights on the patrol car dimmed, apparently due to the presence of the object. This object was immediately reported to O'Hare AFB and the witnesses were questioned by Air Force officers.
 
(b) 19 Jul 1958 - Des Plaines, Ill.--early morning. Three men at corner of Lee & Algonquin, Des Plaines, saw a bright red object pass overhead, silently, hover momentarily over O'Hare, then take off at very high speed. Sighting was reported to Des Plaines Police at 0345 hrs., 19 July. (Record Bureau Number 31335). The following day, one witness contacted O'Hare and reported the sighting. The Des Plaines Journal also contacted Air Force officials.

I would like to know the official conclusion in these cases in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 9.

Respectfully yours;

(redacted)
4/1
