I, ______, 165th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Biloxi, Mississippi, do hereby make the following statements:

On 23 April 1952, I was coming out of the Squadron Mess Hall when I saw what looked like a flying saucer. The time was about 1945 mountain standard time. The object was traveling at an unestimated speed and at what looked like to be flying at approximately 40,000 feet. The object was visible until it turned sideways at which time it disappeared because of the saucer like shape. After approximately five (5) to ten (10) minutes after sighting, the object disappeared.

Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 22nd day of April 1952.
