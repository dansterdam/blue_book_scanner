31 October 1958
Subj: Unidentified Flying Object, reporting of

The object was observed by Mr. John J. and various other witnesses apparently reliable. 

The object was first sighted about 30 degrees above the horizon traveling downwards at great speed. The object appeared to be a basketball, circular, blue-green in color, and had a blue streak "tail" estimated to be 30 feet long. The observer stated that the object appeared to be uniform in color and size, and seemed to be slowing down at the end of the sighting. The observation of the object was maintained only momentarily.

The observer stated he moved forward in an attempt to follow the object to the stern of the vessel when the object disappeared behind some nearby observers. The object was visible for no more than 2 miles range approximately.

Several other witnesses noted a multi-engine U.S. Air Force aircraft circling the vicinity of the sighting for about ten minutes after the observation.

The weather was clear and sunny. The date of the reported sighting, 28 October 1958, was clear and the object was very bright, although the observer thought it was nearer and smaller than the actual object.

Mr. G. also reported that he and his wife had sighted the "missile" party approximately while driving his automobile on a local highway. (This "missile" party is thought to be usual reactions to re-entering.)

The observer, Mr. J., was employed as a leadingman shipfitter at the U.S. Naval Shipyard, Charleston, S.C., and was considered a reliable and responsible observer. There is no further evidence concerning this sighting in the event it is made public information.

There appears to be no further evidence concerning this sighting of an unidentified flying object.
