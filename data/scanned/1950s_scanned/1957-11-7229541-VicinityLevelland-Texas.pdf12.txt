LEVELLAND, TEXAS "BLUE LIGHT" CASE
2 NOVEMBER 1957

Five witnesses report seeing objects in the vicinity of Levelland, Texas in the early morning hours of 2 November 1957. The objects observed were reported to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter and surrounded by a blue glow. The description of the UFOs is that they were found to be in a stationary position, with their lights extinguished and a flame of white lights at several of the witnesses reported that the estimated duration of the sightings was approximately 20 seconds. On 4 November 1957, a witness reported an UFO observed and the object rose and disappeared into the base of the clouds.  

The incident on 2 November 1957 was a 1,000 foot overcast, visibility three miles, light and variable winds from the northwest. The incident on 4 November 1957, thick heavy clouds.

It is concluded that the cause of the sightings on 2 November 1957 was probably a weather phenomenon. The cause for the witnesses' observations could be attributed to a meteorological situation, possibly phosphorescence. In one instance, a faulty distributor was determined as being the cause for the sighting under consideration.

The object sighted on 4 November 1957 was probably a weather balloon, for which identification is claimed.
