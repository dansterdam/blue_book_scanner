ALLISON
Inter-Office Memo
Date: February 24, 1951
SUBJECT: "Flying Saucer" Picture
TO: Lt Col J. B. Frye

CONFIDENTIAL UNCLASSIFIED

On February 16, 1951, a report was received from a confidential informant that he had often discussed communism and aeronautics with another employee. Two or three weeks prior to this time, the informant had told our informant that he had seen some pictures which were taken by a brother or brother-in-law who worked in Washington, D.C.

Our informant's suspicion was aroused when he gave him the enclosed pictures and told him if anyone had seen them before he got them they "would be in Jail". Our informant was reluctant to send other employees to our informant to see the picture instead of showing it to them himself. After returning the picture to our informant, he told him that he had misplaced it, and this seemed to make him uneasy.

An investigator was sent to Seymour, Indiana to investigate the background of the man who was found to have a brother and a sister. The brother is a teen-ager in school, and the sister, who was mentioned, is also working at our Plant 10, 25-63057.

On February 19 our investigator reported that the brother works in a government segregation zone, which is similar to a government computation zone, and a sister who is working in Civil Service. This was verified through a man in the Service who reported he saw letters from these brothers to friends.

On February 20 our informant told our informant that he had a magazine at hone that advised that the Army would make a startling statement about June 1, 1951 and indicated that this announcement would be about flying saucers.
