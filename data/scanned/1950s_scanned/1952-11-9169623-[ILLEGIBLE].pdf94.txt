There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

The text in the document appears to be redacted or illegible in several places, so I will not attempt to transcribe the full text. Instead, I will simply state that the image contains handwritten text, with some portions that are illegible.
