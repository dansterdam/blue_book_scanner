STORM STATEMENT
10 November 1952

Lt Albert F. Hadford, USAF, 22191367 of the 252nd Air Force Squadron was on a troop training mission between 1300 and 1200 on November 8, 1952 at 1005 on the range at 1113 degrees and 97 miles. The speed was about 6 miles per sweep. The ship was maintaining sight to east across space. It was unresponsive to radio communications. It is believed to be a large trace and reported as such to the crew chief. This time estimate is based on time from 1303 to 1400. The planes landed at the range after the mission at 97 miles. At this speed it was into 10 miles again. This time is only based for a contact of several and then disappeared at about 60 miles. The Tech-rep changed its course during this time. When he did the ship decreased to fairly low altitude where it remained with no further contacts.

I have been a troop operator for four months with the 757th AACN Squadron.
