TRANSCRIPT OF A SHORT TELEPHONIC REPORT RECEIVED ON 6 MAY 1959 FROM MAJOR SAADAT OF THE IRANIAN AIR FORCE IN TEHRAN, IRAN. REPORT RECEIVED BY MAJOR SOHIER OF THE IRANIAN AIR FORCE.

AT 0130 HOURS ON 6 MAY 1959 TWO IRANIAN AF F-86 SABRE JET INTERCEPTORS WERE SCRAMBLED TO INVESTIGATE FOUR UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS DETECTED ON RADAR OVER THE TEHRAN AREA. THE OBJECTS WERE TRACKED ON RADAR AT SPEEDS UP TO 600-700 MPH AND ALTITUDES UP TO 60,000 FT. WHEN THE INTERCEPTORS CLOSED IN, THE OBJECTS CHANGED DIRECTION AND OUTRAN THE JETS. GROUND CONTROL THEN LOST RADAR CONTACT WITH THE OBJECTS.

A SECOND MISSION WAS LAUNCHED TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. AGAIN, THE INTERCEPTORS COULD NOT CLOSE IN ON THE FAST-MOVING OBJECTS. DURING THE SECOND INTERCEPT ATTEMPT, THE LEAD PILOT'S INSTRUMENTS WENT OFF AND HIS AIRCRAFT'S LIGHTS WENT OUT, CAUSING HIM TO ABORT HIS MISSION. HIS INSTRUMENTS AND LIGHTS RETURNED TO NORMAL WHEN HE BROKE OFF THE CHASE.
