Aerial object. 
It appeared to me to be either a controlled landing or a 
thin glide of a metal object, that could have turned up 
coming through outer space and was gliding to a crash. 
I request that if your office is interested - I would be 
glad - especially, when the thing is out - to have an air 
force representative meet me and I will show the details, 
direction of flight - altitude - pointing heavy vision - and if 
it were necessary, though doubtful, we could try radio 
have a light them plan of camera if on the course -
I really now, the effect of this time loss, but one does 
not enjoy courtesy jot - it would not was not until we saw this 
more of indiscriminable flying objects, that our thought slowly that 
this were thought must (may-be) should tell if their experience.
