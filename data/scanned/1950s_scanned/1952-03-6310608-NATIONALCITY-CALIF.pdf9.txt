The image contains a newspaper article with the headline "Hundreds See Fireball Flash Across S.D. Sky". The article describes reports of a "green fireball with a long tail" that was seen by hundreds of people in the San Diego, California area on the night of March 6, 1952. The article mentions that the Coast Guard, the Navy, and other organizations were investigating the incident, though they were unable to determine the exact nature and origin of the object.

The text in the document is as follows:

'GREEN WITH LONG TAIL'
Hundreds See Fireball
Flash Across S.D. Sky
Hundreds of startled San Diegans who reported seeing the phenomenon agreed it was a huge mass of green light, a fiery tail. It angled down toward the southwest and then appeared to burst out and go out, the observers said.
Rudolph M. Lippitt, secretary of the San Diego Astronomical Society, tentatively identified the object as "a giant meteor."
He said, "This was not a plane, not a rocket and not an atomic explosion. It was a huge fireball, green in color, with a tail like a comet. The Coast Guard and the Navy are also investigating it as a rare phenomenon."
Dr. Chester Sillwerinaia, State College astronomy professor, said it probably was a meteor.
He said "This could not be accurately determined without more information on its speed and altitude."
