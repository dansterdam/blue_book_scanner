AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
1-19-53
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon, Anchorage, Alaska
This document furnished to the U. S. AAF District Intelligence Office, 
Anchorage, Alaska. 
Lt. Henry Stake, circuit #3, HAZ, Anchorage, Alaska. 
Subject:   At approximately 6:15 AM on 1-16-53, Lt. STEPHEN HENSLEY observed a bright object in the sky to the south, apparently hovering approximately 30 miles from Anchorage, Alaska. The object appeared as a single bright light, slightly larger than a star and with a luminescence greater than a planet. It maintained a relatively fixed position in the sky for approximately 30 minutes, then began to move in a northerly direction at a very high rate of speed. The object quickly diminished in size and eventually disappeared from view. 
Lt. STEPHEN HENSLEY, the observer, is considered to be a reliable and conscientious officer. His report is considered to be accurate and factual. The time of observation, weather conditions, and the general description of the object are consistent with other reports received from the Anchorage area. 
Although the newspaper article indicated unusual and unexplained sightings of this nature are becoming quite prevalent and believe that use of the binoculars may have contributed to the sighting, there was no sound, trail, or exhaust associated with the object. 
Sightings of this nature have been of increasing frequency in the Anchorage area and may have some significance in the overall problem of unidentified aerial phenomena.
