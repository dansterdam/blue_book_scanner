The image does not contain any photographs. It is a scanned page from a UFO report document that appears to describe some tourists examining a landing spot. The text in the image states:

"Vins-Sur-Caramy - Top-Some tourists examining the landing spots. Bottom - Jimmy with Mme. Delcroix Ayraud to his right studying traces left by the object that was registering on the magnetic deviation of one of the guide poles that was near the spot where the 'object' landed."
