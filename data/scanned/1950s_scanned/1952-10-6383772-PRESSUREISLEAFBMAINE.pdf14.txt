One incident that particularly engaged the attention of the panel, and would probably have become a famous classic except that Air Force investigators had it as a strike secret, was the sighting at Presque Isle Air Force Base in northern Maine. On October 15, 1952, at about 10:15 p.m., E.S.T. a group of weather observers saw the early horizon and had set up a theodolite to measure its altitude and bearing. As the glow-ing sub-known slowly rose higher above the horizon and seemed to become closer, it appeared through the telescope of the theodolite as a strange disk accompanied by four flickering green lights, two on each side. Alarmed by this spectacular phenomenon, the observers called the Air Force Base at Limestone, some twenty miles north and east, to ask whether the object was visible there. It was. Setting up a theodolite, the Limestone observers confirmed the Presque Isle observers' account and both groups of observers saw the strange object for nearly an hour. Here was the kind of situation the investigators had been hoping for: simultaneous observations of a single object, made from two different stations a known distance apart. Calculations based on the observations showed that the object was about twenty-five miles from each station and was estimated to be approximately 300 feet in diameter.
