SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

GENTLEMEN:

THE FOLLOWING PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVED BY DR. *** AND DR. ***

DATE AND TIME: OCTOBER 9, 1958 AT 7:40 P.M., M.S.T.

PLACE: ON THE MORSE CREEK ROAD IN THE BRIDGER NATIONAL FOREST, APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MILES FROM THE GREEN RIVER LAKES AREA AND PINEDALE, WYOMING.

THE WEATHER WAS QUITE CLEAR WITH ALL STARS BEING EASILY VISIBLE FROM THIS REMOTE SECTION.

AT A COMPASS READING OF S.S.E., AT APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES OFF THE HORIZON, A BRIGHT BLUISH-GREEN OBJECT WAS OBSERVED. IT FIRST CAME INTO VIEW AND MOVED RAPIDLY SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE SKY WITH VARYING DEGREES OF BRIGHTNESS FOR A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN MINUTES. THIS OBJECT STAYED IN THE SAME GENERAL VICINITY BUT HAD A VERY ERRATIC MOTION WITH VARYING DEGREES OF BRIGHTNESS. IT REMAINED BRIGHT ENOUGH FOR THE GREATEST PART OF THE SIGHTING TO BE OBSERVED AGAINST THE STARRY SKY. DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES, IT GRADUALLY FADED AND COULD NO LONGER BE OBSERVED. THE VARYING INTENSITY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN OBSERVED ON SPUTNIK. AT TIMES, A SECOND OBJECT SEEMED TO BE PRESENT BUT IT CAME CLOSE TO THE LARGER OBJECT ONLY TO RECEDE JUST PRIOR TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MAIN OBJECT.

WE, OF COURSE, WILL APPRECIATE YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THIS LETTER AND ANY FURTHER COMMENT, AS WE ARE MOST INTERESTED IN THIS PHENOMENON.

SINCERELY YOURS,

*** M.D.
