DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

4 February 1959

Dear [Redacted],

Thank you for reporting your sighting of unidentified flying objects sighted over the past eleven and a half years. To assist the Air Force with the continuing of your sighting, please complete the enclosed questionnaire and forward it directly to:

Commander 
Air Technical Intelligence Center 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

It is understandable that sometimes during the press of exceptional circumstances some detail is omitted or proportions, but when given subsequent consideration, under laws you mentioned a mile or more does detail completely cut to the size of a half dollar if this is true, then at four miles the object is some 10 or 60 yards estimated to be, if you were in 60 seconds and this point would be closed to 60 miles in the minute, than the 7 miles estimated in your letter. It will be very helpful during analysis of this information if you would elaborate on this information when you complete the questionnaire.  

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major USAF 
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
