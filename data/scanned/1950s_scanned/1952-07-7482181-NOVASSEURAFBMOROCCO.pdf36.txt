Text from the document:
On 12 July 1952, the text of an article which appeared in the "Atlantic Review" on 5 July 1952, the following was reported by Bud Gardner:
"Flying Saucers" have been seen in the Casablanca sky. And their flight over the city was observed by several people for about ten minutes. The T.W.A. station manager here, the following is a statement by Bud Gardner:
On the roof terraces at the Play Club last night when all of a sudden Danny Louis said "Look, Look, Look". With that, 24 Louis (Bunny's husband), O. D. Griffin, Mrs. V. Knoll, her husband and her daughter, Batty Handcock and myself looked up to the sky. Very rapidly, what looked like a formation of about 20 to 30 objects passed by, giving the impression of some glowing discs or metallic objects.
The formation appeared to be the same type used in military air maneuvers with one trailing the other.
When we first saw them, they were about "one o'clock" and moved across the sky about "three o'clock" in a matter of seconds. We just couldn't believe our eyes. Had one or two people seen them it could have been considered an optical illusion, but with five people observing them, we know that they could not have been the lights of an aircraft, nor anything else we are familiar with. These glowing objects were completely silent, and no sound was associated with them.
Some must have had different versions of what the shape of the objects were, because we all had a different opinion of what they looked like. Looked like, looked like reflecting objects, some like discs, and the general opinion was that they were of metallic construction.
