Belgrade, Yugoslavia

Flying Saucers. Stories of these mysterious vehicles are legion; only rarely, however, are phenomena of this type observed with as much reliability and authenticity. Yesterday, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, occurred another incident of this sort.
In the first case, radio belinne received on February 15th a communication from the research department of the Yugoslav Air Force stating that a formation of flying saucers had flown over a Belgrade suburb on February 15th. They were, it appears, developed by the research department of the Yugoslav Air Force and they had the following characteristics: diameter, 15 meters; speed, 1000 kilometers per hour; altitude, 3000 meters; equipped with radio control. A further display is "scheduled for Marshal Tito's birthday".
