The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically an "Air Intelligence Information Report" regarding an "Unidentified Flying Object Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBJECT)" in the Middletown, Pennsylvania area.

The text in the document is as follows:

UNITED STATES
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: (UNCLASSIFIED) Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBJECT)
AREA INVOLVED: Middletown Air Material Area
DATE: 3 Aug 52 PERIOD: 3 Aug 52
FROM: John L. Snider, GS, USAF
TO: Commanding Officer, IGL AFB, Ohio
SUMMARY: (For continuation see reverse side) This Office received the enclosed correspondence concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object.

Since the subject letter includes great detail, the correspondence should suffice in presenting the facts surrounding the observation and will not be elaborated upon in this report.

The only additional information that this Office can supply is that the distance of the observation may be described as 7-mile visibility with high scattered formations. These were reported to be in the image at the time; however, this is not conclusive proof that the object observed was part of the formations or that the formations were the object observed. It is possible that weather balloons had been released some time earlier, disclaiming the probability that they were in the observer's area at the time.

This Office can offer no definite explanation for the sighting.

L/Col, 3 Aug 52, Robert G. Swengle
