STATEMENT

I was called out of my house at approximately 5 seconds after 9:43 on 22 August 1953, by my husband, James V. Bollen, to see a strange light flying by the house. This light was a reddish-brown and did not resemble an aircraft or part of an aircraft in any way. There was no sound. I watched this strange object for about 25 seconds until it disappeared from view behind the house next door. It traveled from north to south, then turned east.
