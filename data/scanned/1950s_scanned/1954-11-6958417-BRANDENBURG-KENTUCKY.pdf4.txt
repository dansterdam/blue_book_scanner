The image contains three sketches or illustrations, but no photographs. 

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object drawn above it. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it.

The second and third sketches show larger views of what appears to be a road or landscape, with the horizon and sky visible. The instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" at the position where the object was when they first saw it, and a "B" at its position later.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
