22TH AID DIVISION. INCIDENT WAS REPORTED BY TELEPHONE SO I CAN NOT VOUCH FOR RELIABILITY OF OBSERVERS. SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY OF SEARCH LIGHTS OR ROTATING BEACONS, BUT OBSERVERS ELIMINATED THIS. CHECKED WITH CONTROL TOWER OPERATORS AT KANSAS CITY AIRPORT AND RICHARD GEBAUR AIR FORCE BASE. BOTH SAID THEY SAW NOTHING. NO OTHER REPORTS OF THIS WERE RECEIVED BY ME.
