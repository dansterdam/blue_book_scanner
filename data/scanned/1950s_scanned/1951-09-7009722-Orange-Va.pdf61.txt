(Investigation #8) shows a single line. The 35 MM negatives furnished by the observer were badly scratched and extreme care was taken in the enlarging process. According to the INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 1st Lt JOHN PAYTER, for inclusion in his report on an unidentified flying object observed near ORANGE, VA, on 7 September 1951.

1. According to the information on the photographs, the objects in the formation kept shifting positions and the number of objects varied from four to six. There was no noticeable sound and no exhaust or jet trail. The objects appeared to be an extremely rapid rate of speed in a southward direction.

2. The observer stated that the weather was clear with very little wind. The altitude was in excess of 30,000 feet, fully above the normal glider altitude. The temperature was 78 degrees, dew point 56 degrees, with wind from the southeast at 20 KTS.

3. The observer stated that on 7 September 1951, he saw two more formations appear at 1230 hours, with about a two minute interval between the formations, but did not get any photographs. The message was identical except that the objects seemed to be at much greater altitude and although the formations kept shifting, the same outline (silhouette) was maintained. Each group looked to be a single line formation.

17. The Subchapter, Texas weather observation at 2330 hours, 7 September 1951, was clear, visibility 15 miles, temperature 77 degrees, wind from the southeast at 22 KTS.
