The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text. 

Here is the text from the document:

Junior Third Officer F. A. Bennett of the American S. S. Santa Monica, Capt. H. A. MacDermid, Master, reports that on 9 November 1952, in lat. 11°55' N., lon. 78°09' W., he observed a large, brilliant green-hued meteor, falling in an arc from approximately 30° to 20° altitude, bearing 160° to 340° altitude, lasting 20 to 25 seconds. The object was almost covered by thick clouds.
