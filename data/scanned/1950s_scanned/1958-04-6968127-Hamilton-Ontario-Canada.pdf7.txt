Dear Mr. ------

Thank you for your letter of 21 April 1958 describing your obseravtion
of an unidentified flying object on 13 April 1958. All available
evidence indicates that Sputnik II re-entered the atmosphere and
disintegrated on 13 April, but you possibly may have seen a meteor.

We are forwarding your letter to the Air Technical Intelligence
Center, Peyton, Ohio as a matter of possible interest. Your interest
in reporting your observation is appreciated.

Very truly yours,
