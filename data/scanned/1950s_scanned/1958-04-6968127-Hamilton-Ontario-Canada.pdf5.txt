The image contains a page from a document with handwritten notes and sketches. There are no photographs present in the image. I will now provide an OCR transcription of the text in the image to the best of my ability, although some text may be unclear and difficult to interpret:

Some words are indistinct due to the poor quality of the handwriting and the image itself. It appears to be notes possibly related to an observation of an unidentified flying object, considering the context of Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force.
