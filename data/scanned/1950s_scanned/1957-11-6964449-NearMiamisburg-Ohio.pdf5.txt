The Rocket Seen. Astronomy Unit Says
A number of Miami Valley astronomers are reporting the nightly passage of a bright object moving in a northeast direction over the Miami Valley area. The object, which is only visible for a few seconds as it passes across the sky, has been observed by several observers in the area. According to the observers, the object is traveling at a high rate of speed and appears to be some 30 to 35 degrees off the horizon. It passes in a northwest to southeast direction at about 8:25 p.m. EST.
Kittrell also said, "It was visible for about 30 seconds, although some observers claim to have seen it for as long as 45 seconds. From all reports, the object appears to be a bright, brilliant star-like object, moving in a straight line and at a high rate of speed." From observations made in past evenings, the object appears to be about the same brightness as the first magnitude stars, Kittrell stated.
The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge, Mass., has been informed of the sightings, and it is possible that the institution will have more information on the object in the near future. This is the first chance for United States observers to watch the passage of the rocket, although similar sightings have been reported in Europe.
Kittrell said that the object will be visible for some time, and that observers should watch for it about 8:25 p.m. EST, in a northwest to southeast direction at about 30 to 35 degrees off the horizon.
