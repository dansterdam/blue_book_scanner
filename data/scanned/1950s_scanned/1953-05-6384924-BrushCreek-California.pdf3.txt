Gold Miners Teetotally Sure They Saw It--A Baby Saucer
Brush Creek, Calif., June 25 (U.P.)--Two gold miners, neither of them drinking men, complained today that a flying saucer with a couple of little men in it keeps showing up at their diggings near here.
"We were just sitting and resting and this thing came drifting down," said partner, John Van Allen,* said they beter not try to get anyr closer, "It was here a few minutes and then up and away again."
The gold mine is the Marble Creek section. It looked like some kind of machine, they said. When they looked for it to come back on later checks, it was gone--except on the second day, when one miner said he thought he saw it but couldn't be sure.
Miss VT Batcher, curator of the county museum, said the two gold miners had a good reputation and were noted for their sobriety.
