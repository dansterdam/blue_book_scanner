STATEMENT

At 1655 5 March 1953, I received a call from Captain Warrington, Commanding Officer, 727th Tactical Control Group, Shaw AFB, South Carolina. He said to put a ground radar back on the air and copy 577 so objects on same. At 1705 radar was back on the air and we had the target over restricted area.

From the call from Captain Warrington just came in, I immediately answered that orders for a control to immediate send any officers or radar personnel MCO's were available. As approximately 1715 S/Sgt John Harnage and S/Sgt Briggs had arrived to give assistance. At that time we pick up approximately 7 plots on the unknown objects. The initial plot was 215252. The object was moving towards Congaree. When the object passed within 11 miles of Congaree, the object made a sharp turn to the north of base. The object then faded at 360Â° 20 miles at 1723.

I took over the job of keeping the log and causing continuous investigation while S/Sgt Harnage and Briggs worked with A/C sent to investigate.
