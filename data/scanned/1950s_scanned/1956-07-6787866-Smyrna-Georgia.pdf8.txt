On the night of July 6, 1956, while playing outside, the source observed a bright, steady light in the sky which he described as being larger and brighter than any stars in the sky. The light appeared to be moving across the sky in a northerly direction. After observing the light for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, it suddenly disappeared. The source stated that he has observed similar lights on several previous occasions in the same general area, but never for such a long period of time as on this particular night.
