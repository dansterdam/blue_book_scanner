COBURN, VIRGINIA - 6287 
INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT

SUMMARY OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA SIGHTING

1. NAME OF OBSERVER: Mrs. Coburn
2. LOCATION: Coburn, Virginia
3. DATE/TIME OF OBSERVATION: February 6, 1959 at approximately 1900 hours
4. REPORTED PHENOMENA: The observer reported observing a bright, silvery object moving rapidly across the sky.

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:

The observer, Mrs. Coburn, reported witnessing a bright, silvery object move rapidly across the sky from the southwest to the northeast. The object was observed for approximately 5 seconds and appeared to be gliding or coasting rather than powered flight. No sound was associated with the object. The observer described the object as being larger than a normal aircraft and estimated it to be at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet. Weather conditions at the time were clear with unlimited visibility.

CONCLUSIONS:

Based on the details provided, the object observed cannot be definitively identified. The rapid, silent movement and unusual size and appearance of the object are factors that suggest the sighting may have involved an unidentified aerial phenomena. However, without additional evidence or information, a conclusive determination cannot be made. The case is listed as unresolved.
