25 MAY 1959

Dear Sir:

I appreciate your letter of 13 April 1959 concerning the Unidentified Flying Objects sighting west of Corsica, Clarion County.

Your letter contained insufficient data to allow a complete technical analysis. However, it indicates the Air Force technical investigation of this sighting has been forwarded to the technical intelligence center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

When an evaluation and/or analysis has been completed, you will hear from us.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
