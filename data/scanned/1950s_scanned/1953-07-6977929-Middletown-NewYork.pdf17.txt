The text in the form states:
"On July 3, 1953, while driving in Wallkill Turnpike, near Middletown Park, I observed an object in the sky which appeared to be a small, white, luminous, roughly circular object making a straight course from due east to due west. The object was stationary for a short time, then moved very rapidly, almost disappearing from sight. [redacted] There seemed to be no noise or smoke associated with the object. After watching it for a short time, it disappeared from sight and I have no further information."
