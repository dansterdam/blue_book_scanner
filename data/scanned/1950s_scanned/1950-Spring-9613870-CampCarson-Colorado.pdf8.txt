ARDMORE, TENNESSEE
AGENTS FOR RELECTING SOMEIDEAS LTD. (CATTLEY)

6 October, 1936

Major General E. B. LeBailly
Director of Information
USAF (Retired)
Randolph A. F. Base, Texas 78148

Dear Sir:

I have read your 15 May, 1956 Air Force policy letter for commanders.

Your statements on UFO sightings and Air Force conclusions are strongly contested by the undersigned. If the Air Force can so readily explain the sightings in 1950? I will certainly request some of the Air Force experts explain to me the so-called hallucinations I experienced, and until it has been fully explained I will continue to make it a matter of public record and in direct opposition to the Air Force stated conclusion and policy.

If the Air Force is using this for a cover for classified work please let me know and I will not accurdingty.

Nest sincerely,
Col. USAF (Ret)
