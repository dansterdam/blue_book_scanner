SUBJECT: Request for Analysis of Electronic UFO Report  
TO: AFOTN-HA ATTACH: Capt. G. T. Gregory FROM: AFOTN-HA1
DATE: 30 Oct 57 COMMENT: MR 2 SITE: Forbes AFB, Kansas REPORT NO: 5263-63/57

1. This report is difficult to evaluate because there is a much as a case of evidence which is all the side evidence to substantiate the presence of a physical object or UFO. With the exception of radar-abrupt disappearance of returns on the electronic type, radar indications, and similar indications. The unusual type beam speeds, abrupt changes of course, etc. These abnormal indications are usually characteristic of UFO phenomena. Considered and evaluated, the findings indicate an unidentified aerial vehicle.

2. The electronic data is unusual in this report in that radar signals (presumably returns from the object) possess all the characteristics of ground radar equipment, and in fact are similar to GPA-1A. This raises the question of as to whether the equipment reporting is actually ground equipment and not airborne.

3. Since the type equipment on the ground (at "Usual") is not known, and since there is no correlation between the ground interpret and the airborne equipment, it is difficult to conclude that nothing was present, in the face of the visual and other data presented.
