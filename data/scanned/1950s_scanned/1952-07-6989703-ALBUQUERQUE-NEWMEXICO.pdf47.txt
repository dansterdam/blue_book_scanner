was requested by 1/Sgt. to look at an object. He observed the object for approximately 1600 MST to look at an object. Its movements were like a falling leaf for several seconds and then it proceeded in an irregular manner, hesitating speed uneven.

observed the object at approximately 1645 on 20 July. After turning from a straight line, the object came back erratically and hovered about half a dozen, apparently caused by the object would not hold a steady course. The only thing visible to use was a pulsating gleaming whitish the air.

At approximately 1430, while section where I noticed a group of people looking in front of the hanger, I observed an object that was round and similar to a weather balloon climbing or flying at that altitude. I observed one at a 45 degree angle slightly west and it seemed to be crawling or creeping back and forth like a pendulum and it seemed that one side or lower object was uneven or irregular than the other side, and it would come back and disappear, and would come back and disappear again, and only one side was reflecting the light that I could make out. After the third disappearance the object appeared to the northeast, and moved across the horizon and seemed to be at a great (obscured at about 5-6 degree angle) a similar object appeared and moved across the horizon and passed close to the other two objects. After that third disappearance the object vanished to the northwest, the other two objects continued to work.
