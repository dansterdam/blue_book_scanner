DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY ATIC-ADC

AGREEMENT:

An agreement was concluded in December 1953 between the Air Technical Intelli-
gence Center and Air Defense Command whereby, in the future, the 4602d Air Intelli-
gence Service Squadron will process and make on-the-spot investigations on all
initial UFO reports originating in the ZI. The 4602d AISS is a definite intelligence
activity which is widespread in the field. In some cases, ATIC will join ADC in
field investigations.

UNKNOWNS:

At the conclusion of investigations by 4602d AISS, Air Defense Command will
furnish information to ATIC on all closed (identified) cases and will forward all
material and reports of investigations on the cases which remain as unknowns.

FINAL ANALYSIS:

The ATIC retains the responsibility for final analysis of these unknowns
originating in the ZI, together with all cases from overseas.

AIR FORCE REGULATION 200-2 (NEW):

This program will be formally initiated with the publication of a new AFR 200-2
which is forthcoming.
