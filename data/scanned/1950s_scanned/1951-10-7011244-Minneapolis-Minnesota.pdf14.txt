The observer, 1st Lt. CHARLES S. HOLT, Jr. USAF, reported sighting a strange object in the sky over the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. The object was first observed at approximately 1700 hours on 12 October 1951 and was last seen at approximately 1730 hours the same day.
DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
T. C-1. 12 October 1951 : Observed an unidentified object approximately 25,000 ft. in altitude over the Twin Cities area. This object appeared to be approximately 15 ft. in diameter, circular in shape, and aluminum or white in color. The object was observed to be moving at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately 1,000 mph. The object was observed to be circling or maneuvering, and was visible for a period of approximately 30 minutes.
2. SUMMARY: The observer feels certain that the object was not a known type of aircraft and has never seen anything like it before. The observer could not determine the speed or altitude exactly, but feels the speed was in excess of 500 mph and the altitude was approximately 25,000 ft. The observer was not able to determine the exact nature or purpose of the object, but felt that inasmuch as it was circling or maneuvering it was not a normal type of aircraft.
3. CONCLUSION: This incident is submitted as an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon. While the object cannot be definitely identified, the observer's report appears to be credible and worthy of further investigation.
