The document mentions "The attached negatives have been evaluated as per the instructions attached to confirm or deny the authenticity of these negatives as a record of unknown objects, and the results of this evaluation are attached." There is also a stamp on the bottom portion of the document that appears to be a "RETURN RECEIPT" stamp.
