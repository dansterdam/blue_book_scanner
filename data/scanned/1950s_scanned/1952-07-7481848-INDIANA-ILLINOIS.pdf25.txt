To Whom It May Concern:
Subject: Unknown object observed by First Officer R. Bullard

Ozark Airline's Flight 305 departed Chicago at 1930 CST. The flight was conducted at an altitude of 4,000 feet MSL and in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. The crew consisted of Captain George D. Keller, First Officer R. Bullard and Stewardess C. Lindsey.

We were in level flight over Buckley, Illinois at an altitude of 4,000 feet when I noticed a white light. At first I thought it was a reflection of our position lights. I noticed it was moving at a high rate of speed, about 5,000 degrees per second. It moved so fast that I had difficulty keeping it in sight.

The time I observed the light was about twenty seconds. It moved as far as I could tell, from west to east across the nose of the aircraft. The time of this observation was about 2004 CST.

Sincerely yours,
/s/ Richard Bullard
First Officer R. Bullard
