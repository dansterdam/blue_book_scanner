II. RELIABILITY: Source was an intelligence individual who was sincere and cooperative. Source was surprised when he was approached by the investigator concerning the sighting, for the subject, as he stated, had been dismissed from his thoughts. It is the opinion of the investigator that Source could be considered reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source sighted an object at about the 2 o'clock position after his aircraft had taken off from the Shreveport, La. Airport at 2115 CST, 3 June 57. He was looking south when object was first noticed and was at an altitude of 500 feet. Object was at approximately 1000 feet and one half mile distant when first observed. At first, only a white light resembling a star was seen. Source stated the landing lights on his aircraft were turned on and that the object responded by brightening its light. Object then moved on a course of 170 degrees to an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet at a considerable speed, after which it appeared to maintain the same relative position to Source's aircraft for the next hour. At this time a second "star" appeared to the right and slightly above the first object. Source said that after second object was sighted, he and the Aircraft Captain (See Part One) decided to call Shreveport tower to see if they had objects in sight. The tower answered affirmatively, stating they had spotted them with binoculars. Both objects appeared as white lights and at times were hard to distinguish from stars. Source stated that they flew a track of 170 degrees after objects were sighted, for a distance of 62 nautical miles, and then to a uf 150 degrees. Object seemed to turn with them and at this time the Airplane Captain called GOATEE (653rd AC&W Sq) to inquire if they had objects on their scope. ______eplied that they had two targets at 9,700 feet. Sight of objects was lost while landing at Lake Charles, La. when last seen they were moving to the southeast.
