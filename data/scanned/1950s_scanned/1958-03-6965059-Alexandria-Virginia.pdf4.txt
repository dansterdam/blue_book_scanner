Dear Mr. XXXXX,

Thank you for your letter of 23 March 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object.

A check of earth satellite orbital tracks indicate the object was not a satellite. Although the object has not been conclusively identified, a tentative analysis indicates that it probably was a meteor.

Your report will be used as a part of our continuous study and investigation of aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER 
Major, USAF
