There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

We have today received a letter, dated October 7, 1959, from the 7539th T.P.P. Carrier Squadron, Medium(Reserve), U.S.A.F., Greater Pittsburgh Airport. This letter states that they have evidence on objects that have been observed flying over their area. All information concerning such objects will be disseminated through this office. 

Until the message from the 7539th is received, we were not aware that the object was sighted by this organization. If the object in question is not a UFO, it is hoped that you will be kind enough to supply us with the information requested in paragraph 3(page 1) above.

If the object is a UFO, it is true that the Air Force now has tangible evidence.

Sincerely yours,
(Signature redacted)
Secretary, NICAP
