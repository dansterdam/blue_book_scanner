There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text in the document reads:

"Vertical-rising aircraft capable of transition to horizontal flight will be a new phenomenon on our skies, and under certain conditions could give the illusion of the so-called flying saucers. Some developments on Defense will make necessary to keep these developments so they can be recognized for what they are."

Mr. Charles added: "I think we must recognize that other countries also have the capability of developing vertical-rising aircraft, perhaps of unconventional shapes. However, we should not assume anything relative to the identification of these developments as being necessarily of foreign origin."
