DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.	SUBJECT	UFO
TO AFOIN-4X2x	FROM Western Office	DATE 6 Aug 56
1.	Reference is made to telephone call from Captain Kalmua, ATIC, on Tuesday, 31 July 1956, regarding a report of UFO by Mr. Van Nuys, California.
2.	At the request of Captain Kalmua, this office attempted on 1 August 1956, to make preliminary investigation regarding the reported object. Telephone inquiry to Mr. ___________ revealed essentially the following:
"On the night of 15 July, I went to bed about 10:30 P.M. and was awakened at or about 11:25 P.M. by a very bright light passing over my house, drifting very slowly.  It appeared to be completely noiseless until it landed in the top of a tree about 300 yards back of my house.  It wedged itself into the tree and split it open.  Two or three guys got out of the ball and talked to me on a tape recorder. They were there only a few minutes until one of my dogs began to bark into the wrist of his microphone and instantly disappeared.  As the ball drifted up it was glowing red hot. This occurred at about 3:20 A.M. on 16 July.  I was awakened again at or about 3:30 P.M. that same day and again I saw the whole thing repeat itself with the ball returning to the same tree and disappearing in the same manner."
3.	Immediately following the the telephone inquiry from this office, Mr. __________ called certain personnel in the CBS Television network in the Los Angeles area, reporting that the Air Force was to investigate the incident.
