and the Northern Astronomers, the Observers viewed it very high in the sky. This sighting indicates there was an unidentified flying object in the local vicinity. This would probably account for the apparent strange color and distortion of this object from local usual flight patterns. It is possible that this can be identified as some military or experimental aircraft, but description from local witnesses indicate the object was silent, hovering, and changing color. The same object was observed from 1753 to about 1755 hour on 13 March 1953 by the witness Miss Hamilton AFS, Calif.
