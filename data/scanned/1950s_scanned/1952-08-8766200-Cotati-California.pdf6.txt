24. COMMENTS:
                     Objects flying against wind at alt 300' ate
                     50-150 MPH around for 30!

                     Possibly "Skyhook" from Tillamook Ore.,
                     at extremely high altitude, which could
                     seem to be flying slowly if they were large
                     & viewed high against the wind. Also, if they
                     moved with the wind, they would only be
                     viewed for thirty minutes.
