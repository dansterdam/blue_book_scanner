INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY
After meeting with the aforementioned people plus SERGEANT FOYERS who is handling the case for the SOUTH BALTIMORE POLICE, it is my belief that much of the material did not contain evidence and that the unidentified solid contours pointing toward a strong magnetic field could have been the PERMAG solution used for cleaning railroad cars.
The investigator feels certain that a well-planned covert-to-covert campaign is needed to gather additional data on the extent, company, and formulas of the PERMAG in order to discover the formula by analyzing the contents of the VINYL, as would make a simple solution to determine the product.
As the situation stands in BALTIMORE, some companies have put their own BIO-CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS on insulation of the equipment. The reason for this is that none want unnecessarily publicity about their own company manufacturing or using a substitute resin some people may believe to be a hazardous substance. None of the civilian populace seemed alarmed about the incidents.
AT 02/2030Z MARCH 1955 a call was received by investigator from Mr. CHARLES GILLIS, 3517 GIST AVE BALTIMORE, who wrote with Mr. JENNER in BALTIMORE. Mr. GILLIS discovered that the cleaning compound used by the RAILROAD could possibly shine when it dried, and that it formed a three (3) square feet of scum.
Neither he, nor I, are saying that the object was a job of this froth-like material, but he suggests that the analysts look for either coated scum residue, or sulfate first as the analyzing may disclose the make-up of the material. This may be a clue or starting point in the analysis.
