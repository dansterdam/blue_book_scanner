This report comes from inland, so we have based our studies only on the data taken from the observation files and letters received from the people, as there has been no personal interview of the observers.

All the observers agree that it was a cylindrical object. Some say that it stood still for 5 minutes approximately. Even standing still it had the wake. Nobody say any wings.

A characteristic worth pointing out is the noise, described as low and rumbling. There are very few cases with this characteristic. 

The cylindrical object, the absence of wings, and the silence condition are facts that indicate, and the collision condition the GOVL to indicate it was an unidentified object. ("It was vertical to the horizon.")

According to the information that we have on that type of OVD, it is commonly known an identity sign, complete this report we think it is worthing to bring to a DG of Air Traffic, on June 24, 1948:

This plane carried as pilots DC-3 and DG-3 and came on Atlanta when an enormous UFD object, like 25-30 meters long, as a bluish shine, the rear was black, with 8 rows of small windows brilliantly alight, it came suddenly in front of the DC-3 at a terrifying speed. The crash seemed inevitable, but at the last second the "object" maneuvered and went by like a bolt of lightning, leaving the pilots with the violent emotions. The same night, about an hour before, over Robinson Airbase in Georgia and by another pilot who saw it before, came this on the route of the DC-3. Similar "objects" were seen in the following places: Holland on the 20th of July 1948 and in the Philippines between Hong Kong and Saipon in August the same year. The pilots of the DC-3, as well as all those who saw the "object", say that from the rear of the plane there came out a huge tongue of flame.
