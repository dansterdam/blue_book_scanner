Following is an extract from SDO Captain H Tom's report of 20 October 57 for your information and necessary action:
"WILLIAMSON, S/Sgt L Sherwood of AMC Command Post reported a call from Mrs. John Willigan, 5574 Bainbridge Rd, Dayton, Ohio at 19:15L 20 Oct. Mrs. Willigan reported a very curious object moving very slowly above the TV tower near Germantown in Dayton at about 19:00L. No USAF/USAAF activity was noted in the area. The object was described as circular, reddish orange in color and pulsating at times. It was estimated to be at 1500 to 2000 feet and about 1/4 to 1/2 mile from the observer's location, being apparently emitting some sort of beam from it's under surface. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes before it moved slowly northerly and disappeared from sight. The object was sighted about 1 1/2 miles north of said sighting place at 19:15L."
