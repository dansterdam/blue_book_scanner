The image contains a drawing that appears to depict a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The drawing shows two circular shapes, which seem to be the "shape of the object" that the observer is being asked to draw in the instructions on the page. There is no further photographic evidence included in this scanned document.

Transcription of the text in the document:

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include any details or the object that you saw, and place them beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this? (Circle one) YES

26.1 If you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
It would seem to be a large and too beautiful,I would say,to be the product of any earth we know of.While at the same time it was a source of light which lent an unnatural brightness and sharpness to the scene.I think it may have been a looking at some point in the sky.
