GEORGIA - ARTCARD #47
WHEDON: (Cont'd)
Here's West Macon, Georgia...
and here's Pt. Benning. We immediately established that training operations were being conducted at Benning on the nights of May 7th and 8th.

Part of the operation was the dropping of parachute flares from aircraft... as well as jet-support for ground operations.
We obtained the photographs mentioned in the report. Enlargements of the black-and-white pictures gave us no clues. But we also had received some color slides. Using a new photo-analysis technique, we managed to get some surprising results.
