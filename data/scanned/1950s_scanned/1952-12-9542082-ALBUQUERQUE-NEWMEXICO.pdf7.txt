The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved trajectory line with an object at the end, depicting how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with mountains or hills in the distance and a road or path in the foreground. The third sketch is a smaller landscape view, showing a mountainous horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
