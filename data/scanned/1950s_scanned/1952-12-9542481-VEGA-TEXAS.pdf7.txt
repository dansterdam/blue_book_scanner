Statements by Captain WILLIAM T. LEWIS

On the night of 29 December 1952, Captain WILLIAM T. LEWIS was on duty as the Officer-in-Charge of the 3505th Interceptor Squadron, Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona. At 2130 hours, the radar operator reported a high speed target 80 miles southwest of Tucson, at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. Captain LEWIS observed the unidentified target on the radarscope for about 20 minutes. He reported that it appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, making a sharp turn, and then disappearing from the scope. He stated that it was unlike any known type of aircraft. Captain LEWIS further reported that during the time the target was visible, it made an abrupt change in course which would be impossible for any known type of aircraft at that time. Captain LEWIS stated that the target appeared to be under intelligent control.
