There is no photograph present in this scanned document. However, the image shows an "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" form from Project Blue Book.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PART ONE

Date: 9 feb 60 
Case: 53 - 1003 - 43

I. SOURCE:
Age: 31
Occupation: Television Technician 
Education: Two years college
Qualifications: Antiaircraft Gunner, ETO 1943-45

II. THE ACCOUNT: The source stated that on 15 May 1953 at approximately 1500 Eastern Daylight Saving Time, he observed a round white object in the sky while working on a television antenna on the southwest corner of 30th Street and 7th Avenue in downtown Manhattan. The object appeared to be stationary and hovering at an estimated altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet. It was silhouetted against the sky. The source stated that after watching it for about 4 to 5 minutes, he secured his camera and took three pictures of the object, two of which he alleges were successful. He said the object then suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly to the north at great speed, disappearing from view in approximately 1 to 1 1/2 seconds. The source stated that he was convinced the object was not a conventional aircraft and that it displayed characteristics which he felt were not normal or known to him. He stated that as a former antiaircraft gunner, he was familiar with the appearance of various types of aircraft, and that this object was unlike any he had ever seen before.

III. DISPOSITION: The object viewed by the source could not be identified. The photos which he alleges were taken are not available for examination. The source is considered to be of questionable reliability.
