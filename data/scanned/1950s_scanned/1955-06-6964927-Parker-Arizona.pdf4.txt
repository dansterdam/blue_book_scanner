INCIDENT NO. 6964927
DATE: 6 JUNE 1955
LOCATION: PARKER, ARIZONA
INVESTIGATING OFFICER: CAPT. SISK

AT APPROXIMATELY 2000 HOURS ON 6 JUNE 1955, MR. JOHN DOE, A RESIDENT OF PARKER, ARIZONA, REPORTED SIGHTING A LUMINOUS OBJECT IN THE SKY APPROXIMATELY 25 MILES SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF PARKER, ARIZONA. MR. DOE STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND APPROXIMATELY 30-50 FEET IN DIAMETER. HE FURTHER STATED THAT THE OBJECT EMITTED A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT FROM ITS SURFACE AND HOVERED OVER THE DESERT AREA FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES BEFORE ACCELERATING RAPIDLY UPWARD AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW. 

MR. DOE REPORTED THAT HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WIFE, MRS. JANE DOE, WHO ALSO OBSERVED THE OBJECT. WHEN QUESTIONED, MRS. DOE CORROBORATED HER HUSBAND'S ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT.

A CURSORY EXAMINATION OF THE AREA WHERE THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE HOVERED REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL DISTURBANCE OR LANDING MARKS. NO OTHER WITNESSES TO THIS INCIDENT WERE LOCATED.

THIS CASE IS CLASSIFIED AS UNRESOLVED DUE TO LACK OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OR CORROBORATING WITNESSES.
