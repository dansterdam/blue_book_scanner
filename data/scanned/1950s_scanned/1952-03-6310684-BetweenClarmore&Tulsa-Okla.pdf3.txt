AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight Air Development Center

On a flight from Muroc, California to Wright-Patterson AF Base on 7 March 1952, at 8:00 P.M, a very bright light was observed between Tulsa and Claremore, Oklahoma. The light was first sighted at 120 mph. As it came closer, it appeared to be a very bright light at the same altitude, traveling parallel to the flight. As the object passed through the 12 o'clock position, it went out for one second and came on again. There were no navigation lights observed. When it passed abeam the aircraft, it finally went completely out. The weather was clear and there was no interference from the aircraft. The observer, an officer of many years' experience, stated that the object might have been another aircraft."
