The image contains a series of sketches and illustrations, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an "A" marked on the line. This is accompanied by instructions to imagine the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it, and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon.

The second set of sketches on the right side of the image includes a larger sketch labeled "A" showing the position of the object when you first saw it, and a smaller sketch labeled "B" as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
