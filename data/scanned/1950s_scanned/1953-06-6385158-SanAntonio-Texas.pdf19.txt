THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
Howard L. Bevis, President
COLUMBUS 10

8 July 1953

Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson,

Now that Jennie has her preliminary clearance, she can help me handle the reports and can type the letters to you and to your successor. This will improve the quality of the typing I am sure. I cannot guarantee spelling. (Neither can I.)

With respect to the two cases you sent us on June 23, there is only one thing to say: "The 21 June report-call was erren must be tossed out because of some difficulty determining data." On Austin there is a glimmer of anything interesting there which would just start pending further astronomical investigation. There seems to be some confusion left by our wire from A.T.I.C. with respect to the San Antonio case.

The San Antonio 16 June is clearly a meteorological phenomenon and one that would warm the heart of a skeptic. This was undoubtedly an augmented aerial optical phenomenon of the setting sun on a high cloud.

Referring to the follow-up statement on the 10 June Detroit case, both Jennie and I still think this was a landing light and area it could not have been a meteor.

I press ahead with reporting little, if any, progress. Jen is going ahead with requesting the air control tower operations increased in hoping to increased the quantity of reports here. Hope Jennie's clearance will not be too long in coming.

School. I hope we can see you soon and wish you a bon voyage into Law.

Sincerely,

Allen Hynek
