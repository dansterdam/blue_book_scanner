As to which C.B. Chapman comment:
1. Definite and clear cut and sound.
2. This object that has been seen at this area seems to be in motion and movement, possibly low altitude, 500 to 1500 feet and various forms or shapes, possibly due to motion.
3. In view of definite sighting report (28 February) will determine exact size and distance away-approximately 1-3 miles.
