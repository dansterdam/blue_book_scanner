The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a newspaper clipping with text describing the appearance of the Northern Lights or aurora borealis the previous night.

Northern Lights Give
Bright, Colorful Show

Shimmering and fiery curtains of red, green and white blasted across the sky in a dazzling phenomenon known as the northern lights 
or aurora borealis Monday night.

The lights were observed thoroughly and most of the nation observed the phenomenon, which is rather unusual so far south at this latitude.

The lights were observed in points as scattered as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, etc.

No one person living in the Wright View area called the Daily Herald after seeing the red sky to know if fishbites had a big fire.

The unusually intense display had marked effect on radio transmission and later on radio hams in the Minneapoli area reported they were unable to operate 'amateur radio until the display had passed.
