I had just opened the back door to go when my husband was going out through the front door, to get his car. I saw a bright light in the western sky, just about seven degrees up from the horizon. I went outside and watched it for about seven minutes after seeing it.

It was orange in color, all of a one's sudden it was to (apparently combining with) and disappeared. it took place in about 10 or 11 seconds.
