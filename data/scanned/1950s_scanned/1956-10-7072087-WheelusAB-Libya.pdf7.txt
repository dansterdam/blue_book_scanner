There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The fact that the visibility was 10 miles and the pilot saw nothing (visually) when he had closed on the lighted area so rapidly, it seems most significant. This disparity between visual sightings and radar presentations is a frequent characteristic - not necessarily temperature inversion as such - may have caused the returns. Birds would be unlikely to maintain a given course, ( or remain in the vicinity of an object) for so long a period of time.
