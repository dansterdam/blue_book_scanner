17 September 1959

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letters of 29 July and 2 September 1959.

There are no still or motion pictures available for loans. Should you contact the curator of the [redacted], Technical Intelligence Center for evaluation as it is always possible that photographic evidence may have been overlooked.

The object you refer to which was found in Minnesota was thoroughly evaluated. This was not a substantive identification, but a careful evaluation in this case.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
M. Sgt. J. L. TUCKER
