OUTPUT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Intelligence Division, HQ USAF, Washington, D.C.  IR-291-50
The Commanding Officer, Maxwell Flight Service Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama, has forwarded the following report of an unidentified object sighted in Missouri on 19 September 1950:

At approximately 1615 hours, 19 September 1950, Malden Radio was advised by telephone that an unidentified object had been sighted over Poplar Bluff, Missouri. A approximate location 1600C: OBLONG BALLOON to the north, high, and moving slowly in an easterly direction. Memphis was dispatched to the scene at 1645. Malden Radio directed the F-51 to the approximate location of the object, but was unable to locate the object by radar or visual contact. The object was observed by the tower over Malden from approximately 1645 to 1800C. This F-51 claimed to the vicinity of the first aircraft over Malden, and observed No Madrid, Missouri, at that time. The pilot of the 
F-51 was unable to climb to the altitude of the unidentified object, and was unable even to estimate how far the object was above him. The pilot claims he could not approach the object, as his rate of climb was inadequate. In shape it appeared to be between spherical and elliptical. At 1800C the object was lost from sight. Resuming in the area of the sighting, the pilot of the second aircraft reports that at approximately 1810C he observed a set of lights that appeared to be a very high speed jet or prop aircraft, with a red and white light in the rear, in the same general direction the object was sighted. This light was observed for some time and then disappeared.
