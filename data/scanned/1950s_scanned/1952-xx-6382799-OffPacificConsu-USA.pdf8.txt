The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a visual representation of the motion and path of an unidentified object, as described in the instructions above the sketch. The sketch includes labels for the horizon, zenith, and a diagram of the object's path.

In the text below the sketch, the observer describes the object as "Perfectly round - appeared to be flat" and notes that it "seemed to move without a trail or vapor nor away from me."
