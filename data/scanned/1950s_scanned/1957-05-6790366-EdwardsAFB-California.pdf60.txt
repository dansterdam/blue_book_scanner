d. Edwards AFB B Case (2 May 1957)

This case received nation-wide publicity because the UFO was over successfully near the Edwards Aib Base and had seen photographed officially by high-speed cameras, especially designed to track missiles by AP personnel.

The object was observed by the camera crew, who, took a series of photographs after it had moved some distance away. The sighting was directly related to the official Air Force investigation. Prior to the official Air Force investigation, the object could be described as the size of a match head, but changing shape from round to elongated as the object played upon the surface. A wind blew, correlated with the reported speed and movement of the object, practically coincided. This pointed to the object being in the air balloon.i Further investigation, not only disclosed that a balloon was released in the vicinity, but precise sightings measurements coincided with the observers' reports as to times, elevations and bearings.

This case is considered to have been improperly handled. It did not come to the attention of ATIC until after the press had received it; the Edwards AFB official made statements to the press that it was "unknown" which investigations disclose that they had been informed that it was a balloon: some local confusion to statements to the press indicating it was a balloon, and interviews investigator also indicated it was an unknown object but they had no evidence to support this conclusion; the various units of the investigation had not been properly and fully coordinated.
