There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This seems to be a page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, that describes an incident involving a "fire ball" or unidentified object falling to the ground.

T/3 st. Manley on 3 March 1953 proceeded to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] for purpose of interviewing them about the object they sighted falling to earth on the 22 Feb 1953. They stated that on that date they were watching television when suddenly a large fire ball came into view. They stated that this was between 2000 and 2100 hours, she immediately called it to the attention of Mr. [redacted] who was seated beside her. Mr. [redacted] went to the window and stated that the fire ball was falling at a terrific speed and was very large. The fire ball was falling at about 20 degree angle from the NNW.
