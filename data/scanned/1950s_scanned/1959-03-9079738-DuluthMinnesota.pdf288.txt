UFO SIGHTING, DULUTH, MINNESOTA
13 MARCH 1959

On 13 March 1959, at 0930, and on 14 March 1959, at 0930, an unidentified flying object was sighted from the Duluth, Minnesota airport. The object was reported to have been observed both visually and on radar by military personnel. The object was described as circular in shape and seemed to hover at times, then move at a very high rate of speed.
The object was reported as tubular or round. Only one "object" was reported. It was observed that the object seemed to have lights on it and that it appeared to be of a magnetic force nature.
Two of the airborne witnesses were pilots of F-102 interceptors. These pilots were attempting to intercept the object but were unable to close on the object.
The radar targets were reported to have been both sharp and fuzzy contacts. During the sightings the object frequently appeared and disappeared as tracked by the radar observers. The object was reported to have flown in many different directions at high speeds too fast for aircraft.
The object was observed that the object seemed to be several hundred yards in diameter. The radar observer reported that the object changed size and shape during the sighting.
Radar film from the ground stations was forwarded to ATIC and analyzed as a different location.
The sighting period, for both the radar and visual sighting, was reported to have lasted 30 minute periods.
The weather during the period was reported as clear, visibility 15+, and wind from 10-15 knots.
The visual sightings corresponded to the location indicated by the radar sightings of the object.
The position of the planet Venus, as to the identification of the planet Venus, reported for the UFO. The lighting conditions at the time of the sighting coincided with the lighting conditions of the planet Venus, contributing factor.
