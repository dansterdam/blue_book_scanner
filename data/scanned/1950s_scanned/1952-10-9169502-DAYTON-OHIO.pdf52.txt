The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram showing the position of an object in the sky from two different perspectives - "A" when the object was first seen, and "B" when it was last seen. The sketch depicts the horizon and the object's position relative to the viewer.

The text instructs the viewer to draw a picture to show the motion of the object, indicating its path and position at the beginning and end of its movement. The viewer is also asked to draw a picture that shows the shape of the object and include any details or features that were observed.
