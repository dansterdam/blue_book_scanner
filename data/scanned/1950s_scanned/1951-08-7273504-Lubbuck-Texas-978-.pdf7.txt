DATE OF REPORT: 7 August 1951
DATE OF INCIDENT: 25 August 1951 
TIME OF INCIDENT: 2000-2100
LOCATION: Lubbock, Texas 
WITNESSES: 3
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

SUMMARY: On 25 August 1951, at approximately 2000 hours, three individuals, two civilian and one Air Force officer, observed a formation of unidentified flying objects. The objects were observed for approximately one hour, until they disappeared from sight. All three witnesses were interviewed and gave similar accounts of the incident.

DETAILS: The three witnesses reported seeing a formation of bright lights, ranging from 12 to 30 individual lights, moving in a southwesterly direction at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The objects were described as white or yellow-white in color, round in shape, and estimated to be 1 to 2 feet in diameter. The formation was first observed moving rapidly, then slowed to a steady pace as it moved across the sky. No sound was heard, and no discernible shape or structure was visible, only the lights themselves. The objects disappeared from view when they moved behind a cloud bank.

CONCLUSION: The three witnesses provided consistent accounts of the incident. The objects were not identified and remain classified as unidentified flying objects. No further information is available.
