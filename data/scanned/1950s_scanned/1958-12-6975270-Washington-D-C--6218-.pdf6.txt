Description of Aerial Phenomenon Observed in Washington, D.C. on 6 December 1958.

On 6 December 1958, at approximately 8:15 AM, an unidentified aerial phenomenon was observed in the skies over Washington, D.C. The witness, a resident of the District of Columbia, reported seeing a dark, rectangular-shaped object floating silently at a high altitude. The object appeared to be approximately 10 feet in length and 4 feet in width. It was described as being black in color and did not exhibit any visible means of propulsion. The object remained in view for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing from sight.

The witness immediately contacted the United States Air Force, who investigated the incident as part of Project Blue Book, the official U.S. government program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects. Photographic evidence was obtained, but the identity and origin of the object remain unknown.

This report is submitted for inclusion in the records of Project Blue Book. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the nature and source of the observed aerial phenomenon.
