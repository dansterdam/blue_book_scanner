UNCLASSIFIED 22 April 1952

I, W. G., Herman H. Rarphirty, Warrant Officer, US Air Force, request authority to make the following statement:

While standing in front of the base of the 75th aircraft Control and Earing Squadron, I sighted an object which appeared to be circular in shape and made a noise similar to that of a jet aircraft. The object was traveling on a level course at a very high rate of speed and it appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length. The object turned off to the left and was lost to sight in less than 10 seconds. Due to the suddenness of its appearance and disappearance, and the fact that it was seen in daylight, I am unable to make any further comment or description.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 22nd day of April 1952.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
