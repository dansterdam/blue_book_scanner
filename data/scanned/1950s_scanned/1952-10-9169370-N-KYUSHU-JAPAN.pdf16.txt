AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Intelligence Officer

314th Tac Carr Sq (m)    Y 101   

Upon re-interrogation, all crew members reported no change in the basic story as outlined above, and specifically as reported by this Headquarters, since three of the five crew members have been more than once re-interrogated. The location of the reported sighting is given as "Ryushu" on 14 July 1952, at 2145L by a combined navigator - radar operator - bombardier, during World War II.

Other crew members interviewed 14 July 1952, 2345 - 0115 (Hr: Min), were Capt Horton, Lt James A. Duntin, and Pfc J. A. Meyers, Lt L. N. Willis, and S/Sgt Gleason. All confirmed the report of their fellow crew member.

There were no reported meteorological phenomena which might account for this reported sighting.

The sighting was confirmed by the fighter pilot sent up by JADP to interrogate the object. This confirmation was orally transmitted by Airmen Walker, who was monitoring the fighter frequency on VHF.
