The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of UFO reports. There is no photograph present in this document, which appears to be a Disposition Form requesting the analysis of UFO photographs.

The text in the document is as follows:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.  SUBJECT
Request for Analysis - UFO Photographs
TO      FROM  DATE  COMMENT NO. 1

1. Request that the attached two (2) frames of color transparencies be reviewed for the purpose of specifically determining either the nature or the cause of the spots purpose or design existing therein. It is recommended that your report be as detailed and technical as possible, so that there be no misunderstanding of our findings when officially submitted to the Cambridge Research Center. The reason for this is that there are certain puzzling aspects regarding this matter.

It appears odd that a professional photographer would ask the Air Force to identify what appears to be the spoils or coloring, developing or the reason why the spots purpose or design exists. M. I. T. has some of the finest equipment in the country for photo analysis, which apparently was available to source.

The fact that the source feared ridicule is questioned, as is the reason why the photo was withdrawn from the photo project, according to the Air Force, [Ref UTAH "ERA-GULL" Case).

In keeping with USAF policy that all originals be returned to owners, request the copies of the photos for UFO (2) be given to us.
