In Conclusion
We of the Unidentified Flying Object Research Council are not fantasy-minded people nor are we casually fooled. We recognize that a great deal of effort and a great deal of truth-which-may-be-error is being expended in the analysis of these case files as thoroughly as it is possible for civilianized research. Some of the conclusions may be subject to considerable data fill substractions and limitations.
Our primary concern is the security and defense of American. It is our conclusion that these unidentified flying objects COULD be a possible threat. We are however certain that they are no immediate danger to us. We are also sure that we have no defense against them as they are superior to anything this country has produced.
The UFORG believes that some type of defensive action against the phenomenon might be necessary. At least the public should be informed of this potential danger. We do not say that aircraft alien to this planet are moving close to our property nor do we say that the sightings actually pose a threat for any unprepared people.
The air force report on UFO's, released by Secretary Connally in study is so sensitive that copies of it have not been made available for our research. But members of our organization have knowledge of this study. We believe that the objects such as those which the United States' radar have seen many times are not "hallucinations" as some of our scientists would have us believe, but members of other worlds - other civilizations. There is no evidence that unidentified flying objects DO EXIST.
All of the persons mentioned in this report are ready and willing to be questioned at any time. As for the UFORG, we are sure of our conclusions and will be glad to do so.
