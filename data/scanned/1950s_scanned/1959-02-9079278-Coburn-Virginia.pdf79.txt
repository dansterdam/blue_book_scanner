The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. I will now proceed to produce the text found in the document:

So after that, we could see this object, this light, leave the top of the mountain. And then it come back and landed again. Yes, my, it come back and hovered over the same spot and then landed again.

I happened to be doing some reading, and I told my wife about it. There wasn't much conversation after that. All the lights were out, and the children were asleep. I could see the object very plainly from the window, and it seemed to be a large object or not. The only thing we could see was the light, and we couldn't tell exactly what it was.

I believe that the Astronomical Society did receive a letter indicating that a number of different persons had reported seeing this object. And her report stated it was a large object or not, but that they couldn't tell exactly what it was from the observation. The air, we did, one reason we do not feel that the color streams are the same in the objects as we have seen in the past. If they were reflections of lights or something of this nature, they would show many color streams. But this did not occur. So we did not feel that the color streams are the some mechanism as we have seen in the past, which would be a possible reflection of some lights.
