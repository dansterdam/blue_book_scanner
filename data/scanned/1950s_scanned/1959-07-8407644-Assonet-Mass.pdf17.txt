ASTRONOMY

Heavenly Display Very Good

Venus is at its greatest brilliancy June 26. With Jupiter and Saturn, plus a full moon, mid-July nights will yield unusually interesting viewing.

BY JAMES STOKEY

WITH THE WARM weather of summer, many persons are finally able to get out of doors and take a look at the heavens. This is an excellent opportunity to see the stars that shine over-head. They are the object of much astronomical interest, and the accompanying map shows their positions on the night of July 15 at standard time (or eleven by daylight saving time) at the first of the month.

The brightest of these planets is Venus, which appears in the west shortly after sunset. It has become very bright, and by mid-July it will be rivaling the evening star at the beginning of the year. 

It has been getting brighter and will do so until sometime in August, when it begins to decline. At its present magnitude, about 4.3-miles in diameter, it is a very conspicuous object in the evening sky.

Next in the order of brightness are Jupiter and Saturn. Both of these great planets now shine in the evening sky, and that is why it is so low on the stage. By July 15 Jupiter will be setting about 11:40 p.m. while Saturn will rise about 8:15 p.m. These planets do not appear on our map. In fact, on July 7 Saturn comes into opposition in Taurus, while Jupiter is now slowly retrograding, or moving westward in the sky. This is unusual, as most planets appear to move from west to east against the background of stars.

The third planet is Saturn, of magnitude 0.6, equal to a bright star of the first magnitude. This is sometimes mistaken for a star, since some of the stars of this group form a more or less clearly defined line which gives the impression of a constellation. Some of the stars of this group from the outline of a square, with the handle to the left.

Two Other Planets Visible

There are two other planets that can sometimes be seen with the naked eye, and these are Mars and Mercury. Mars is also in Leo. It is high in the sky and can be seen by observers from mid-evening to dawn. At this time it is a full magnitude fainter than Venus and further north, but still a rather conspicuous object. It is low on the horizon, however, and appears like a second magnitude star. In addition, its position changes rapidly so that on July 15 it will be higher and a little to the right of its position here shown. Mercury, third planet in order of brightness, makes one of its infrequent appearances in the evening sky. On July 15 it will be about four and a half degrees above the horizon, just before the sun sets. Like Venus, it will be at its greatest brilliancy on June 26, so it is worth while looking for it during that part of the month.
