4 December 1957

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 11 November 1957, addressed to the United States Air Force, concerning material found in Glendora, New Jersey in 1957.

The information contained in your letter is much too old to estimate the conclusions and/or evaluations on the material considered and will through this fact not be considered at this time for analysis. I wish we had, in our files, facts to help you in this instance.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

Lt. Marlon J. Cameron
Major, USAF
