Mirror Landing System
Designed to Save Lives
See Front Cover
THIS PHOTOGRAPH, all U.S. Navy pilots are provided the 'mirror ball' as it is the right photograph to the pilot maneuvering system for landing on aircraft carriers.
This mirror system is designed to avoid errors by the pilots in depth perception and incorporating develop methods under which the pilots when used to indicate whether they are too high or too low, thus allowing pilots to adjust their approach until their planes align with the safety wire.
The mirror is a special system, approximately 30 inches in diameter, is hung ahead of the safety wire near the stern of the ship. The pilot's eye is about eight feet from the mirror as he approaches the landing deck, but adjustments are made to compensate for different ships and aircraft operating characteristics.
By keeping the aircraft properly aligned with the mirror, the pilot will fly on the correct approach glide angle and make an accurate landing on the deck. The mirror provides the pilot a clear visual reference of the proper glide angle to the landing surface.
When a plane approaches the ship, the pilot levels off at the proper altitude and maintains this through the point of touchdown, with the mirror as his guide. If he sees the deck approaching rapidly, the pilot knows he is too high and applies power to correct his angle of approach. If the deck seems to move away from him, he has drifted low and should apply power and adjust his attitude to move back to the proper glide path.
This mirror landing system has proven of great value in saving lives.
