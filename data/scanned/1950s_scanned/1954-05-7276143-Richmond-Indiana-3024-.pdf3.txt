SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
1. On 7 May 1954, at 0905 hours, this office received a telephone call from Mr.
William L. Ziegler, Field Investigator, National Investigations Committee on Aerial
Phenomena (NICAP), Richmond, Indiana. Mr, Ziegler reported that on 6 May 1954,
at approximately 1900 hours, two high school students, James C. and Joseph B.,
observed an unidentified flying object over the vicinity of Richmond, Indiana.
2. According to Mr. Ziegler's account, the two students were observing aircraft in
the sky when they noticed a fast-moving object which first appeared as a bright
light and then changed to a round silvery object. The object was observed for
approximately 15 minutes and was estimated to be approximately 500 feet in
diameter. The object was observed to accelerate and then make a sharp turn before
disappearing from view.
3. Mr. Ziegler was advised that this matter would be investigated further and that
he would be contacted again. A copy of this report is being forwarded to the
Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, Washington, D.C.
