COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
The Air Intelligence Information Report, dated 29 September 1952, which was not contacted regarding the sighting and investigation of the object observed over Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 6 October 1952. This delay between time of sighting and time of report may account for the excessive time elapse and incompleteness of the present report. The "Toad Blasts" heard by the observers were caused by a broken sound barrier of a jet aircraft.
