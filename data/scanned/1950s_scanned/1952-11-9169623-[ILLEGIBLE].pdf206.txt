This image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The text describes the movement and appearance of the object, including its apparent disappearance and reappearance, as well as the observations made by the witnesses. The document mentions a Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] and refers to the objects being verified by another individual.

Text extracted from the document:

the loaf of bread. The object then moved up and to the left, disappearing from view. The object was over the tower it disappeared; then a trail of smoke appeared, going up and to the right, seeming to indicate the object was disappearing from view. This smoke trail appeared from time to time, and then disappeared entirely. It seemed to the observers that the disappearance had occurred because the object had returned to a distance where it could not be followed. The object reappeared rather slowly when it could be followed. The smoke trails were observed by Dr. [ILLEGIBLE] and thus was substantiated (although not as positively) by Mrs. [ILLEGIBLE].

Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] states (and it was verified by Mr. [ILLEGIBLE]) that he watched the objects from 10:32 to approximately 10:45.
