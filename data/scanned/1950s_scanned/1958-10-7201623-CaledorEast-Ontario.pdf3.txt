The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a handwritten document, possibly an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

Mr. X reported sighting this aircraft at 11:25, 7 October 1958, Caledonia east of Ontario. The aircraft was flying at an estimated 5,000 feet altitude and was first sighted due east and moving in a northerly direction. The object was described as a shiny, disc-shaped object, approximately 30 feet in diameter, with a dark red or purple glow around the outer edge. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes before disappearing from view. Remark: It was noted, the observer is a minister from Caledonia, east of Ontario, and he stated that he had never seen anything like this before.
