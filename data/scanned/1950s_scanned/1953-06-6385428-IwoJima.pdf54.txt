The general opinion of the people who have seen this thing is "a burning aircraft". It emits a thick black cloud of smoke while in operation.
One A.A.O. actually dispatched a/c to search the area for a downed plane in one instance.
Usually the public is notified of tests.

At the present, a new model is being constructed, presumably an improvement.
