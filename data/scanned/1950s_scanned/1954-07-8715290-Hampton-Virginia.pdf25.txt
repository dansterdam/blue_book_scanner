MOUNTAIN VIEW - MISSOURI

Dear Cap't-
Fan a while found here -
can a saucer formation - see any activity thru the haze probably haze we are all interested in sighting see anything yet no. Have a regular station here on fly nights - first time today is haze a little active but yet not enough to really do much - on June 30 about 4 pm Tenn could not make out at all - as seen on day light and the strange side and star shapes - moving at times slowing rapidly - more different types at times. At nine we could not see them but got bright flashes on west side of the sky - must be something there if we could only locate them. Might different than ours altogether. Not worth much reporting alone, let me know if you have any other reports that may give me a clue I am sending this along.
