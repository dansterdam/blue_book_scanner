I ______ being
of sounds mind & hereby state
that I saw following occurrence
happen on the twentyfifth (25th) day
of July 1952 at or around 0130 central
standard time. Standing on top
of operations roof I saw flashes
of light at different intervals that
appeared as if they were in one
same cycle, these flashes of light
that were seen by me appear to
be between 15 & 20 degrees above
the horizon and seem to leave
a trail for a second.
