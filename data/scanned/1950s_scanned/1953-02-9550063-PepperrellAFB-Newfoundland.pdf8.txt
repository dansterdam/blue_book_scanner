The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated UFO reports.

I. Description of Incident:
An Air Force major and enlisted personnel from this base observed a green object which a trail of sparks traveling downward at a high rate of speed and disappearing behind the horizon. The object was similar to that of the moon. Time of sighting was 1910 local time and the existing weather conditions were generally good.

II. Discussion of Incident:
Project Blue Book's contract astronomer is of the opinion that the object seen was probably an overestimated meteor. Two factors substantiate the meteor conclusion in this case: 1) the fact that it followed a downward course and 2) that it gave off sparks, two characteristics of a meteor. No length of observation was given that would rule this explanation.

III. Conclusion:
Probably a meteor.
