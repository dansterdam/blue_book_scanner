Attached herewith are subject photos and a report regarding the incident.

Request your comment concerning the preliminary analysis made by this office, the following:

a. Source's statement that the camera was not moved does not appear to correspond to the time-exposure of the moon, which could have been shown as one continuous line. Two directions of the moon are indicated on the photograph.

b. Both enlargements show a slender-like item, above and extending outwards from the object.

c. The object resembles the glass fixtures usually found hanging from ceiling.

d. In our opinion, the shutter was tripped sometime before removal of the camera lens, a dark-colored calling with a vented-glass fixture, would result in the picture being exposed, being a type not exposed, a slender first supports and the ceiling blending into the night sky or original exposure.
