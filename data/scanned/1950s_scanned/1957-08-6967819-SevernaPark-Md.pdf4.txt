The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

The first one seemed to come down to what I guess may have seen about 10,000 feet. It seemed to be about 15 or 20 feet in diameter, a brilliant white light and reddish-orange on the outer edges. It came down a little ways and stopped and hovered there for a few seconds and then zoomed straight up again at a terrific speed. They both came down again, the second one is a little smaller, but a brilliant white light. They both came down again, the second one is a little smaller, but a brilliant white light. They both seemed to be about 2 or 3 degrees of arc and then went straight up. I am not sure whether they are third line or not. I am suspect to say that I have not had this verified by the ARDC and I reported the incident to Lt. Andrews requested that this report be accompanied by some personal information so that the authenticity of the report can be evaluated.

I am 35 years old, a registered professional engineer in private practice. During World War II, I was a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy and served for four years, graduating from Leigh in mechanical engineering. Since the war, I have been employed in aerospace dynamics, flight test engineering, and as an instructor for the CAA.
