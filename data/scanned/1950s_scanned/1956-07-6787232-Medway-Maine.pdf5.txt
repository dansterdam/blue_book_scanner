1. SOURCE:
       Address: Stockholm, Maine (HKJC 5102)
       Age: 46
       Occupation: Housewife

       Education: High School

       Qualifications: Mrs. ______ information seems to be very accurate with the exception of measurements. Her perception of distances appears to be defective.

II. RELIABILITY: Mrs. ______ is judged reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: While walking along the highway, one
half mile north of Stockholm, Maine, in the company of a friend, Mrs. _____
happened to look up and saw an object moving from Northwest to Southeast, across
the sky. She estimated it to be about two miles away from the position which they
were occupying at the time. The object was seen in bright daylight and had the
brightness of an automobile headlight several blocks away.

       As this object passed through the air, it left a trail of light, almost white smoke, which did not last as long as that left by a jet, and was much lighter.
This smoke trail followed a flame approximately fifty times longer than the object
itself.

       The object was cone shaped, silver colored and appeared to be approximately
the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length, and flame emanating from it was
of a yellow color. The edges of the object were sharply outlined against the sky.

       Mrs. ______ watched this object for approximately fifteen seconds before
it finally disintegrated. During the course flown it did not pass from view behind
anything in the sky, there being no clouds, and the weather being about normal for
this season.

       Source stated that she had no way of judging what the object could have
been, since she and the lady with her had never seen anything like it before. But
she again stated that it resembled an oversized ice cream cone, constructed of an
aluminum or silver material.

       Mrs. ______ and her companion sighted this object on 19 July 1956, at
 approximately 2100Z. They were walking in a southerly direction toward Stockholm
village, and faced south for the full duration of the sighting.
