Visiting Comet
To Be Visible
On Saturday
Clear skies permitting, a visi-
tor from outer space will be
visible at sunset Saturday.
The Arend-Roland comet
reached its closest position to
the earth April 8, and now is
retreating.
It should be sufficiently far
enough away from the sun to
be seen by the naked eye at sun-
set Saturday.
Its tail will be pointing away
from the sun, and it should be
as bright as a brightest star
in the April sky.
The comet should be visible
about one hour after the sun
has set in the West, where
the sun sets.
About May 1, the comet will
have risen higher in the west-
ern sky, passing between the
constellations Cepalis
give the comet constellation.
The comet has been named for two
Belgian astronomers who disco-
vered it Nov. 8, 1956, should be
visible for the rest of Aprii and
May.

ASTRONOMY
New Comet Will be
Visible to Naked Eye

A BRIGHT new comet will be visible
to the naked eye in late April and early May
It may shine at zero magnitude making
it one of the most brilliant objects in the
sky at that time. Known as Comet Arend-
Roland, the object was discovered on Nov.
8, 1956. (See SNL Dec. 1,
1956, p. 345).
Since then astronomers both here and
abroad have followed it with their telescopes
and now have sufficient observations to plot
its future path in the sky.
Although it can be seen by persons in
the Southern Hemisphere before dawn dur-
ing the first half of April, people in the
Northern Hemisphere will not be able to
look at it until the end of April and the
beginning of May after sunset. Then the
comet will have passed between the earth
and the sun.
Its brilliance will fade rapidly and it will
disappear from naked-eye view by the first
of June. During the last part of April it
wfil appear very low in the northwest sky
after sunset.

New Comet at end of April and first
half of May. Will probably be reported
as UFO's or Flying Saucers by some. This
comet was only discovered three months ago.
Stand by for a flurry of saucer
reports between now and May.
