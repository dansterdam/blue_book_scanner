Figure 17. Reported movements of the Chesapeake Bay disks. (1) disks at the approach; (2) disks over and rescue; (3) the change in direction and velocity. Nash flipped off his seat belt so that he could move to the window on the side. During this brief interval he was not able to see the objects, but Fortenberry kept them in view. As he later described, their amazing behavior: all the disks simultaneously ceased their action and one by one flattened out to the right. Still on edge, they suddenly reversed their positions so that disk 6 became the leader (Figure 22).
This shift took place only a brief second and was completed by the time Nash reached the window. Both he and Fortenberry then observed the disks flip back from the concave to the flat position. In the same fraction of a second, the entire line changed direction as a sharply as a ball bouncing off a wall and shot away to the east. Two similar disks darted out, apparently from beneath the plane, and joined the line (Figure 23). The disks suddenly disappeared, immediately reappeared, abruptly began a steep climb to an altitude-above that of the plane, then vanished not in sequence, but all at one time. As described earlier, the ground controllers had tracked for a period of 12 to 15 seconds; their velocity would have been 1,200 to 1,500 miles an hour.
After a quick check showed that no one else in the aircraft had observed the lights, the pilots radioed a message to the CAA station at Langley Air Force Base. Officials there, and later ones at Newport News, had been in the region at the time of the sightings but they were ruled out as an explanation. Both pilots were informed that seven other persons, apparently on the ground, had reported wireless lights in the Norfolk area; the Air Force files contain no record of these reports and it is probable that these persons missed the most tantalizing details for UFOs.
