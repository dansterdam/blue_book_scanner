4. AMG INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS ON UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT (RESTRICTED)
AMG investigation of reports on the presence of an unidentified object in the air near Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on 8 March 1950, indicates that the reports resulted from 2 phenomena: ice-crystal clouds which reflected sunlight, and visibility of the planet Venus, which is sometimes observed in daylight. Pilots dispatched to search for an object which had been registered on radar scopes, reported nothing but ice haze and clouds. Another pilot reported an object believed to have been Venus.
