REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT: UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENON 
LOCATION: ANGELES CREST HIGHWAY
CALIFORNIA
DATE: 6 OCTOBER 1957

DETAILS OF INCIDENT:

On the evening of 6 October 1957, the witness, Mr. John Smith, was driving along the Angeles Crest Highway in California when he observed an unusual aerial object. Mr. Smith described the object as a large, triangular craft that appeared to be hovering silently approximately 500 feet above the ground. 

The object was estimated to be approximately 50 feet in length and had a central tower or structure. It exhibited no visible means of propulsion and made no sound. The object remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Mr. Smith reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force. This report was subsequently forwarded to Project Blue Book, the official U.S. government program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects.
