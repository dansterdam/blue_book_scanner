COLUMBUS - VULTEE AVG CORP
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS
INFO:
FROM: ATOLL-7112-52

Concerning the electronic sighting of 24 Dec 52 over Dallas, Texas, ATIC finds that before a suitable analysis can be made it will be necessary to obtain prints from the original 6x15 film. The negative copy you have forwarded us unfortunately lacks enough detail.
Therefore, ATIC would appreciate your forwarding 8"x10" glossy prints or every phase of the original film.
In reply cite Project Blue Book.
