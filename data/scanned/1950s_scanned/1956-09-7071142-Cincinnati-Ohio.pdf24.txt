G. DISCUSSION (CONT'D):

1. SHOWN OF INDIVIDUALS VIEWS:

a. ...
b. ...
c. Lawyer's personal records.

2. The reported sighting occurred at approximately 9:30 P.M. on October 7, 1956 in Cincinnati, Ohio. The incident was witnessed.

a. is known as "Wendell-ville". This suburb is approximately 21 miles from the downtown area of Cincinnati. It carries a population...

b. in the course of Cincinnati, in what is known as "Winton Place". This community has approximately 12,000 population.

c. A case of explanation is necessary here. In his possession a small triangular-shaped object could have been just a product of his imagination which in some way could be distorted into what he thought was a flying saucer. A daily transfer or removal of the object upon daylight arrival could explain his sighting as he was anxious to impress his neighbors.

3. Mr. - discussed the situation (and my findings) late in his home, and informed me that he was trying to impress those in his community... trying to indicate that he was very security conscious... I told him no classified items or information was involved in this investigation.

To conclude, this investigation involved no classified items or information. I told him so proceed openly. I have asked several leading questions, but see no reason to AFTIC the case. There were no other witnesses located, and I found no evidence to substantiate the sighting. There was no air force personnel involved, and the individual was simply overanxious and trying to impress his neighbors. Other than personal calls, I have nothing further for him.
