Regarding the object, the witness states: "The object appeared to be about 500-600 feet away from me in the sky. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and was traveling at a very rapid speed. I would estimate its size to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. It gave off a brilliant light that seemed to light up the surrounding area quite brightly. As it passed overhead, it gave off a burst of speed and seemed to pick up great speed. I have never seen anything like it before. There was no sound from the object. It did not appear to be an aircraft or fire balloon. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this before. I would not take an oath that this brilliant light was not an aircraft, but I do not believe it was. It certainly was not an aircraft or fire balloon that I am familiar with."
