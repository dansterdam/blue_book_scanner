DESCRIPTION: 
Between 2230-2300 hrs, the witness observed a bright, luminous object in the sky. The object appeared to be round in shape and was giving off a bright white light. The object moved rapidly in a zig-zag pattern and then disappeared. The witness was unable to estimate the speed or altitude of the object.

INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:
The witness appears to be sincere and there is no evidence of fabrication. The description of the object is consistent with other UFO reports. However, due to the lack of precise detail, the incident cannot be conclusively identified as an extraterrestrial craft.
