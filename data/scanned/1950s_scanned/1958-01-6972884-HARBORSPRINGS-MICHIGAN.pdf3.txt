The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

OCR output:

THE OBJECT WHICH WAS OBSERVED  WAS COMPLETELY ALIEN TO ANY LOGICAL

SCIENTIFIC  CONVENTIONAL  PSYCHOLOGICAL KNOWN COMPARISONS MADE.

THE BRIGHT PINPOINT OF LIGHT FIRST OBSERVED IN THE SKY, WHICH MOVED AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED IN IRREGULAR AND ERRATIC MOTIONS, COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED LOGICALLY IN TERMS OF ANY KNOWN AERIAL VEHICLE OR PHENOMENA. A PUZZLEING EXPERIENCE IN EVERY SENSE.

THE VISUAL OBSERVATION WAS CORROBORATED BY 3 WITNESSES, ALL OF WHOM WERE IN DIRECT AGREEMENT AS TO WHAT THEY ALL OBSERVED SPECIFICALLY. NONE OF THETHESE OBSERVERS HAVE EVER HAD ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OR INTEREST IN THIS TYPE PHENOMENA, I.E. "NO TO SEE."

THE PHENOMENA AS WITNESSED APPEARED TO BE OF A COMPLETELY UNEXPLANIABLE NATURE DEFYING ANY REASONABLE LOGICAL EXPLANATION BASED ON THEIR UNANIMOUS OBSERVATION AND DESCRIPTION.
