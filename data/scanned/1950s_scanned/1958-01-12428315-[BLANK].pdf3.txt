The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. This page discusses the view of Dr. Harlow Shapley, former director of the Harvard Observatory, who believes that there must be 100 million planets in the universe where intelligent beings exist, not necessarily like our earthly brand.

Here is the text of the document:

EDWARDS:

Dr. Harlow Shapley, former director of the Harvard Observatory, tells us that there must be 100 million planets in the universe where intelligent beings exist...not necessarily like our earthly brand...live and multiply and think.  

And some authorities have claimed actual evidence that this type of life does exist on other planets.

Here's an example of the evidence they offer.

(OF MARS SHOWING CANALI)

This is Mars. Telescopes reveal strange geometric lines criss-crossing its surface. 40 years ago, Percival Lowell, a distinguished American astronomer stated that these lines... the canali... are true evidence of intelligent life on Mars.
