(1) A witness would have to possess a relatively high degree of physical and mental alertness to identify the unusual characteristics of the object that was observed. The witness was reportedly in a sober condition at the time of the observation, which adds to the reliability of the report.

(2) The logs contain a fairly detailed explanation of the phenomenon. The description indicates that the witness was able to observe the object for a relatively long period of time, which increases the validity of the information.

(3) The report is considered to have sufficient explanatory details that would enable a more complete analysis. However, the absence of any corroborating witnesses or evidence limits the certainty of the conclusion.

Based on the tentative conclusion made in paragraph (3) above, it is still the opinion that the report represents a valid sighting, and deserves further investigation. The lack of any "small-acting" features on that day indicates that this is the only logical explanation, and that the usual types of aerial phenomena can be excluded.
