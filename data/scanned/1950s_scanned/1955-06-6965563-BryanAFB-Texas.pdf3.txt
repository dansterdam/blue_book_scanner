COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was a rawlinsonde balloon hypothesis fit the circumstances of this sighting.
2. The Preparing Officer believes the balloon hypothesis fits the circumstances of this sighting.
1/20 Raymond T. Mymers, 1/21/55: The object sighted by USAF Everett Y. Wood, W/Officer, 17th Weather Sq., Bryan AFB, Texas, on 23 June 1954 was a rawlinsonde balloon released from the Bryan Air Force Base weather station, Bryan, Texas.
The characteristics of the balloon as described by the eyewitness are consistent with the normal flight pattern and behavior of a rawlinsonde balloon. The object was sighted at an altitude stated to be thirty (30,000) feet at all courses stated that the object was sighted at an altitude of 20,000 to 30,000 feet.  The object was under observation for a period of about 30 minutes, consistent with the normal flight time of a rawlinsonde balloon. Based on the above, the Preparing Officer believes that the object sighted was a rawlinsonde balloon.
The Bryan Air Force Base weather Station reported the following information for 23 June 1954:
Sky condition - clear
Winds - 230 degrees, 52 knots at 25,000 feet
230 degrees, 55 knots at 30,000 feet
The Preparing Officer contacted 6th Weather Rawlinsonde Department. Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and received the following information:
Rawlinsonde balloons have been sighted with the naked eye after dark, up to altitudes of 80,000 feet, depending on the balloon's inflation rate and size of the balloon.  A light such as the one used for rawlinsonde observation could be very detectable at high altitudes when the balloon is at maximum inflation.
3. The Preparing Officer believes that the UFOB are one in the same.
