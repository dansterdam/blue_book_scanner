Inquiry from Associated Press UNCLASSIFIED
Director of Intelligence
DES/O: Reg AA-952                                                     21 February 1952

1. The following request for information was received from Mr. Elton Fay, Associated Press:
"Could you run a check on this report?"
"A reserve officer-pilot, who recalled AD from jet flying for an airline, was flying after recall over Central America area. While in the air, word came that the airline he had joined has been sold to another owner. Subsequently, he was sent to inactive duty, then a few weeks later 'called back' for two weeks AD at Mobile. While there, officers at that base decided to hold screening on subjects of flying saucers. This officer, who had mentioned to other officers, was put on the program."
"Shortly before the seminar, an A-3 jet came 'across the horizon.' The officer in question was asked about the horns. The reconding was made, and it was described as telling of a flying saucer." 
"From other sources we learn this interrogation occurred at Mobile on 30 March 1950."
2. Inquiry has revealed that the above is substantially correct, but that the first date of "fall" is inaccuratly recorded, and that AF has no information to confirm statements in paragraph 3 of Mr. Fay's query.
3. It is requested that the correct name and rank of type of sighting, and date of sighting, be reported sighting to this office.
4. No release of this information will be made public until it has been properly conditioned and cleared by persons who have authority to declassify such material.
