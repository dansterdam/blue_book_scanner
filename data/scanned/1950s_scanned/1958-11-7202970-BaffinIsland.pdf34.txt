The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book document. The text on the page appears to be a description of life on Mars and a celestial time table for November.

Life on Mars
One of the most interesting was the work of Dr. William M. Sinton of Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona. Dr. Sinton found that Martian soil contains certain carbon and hydrogen compounds, but he cautions against over-interpretations, as these compounds may have been produced by processes going on currently or may have been in the soil for long periods. Dr. Sinton measured the infrared spectrum of the Martian atmosphere and found it to contain such simple gases as carbon dioxide and perhaps also molecular oxygen, but other trace constituents were not identified.

Celestial Time Table for November
The time table lists various astronomical events and observations for the month of November.
