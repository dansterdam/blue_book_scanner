The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document seems to be a "Pilots Guide for Communicating with Airway Stations" and includes information on radio communication procedures and radio communication codes.

PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS
PILOTS - never hesitate to use your radio. Remember that talking by radio is almost the same as talking on your home telephone.
The following are typical examples of two-way communication with airway stations:
IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number.
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE".
IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number.
Example: "ATKINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE".
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS - STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - OVER".
After the airway station has identified your make and certificate number, they will handle your message. The airway station will normally answer on the radio range or radiotelephony frequency. If a reply is desired on other than the radio range or radiotelephony frequency, indicate the frequency on which you desire the reply to be transmitted.
POINT ONE MEGACYCLES - OVER
After the airway station has answered your call, proceed with your message without further call or other than preceding the message with "OVER".
"STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - THIS IS CLEVELAND RADIO - AT ELEVEN TWENTY - FOUR THOUSAND FEET - OVER"
"ROGER - CLEVELAND RADIO - AT TOLEDO - OVER".
