ATIC DOCUMENT 193879, RUSSIA

The following sightings were made in Russian skies between 19 November 1952 to 25 February 1953:

1) During the nights of 19 to 20 December 1952, an aircraft was observed the sky over Moscow on 3 or 4 occasions. The aircraft appeared to be of unusual optical performance. On one occasion the aircraft was observed descending into the clouds and was not seen again.

2) On 5 January 1953, three or four objects were observed in the sky for a period of about 10 minutes. The objects appeared to be luminous and remained in one spot during the time they were observed.

3) On 20 February 1953 between 1720 and 1930 hours, 3 or 4 objects were observed rapidly ascending and descending over the Moscow area. It was reported that the objects appeared to be luminous and remained visible for 15 to 20 minutes.

ATIC COMMENT: It is believed that many of these sightings are the result of Soviet balloon activity. The rapid or unusual maneuvering observed might account for the second sighting.
