HEADQUARTERS

COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO

9 January 1953

Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: Col. Ray McDuffee,
Chief, Technical Analysis Division
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Ray:

In thinking over our telephone conversation, I am not certain
whether you said Capt. Ruppelt would be here on the 23rd or 24th
of January. I seem to recall that you have him scheduled for
arrival 0930 hours on the 24th. We have the conference scheduled
for 0815 local time. It is obvious that Ruppelt would need to
arrive the day before. It will be most convenient for us if he
could arrive at about 0930 on the 23rd and spend a full day in the
office before his presentation Saturday morning. In any case,
please bear in mind the 0815 time on Saturday 24 January.

Regards,

(Signed)
C A MILLER
Colonel USAF
