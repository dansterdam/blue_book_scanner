'Thingnik' sighter Finally Tells Tale 
Of Mysterious Landing to Sheriff
by Peter J. Wissing

CLAYTON, N.M. - Clifford Moore, a ranch hand near this city, said he saw a mysterious object land in a field near his home on Wednesday night.

Moore, who lives about eight miles southwest of Clayton, said the object landed in a field about a quarter of a mile from his home about 11 p.m. 

According to Kenneth Locke, deputy sheriff of Union County, Moore volunteered information about the incident after being questioned by the sheriff's office.

Moore told Locke he observed the object for about 15 minutes. It appeared to be about 50 feet long and 15 feet wide, and was hovering about 10 feet off the ground.

Locke said Moore reported he observed a bright light on the object and that it emitted a humming sound. The object then rose straight up and disappeared, Moore told the officer.

The deputy said Moore was interviewed again Thursday and was asked to take the sheriff's office to the scene, but he was unable to locate the exact spot where the object had landed.

"Locke said Moore made no claims of seeing any creatures or beings in connection with the landing. He explained that Moore said he was "scared to death" during the incident and left the area as soon as the object took off.
