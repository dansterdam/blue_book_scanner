SUBJECT: Radar and Visual UFO Reported by ADIN-L-BL
FROM: ADIN-L-BL
DATE: APOIN-L-BL/V. D. BRYANT/jc
TEL31/disc 365-D/fm S

1. The following comments are made with reference to the radar portion of this UFO sighting:
a. The size of the "blip" on the scope is much larger than a normal return for a single target.
b. The indications are that this was a large target (from the large "blip" observed), the GCI station should also have had radar contact. This they did not have.
c. The speed the target left the scope eliminates returns from aircraft, including the B-47.
2. It is extremely difficult to discount sightings which involve both visual and radar tracking. In case the evidence of a physical target cannot be positively disproven, although the discrepancies in the radar portion of the sighting denies this the radar sighting is a full target. If this is true, the sighting may be a case of associating an actual visual target with a false radar target.
3. Although this office is not in a position to comment on the subject, it would seem that unusual weather or transmission conditions which affect radar transmissions might also affect visual transmissions thereby providing freak visual observations.
