Garreston S.D. October 6, 1959 
Dear Sir:
I have just witnessed a most unusual object in the sky over Garreston, South Dakota and would like to report it to you. 
At approximately 9:15 P.M., while outside my home, I observed a bright, round, luminous object moving slowly across the sky in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet and moved in an absolutely silent manner. The light remained constant and did not blink or flicker. It did not resemble any known aircraft, either military or civilian. 
The object was visible for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing behind some trees. I would be more than happy to provide any additional information you may require regarding this sighting.
Sincerely,
S. Garreston
