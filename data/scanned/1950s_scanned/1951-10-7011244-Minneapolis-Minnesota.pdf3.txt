"The only information available to this incident is a letter report, dated 7 Oct., 1951, which states as follows: 

"I don't know how to describe its size, because at the time I didn't have the binoculars to judge its size."

Shortly after this we saw another one, and this one didn't seem quite as large.

"When I saw the second, one I called our "reading" station at the airport and asked them if they had reported any unusual things in the sky. There were a number of other people, but couldn't keep the two visible long enough to get a good look at them. They seemed to fade out rather rapidly."

Status of Investigation:
Further details of the incident have not been procured. The sources have been investigated but no evidence that could be corroborated high altitude balloon projects.
