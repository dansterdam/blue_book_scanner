FLYING SAUCER*

On Wednesday, December 16, 1952, I participated in a test flight of a Navy Jet Fighter Constellation UV-42, taking off at 10:35 p.m. The flight was over Catalina channel and we climbed out over the ocean and reached an altitude of 20,000 feet. At 10:50 p.m. something approached the plane from the right side and passed overhead behind us at a distance estimated to be 4,000 feet. It appeared to be a very large object, possibly 100 feet in diameter, and it was moving at a speed estimated to be 20,000 feet per minute.
Several seconds later a second object approached from the left side and passed under the plane at about 10,000 feet. This object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was moving at a rate of speed estimated to be 15,000 to 20,000 feet per minute.
It was a clear night, moonlight, and I could see the objects quite distinctly as they passed by. After they had passed, we made a gradual descent and landed at approximately 11:45 p.m.
Although the object appeared to be absolutely stationary, it did not seem to give off any light, nor did it have any visible means of propulsion. It was, however, quite large and apparently solid in appearance. There was no sound associated with either of the objects.
Looking back at the flight, I can say that it was recorded that the two objects were sighted at approximately 20:50 p.m. or just a little before that time. We continued with the test flight, and landed after the observation, at approximately 11:45 p.m. When we were on the ground, we discussed other details of the flight and then we were debriefed. I gave a written statement of what I had observed to my Duty and Administrative Officer at that time.
