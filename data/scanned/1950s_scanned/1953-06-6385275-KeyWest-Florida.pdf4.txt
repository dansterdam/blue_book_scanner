The image does not contain any photographs, but rather three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch depicts a curved line on the horizon, with instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the observed object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when it was last seen. The second and third sketches show the perspective of the observer on the ground, with a road and landscape in the foreground, and instructions to refer to a smaller sketch to complete the larger sketch.
