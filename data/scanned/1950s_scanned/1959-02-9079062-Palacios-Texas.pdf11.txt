Here is the text from the document:

Mr. Gaines Corperon
Route 1
Palacios, Texas

March 4th, 1959.

Commander in Chief
U. S. A. F.
Washington, 25, D. C.

Dear Commander:- 

An unidentifiable object appeared in the sky Feb. 10, at about 5:40 A.M. which was traveling South by a few degrees East and stopped by the star ( Y ) in VIRGO, THEN there appeared a mass of small lights around it and it had an ability to move clock-wise among the lights in an erratic course about one-third the radius from the outer rim of the circular mass of lights, then after completing about 7/8 of a circle it moved to the center of the mass and came to rest with its North side almost touching the star, then I failed to see the small lights they seemed to vanish all at the same time, then the main object seemed to change its design; the length seemed to change to its depth and in less than 15 seconds it grew so small that it was invisible, as the vanishing in the distance.

The object was about two times longer than its width and its depth appeared to be two-thirds of its width, with all corners rounded, Shining with a reddish red glow.

That you might be interested or help me contact someone who is.

Yours truely.
