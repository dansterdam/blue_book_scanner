Gallery 4--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

This gallery shows, in a broader pictured portrayal by the occasional irregular shape of the exterior body,some Frisbee's have been reported to change course after travelling.
The original entrance velocity, angle of entry, size and chemical structure all contribute to the path of a saucer. Such is the variety of speeds, attitudes and directions reported.
The saucer depends on the dynamic and the direction the object is moving rather than the surface friction. When the internal forces increase friction will stop. The greater the distance between the observer and the object, the more chance of error will lie in timing the speed [.] Some observers were very steady, traveling at an almost leisurely rate. They must have been a long way off to appear so slow. Yet, two instances in 1945 maintained a horizontal course over a distance of several thousands of miles, crossing countries untried and traversed [.] Some persons reported to the Ufologics Society that on November 1, 1956, at 5:30 p.m., a Frisbee proved slowly through the sky from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania. Described as bluish-green, traveling at a moderate pace, it maintained a course for about a hundred miles. Perhaps an unusual manifestation [.] P-71. On May 12, 1951, at 9:40 a.m., there was described a round, glowing object, larger than a car, hovering just above the treetops near people. Toward the end it came to a stop, spiraled a couple of times and then simply vanished, either leaving or landing indistinctly. To summarize: Meteors can travel at low velocities and "a sightingHistory horizontal craft".
