The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document states:

UNCLASSIFIED
1. The images on the negatives were caused by light striking unexposed film, (i.e., the negatives were not retouched).
2. The individual lights in the "formation" varied in intensity.
3. The intensity was greater than any surrounding stars as the stars did not register. (The photos were taken under CAVIL conditions.)
4. The individual lights changed position in the "formation".
C. Re-interrogation of the photographer:
The OSI was requested to reinterrogate the photographer in another attempt to determine the authenticity of the photographs. The details of this interrogation have not been received, but a preliminary report stated that there were no indications that the photographs were not authentic.
D. Future Investigations:
A trip to Lubbock, Texas, will be made during January. Arrangements are being made to have a Project grudge consultant and a physician accompany the investigators. If the photographs are authentic, they are important in that:
1. They will give an accurate measurement of the "angular span".
2. The light source, although it appeared to be of low intensity to the eye, was highly sensitive.
3. The movement of the individual lights in the formation can be studied further.
4. Density comparison tests can be made.
