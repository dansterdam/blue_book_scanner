This image contains a hand-drawn illustration part of the form under question 20. The drawing appears to represent the motion path of an unidentified object. The object itself is illustrated as a saucer-like shape with annotations indicating changes in its angle such as "20°" and "30°", and directions shown by arrows. The start of the path is labeled with an "A" and there is a "B" at the end along with directional changes marked during the course. Below the drawing is annotated with some handwritten text that is partly obscured.
