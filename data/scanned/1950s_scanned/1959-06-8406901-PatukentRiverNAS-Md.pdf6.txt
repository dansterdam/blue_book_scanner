SIR:

This organization, has forwarded to me your letter of 6 October 1959 for reply. It is noted that your memorandum of 25 September 1959, and upon an evaluation of both pieces of correspondence, I am forced to comment as I see them, as follows:

1. The information most specifically information concerning "two local recent happenings," Your reply refers to the information as "incidents, or of course they were not."

2. You have sent to Miss several lengthy forms to complete; these forms deal ostensibly with information to be supplied by witnesses to some phenomenon. Since Miss did not herself witness the phenomenon referred to, she cannot, of course, complete the forms, and I am somewhat amazed that you inferred that she could.

3. If you are not in communication with the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base which all designated upon the phenomena, you suggest that we write to the base ourselves. I say this because you have written the reports (contained insufficient data for valid conclusions), and did not ask you will receive a reply, but rather requested that you would furnish any additional details you might have inquired.

Please do not feel that I an being critical simply because I enjoy the process; however, I cannot help but feel that large organizations with much to do such as your own, sometimes overlook important details of other people's time in this matter as much as I regret having to use my own. Thanks you for your continuing patience and consideration.

Sincerely,
