AFOIM 4

PROGRAM

General Doughty
AFOIM 4-A
It is my impression that General Walsh is interested in producing
AFOIM 4-8
AFOIM 4-C the development of intelligence with the minimum expenditure of funds
the utilization of manpower and monies to cover certain specific problems. 
AFOIM 4-D I have conducted a review of the functions of AFOIM-45, and feel that we
the UFO discussion 1957-58 should at this time be considered whether to continue
considering the time it was felt that the assignment should be made to
AFOIM 48 AFOIM-4D. I believe that those functions might pose a threat to
AFOIM 4-F secure evidence that UFO's constitute any such threat.
