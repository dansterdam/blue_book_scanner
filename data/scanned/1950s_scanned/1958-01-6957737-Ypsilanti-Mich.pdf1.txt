The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a Project 10073 Record Card that records details of a UFO sighting, including the location (Ypsilanti, Michigan), the date-time group, the type of observation (aerial-visual), the length of observation (6 secs), and a brief summary of the sighting ("Bld, obj w/ appearance of marble or milky plaster w/things on side of it."). The document also includes a section for the observer's conclusion, which states that "Limited info makes evaluation impossible."
