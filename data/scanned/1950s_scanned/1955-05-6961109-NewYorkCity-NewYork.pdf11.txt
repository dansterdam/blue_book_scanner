AF FORM 112â€”PART II
UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Date: 5 April 1955
ATIS
DS-UFOB-3-65
Page 3A of 12
COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the object described in this report and the photographs taken are worthwhile for the following reasons:
a. The enclosed photographs were taken by the local U.S. Weather Bureau and Air Force weather station for analysis. It is the opinion of those familiar with the case that the photographs do show something significant.
b. The day (Sunday) of the sighting coupled with the fact that the area of sightings is highly industrial and crowded at that time indicates the probability of a large number of witnesses.
c. Commercial and Air Force photographers were contacted concerning the possibility of having taken ground photographs with the type camera used by the source. In all cases it was agreed that it would be possible by chance to accidentally obtain a picture in the 18 to 20 feet range.
2. Although the source is a "casual fan" and was particularly interested in publicity, seems to substantiate the possibility of a real event.
3. Although the object was given a rapid rate of speed by the source, he managed to snap ten pictures (of which only two were returned) in one and one-half minutes, which does not lend a rapid increment to the duration of the phenomenon.
4. This report and pictures are forwarded to ATIC for further analysis and evaluation.
