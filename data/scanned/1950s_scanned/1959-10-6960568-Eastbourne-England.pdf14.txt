Transcription of the text:

"San Diego 2, California

Dec 3 1959

General Grant received your letter of 28 October upon his return from an extended trip to the Far East. Immediately thereafter he instructed me to reply in detail to your previous note forwarding General Grant's request that I reply to your present note and advise you when he might be in such a position that it would be impossible for him to state when he might visit your Intelligence Center. While General Grant is vitally interested in visiting your Intelligence Center, he feels that it would be more appropriate for your organization to ponder the matter further rather than requesting the Commander of the Center who has already received your original photograph as a General Grant indicated in his letter of 19 October to you.

Again, on behalf of General Grant, let me express our appreciation for your continued interest in Air Force matters.

Sincerely,

JOHN E. MORRISON, JR.
Colonel, USAF, Directive Division
Directorate of Telecommunications"
