The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, with a form that the observer filled out to describe their sighting.

Sound: Whistle like
Color: Reddish-orange color, dull
Shape: No drawing provided
Edges of the object: Fuzzy or blurred
Like a bright star
Sharply outlined
Other: Steady, appeared for 5 minutes

If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? [This question is left unanswered on the form.]
