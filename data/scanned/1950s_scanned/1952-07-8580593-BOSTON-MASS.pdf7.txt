ID-GJX 24-349
(a) Description: Two (2) round, bluish-green lights, much more brilliant than stars, and without sound or exhaust trail. Observer could not estimate the size or distance.

(b) Formation: One directly behind the other and at the same level. Almost exactly the same distance between the two points, but the fact hat they kept this position exactly indicated that they were rigidly connected.

(c) Maneuvers: The lights were sighted at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizon in the southeastern sky. They moved northwest until directly over the observer, at this point the distance between the two lights increased. They then reversed their direction, passed over the observer, and began a wide arc toward the northeast. All maneuvers were on the same horizontal plane, without any noticeable change of altitude.

(d) Disappearances: Lights were not dimmed by distance, but the disappearance was abrupt, as if the objects had been switched off suddenly. They would reappear at another point along the arc, continuing until reaching the approximate point at which the first disappearance occurred.

(e) Time sighted: For approximately 15 minutes, by an officer of the station, who was on duty and reported the sighting.

(e) Manner and location of observation: No optical or mechanical aids were employed. Observation was made from the administration building at Squantum Naval Air Station, Quincy, Massachusetts.

(g) Identification and description on observer: Lt Commander
has served twelve (12) years active duty in the U.S. Navy, primarily as a pilot. He is presently performing duties of assistant personnel officer at Squantum. He stated that falling stars, jet exhaust trails, flares, and other lights were distinctly different from any of these.

(h) Existing conditions that might account for sighting: None. No physical evidence exists, and no interruption of station activities was taken.
