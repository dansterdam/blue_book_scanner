AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Agency): OSI, Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, New Mexico

DATE OF INFORMATION: 22 JULY 1952

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

In accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 12 AUGUST 1949, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects, a report is submitted.

On 22 JULY 1952, between 1, 000 and 1, 030 hours, MST, two towers at the Albuquerque Airport reported the presence of strange lights in the air southwest of the airport, moving in a north-southerly direction. The control tower operator reported seeing at least 8-12 fast moving lights at one time, some turning red, some white, and some green. He stated they seemed to move rapidly, stopping and starting, ascending and descending. The Air Force radar operator on duty reported that he had observed the object on his scope, but that it seemed to move too fast for normal aircraft. The lights were observed by many witnesses, both Air Force and civilian. They were from 500 to 5,000 feet in altitude and seemed to hover and make rather erratic maneuvers. After about a half hour the lights disappeared from view and from the radar scope. No aircraft were in the area. This report is considered as being reliable, as the observers were well qualified.
