III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
SOURCE stated that on 6 May 1956 at approximately 2300 hours, local, the following conditions he noted:
A bright object in the western sky below the clouds. SOURCE'S attention was attracted by the object due to its brilliance and the peculiar motions it was exhibiting. SOURCE was using 7x50 binoculars. SOURCE reported the object was sharply outlined, shaped like a cigar, with a yellowish-red glow to it which would pulsate and fade, then reappear. The object would sometimes appear to hover in one spot, and at other times it would streak across the sky in a small portion of the time it appeared to hover. The motions of the sighting object appeared to SOURCE to be erratic and unnatural to the point of being speedy at one point in direction and slowly passed out of sight over the western horizon.
SOURCE stated the object did not break into pieces nor did it appear to emit any sparks or flames. The object did not make any audible sound. It was stated by SOURCE that the object approached to within approximately 35 miles of his position and then slowly passed out of sight. The observation lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes.
