Dear Sir or Madam,

I have acquired an object described locally, that at first I believed to be a meteor. However, after closer examination I have decided it to be in the nature of a spaceship, about the size of a "Jupiter C" missile, and remotely and silently hovered. Similarities with the external structure of the "Jupiter C" are startling, but my views on its nature are tentative, and it is diminishing, and as it moved from heat, except the nose, which is warmed.

After all long as this is shown on the training site eight pounds of course.

If interested, please send someone to observe as I believe this to be of great significance.
