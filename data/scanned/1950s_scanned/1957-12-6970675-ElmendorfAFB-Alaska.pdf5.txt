VENUS IS CHRISTMAS STAR
A crescent moon and the planet Venus will be close together on December 24, making a brilliant pair that lights up the Christmas sky.
By JAMES STOKLEY
This year we will have a real Christmas star, the kind that tradition says heralded the birth of Christ. It will be the planet Venus, which will be at its greatest brilliance on December 24.
Just why is the pair of the crescent moon and Venus sometimes called the "Christmas star"? It is because they appear together in the sky just about the time of Christmas, and Venus then is at the peak of its brilliance.
Of course, the Christmas star of tradition was not really a single star, but rather a bright object in the sky, either a planet, a conjunction of two or more planets, or possibly even a comet. Some astronomers believe it may have been a rare supernova, an exploding star, which would have been very bright for a short time. But the Venus-moon pair for Christmas this year will be just as brilliant.
On the 24th, the moon, in a crescent phase, will be setting soon after the sun. But the brilliant Venus will remain in the sky, shining brilliantly throughout the night. This will be a favorable time to see the planet.
Venus is the brightest of the visible planets, and when at its best it outshines even Sirius, the dog-star, and ranks next to the sun and moon in the order of bright celestial objects. Right now it rises soon after sunset, and is high in the southwest during the evening hours. It will be farthest east of the sun, and will remain in the evening sky for several months.
There will be a clear view in this direction, and astronomers say you can get a glimpse of the crescent moon and Venus together when they are at their highest, about two hours before sunset. This will be an especially favorable time to see Mercury.
Observed more closely, the astronomical pair has other interesting features. Venus, of course, goes through phases like the moon, and they can actually be seen through a small telescope. As the planet moves in its orbit, the lighted part we see waxes and wanes.
Right now Venus is waxing, appearing as a crescent. Later, as it swings around to the far side of the sun, it will become full, like the moon, and the entire lighted hemisphere will be turned toward us. But there will be no more favorable time this year than when it is paired with the crescent moon at Christmas.
Deep down in brightness
Brightest of the stars is Sirius, the dog-star, better known as the "dog of Canis Major," the great hunting dog of the heavens. But Venus, though much farther away, outshines Sirius because its nearness to the earth's atmosphere causes a partial diminution of its light. Later in the night it climbs higher, and its brilliance becomes more pronounced.
On the brightness scale of star magnitudes, Venus rates zero, which means that it exceeds any other star visible in the night sky except Sirius. In fact, for the magnitude of this planet to come as low as zero is nearly as bright as it can get, the figure zero indicating the most brilliant objects.
