STATEMENT OF
FIRST LIEUTENANT A.E. PETERSEN
7th WEATHER SQUADRON
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA

ON 6 MAY 1957, AT APPROXIMATELY 2300 HOURS, I WAS ON DUTY IN THE WEATHER SQUADRON OPERATIONS ROOM AT EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA, WHEN I NOTICED SEVERAL BRIGHT FLASHES OF LIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW. I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUTSIDE TO INVESTIGATE.

UPON GOING OUTSIDE, I SAW TWO BRIGHT OBJECTS TRAVELING IN THE SOUTHWESTERN SKY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE OBJECTS WERE BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR AND OBLONG IN SHAPE. THEY APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH AND WERE VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 15-20 SECONDS BEFORE DISAPPEARING.

I IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE OPERATIONS ROOM AND NOTIFIED THE DUTY OFFICER. WE BOTH OBSERVED THE OBJECTS THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE OPERATIONS ROOM. THE OBJECTS WERE SPOTTED AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER, TRAVELING IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION.
