WACO, TEXAS
April 6, 1952

Dear Sir:

This letter is to report the observation of a highly unusual object in the sky over Waco, Texas, on the evening of April 6, 1952.
Approximately 9:30 p.m., my wife and I were standing outside our home in North Waco when we noticed a bright, hovering object in the sky to the northwest. At first, we thought it might be an aircraft of some kind, but as we watched, the object suddenly accelerated and shot straight up into the sky at a tremendous speed, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.
The object was round or disc-shaped, silent, and emanating a bright, white light. It hovered motionless for several minutes before its rapid ascent. There were no wings, no trail, no sound, and no other identifying features.
I realize that this may sound like a typical "flying saucer" report, but I can assure you that my wife and I are rational, intelligent observers who have never before reported anything of this nature. We are both still quite shaken by what we witnessed.
I would appreciate any information you may be able to provide regarding this incident, or any similar sightings that may have been reported in the Waco area. Please let me know if you require any additional details from me.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
