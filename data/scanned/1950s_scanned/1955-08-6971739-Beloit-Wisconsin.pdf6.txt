Flight 3-A 4602D AIRS AIRS 3-A-UFOR-1-55 Part Three 7 PAGES
I. SOURCE: Mr. Harold W. Varney 
Address: 335 Bluff St., Beloit, Wisconsin
Age: 41
Occupation: High School Graduate
Qualifications: Three years GCG experience; present position of GCO supervisor
II. RELIABILITY: Source changed his original opinion about the sighting, after various thoughts, and some layman type research on the subject to satisfy himself. His original opinion was that the objects were UFOBS, but later GCO observations made him doubtful. He indicated that his first opinion, that objects were UFOBS, had been influenced by the source of his preliminary information.
III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGHTINGS: No observation of the sighting was made while en route from the source's home to GCO post and he could not note any unusual conditions in the sky. The sighting of the objects was first noticed by the GCO observer and he was called to the post to observe the objects himself. The star-like objects, varying in size from the size of a baseball to a pinpoint, were observed for approximately 3 hours. Their movement appeared to be erratic with no set pattern. They were observed to the south or south to north.
IT WAS ALSO NOTED BY THE SOURCE THAT THE PATH OF THE "MILLER" MAY SEEMED TO CHANGE DIRECTION SLIGHTLY DURING THE HOURS OF OBSERVATION OF SIGHTINGS. THE DURATION OF THE SIGHTINGS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY TWO TO FIVE MINUTES.
