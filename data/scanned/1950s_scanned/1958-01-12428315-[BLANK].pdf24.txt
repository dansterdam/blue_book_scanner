DISSOLVE TO: ARTCARD #27
(OF MANTELL)
...under the command of Captain
Thomas Mantell, a veteran combat
pilot was immediately vectored
in on the strange apparitionalshaped object.

(CUT BACK TO EDWARDS)
What happened then depends upon
what version you read. There
were seven witnesses in Godman
Tower...and their accounts differ
in many details. But this is sure.
Captain Mantell...by radio...reported sighting the object above
him. He said it was "Metallic
and of tremendous size". Mantell's
plane was not equipped with Oxygen...
