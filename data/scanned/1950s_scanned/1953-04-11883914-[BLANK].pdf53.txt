Astronomer E, from England, has made no sightings, but tells of the reports of unidentified objects in England.
Astronomer G has made no sightings, nor have his associates.
Reasonably interested in talking about the subject, he clearly does not consider it a topic of any real importance as compared with the problems he is interested in at the moment.
Astronomer H has been associated with systematic meteor observation, but not for any great length of time. He has made no sightings nor have his associates. His meteor cameras have not picked up any objects.
Astronomer I has made no sightings and it was rather difficult to get him to talk about the subject at all. Clearly he does not regard it as a problem of importance.
Astronomer J, who has had long experience at a meteor observatory, has made no sightings but clearly is very interested in the problem. He has promised cooperation should any items come to his attention. He is very much interested in seeing this problem cleared up. His professional rating is excellent.
Astronomer L has made no sightings nor, as far as he knows, have any of his associates.
Astronomer M has made no sightings. Politely interested, but he clearly does not regard it as a major problem.
Astronomer N, with an excellent professional rating, has made no sightings nor does he know of any associates who have. He said that astronomer Whipple thinks the green fireballs observed in New Mexico are small asteroids.
