MEMORANDUM REPORT to Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951.

1. I was piloting on flight 125/9 from Keeflavik, Iceland to NAS, Argentina.

2. At approximately 0550Z/10 February 1951, I was reporting our position to RADEA Navigation when I sighted an unusual object. At that time we were on a true heading of 230Â° at a true air speed of 190 knots, and a ground speed of 160 knots due to a 70 knot headwind.

3. Lieutenant KINGDON pointed out an orange colored object about 6000 yards, or 3.4 miles, away, saying it appeared like a small village or a ship. Due to our position, I was certain it wasn't a village.

4. I had been looking at the object about thirty seconds, which it appeared to me was another demonstration of the "northern lights" phenomena which occur at that latitude, when the object suddenly changed direction at a high rate of speed. I pointed this out to Lieutenant KINGDON, but owing to the crowded cockpit, I did not get another look.

5. The best view I had of the object showed it to be a circular, bright orange-red disc, which was approaching us at a very great, undeterminable speed.
