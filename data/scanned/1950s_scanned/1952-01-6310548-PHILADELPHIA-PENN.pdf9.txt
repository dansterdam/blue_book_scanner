If you saw a meteor falling to the north of Philadelphia last night, Dr. CHARLES P. OLIVIER, director of the Flower Observatory, wants to hear about it.
Several persons reported seeing the phenomenon about 6:15. Some described it as a huge ball of blue and red flame. Others said the ball was green with yellow "tails". All agreed it seemed to be falling straight towards the earth.

On 27 February 1952, Lt. A. T. MCHIG, Intelligence Division, Police Department of Philadelphia, advised Special Agent PIGOOD B. FETT, Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Philadelphia, Pa., were concerned and both advised their respective offices had received no reports of the fire balls.
