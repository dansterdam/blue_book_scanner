PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 8 JUL 50 
2. LOCATION: New Church, Va.
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 05-30 PM
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Vieual 
5. DURATION: 0-1/2 MIN
6. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: N.A.
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Varying
9. COURSE: Erratic
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The objects were described as "buzzy" or "burry" in appearance, with no indication of solidity. The movement appeared erratic, describing a zigzag course. The objects appeared and disappeared from view, and at times seemed to stop and turn around. The objects gave the impression of being "not too high" and the observation was discontinued when the objects disappeared from view. Possibility exists that the objects could have been a type of high-flying aircraft, but the unusual movement and apparent lack of solidity made positive identification impossible. The total number of objects was not determined, as they appeared and disappeared from view, making an accurate count difficult.
11. COMMENTS: Insufficient data for evaluation.
