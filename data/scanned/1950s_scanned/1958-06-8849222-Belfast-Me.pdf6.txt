ORIGINATING AGENCY
Det 9, 1006th AISS
Comments of the Investigators:
1. In view of the information received and the personnel assigned to investigate, the sighting appears to be the star "ARCTURUS".
On 23 July 1958, at 2320 hours (EST) the object was pointed out to the investigators, who observed it for several months, and it was the object reported as the sightings of 26 and 27 June 1958.
2. The object was definitely a "star", established in a "tail to be jumping" pattern characteristic of the double star system viewed through a telescope (Bausch & Lomb) with a 40 millimeter lens, due to the lazy moving character of the object, which was observed by the investigators.
3. The object was in sight for approximately thirty (30) minutes and did not change its position or move about as reported by the sources. The object was finally obscured by heavy fog.
