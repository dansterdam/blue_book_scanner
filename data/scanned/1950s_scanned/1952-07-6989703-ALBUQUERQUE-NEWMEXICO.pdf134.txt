AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
66th Bomb Wing, Heavy
1952-07-27-52

The report describes an incident where two or more metallic objects were observed in the sky near Albuquerque, New Mexico. The objects were described as being metallic in color, resembling a grain of wheat in shape, and were determined to be beyond the weather balloon under observation. The observers were unable to estimate the altitude of the objects with any degree of accuracy.

The report also mentions that it was impossible to estimate the size of the objects before the weather balloon burst. The objects were observed to change direction and speed, and to disappear into the distance. The report states that the objects followed a general path from northwest to southeast.
