A STRANGE AIRCRAFT IS SEEN OVER SIOUX CITY BY KANSAS CITY PILOT
WHAT CANNOT BE PERFORMED BY THE AIRPLANES OF TODAY? "WINTHER SAYS"
A VETERAN air line pilot told of seeing the strange light in the air near Sioux City tonight. Vinsther, Continent Airlines pilot who has been flying for 20 years, said that while approaching the Sioux City airport he saw a strange light in the air.
The light seemed to be about the size of a B-29 with a long narrow fuselage and four long, straight wings, Vinsther said. The light seemed to be about 5,000 feet up. 
"The exhaust glow," Vinsther said, "seemed to be coming from the wingtips and I saw no other lights on the craft." 
Vinsther explained he watched the craft for some time and it seemed to be maneuvering at the edge of the field, he said. However, there were no navigation lights, in addition to the strange light illuminating the craft.
Vinsther said when he got back to the city, his first action was to tell his co-pilot, James P. Hawthorne, what he had seen. Hawthorne, Vinsther said, was more interested in the business of getting the plane landed, but one of the eleven passengers, a woman sitting directly behind the pilots, also saw the strange craft.
Vinsther said the craft was getting lower and lower until it finally disappeared when the plane was on the ground, and he could not see it any longer. He said the plane was not attempting to land and that it seemed to disappear into the darkness.
