Here is the text from the document:

Air Attache, Australia
TR-305-55
UNCLASSIFIED

Where an impression of distance has been formed in most cases the observer was observing an object at fairly high altitude. The impression of distance has been made by the observers by comparison with known objects of similar size and shape at a distance over a much longer length of time the light was seen. 

The following opinions are recorded:
a. The sighting was of a light, not of an object. 
b. From the weather conditions, it is considered that the light may have been a meteor.
c. In regard to the above opinions, although several reports stated that an object was observed that appeared to be solid, the consensus of opinion is that the appearances were those of lights rather than solid objects.

In support of the meteor theory many observers gave the impression as the light appeared to them to be similar in nature to a meteor. On the other hand, the opinion is expressed that the light did not behave like a meteor.

It is recommended that any future investigations as a result of newspaper reports to be conducted as follows:
a. Copies of all leading State and Interstate daily newspapers be obtained covering the period of the reports.
b. The Commonwealth meteorologists be consulted for an opinion as to reports and sightings made by official observers.
c. Interviews be undertaken if deemed necessary.

Attached are copies of various reports which appeared in SYDNEY newspapers.
