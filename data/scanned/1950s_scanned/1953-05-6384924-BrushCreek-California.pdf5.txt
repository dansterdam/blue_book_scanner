TWO MINERS FLY OFF HANDLE AT A SAUCER
BRUSH CREEK, PA. - Two miners on their way to work at a near-by gold mine came upon a strange object and tried to approach it, according to a report received here.
The object was described as a bright, metallic disc-shaped object that kept bothering them as they made their way to the mine. John Van Allen, one of the miners, said they tried to approach the object but it would not allow them to get near it.
The object would come near them and then dart away, the report stated. The miners said the object was about four feet thick. They said they tried to approach it but it sped away. The miners said it seemed to be about 15-20 feet in diameter.
"If it would be all right to take a shot at it I certainly would," one of the miners was quoted as saying. "But it went away too fast for us to get a shot."
The report stated the incident occurred on May 25, 1953.
