SLIDE NO. 11

Assuming a typical present day installation of a 6000 lb.

thrust jet engine, the estimated performance would be as follows:

        Rate of climb at sea level                          21,000 ft/min

refueling and the possibility that our aerial phenomena may be
due to conventional aircraft from a foreign source, using the range
extension to be gained from recent refueling techniques. It is
quite true, of course, that in-flight refueling has greatly
