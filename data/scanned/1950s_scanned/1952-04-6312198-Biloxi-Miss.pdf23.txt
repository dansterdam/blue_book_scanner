Information Pertinent to Objects Sighted:
1. Shape: The shape of the objects sighted was reported as being round, "disc-like".
2. Size: No estimation of the size of the objects sighted was advanced by the observer due to his inability to determine accurately the size of the objects.
3. Color: The objects appeared to be a dull orange color, comparable to the glow of heated metal.
4. Number: Three (3).
5. Trail or exhaust: None observed.
6. Propulsion system: None observed.
7. Speed: No estimation of speed was made by the observer due to lack of knowledge concerning the size of the objects. However, the observer stated the speed to have been very fast.
8. Sounds: No sounds were detected.
9. Maneuvers: Erratic line formation, flying straight across the sky. See sketch.
10. Manner of Disappearance: The objects disappeared rapidly (in a matter of a few seconds) in sight of the observer. The objects appeared to change formation or alter their pattern and then seemed to accelerate rapidly and disappear from view.
