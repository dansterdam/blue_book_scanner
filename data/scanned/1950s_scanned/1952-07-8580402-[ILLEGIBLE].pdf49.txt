10. 25 June 1952, Japan/Korea area.
This is not a single report but a collection of 13 similar reports which occurred in 1951 and 1952. No adequate explanation has been given by the radar expert for any of them and therefore I can as any judgement as to their cause. This is one strictly for the radar experts.

11. 22 July 1952, Maxwell, Texas.
Evaluation as possible meteor is not tenable if object was seen to climb from 8,000 feet to 14,000 feet, then to hover, then to drop at an angle of 45 degrees, continue hovering, and fly around an area of 100 feet. This does not appear to fit the pattern of a meteor. There were clearly indications which should have been followed up in this identification: insufficient follow-up, or insufficient information.

12. 22 July 1952, Uvalde, Texas.
This is an interesting case, with two witnesses. Chief witness was the weather observer for Trans-Texas Airlines, who was thoroughly familiar with all planes, weather balloons, etc. Object covered an arc of approximately 100 degrees in 4-5 seconds, had no visible aerodynamic features, and a bright illumination. It climbed vertically very rapidly every second and moved from in front of a cumulus cloud to 1 back of it, then giving some estimate of 6 distance. Object observed in broad daylight. It is too bad that this one was not much more thoroughly investigated than it appears two adult witnesses and one 14-year old witness. Rated it as 92 67.

13. 24 July 1952, Carson Sink, Nevada.
Sighting just three to four seconds in duration, too short a time to make any definite observations. Case must be carried as unidentified.

14. 28 December 1953, Marysville, California.
A one-witness case. Even though observed by a fairly qualified witness it is very strange that there were no other witnesses since incident took place in a populated area.
