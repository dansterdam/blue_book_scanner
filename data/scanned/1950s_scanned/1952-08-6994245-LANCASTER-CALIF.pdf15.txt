2. A sheriff's patrol at 2237PST on 1 August 1952 observed two flying saucers, one remaining stationary over Lancaster, California and one over Leona Valley, California, hovering, stationary, at times, and moving slowly along the horizon, then accelerating out of sight to the south. This Leona Valley object appeared to be about the same luminous degree and the same dimension and visibility below the horizon. Sheriffs of both places compared notes. Records revealed by the two officers red light 25 mils north of Lancaster between 2206PST and 2207PST. One of the witnesses in the Palmdale sighting spent six years in the Navy as a pilot and stated that the sighting could have been a jet plane; however, he could see no normal identification lights.

Weather in the area at the time of sighting was clear. Visibility 15 miles, winds aloft 10,300 feet from 130° at 13 knots, 20,000 feet from 200° at 17 knots, 30,000 feet from 250° at 18 knots.

3. Witnesses: Mr. William D. Mellotte, Sheriff's office, Palmdale, California
                    Mr. H. D. Martinetti, Sheriff's office, Palmdale, California

Flight Air traffic in the area at the time of sighting was one KevIon westbound over Palmdale at 2315PST and one C-46 eastbound over Palmdale at 2236PST.

Comments of Reporting Officers

5. Sheriff Mellotte's six years experience as a Navy pilot should adequately quality him for making accurate aerial observations. Witnesses were not interrogated as interseption action was taken by the 27th Air Defense Command Division and no object sightings were reported from radar sites.
