The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

fairly precise formation. The first frame, no.4, was not plotted because of extreme blurring, but frames 5, 7 and 8 were plotted as Charts I, II and III respectively. Chart IV is a composite of Charts I, II and III. In it the spots from the previous charts, that appear relatively fixed in the formation, are shown as heavy black ink spots. The relatively moving spots are shown in light pencil--the first position of these shifting spots is light red, as in Chart I; the second position, spaced between the heavy spots, is in black pencil, as from Chart II; and the final position is shown in light green.

5. According to the microscopic examinations, spot brightness range could be expressed as weak, average, and bright, corresponding to faint, average, or heavy spot densities. The faint spots in the moving row are underscored, while the bright spots are circled. Only those spots in the fixed row that are alike in all three negatives are indicated in the same way.

6. There is the appearance of two extra spots, outside the regular rows. One spot is to the lower right in all three charts, while the spot shows only faintly in the nor'negative and was missed in plotting Chart III. It appears in position at the left end of the moving row in Chart III.
