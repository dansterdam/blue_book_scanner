Therefore, we would like to discuss the above and other reports we have received with you in person. We have discussed this on several occasions with the Air Technical Intelligence Center in the past future, at which time we would like to discuss how we might best aid you in such a way as to serve your best interests. I am confident Mr. Chorwon will be impressed with the work I have done. 

If you are in doubt as to the reliability of this matter, please bear in mind that I am a student at the University of Pennsylvania this fall on a 4 year full-tuition Alumni Scholarship.

May I extend my best wishes for success in your research.
Very truly yours,
