Dear Sirs,

I am forwarding a letter to you: office reports on the P.O. Sighting which I had sent to Dr. Edward U. Condon at the University of Colorado. They returned my letter with a note stating that the original office where this was closed out no further action was required, and felt the matter was satisfactorily covered in the information report on the incident.

I hope that you will excuse me for not returning this to you first, but I didn't know who to send it to, and it became a little embarrassing after reading the conclusion of Mr. Condon's report on this page.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
