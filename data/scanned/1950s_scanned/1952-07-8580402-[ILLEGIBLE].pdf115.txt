The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch of an overhead view of the horizon. The sketch shows the position of an object when it was first seen (labeled "A") and when it was last seen (labeled "B"). The text instructs the viewer to draw a picture that shows the motion of the object, placing an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end. The text also describes the object's observed movements, stating that it was spotted approximately 60 degrees above the north-northwest horizon, moving slowly in a generally northward direction at an elevation of 10-15 degrees, and then disappearing beyond the north-northwest horizon.

Text extracted from the document:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.
I had noticed the object about 60 degree above the north-northwest horizon. It moved slowly in a generally northward direction at an elevation of 10-15 degrees and then disappeared beyond the north-northwest horizon.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
(The object showed a rather carrier-like configuration with dimensions that appeared to be roughly 50 feet long and 15 feet wide. It seemed to have fuzzy or hazy parameters - not a sharply defined object. It appeared to have a definite glow or luminosity - not merely reflecting light, but emitting it. This was not merely a point of light, but an extended, three-dimensional shape.)
