The radar returns recorded during this period were in a position very
close to a gap-filler antenna located on a mountain at the 8000' level.
No interceptor or other search aircraft received either radar returns or
the airborne radar or made visual contact with the UFO.
3. Since 24 Sept 59, several instances have been observed wherein non-
moving radar returns appeared in the same location as those on 24 Sept 59.
No specific UFO report was made by the 827th ACWRON.
sent a wire to Secretary Dudley Sharp stating that the
object sighted in Oregon on 24 Sept 59, was a space ship powered electro-
magnetically. Mr. stated that this ship made fools of the aircraft
which were scrambled to intercept, and he requested that Secretary Sharp
get the military in line. Major (NICAP) also sent correspondence
to Secretary Sharp; Major having learned of the above described
radar sighting erroneously connected this with the visual sighting on
the same day. This letter also suggests that Secretary got the
military in line. The correspondence from both Mr. and Major
intimate that the Air Force has the true answer to this sighting, but is
not revealing the information.
5. The information provided ATIC concerning the visual sighting 24 Sept 59,
is insufficient for a positive conclusion. The object, if the same object
were seen for one hour and 19 minutes, could possibly have been a balloon.
There is also the possibility, since the object was seen off and on during
the period of the sighting, that the first object seen was a refraction of
the star Canopus, with the interceptors and other aircraft themselves being
responsible for the subsequent sightings. This case is carried as insuffi-
cient evidence in the ATIC files.
