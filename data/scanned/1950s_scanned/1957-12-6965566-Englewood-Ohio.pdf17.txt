ALLEGED UFO
Montebello, Calif
1 December 1957

1. Looks like two pairs of balloons.
2. Move in unison - keep same distance.
3. Film too short and slightly out-of-focus and over-exposed.
4. Because of three (3) above, with very limited data (no exact azimuths, bearings, directions, elevations, etc.) very difficult to make a sound.
5. Review of letter, with the "chips on his shoulder" attitude, plus the obvious attempt to make a "big project" out of 5 seconds of film - strongly suggest that he knew what the objects were. Can't prove it though.
6. Enlarged to motion-picture screen size: Reviewed by Lt. Col Whither, Sgt. Bolieu, and Capt. Gregory in UFO Project Room.
