The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, likely containing textual information and data related to a UFO sighting.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

15 NOV 56 09 37 34/ ACTION CONCR EXES ADT COMDT OPERS COMT HAT ADV CON STAY REPORTS IG 01.35

The text on the document includes information such as the date (15 NOV 56), time (09 37 34), and various abbreviations and codes likely used in the reporting and processing of the UFO sighting.
