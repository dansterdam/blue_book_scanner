The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically Case 173 from Gary, Indiana on July 14, 1956. The text describes the reported sighting of a "brilliant stranger" in the sky that was "visible for infinite number of minutes". Several substantial citizens of Gary saw it and described it as being as big as a full moon and having a bright white light in the center. The document states that the director, Dan Shannonoff, was notified, and he told the witness to lock the sighting. The text also mentions that the Air Defense Command was also informed about the sighting.
