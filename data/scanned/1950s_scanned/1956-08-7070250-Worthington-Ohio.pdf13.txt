LETTER 30 CASE INFORMATION SHEET

Letter received by Dr. Rynex from Duluth, Minn.
24 hand report of observation in 1956 or 1957.

Dear Mr. _____,

This letter is in answer to your inquiry about the experience I had saw years ago on a sighting. The history on flying saucers in the United States on this subject became quite well known.

On or about August 20, 1956 or '57 (it is hard to pinpoint the exact date) I received a phone call from a newspaper reporter. He said he had received a report from a little Ohio town called Worthington stating that a family had seen a large flying object at about 2100 the night before. This object was described as being of enormous size, oval in shape, and a glowing white with many lights around its sides. As it passed over, it seemed so close that the observer said he could see what appeared to be massive observation windows on the object's surface. They estimated the object to be approximately 100 feet in diameter while I considered it to be a case of a so-called flying saucer image. The newspaper reporter from Columbus representing the Columbus Dispatch asked me, having a background in astronomy, to come out and examine the scene, to see if I could throw any light on the subject. 

Not being enthusiastic, as I had been plagued with calls of this sort in the past, nevertheless, I agreed to go. When I arrived, the family related their experience in detail. They stated that the object appeared suddenly from the north, hovered almost directly overhead for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, made an extremely sharp angular turn, and then disappeared rapidly in the distance. I must admit, so was I. The object appeared to be about the size of a 5-story house and about half-block long. I stepped off the distance involved and we both watched it perform what seemed to be absolute impossible maneuvers. The object flew off in a tremendous speed - so fast that it literally vanished from sight. I told the family that I could not explain what they had seen, and that I agreed it was a strange and unusual occurrence, for which I had no logical explanation. Since there are no known craft of such dimensions and maneuverability, the event must remain a mystery. I advised the family that I would report the incident to the Air Force and recommend an immediate investigation. 

Within a day or two, a Captain and a Major from Wright-Patterson AFB arrived, interviewed the family, examined the scene, and obtained all the details. When they left, they stated that an official report would be filed at Project Blue Book, and that the Air Force would give the matter serious consideration. What ever became of their final conclusions, I never did find out. Since the event, I have personally received several letters from private citizens inquiring about the case, but I have no additional information to provide. I can only state that the object was of enormous size, performed maneuvers which defied explanation, and left me and the family who observed it completely baffled. I am certainly like to find one for logical explanation.

Sincerely,
