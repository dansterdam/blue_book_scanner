COMMENTS (Use reverse, if necessary)
1. Reference D/I-ATIG conference, 5 March 1957, on this UFO program, regarding the procedures to be followed in the future. UFO correspondence of a potentially dangerous or controversial nature, publicity-wise, should be reviewed by the Director, preferably the Office of Information Services.
2. The original film and detailed data to this organization are not permitted to be released until more than two weeks after the date of the request. It is requested that you refer any persons requesting the film and information on the recent Edwards AFB incident to this Office, since the photos and UFO reports are not permitted to be released until more than two weeks after the date of the request.
The original film is in repository with the UFO files. Any decision to release the film and detailed data to this organization must come from higher levels. In our opinion, any exception made in favor of one individual or organization will undoubtedly result in a flood of requests from the others. The requested reply was drafted with this in mind.
