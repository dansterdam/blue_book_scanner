Dear Sirs:

I am writing to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object which I observed on the evening of July 9, 1952.

At about 8:30 p.m. I was driving in my car west on Highway 110, approximately 5 miles west of Fremont, Wisconsin. I first noticed a bright light in the sky to the southwest of my position. At first I thought it was an aircraft, but as I watched I noticed that it was maneuvering in an unusual manner. 

The object appeared to be circular in shape and was giving off a brilliant white light. It moved rapidly in a zig-zag or erratic manner for approximately 5-10 minutes. At one point it appeared to hover motionless, then it suddenly accelerated and shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.

I was so intrigued by this sighting that I immediately pulled my car over to the side of the road to get a better look. I watched the object carefully through the windshield of my car. The maneuvering of the object was quite unlike anything I have ever seen before in relation to conventional aircraft. I am a licensed pilot and have a fairly extensive knowledge of aircraft in general, and I can state with certainty that this was no conventional airplane or helicopter.

These aspects were in view for approximately 5-10 minutes before the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. I hope this information is useful to your investigation. Please let me know if you require any additional details.

Sincerely,
