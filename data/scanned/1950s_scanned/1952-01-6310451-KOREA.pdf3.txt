    Comments by 98 Bomb 'Jing Inttlligence Officer:

 
Because of the unusual nature of this sighting as well ns the similar one reported above special effort Yns a1nde to elLLUnate all possible kno\lTl alternatives concerning the possibili t;l that this could have been a r1exiglass reflection. It is to be noted that two different crew members spotted the object from different positions at the same time. In regard to flek, flares, and rockets, crew members indicated then- fimO.iari ty with such objects. 
In all cases crew members were veterans of WW II combat cre1m1en, and had had several bonlbii missions in Korea. They stated very emphatically that the sightings noted above bore no resemblance vhatsoever to anything they had previously experienced; The possibility that such storios had been rorrlicated is believed to be obviated by the fact that the crews involved, from different squadronn, flew on different missions and were intorro6ated at widely separato tines (1 hour). In conclusion it is the opinion of thio officer that thooe sightings represent another example of new techniques flnd warfare under test by the enen,y.

Comlllent by D/I, FEAF Bomber Command:

It is assumed that there is still a real possibility t.'iat these phenomena m&y very well indicate the presence of new enemy flare devices, desp:i_te the unit intelligence officer's feelings that such possibilities are ruled out. Aside from that, it is worth rlentioning that the 98ttJing Co LI11Bnder v1as present during the i11terrogation, and warned the crov members as to their responsibilities in reporting such observations. Special report of unidentified flying objects vill be subnitted.
 
Vie, of utterlack of simil!'Jr observations in the past and no firm indications on which to base evaluation requests your comments in regard to above.
