The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and "B" marked on it, representing how high the object was above the horizon when the witness first saw it and how high the object was above the horizon when the witness saw it later. The second and third sketches show larger landscapes, with the second sketch depicting a road and buildings, and the third sketch showing a curving road leading to mountains in the distance.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was in when you first saw it, and a "B" or its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
