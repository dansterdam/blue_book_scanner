METEORS

The Hydragraphic Office is cooperating with astronomers in studying meteors. Determinations of their number, size, color, time of appearance and disappearance are essential as clues to their orbits, and relationship to the earth's atmosphere. Complete data regarding their direction of drift are of special importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.
