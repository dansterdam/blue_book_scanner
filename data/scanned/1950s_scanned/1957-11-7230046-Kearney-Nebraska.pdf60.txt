SUPERMAN--DOES HE REALLY EXIST?

of time. What of the inter-relations of the Federations and the awful gulfs of space between them? Do they, can they operate and communicate over such distances? 

This seems impossible to our minds. Our scientists say that no vehicle could ever quite reach or exceed the speed of light. This observation may be valid to fit the facts as we have them established, but it is also made on the concept that light is "constant" in its own right. It has not allowed for the application of "intelligence" to a naturally oc- curring force. Despite any evidence we may have to the contrary, it is certain that a powered vehicle can and has traveledÂ· many times the speed of light.

The cosmic men seem to be much interested in us and our first at- tempts to establish space travel, as their presence around our research centers indicate. The fact that they have been visiting this solar system for centuries without making contact indicates highly complex operations involving a powerful and exact science far beyond our scope of knowledge.

At present the men of Earth are not prepared for a meeting of the minds with the cosmic men. Nor will we be when we walk on the outermost planet of our solar system. But when our first inter-stellar ship heads for the stars, we can be certain they will be knocking on our cabin door.
