This image does not contain any photographs. It consists of two sketches or illustrations.

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above it. The instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show the position when you last saw it.

The second sketch contains two larger illustrations. The one on the left shows a person standing on a road or path with surrounding landscape. The one on the right shows a simplified landscape with a horizon line. The instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it, referring to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
