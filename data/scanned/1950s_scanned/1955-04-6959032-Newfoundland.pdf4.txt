HISTORY PLOT THIS 1120.15 OF, AN END OF STATE UNIT OF FOLLOWING TO BE CALLED TO ATTENTION

FOR LIEUTENANT COLONEL GIBBONS GAF 4302 POST CLASSIFICATION GUARD FLIGHT COMMANDER, 95TH AIR BASE GROUP, GANDER AIR FORCE BASE

WHILE ON A ROUTINE FLIGHT AN OBJECT WAS SIGHTED OVER THE CITY OF GANDER, NEWFOUNDLAND AT APPROXIMATELY 1950 HOURS ON 6 APRIL 1955. THIS OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BY PILOT AND CREW.

PILOT FIRST DETECTED THE OBJECT ON HIS RADAR AT APPROXIMATELY 30,000 FEET OVER THE CITY OF GANDER. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO MAKE A VISUAL OBSERVATION OF THE OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE METALLIC IN COLOR AND CIRCULAR IN SHAPE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE OSCILLATING SLIGHTLY AND TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. PILOT ESTIMATED THE SPEED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 1,000 MILES PER HOUR.

AT APPROXIMATELY 1952 HOURS THE PILOT CALLED GANDER CONTROL TOWER TO REPORT HIS SIGHTING. HIS REPORT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AND HE WAS THEN INSTRUCTED TO CLOSE ON THE OBJECT AND ATTEMPT TO MAKE VISUAL CONTACT. 

AS THE PILOT CLOSED ON THE OBJECT IT APPEARED TO PULL AWAY AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE PILOT THEN DISCONTINUED HIS PURSUIT AS HE WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN VISUAL OR RADAR CONTACT. 

THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY A TOTAL OF FOUR WITNESSES INCLUDING THE PILOT AND CREW. THEY ALL DESCRIBED IT AS BEING METALLIC IN APPEARANCE, CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, AND TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEY ALSO STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE OSCILLATING SLIGHTLY DURING ITS FLIGHT.

ATTACHED ARE COPIES OF ALL PERTINENT RECORDS RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT. THE AIR FORCE CONSIDERS THIS TO BE A GENUINE UFO SIGHTING AND NOT AN ASTRONOMICAL OR METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENON. ALL ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY OR CLASSIFY THIS OBJECT HAVE PROVED NEGATIVE. THIS SIGHTING CANNOT BE REASONABLY EXPLAINED BY ANY CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION OR AERIAL VEHICLE KNOWN TO BE IN OPERATION AT THAT TIME.
