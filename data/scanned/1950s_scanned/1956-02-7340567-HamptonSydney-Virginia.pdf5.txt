SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A check was made with the U.S. Weather Bureau at Byrd Field, Richmond, Va. to determine whether there was any weather balloon launched at the time of the sighting. Records indicate no balloon was launched at Byrd Field (3 seconds duration) of brightening into the vicinity of Hampton-Sydney, Va. on the date and time of the UFO sighting.

2. A check with the GGC Filter Center, Richmond, Virginia revealed that this agency had recognized no significant disturbances to the 7975th ACAW Radar at Camp Peary, Va. No other reports on the object other than the original report from observers were obtained.
3. The 6478th ACAW, Manassas, Virginia, was called by telephone for any information which might be available on the sighting. This installation was unable to offer any evidence to support the sighting.
4. Stated for comparison are the drops, however, additional information as to exact location or altitude of dropped objects was not readily available from the original sighting data. However, the object in Richmond, Va. (CODES UNSEEN) appeared to be at a much higher altitude than the reported UFO sighting.
5. As a result, no further information could be obtained to substantiate the radar data recorded at the approximate time of the sighting.
