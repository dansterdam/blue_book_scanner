TDEIT/MAJ H QUINTANILLA, JR./09/16/66/9/mfb/27 Oct 66
UFO Sighting, 27 February 1958
HQ USAF (SAFOI CC)
Reference the attached letter from 27 February 1958. The following is a suggested reply:
A. Dear Mr. _____,
There have been many accusations made against the Air Force concerning our alleged official stand that "there just ain't no such thing." Our official stand is that there has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that would identify confirmed as unidentified as established as.
If you had reported your observation to the Air Force, our analysts and evaluators would have attempted to determine what you had observed. They would have endeavored to find a logical answer. Then your case would have been categorized as unidentified. The Air Force would not have made your name available to the press without your permission.
It would be extremely difficult at this late date to perform a comprehensive investigation of your observation. It will be filed with our 1957 cases for information purposes; however, it will not be considered a case. There were no UFO reports submitted to the Air Force for 27 February 1958.
FOR THE COMMANDER
LOUIS DE GOES, Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Technology and Systems
