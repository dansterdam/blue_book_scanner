OCR OUTPUT:

On the night of Tuesday, 28 October 1952, I was pilot of an Air Force F-51. I was on a routine night training mission at approximately 10,000 feet MSL. Over Paoli, Oklahoma, I observed a bright light which appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated at 1,750 hours, or approximately 23 hours after sunset. The light descended rapidly and was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes. The object appeared to be oval or cigar-shaped, estimated to be 1,000 to 1,500 feet in altitude. 
According to my knowledge, I reported the following observations to be true and correct: 
1. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed. 
2. The object descended rapidly.
3. The object was oval or cigar-shaped. 
4. The altitude of object was 1,000 to 1,500 feet.
5. The object appeared to illuminate the ground area in the vicinity of the object.
The object descended into numerous bright fragments. I do not believe this was an astronomical phenomena, but an unknown aerial object that appeared over the Paoli, Oklahoma, area.
