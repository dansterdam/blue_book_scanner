```
HOURS LATER SHOW THE OBJECT FURTHER
TO THE EAST BY APPROXIMATELY
50 NAUTICAL MILES. THIS INFLATION
AND THE REPORTED WIND VELOCITY OF 
APPROXIMATELY 40 K AND TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST TEND TO SUBSTANTIATE THE
BALLOON CONCLUSION.

THE ATIC CONCLUSION IS THAT
THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS 
PROBABLY A BALLOON.
