WOMEN SEE MISSILE:
SHAPED LIKE A CIGAR
An object described as resembling a "missile shaped like a cigar" was observed over Willoughby, Ohio on Thursday 10 December 1963 between 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm. Mrs. Donald C. Somers, a local housewife, said there was a loud sound like a clap of thunder, and trailing like the usual sonic boom. The object was in the area for about 10 minutes. It was moving at high speed, first southwest, then northbound. The object banked and straightened up and disappeared, leaving a trail of strange-like flames.
