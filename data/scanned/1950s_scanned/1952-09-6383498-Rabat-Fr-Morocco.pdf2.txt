On 22 September 1952, at around 21:15 hours, a luminous disk of a diameter close to that of the setting sun, 17 kilometers from Tangier, saw toward the south. A luminous trail followed it for about 12 seconds; the disk, which looked like a brightly illuminated metallic object, suddenly emitted two great streaks of flames and disappeared.
At 1820 hours, a strange object was also seen in the sky over Fes, French Morocco, flying at high speed from east to west and leaving behind a luminous white trail.
