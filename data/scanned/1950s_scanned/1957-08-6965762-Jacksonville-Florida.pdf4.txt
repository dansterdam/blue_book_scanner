The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text in the document reads:

Dear

Your interest in telling us of the sighting you witnessed in 1957 is appreciated.
