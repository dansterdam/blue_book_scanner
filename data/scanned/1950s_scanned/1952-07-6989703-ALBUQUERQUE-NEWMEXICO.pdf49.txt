Alley objects. One could not watch constantly because of the sun. I could not see which way they were going or the speed of their movement because I could not keep watching as my eyes would not stay.

was informed that several citizens sighted strange objects in the air at approximately 1415 MST, as they were rising vertically. A man stated that he saw 6 or 7 round objects silver in color, ascending and was unable to account for them. He said they were sighted to the southwest and appeared to be about 1,000 feet in the air. The objects stopped and hovered, then climbed rapidly out of sight.

I, Mrs. [ redacted ], was at home eight miles from the Grant Falls AFB when my husband, who was on duty at the Base, called me to tell me to look for strange objects in the sky. I went outside and looked to the north and saw five bright objects in the sky which appeared to be about 10,000 feet in the air and moving very rapidly. They were oblong in shape and silver in color. A sixteen year old boy was with me and he can confirm this statement as to the color and behavior of the objects.

The last two were traveling north to south in the western part of the sky. They seemed to be a vapor-trail them and behaved like jet airplanes. Due to the brightness of the sun, I was unable to get a clear view in the binoculars. All three seemed to disappear just I managed to travel out of sight.
