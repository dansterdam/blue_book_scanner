UFO Rept
Mrs. C., aged 30 or so, informed that she observed an object in the air of a bright reddish-purple color and about the size of a golf ball. It remained stationary for a few minutes, then began moving off to the northeast. After some 30 to 40 seconds, it simply disappeared and vanished from sight. It was cloudy and she had a good clear view of this object. No sound was heard. I had a talk with this woman, and she impressed me as being sincere and reporting accurately what she saw. She could give no explanation for what she observed.
