There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text.

The text in the document says:

AFTERNOON SIGHTING:
MANY BUGS WERE OBSERVED FLYING OUT OF THE SUN. THESE BUGS APPEARED ROUND AND RE-ENTERED THE SUNLIGHT.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE BUGS AT A DISTANCE MAY HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA.
