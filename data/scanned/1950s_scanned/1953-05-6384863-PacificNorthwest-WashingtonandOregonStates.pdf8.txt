3. Coast Guard Radars operation at Westport, Washington reported receiving primary targets on 500 ft. chart at 2330 and 2345 which were unidentified. These could not be identified and may have been related to the balloon move.

SECTION IV DISCUSSION
1. A study of the alingment of plots provided by station P-57 on these tracks and the report from personnel at the station that the blips looked unusual led to the conclusion that the blips/plots were caused by some considerable distance from the radar station. Considering that the sea was running in a direction that would result in the tracking of sea returns, the conclusion was that a target a considerable distance from the station was being tracked and that the four returns plotting to the ground station would be a false return and a range of targets beyond the radar station would be obtained.
