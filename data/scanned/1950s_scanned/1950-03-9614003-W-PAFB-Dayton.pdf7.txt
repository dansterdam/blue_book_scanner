Text from the document:

"At approximately 11:30 A.M. 9 March 1950, Mr. J. James and the writer were informed that unidentified signals of very large amplitude were being received on the SCR-584 in Area B. It was also indicated that celestial bodies were observed earlier in the day. Mr. James and the writer proceeded to the radar site in order to observe the signals and suggested that, inasmuch as the signals were undoubtedly weather conditions, it would be advisable to obtain confirmation from an F-80 weather reconnaissance aircraft. An F-80 aircraft was dispatched to the area and reported back that strips of ice laden clouds running northwest to southeast were visible at approximately 30,000 ft. This information concurred with data obtained by the radar forming conclusive evidence that the ice laden clouds were the cause of the reflections from the ice laden clouds.

"It is believed that the visible sightings may have been due to the early morning sun shining through the ice laden clouds causing an optical illusion."
