The image does not contain any photographs, it consists of two tables. The first table is an "AERODROMES - DETROIT SECTIONAL CHART" which lists the name, location, elevation, type, etc. of various aerodromes or airports. The second table is an "AIR DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONES" which describes the air defense identification zones designated in the United States and Canada.

AIR DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONES

In the United States several areas have been designated as Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ) by the air force for positive control of air traffic. ADIZ's exist along both coasts, in the Great Lakes area, within the Northwest, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Albuquerque - Knoxville control areas. Any aircraft flying into these ADIZ's must file a plan and maintain radio contact with the controlling agency. The ADIZ's are in San Francisco ADIZ, Los Angeles ADIZ, Seattle ADIZ, and Albuquerque ADIZ. 
Similar Air Defense Identification Zones (CADIZ) have been designated by the Director of Air Transport, Canada, for the defense of the Canadian homeland. The Canadian ADIZ's are delineated on the face of aeronautical charts and are so labeled. They are also indicated on the face of aeronautical charts and are so labeled.
