STATEMENT OF G. D. SMITH

UNCLASSIFIED

While working on the MP-8 my crew noticed several planes laying vapor trails or smoke screens. While trying to discern which of the two it was, smoke screens or vapor from engines, one of the fellows said "Look at the stars." So looking directly overhead I saw what appeared to be a large star. By adjusting along a fixed object I determined that it was moving slightly, perhaps to the west or south west. 

As I watched it intently for approximately 5 minutes, it progressed at the same slow rate of speed, then as I watched it seemed to revolve or wobble so that I lost sight completely, still not having moved hardly at all.

I did not witness the object which moved out of sight as rapidly as it was witnessed by me. There must have been the two of them, the same azimuth.
