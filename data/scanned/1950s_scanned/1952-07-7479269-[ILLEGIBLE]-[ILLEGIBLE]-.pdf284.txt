STATEMENT OF: Donald R. Hartlauer

I was inside our assigned radar van listening to the comments of some of the other students who were watching a glowing object in the sky. Benn Bush comments that he could see a star shining over his hand. This aroused my curiosity to go out and see it. As we watched this gleaming object, we perceived a slight southeasterly movement of it. I took my eyes off it for a moment and looked again as Bush said that it's taking off. It was no longer where I had previously seen it and I was unable to pick it up again visually as Bush traced it's rapid path southward to the horizon.

Approximately 13 minutes later we estimated the time that we'd first seen the object to be 8:40 by my watch.

I continued watching the sky for other objects and it was at 9:07.5 that I spotted another identical-looking object moving swiftly from the time I'd first spotted it to the South. This one was perhaps a little lower than the first. I traced it from overhead nearly to the horizon created by a semi-building, with a rolled-up sheet of paper to the horizon due east before it vanished. It was indistinct able to my eyes.

Estimation of altitude or speed is too difficult to judge without an idea of the size of the objects.

This second object appeared to wobble very gracefully at the same time it sped forward - similar to a paper plate in a strong wind, though it could extend or diminish its forward movement. The wobbling effect was manifest on the shining surface. It would become darker on one side and then different on the other once in a while.

At 9:15, by my watch, I followed a third similar shining object which followed the same general, or possibly identical path, southward as the first two.
