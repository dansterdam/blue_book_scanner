(2) LOCATION: Goose AFB, Labrador, Canada.

(3) DETAILS: The object was first observed to the south at an elevation of approximately 30 degrees. It remained stationary for approximately five (5) minutes, then began moving in a northerly direction at a tremendous rate of speed. The object appeared to be round in shape, luminous in nature, and approximately twice the size of a B-29 aircraft at the same distance. The object was observed by four (4) enlisted men for a total of approximately ten (10) minutes.
