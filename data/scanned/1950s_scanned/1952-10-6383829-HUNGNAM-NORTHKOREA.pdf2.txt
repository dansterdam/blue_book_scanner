AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Subject: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object
Location: Ko-Eun-Ri Area, Hung-Nam, North Korea
Date: 17 October 1952
Observer: Technical Sergeant Kenneth E. Porges, USAF, Co-pilot, Martin Air Grp 23
SUMMARY: Information on a certain observed aerial object by the co-pilot of a Martin bomber on a mission over North Korea. The object was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes as it maneuvered at a high rate of speed at an altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet. The object had a circular shape and no visible means of propulsion. The aircraft and crew were not affected by the object's presence. There were no unusual disturbances of the atmosphere noted.
AT's COMMENTS: The object as described exhibits characteristics traditionally associated with "flying saucers" or "unidentified flying objects." The sighting report is considered to be authentic and consistent with similar reports of this nature. However, the exact nature of the object remains undetermined.
