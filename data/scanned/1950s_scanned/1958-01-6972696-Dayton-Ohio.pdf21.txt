There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with a page number "19" printed at the top. The page contains handwritten text, but no visual image or photograph.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the output of the text found in the document:

This was the result of sighting code 1209 at Wright-Patt AFB on 27 Mar 59 this was typed for 19 or 8 reports not 9 reports
