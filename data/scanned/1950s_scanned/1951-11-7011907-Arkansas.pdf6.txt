SIGHTING PAN-HELL BEALE AT DURANGO, TEXAS,
NOVEMBER 12, 1952 ABOUT 3:30 PM.

I saw two objects at about 75째 elev. and 200째 azimuth. They were rapidly in an ESE direction, at a very great height. Both 

were the same size, not appearing metallic, or brilliantly defined, but of a fuzzy, misty, ragged-edged cloud-like appearance, elongated in color, roughly globular, without elevators, fuselage, wings, etc., or any characteristics of any aircraft or guided missiles. They moved over each other vertically every 3 or 4 seconds, holding the same shape and merged entities, always maintaining the same distance apart, held together by a point visible but not distinct. In view in full detail for the same cloud-like structure and color as the two objects. After remaining vertically for about 10 seconds, they moved off horizontally; after 15 or 20 sec., tilted up until vertically and disappeared. Happened 3 or 4 times with the wispy connecting band that was visible at all angles during the multiple motions. The motions were unlike anything seen - multiplicated exactly the same, a bar-bell being turned end-over-end vertically. when tilted clearly until rotating horizontally about 180째 elevation and at 95째 azimuth when forwarded motion stopped. Moved rather slowly in an irregular zigzag course; had no sound. The objects apparently still on a level course - the objective did not diminish in perspective or visibility as is always normal in viewing receding objects.
