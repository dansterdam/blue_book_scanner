There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a typed document, which appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

"REPORT SOME TWO WEEKS IN FALLOUT RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT LANGLEY AFB, VA.
Subsequent to the sighting of two or more spherical objects believed to be satellite or balloon trackers, operating at an altitude of about 100 feet over the base, the officer in charge of the flight was subsequently questioned. The object was found to be four and a quarter feet in diameter and was round in shape with a dull surface. Visual observation indicated that the object remained stationary for a period of time, and was then seen to move rapidly in a horizontal direction and disappear from view. The incident took place just at sunset, which probably accounts for the difficulty in obtaining clear photographs of the object as it was difficult to obtain adequate light. The incident was reported to higher headquarters in the usual manner."
