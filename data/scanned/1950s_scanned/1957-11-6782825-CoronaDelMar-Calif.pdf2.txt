Dear Sir:

Please refer this letter to the proper department, concerning inquiry into reports of UFO.

All pertinent information is in the story enclosed. In this week's issue of Newsweek, a photographic reproduction by certain newspadiermen, not given to hysteria or illusion, is not called to your attention, good sirs.

You have a perfectly normal and logical explanation of what I saw at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 12. If so, would you please inform The sketch below will give you an idea of the relative size of the object and direction of motion. There were no clouds nearby. The object was very clearly defined, not fuzzy and almist perfectly straight.

It's about a half moon.
