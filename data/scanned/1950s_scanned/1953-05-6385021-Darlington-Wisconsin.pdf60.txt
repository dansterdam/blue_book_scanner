U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and used as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may restate information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

The text in the handwritten portion reads:

"White luminous object sighted 9:25 P.M. May 31, 1953. Darlington Wis. Sighting duration 4 seconds. White object without body, just luminous cloud. Very bright, much brighter than the moon. Moved rapidly in a straight line, then made a sharp turn at a high angle to its original course. Then it began a curving descent and disappeared out of sight. There was no noise at any time and no trail was seen. The object definitely was not a conventional aircraft."
