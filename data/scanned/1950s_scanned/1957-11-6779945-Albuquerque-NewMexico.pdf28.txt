return to the spot with witnesses, as no one would believe him otherwise. He got to his car, got his wife, and went again to the spot where he had seen the object. He wanted to get his wife to see it also. But by that time the object was gone. he had seemed to get his wife however. He went home, and returned to the spot where he had seen the object but by that time the object was gone. Moore stated that the object was 50 feet in diameter, disc shaped, and about 15 feet thick, with a cone on the top, making it overall about 20 feet high. It was glowing a reddish color and the surface seemed to be metallic and like a mirror. The object was unusually bright, that night, and it was the moonlight that made it so, according to Moore. The object hung motionlessly for several minutes, and then took off silently at a terrific speed towards the southwest. Two county officials were notified of the sighting the following day. The field was subsequently searched and holes in the ground like those made by a heavy object landing were found. The Bernalillo County Civil Defense. returned to headquarters to get a geiger counter. When we reached the spot again, the geiger counter showed a higher reading at certain areas along the perimeter! Waiting a few hours, Locke and Reineck took another reading at the same points. The reading was only 10-20% lower, indicating the residual radiation had not dissipated appreciably. Since this indicated that the reaction on the geiger counter was not caused by natural background radiation, it was widely published at the time. The sketch below, however, is Moore's own original drawing, which he gave to me.
