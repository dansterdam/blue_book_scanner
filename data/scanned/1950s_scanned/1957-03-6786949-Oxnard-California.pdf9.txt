Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any photograph or image present in the provided document. The document appears to be a typed text report from Project Blue Book describing a UFO sighting incident that occurred on March 22-23, 1957 near Oxnard, California. The text details the sighting by an Air Force duty officer, the ground observer's report, and the conclusion that the sighting was "probably star Arcturus" despite the proximity of the object to the ground. The report also mentions the lack of radar contact and ground radar data during the incident.
