The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photographs. Instead, it seems to be a table or grid with a large number of entries or data points.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO
ATIC PROJECT BLUE BOOK CASE RESUME
PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
