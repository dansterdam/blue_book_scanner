The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed report or document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s.

Aircraft # 2603, a T-33, departed Kelly Air Force Base at 0043 hours. While in the air, the pilot and observer noticed an object in the sky which they were unable to identify. They were concerned over a sighted object in the vicinity and we notified a third person. They were concerned over a sighted object in the sky.

Randolph Tower mentioned something about flying saucers so we decided to investigate.

The object gave off a bright light and gave the appearance of rapid movement as we flew toward it. We climbed to an altitude of 13,500 feet at which point the object disappeared behind clouds. We climbed it to 18,500 feet at which point the navigator informed the object had disappeared.

Meanwhile, radar control joined with Randolph Tower in observation. We transmitted them our confirmation as to the point location of the object. However, their radar could not pick up the object. Based on their instructions, we flew intersections on the suspects but were unable to locate them as they had no more targets, so we returned to our routine mission.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
