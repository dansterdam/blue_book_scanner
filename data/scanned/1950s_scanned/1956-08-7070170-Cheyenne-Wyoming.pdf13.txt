Cheyenne, Wyoming, Central time on August
7, 1956. The object was observed being carried
along at a very high rate of speed, estimated
at 2000 miles per hour. The object appeared
to be circular in shape, about 30 feet in 
diameter, and giving off a reddish-orange glow.
It was observed for about 2 minutes and then
disappeared from view.

(11) Existence of physical evidence. There was no
physical evidence found at the scene of the
sighting, since the object was observed at a
high altitude and was not seen to come down
to the ground. No metallic or other material
was found that could be directly attributed to
the sighting.
