PAGE FOUR OF APRIL 26G

FIVE MILES NORTHWEST TO NORTH OF BALTIMORE PD THE EXISTING VISIBILITY 
AT THE TIME WAS POOR DUE TO A HAZE LAYER AND A SLIGHT MIST THOUGH 
OUT THE AREA THERE ARE THREE /3/ AIR WARS IN THIS AREA / TED 29- RED
33 RED 45 / AND TRAFFIC IS FAIRLY HEAVY ON ALL OF THEM PD IT IS MY 
OPION THAT THE SIGHTINGS WERE ACTUALLY PASSING AND NAVIGATIONAL LIG-
HTS OF NORMAL ROUTINE AIRWAYS TRAFFIC AND BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED
VISIBILITY WERE NOT READILY IDENTIFIED AS SUCH BY THE OBSERVER 
FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS DEEMED NECESSARY
WASHINGTON CAA ADVISE THEY WILL ATTEMPT TO CORRELATE AIRWAYS TRAFFIC
 / RED 29- RED 33 - RED 45 / FOR THE EXACT TIME THE OBJECTS WERE S
- IGHTED
