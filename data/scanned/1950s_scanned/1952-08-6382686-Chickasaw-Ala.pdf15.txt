STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN WILLIAM E. EDWARDS, AC 535 751 (Continued)
The illumination varied and changed from blueish green to a red, nearly the color of exhaust flames and glowing red of exhaust stacks as noted by persons familiar with aircraft flying at night.
My first impression was an aircraft approaching, however, G.C.A. could not observe any aircraft within its scope or any movement.
At the time of observation there was some cloud cover and the undersigned could not observe the Bates Field beacon which is approximately 11 miles distant.
