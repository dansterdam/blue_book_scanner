There is no photograph present in the provided image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text describing a UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

At 9:25 the object was beginning to float slowly upwards and move off to the south, over a trackless area of lake and forest. It had entered the clouds and was out of sight. The radio batteries were now tried again, and proved to work normally; the batteries had apparently not affected by the episode.
The four hunters bolted the cabin door and loaded all their guns before going to bed.
Before their return to New York, the party heard of three more UFO observations (details omitted). 
On Saturday the 5th, the hunters drove back to New York. Shortly before noon they passed through Plattsburgh, N.Y. Here they heard the local radio station reporting that a Plattsburgh citizen of the highest reputation had had his car stalled on the radio-radie highway, hovering directly overhead. According to the station's report, this one was "spaced out" differently from the others, but this one was reported to the same source. 
The four hunters stopped for lunch at Schroon Lake, 75 miles south of Plattsburgh. Had the croppers seen anything on the evening of the 5th? They certainly had: a metallic-looking sphere had hovered over five of ten minutes directly over their barracks, and had stopped cars in Schroon Lake. The croppers had also talked to jet pilots from Plattsburgh (as in Shambrige) and been shown up about the objects on that day, who, with them - "we don't mind chasing bombers or fighters," if they had said, "but we don't like to chase these damn saucers, because we don't know what they can do."
Mr. Jacobsen's mother told us that when he returned home, he was "shaken."
As far as the Los Alamos is concerned, such a possibility is totally out of the question. The veracity of Mr. Jacobsen is beyond doubt.
