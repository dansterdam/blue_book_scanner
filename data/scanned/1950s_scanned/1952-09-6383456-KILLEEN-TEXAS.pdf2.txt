At approximately 0430 hours on 17 September 1952, Cpl Harold N. Blair, FA 
1C 5 378, Military Police Company, 8156th AUD, Killam Base, Killeen, Tea 
observed a flying saucer type object fly over post 33 where he was sentry on 
duty.

Blair gave the following information during an interview with the under
signed: Daylight had not started to break as yet, and Blair was looking sky 
ward observing the stars when he saw an object at approximately 1000 feet 
altitude fly directly over his head. The object was described as about 10 
across, and had a green fluorescent appearance across the front, and two (2) 
six foot red flames protruding from the rear. The object was observed for 
approximately 2 to 3 seconds at an estimated speed of 700 to 800 miles per 
hour, traveling generally towards the east. A peculiar sound, something like 
a model airplane engine, was heard. The object was travelling from Southwest 
to Northeast.

Blair has had no experience as an aircraft observer, or no experience 
in astronomy.

This drawing is a re-production of the sketch made by Blair.
