SUBJECT: (U) Request for Information - Hopkinsville Incident 21 August 1955

TO: Commander 
Campbell Air Force Base
ATTN: Intelligence Section

1. This Center requests any factual data, together with pertinent comments regarding an unusual incident reported to have taken place six miles east of Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on subject date. The incident involved an all-night attack on a family named Long by some creatures reported to have descended from a craft or hovering objects.

2. The Air Force has been informed by reliable sources that an article on this incident may soon appear in a magazine publication, and that the Air Force will be queried regarding its opinion or explanation.

3. Seeking factual, concerning data, no evidence can be given for this fantastic report as the incident has never been officially recorded in any permanent Air Force matter. However, two important factors prompt this request:

a. Previous experience with sensational articles of this type show that almost invariably a large number of inquiries and allegations against the Air Force soon follow, from both the press and public, and
b. An unidentified aerial object, engaged over the area and reported upon by two Air Force officers from Campbell Air Force Base, 
This Center; which is responsible for evaluating incidents of this nature under provisions of AFR 200-2 "Unidentified Aerial Objects," has indicated a need for such reports.

4. To assist you with respect to any inquiries or investigations, this request is forwarded, requesting any pertinent information, critique, and the Hopkinsville Police Department. The Chief of Police at Hopkinsville was a witness to this incident and is believed to still be on active duty.
