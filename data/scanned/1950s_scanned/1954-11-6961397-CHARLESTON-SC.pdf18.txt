AIR FORCE TO PROBE NEW "FLYING SAUCERS" OVER EUROPE

Air Force intelligence experts, scientific advisers and defense agencies will attempt to investigate reports of unidentified objects in European skies this year but in Europe are treating these flying saucer tales with a certain amount of skepticism.

European nations contacted say they have received no official requests from the United States for cooperation in studying the phenomena described as "flying saucers."

However, the Air Force's Office of Scientific Intelligence, which is charged with investigating these phenomena or frauds, disclosed that it plans to analyze data from abroad. It was explained that the Air Force is interested in this matter because of the effect it could have on national defense.

The official Air Force position is that while it has not been able to prove the existence of flying saucers, neither has it been able to disprove reports claiming their existence. The Air Force plans to analyze new data and determine whether a national security problem is involved. As in the past, the Air Force will not confirm or deny the existence of flying saucers, but will determine if any threat to defense exists.

The Air Force also says it will study reports of sightings from the public in an effort to determine if any of the unexplained phenomena might be of scientific interest. The Office of Scientific Intelligence, however, emphasizes that in many cases sightings of unusual objects in the sky may have natural or man-made explanations rather than representing genuine "flying saucers."

Some European nations contacted said they have had such sightings, but have made no official reports. The Air Force hopes to get cooperation from other nations in analyzing these reports.
