MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: (U) Balloon Identification - Recommendations 

1. Subject item was identified as an ATTIC star device. Efforts were made by pertinent agencies to identify if possible a balloon, as similar devices have been used in the past. It appears that it is identified as a device, such as it possesses a potential for intelligence information.

2. Inasmuch as it has been identified as a known object, it falls out of the UFO category and should be placed in the hands of pertinent specialists for further intelligence exploitation, if any.

3. Accordingly, to assist you in this matter the following are offered:

a. Have made arrangements with Mr. Arnold, 4E2 Equipment Specialists, to work with you in this respect.

b. Mr. ___ and this officer, previously worked on a balloon equipment project and you will find him very cooperative.  

c. Some of the intelligence requirements for information that may be considered in this matter would include origin, purpose, track of the balloon, possibly as a stream, or upper atmospheric data that may relate to the subject, etc.
