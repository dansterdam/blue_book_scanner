The image contains a photograph that appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. The page includes a star chart diagram labeled "symbols for stars in order of brightness" and a text section titled "Early Stars Were Brighter" that discusses how the brightness of stars has diminished over time.

Early Stars Were Brighter
A study of the atmospheres of the 8 stars leads astronomers to the conclusion that billions of years ago the stars were much brighter than they now are.
Test skies, there are several such signs, with much less brilliant stars than a few million years ago, are given by Dr. Ernest H. Walters and Dr. van Allen, both of the University of Utah. Their evidence convinces them that:
1. After billions of years, the brightness or apparent light output of the stars had diminished, so that the stars appear relatively much fainter now than they originally were when they were first formed.
2. The stars are believed, from various lines of evidence, to be about 5 billion years old. During the early life of the stars, they were producing large amounts of nuclear energy which manifested itself in greater brightness.
3. During the latter part of a star's lifetime, when the internal nuclear energy sources run low, the brightness of the star tends to diminish.
4. A study of the star Arcturus lll, which is about 30 million years old, shows that the brightness of Arcturus has diminished by about 7 percent in the last few billion years.
Astronomers have long held the general idea of stellar evolution, which includes the process of change in the appearance and characteristics of stars through the ages. The present study helps quantify this general idea and indicates that the stars were much more brilliant billions of years ago than they are now.
