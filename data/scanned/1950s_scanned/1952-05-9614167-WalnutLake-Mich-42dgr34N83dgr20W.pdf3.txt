AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT.
3510th CC Tng Wg, RAFB, Texas REPORT NO. TR-52
27 MAY 1952

C E R T I F I C A T E

I, Captain John S. Jones Jr. AO 414555, do certify that:

Sunday evening, 25 May 1952, I was sitting in the patio of my home on Randolph Air Force Base. There were two other people present, the three of us were discussing stars. At approximately 2130 local standard time, a group of lights, orange white in color, were seen to the west at an angular height of about fifteen (15) degrees above the horizon. These lights approached the east at an extremely rapid rate of speed. From the position I occupied, and as evidently I was able to see that they were of a teardrop shape, pointing toward the front or direction of travel, and twelve (12) in number. They were in three (3) groups of four (4); the three (3) groups formed a V. The sky was dark; no moonlight. Slow, and the lights were clearly visible. I judged the altitude of these lights to be about ten thousand (10,000) feet. Each light appeared to be an individual object. The only distinguishable sound was deep, soft, indistinct noise, similar to vroom. The size of the objects was not plain due to darkness, yet the apparent size of the lights was about one-eighth (1/8) of an inch in diameter. These twelve (12) objects crossed their formation across the sky and passed from view toward the south. The entire time taken by these objects to appear in the west, pass overhead, and disappear to the east was about three (3) seconds. The time it actually took them to pass, and really get up from seat and move less than fifteen (15) feet. Speed of objects is estimated to be in excess of two thousand miles an hour.
