"it seemed to hold disappear d a long object so that to was still a strong flighting.

It got accelerated _________ 15 miles an hour.

Went land, which it is the wind move against that thing. But before it could look up, it had gone.

I had a strange white mass about it as the mist was a bank or it hid what was inside, which moved so quite that we could see no details.

Those that the best vision describe the "thing".
