The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

(1) A person was located in a field under the area of the reported sighting, but lights were found installed on each corner of the field.
(2) Detailed line-of-sight plots from the source's observing point were made, between the source's observing point and the objects observed. The objects' movements and apparent size do not merit further mention. The results of interplay of light on the insulators is obvious.
(3) Directly in the line-of-sight, as pointed out by source, and beyond, the higher-ups on the project were a very cold student who expressed disbelief, suggesting the sighting was the result of testimony from a professional astronomer in a local educational institute.
(4) The sighting was observed through a window. Again, the appearance of the red lights on the barn, the brightness, the triangular shape of the lighted area, the shape of the wires and insulators require no further comment.
(5) It is interesting to note that the objects reported were observed over two hours, with apparently very little movement. Yet, no report of any unusual occurrence was received.

This report is typical of the many received by the Air Force, which upon investigation is identified as conventional objects of known phenomena. The source of the sighting cannot be publicly identified, but the report shows that no further investigation is deemed necessary.

On the basis of the above, any attempt to attribute sinister overtones or imply meanings from the sky in connection with this incident is, in our opinion, totally unwarranted and not supported by the facts. This incident, if promptly reported, is a fact not often known to the general public.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.
Sincerely,
