Unidentified aerial object sighted in western sky, from eastern portion of Cincinnati,
at 9:48 PM, Wednesday, August 13, 1952.

SITUATION:
Sitting on porch, alone, adjusting lounge chair. Looking up suddenly, sighted object soaring from huge treetop in the Northwest.

WEATHER:
Generally clear directly above point of vision. A slight vaporous haze in the South and extreme western portions. Humid.

DESCRIPTION:
size...
Strikingly large! An estimate: quarter size of a full moon.
shape...
Globular. Of clearly defined outline: posterior, the same, completely lacking in tapering effect, without luminescent, gaseous or scintillating trail. These were positive, clearly observed characteristics!
color...
Brilliant luminous white like “burning magnesium”, but not emitting a haze or scintilla. Near center of object was an inconstant dark or shaded portion with an observed tendency to flicker.
altitude...
Object approximately less than 5000 feet.
course...
Flying South in positive, direct course without traceable arc or trajectory.
speed...
Faster than jet plane, but appreciably slower than any previously observed meteor. Estimated, 1000 mph. Time lapse from point of vision to disappearance behind neighboring rooftop - 3 seconds.

OTHER CHARACTERISTICS:
No sound whatever. Object had an apparent spinning or whirling motion, but its course remained constant and stabilized, free of drag or wobble.

EVALUATION:
I am aware of, and, familiar with the popular Perseid meteor shower. I have observed countless meteors of this shower in years past (especially 1946), and, have observed numerous meteors this summer. None of these compares to the object cited in this report. During the same evening (Aug. 13) I sighted no other meteors from my point of vision. The clearly observed abnormal features of the object would not indicate a Perseid meteor.
