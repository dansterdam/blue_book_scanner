Enclosed herewith is an interesting report received by the CRIFO from Mr. Vinson R. Smiley, Covington, Kentucky, dated October 10, 1956. We wish to call your attention to the following facts:
1. Mr. Smiley employed as a night watchman at the Lunken Airport, Cincinnati, Ohio, states that he suddenly observed a brilliantly lighted object and then watched it as it made a controlled landing on the airport runway. The report contains many technical details regarding this sighting.
2. We have made a verification of this occurrence through the Assistant Manager of the Lunken Airport, who states that the report made by Mr. Smiley is factual and that several members of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society, including a renowned photo-scientist, have been notified and are planning to interview Mr. Smiley with the view of obtaining photographs and additional data.
3. In view of the technical nature of this report and the subsequent investigation being made, we are withholding the name of the photo-scientist referred to above, as he has not as yet given his approval for publicity regarding the photographs in his possession.
You may contact me for additional information regarding these photographs and the technical data which may subsequently be obtained.
The photographs were taken on Sunday, October 7, 1956.
On the same date CRIFO received three telex messages from Canada, indicating that Brilliant objects been observed near R.C.A.F. stations. These reports are as follows:
