Dear Mr. [redacted],

THIS IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR LETTER OF 6 FEBRUARY 1959 CONCERNING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT YOU SAW ON 23 JANUARY 1958 IN THE FORT WORTH, TEXAS AREA.

THE RECORDS OF THE U.S. HYRDROGRAPH TEAMS CHECKED ALL UNITS REFERENCED YOUR REPORT. NONE OBSERVED ANY OBJECT HEADING IN THE DIRECTION NOTED IN YOUR REPORT. THE OBJECT YOU DESCRIBED COULD NOT BE ONE OF THE SATELLITES IN ORBIT AT PRESENT. (SEE COPY OF ATTACHMENT MENTIONED.)

NO REPORTS WERE RECEIVED FROM ANY U.S. ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY REGARDING AN UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE OR OBJECT IN THE AREA IN QUESTION. 

THE DALLAS, TEXAS ADC FILTER CENTER REPORTED NOTHING UNUSUAL OBSERVED IN THE SKY AT THAT TIME BY RADAR, AIRBORNE AIRCRAFT OR GROUND CONTROL UNITS IN THE FORT WORTH-DALLAS-ABILENE AREA.

THE AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER CONCLUDES THAT THE OBJECT WAS PROBABLY A JET AIRCRAFT OF THE F-100 SERIES AT HIGH ALTITUDES. JET AIRCRAFT SUDDENLY CUTTING THEIR AFTERBURNERS IN (OR OUT) WOULD GIVE THE APPEARANCE DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT.

SINCERELY,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
MAJOR, USAF
