There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the criteria used to evaluate reported sightings of unidentified flying objects.

The text from the document is as follows:

"The diameter is 33 ft. diameter and appears to be 17 seconds of arc in diameter. (b) The time of lighting was 19:05 EDST and was observed until 19:17 EDST, or 10 September 1951.  However, all the foregoing observations concerning the conclusions from the interrogation of Lt. __________ are in the assumption that it is impossible to demonstrate this criteria necessary to establish their sighting as one of a balloon.  Now these criteria are considered to be something like the following: 

a. Opportunity - that is the presence of a balloon in that
geographic area.
b. Similarity - that is points of similarity between balloons and observations made.
c. Absence of a negative component - that is, the pilots themselves verified as a balloon or the subject who were viewing from the ground did not see a balloon, however, they could be influenced upon.

It is believed that essentially that these factors would effect the decision.  Now as to opportunity, we have information that the Evans Signal Laboratory released two balloons at 11:12 EDST on September that these balloons were in the air with 12:12 MST of 10 September and that they were at 164,000 ft and the diameter of the balloons at sunset was approximately 377. It is to be noticed that Evans Signal Laboratory is located at Belmar, N.J. It is considered that opportunity is presented in the time element and in geographic location regarding points of similarity the following must be considered:

Considering that the pilots disregarded radically, interrogations of A-2 of the 11th and interrogations by AHTC personnel as in their opinion that they are not sure or more than this fact that the"
