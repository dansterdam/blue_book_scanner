The image contains a hand-drawn diagram or sketch, but no photograph. The diagram appears to be related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

CAPT RUPPELT: That's over in the Electronics Sub-Division.

CAPT RUPPELT: Did you see a splash? I mean the entire and the G.C.I. (?) it you known?
SOURCE: 
Well, now, the G.I. didn't see the splash. They did see the light. They thought it was just another aircraft. Let's of these aircraft would come over and turn on their lights to say "hello". We'd shine ours back to them.
CAPT RUPPELT: And they came up where you were playing pinochle and told you about it. It took them about three minutes to get up there?
SOURCE:
A little longer than that. About five or ten minutes.
CAPT RUPPELT: O.K., then that's about it.
