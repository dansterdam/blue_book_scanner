The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing the release of a weather balloon from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The text states that the weather balloon is 10 feet long and 6 feet in diameter, with winds at Eglin of 20,000 ft at 28°/45K. The time from launching to sighting would put the balloon in the area of sighting.
