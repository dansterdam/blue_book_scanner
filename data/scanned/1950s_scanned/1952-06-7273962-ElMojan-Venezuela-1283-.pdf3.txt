The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a black and white photograph that depicts a crude sketch or illustration labeled "CRUDE HOAX" with the phrase "INDIA INK SKETCH" written below it. The sketch appears to show a simple silhouette or outline of what looks like a UFO or some kind of aerial object.
