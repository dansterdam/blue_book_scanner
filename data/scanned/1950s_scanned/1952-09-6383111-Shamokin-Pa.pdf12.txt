SAFIL 0779-H

Dear Mr. K n s k i t:

Thank you for your personal expression of interest in behalf
of Mr. 's group, Shamokin, Kulpmont, Kase-Wisn, concerning "Flying
Saucers."

For Mr. 's assurance, I am enclosing a May so that
he will have the full picture of our activities in this matter to
date.

As may be noted from this report, the Air Force has received
a number of reports from credible observers which cannot be
explained at this time. However, our investigations of unusual
aerial phenomena have produced nothing which confirms any
reports, and we understand as rare is known about occurrences in
the upper atmosphere.

The Air Force appreciates Mr. 's Interest in reporting
his observation. You will want to know that his report has been
made a matter of record and is being evaluated by the Air Forces.
In the event additional information on this matter is required,
an Air Force representative will communicate with Mr. 
to obtain the desired information.

Your personal interest is appreciated.
