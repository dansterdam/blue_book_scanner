There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Using optical character recognition (OCR), the text in the document is as follows:

ACCOMMODATION

The eyes change focus to see objects within about 20 feet, but do so almost not at all for distant objects. 

SEEING AT NIGHT

It is easy for your eyes to play tricks on you at night when you stare for some time at a light - say, the tail-light of a lead airplane. What happens is technically known as autokinetic movement, or more commonly as static vision. If the light is stationary, it may seem to move and swing in wide arcs. If the light is moving, it may seem to move to the side motion it is actually going straight ahead. The cure for stare vision is don't stare - keep shifting your gaze from point to point.

Another common illusion at night is to see a light expanding or contracting at a fixed distance from you when actually the light is approaching or going away. Again, shift your gaze.

One last tip on seeing at night is to keep your windscreen scrupulously clean. Dust, grease, water droplets, scratches, and the like all obstruct your vision at night. This could, after a few hours, take on the silhouette of "an unidentified flying object."

With regard to color perception at night, blue and green lights are seen most easily; red and orange are seen least easily.

From motion parallax - When the observer fixes his sight on one object while his head or body moves, other objects apparently moving in the same direction as he are judged to be more distant, while those apparently moving in the opposite direction are judged to be nearer.
