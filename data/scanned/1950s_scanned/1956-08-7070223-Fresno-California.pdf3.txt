Dear Sir:
Received your letter and forms of the what. I realize you thank me for reporting - I mailed them sketches of what I saw - with a note about others - I hope you received all of them. In any case - copies are on hand - will be glad to forward some - but my job will be a little easier if you would kindly forward forms necessary to give detailed information - makes it very much easier to complete the picture. 
Constantly trying to have it on record - it certainly gets a busy phone to have interested parties.
Thanks to you this - and I hope to be of a little help some where along the line -
Yours sincerely
