The image appears to contain a photograph of what is described as a "Bell bomber" equipped with the "self rearner", which the text suggests may have contributed to some of the "flying saucer" reports. The text below the image provides a detailed description of a "New Air Photograph Device Described", including information about its development, capabilities, and how it was used in early test flights.

New Air Photograph Device Described

The Air Force's newest night photography device, developed at the Wright Air Development Center, has been announced publicly for the first time. The gadget, weighing only 15 pounds, enables serial photographs to be taken from a jet plane at night.

The 1-inch camera unit, suspended from the wing, is controlled by the pilot. It gets its power from the plane's electrical supply and can take up to 500 exposures without reloading. The pictures are then developed at the Air Force's specialized aerial photographic laboratories. 

During the FIRST test flights conducted at Wright Field on March 5,1953, it is reported that pilots and field officials were able to obtain ground photos from extremely high altitudes at speeds exceeding 600 miles per hour. A similar response was obtained by a Detroit area manufacturing plant, whose secret drawings were revealed in the pictures taken on these test flights.

The device now has been successfully tested on numerous missions, and the Air Force claims it has solved the old military problem of how to take pictures of enemy activity at long distances and at high speeds.

When first used by the Air Force in 1950, the "bell rearmer" was connected to the same type of equipment. The first flight test took place late in 1951.
