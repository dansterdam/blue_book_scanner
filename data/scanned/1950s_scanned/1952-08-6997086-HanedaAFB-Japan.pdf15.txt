```
5 August 1952, Haneda AFB, Japan

Report of radar targets does not allow a plausible explanation of
the nature of the targets. Absence of weather data, i.e. temperature 
vs height and moisture vs height does not allow an anomalous propaga-
tion estimate. However, the report states that targets did appear to 
be permanent echoes at various times.
