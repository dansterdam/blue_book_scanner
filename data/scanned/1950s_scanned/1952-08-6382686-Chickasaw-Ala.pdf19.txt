Control Tower Operator

I was working in Traffic answering calls when the officer of the day came around. He came to me and said that he had a report that an officer saw a light to the west of the field. This was at about 2100 hrs when it first became visible. I went out to the tower platform and then I saw a light in the distance. It was a bright white color. I looked at it for just a little while, only about three or four minutes, then it went out. I know nothing about it, radar, but at the same time we were in contact with GCI by radio. The GCI operators spotted something over to the northwest, heading east, at 8000 feet. I know that they reported three blips within 4,000 feet, none moving and did not say anything about the distance or what else happened. It was clear in the tower. I say no clouds interfering whatever. The object was towards the east of the moon. I never noticed the object move. The moon is sometimes dimming at about this time of night and that is when I saw this object, so I assume it was not the moon but some other object. I cannot identify this object and this report is exactly the same as the one there.
