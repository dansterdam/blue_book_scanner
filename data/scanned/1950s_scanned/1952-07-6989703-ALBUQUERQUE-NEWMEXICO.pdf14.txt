There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

(2) It was brilliantly lighted and seemed to be of a reddish-orange color. (3) It was completely silent in its flight. (4) It made a steep climb from behind the mesa and traveled in a horizontal course for approximately 5 to 7 minutes, at which time it made a steep dive back of the mesa.
