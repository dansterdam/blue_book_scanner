Before I begin the actual story I have
to tell you; I must state that my
previous remarks were for the fact
that I feel that end neglect to remain
unbeknown to you. For what I am to
relate important to you, but perhaps, what
I tell you may be.

About fourteen years ago around, 1952
I had a most unsettling actual-experien-
surpassed, what is morose, a day
called "Flying Saucers" or "U F O"; at That
Time it wasn't popular or common-
conversation. I can, also, assure you
it was the very last thing in my
mind I thought I might add out
more. Thing I have only had. That
one experienced, that long ago, acking,
once, in spite of the present day
rash of reports.

It was a week or two before
Christmas, 1952, I had gone Christmas
shopping in Hollywood, Calif. I had not
car at That time and. Traveled by bus;
I lived, and Still live in The same
place in North Hollywood, Calif.; I
arrived back where The bus stopped
at The corner of Ventura Blvd. and
Laurel N. H. Calif., approximately 9.30 P/M.
I stopped into The Corner Phone Booth
in junction with a gas station and
called home for someone to pick me up.
As I live about eight blocks away
from There. As I gathered my packages
and stepped out of The Phone Booth
