Case Number: 9079278
Date: 9 February 1959
Subject: Unusual Sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects
Location: Coburn, Virginia

On 7 February 1959, Mrs. Virginia Smith of Coburn, Virginia, reported the sighting of several unusual flying objects in the sky over her home. Mrs. Smith stated that at approximately 8:15 PM, she observed three bright lights moving rapidly across the sky in a westerly direction. The objects were described as round in shape and emitting a bright, bluish-white glow. They were silently traveling at an estimated speed of 500-700 mph and disappeared from view within 30 seconds.

Mrs. Smith immediately notified the local authorities, who in turn contacted the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book for investigation. An Air Force investigator was dispatched to interview Mrs. Smith and examine the site. No physical evidence or residue was found, and no other witnesses to the event could be located. The case was classified as "unknown" due to the lack of corroborating evidence.
