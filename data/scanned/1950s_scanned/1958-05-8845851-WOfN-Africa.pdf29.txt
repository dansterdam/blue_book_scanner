THE HOLLY RIVER SAUCER
Bunch of us down there - we ran out onto the porch, and they even had a telescope there, and some of them looked at it through that. It looked like - like a cigar at both ends, and it looked like there was a division right through the middle of it, with as much white down here as there was myself, and, uh, I couldn't tell you just what it was.
BARKER: This division. Was that as if the podition was seen?
H. G. MOLLOHAN: Yes, that's where the division was seen.
BARKER: And there was fire coming outside on the bottom.
H. G. MOLLOHAN: Yes, smoke and fire. Kind of a blue smoke, looked to me like - no, it could tell, and, then, like a red blaze of fire would fly-up like they were trying to land, or something. And it is packed up, and it is packed out, and he came back again like he was trying-made the third attempt to come down in them woods tight on top of that ridge. It was coming a storm.
BARKER: It was crowding a storm.
H. G. MOLLOHAN: No, it wasn't when it started.
BARKER: A rain storm.
H. G. MOLLOHAN: A wind storm, and rain with it - and a bad one too.
BARKER: And it gave you the impression, from watching it, that the thing might be in trouble?
H. G. MOLLOHAN: That's what we thought, and we thought, the once, we thought it fell over the hill, and that's the reason - BARKER: That's when you lost it?
H. G. MOLLOHAN: No, I didn't hear any noise.
BARKER: About how far away is the hilltop? H. G. MOLLOHAN: (To his son): Well, that, of course, would be a mile, wouldn't it?
BARKER: Yeah, do you think it would be a mile HANK MOLLOHAN: Yes, that would be it.
BARKER: When you say it disappeared at that time did you think it had fallen, or landed?
HANK MOLLOHAN: This was still during the daytime, you see.
BARKER: Could you see anything after it landed?
HANK MOLLOHAN: No. We couldn't see anything. It was getting dark then, and the reason we couldn't see very good.
BARKER: You could see through the trees, though?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Oh yes.
BARKER: That's when you went up on the other hill to look.
HANK MOLLOHAN: That's when we went up to take a look. We definitely saw a man. Whether that's what we seen, this or not, I don't know.
BARKER: Where was the man? Was he there at the place where we saw the thing?
HANK MOLLOHAN: No. He was right under the top of the hill - right near the place where we saw it.
BARKER: Did this look like an ordinary man?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Well, I'd say he wasn't any great big man, just an ordinary man.
BARKER: He didn't seem to be discused or anything?
HANK MOLLOHAN: No.
BARKER: What did he seem to be doing?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Just standing there, looking around under a tree when we saw him.
BARKER: Was he examining the tree or something?
