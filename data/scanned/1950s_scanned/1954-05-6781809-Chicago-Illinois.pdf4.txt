Examination
The date is May 24, 1952. The witness is 7:00 o'clock. If was sighting us way, and several others, including a sales manager, saw an object fly out of the sky and hover for some time. Then it took off at tremendous speed, making a short turn and disappearing. I intend to give these further details later. The original sighting and motion were and shall remain the record. I have called the Air Force and they seem considerably interested in the matter and in investigating further. I may discuss it further as the situation determines. Here is the material that can be forwarded to you at this time. Kindly acknowledge receipt, so I will know you have received it. Thanks for your interest and assistance.
