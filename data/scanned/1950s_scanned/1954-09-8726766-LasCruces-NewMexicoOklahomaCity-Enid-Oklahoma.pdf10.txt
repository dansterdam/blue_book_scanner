In the years following, green fireballs occasionally appeared. An astronomer observed one over Lafayette, Colorado, at 7:45 P.M. on June 4, 1950. One soared over the New England states and eastern Canada on November 2, 1950, and a year later, on November 2, 1951, a plane crew over Texas sighted another which was dramatically publicized in Life Magazine, and described in a saucer publication as "a strange missile" that shot out red balls. Few others made the headlines until the one of September 18, 1954, but even that caused only brief excitement and the Air Force expressed no alarm.
