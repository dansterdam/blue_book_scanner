The image does not contain any photographs, it only shows a typed letter. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

BECAUSE WE ARE IN BUSINESS HERE AND ALSO BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH HER WHO I CALLED OUR LOCAL PAPER TO ENQUIRE WHOM HUE CONCERNED FOR DOING SO PUBLICITY SEEKERS. SHE HAD SENT THIS LETTER TO US BUT WE HAVE DECIDED TO IGNORE IT AS IT WAS TOO MUCH ABOUT ,O.X. PUBLICITY SEEKERS. SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SO MANY KINDS IN OUR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON IS SURE THEY WERE "PLAYING SAUCERS" AND JOSPEHINE (SILL ?) LAND IN OUR FRONT YARD NEXT TRIP OUT.
