(AT JCRC)
1. Attached UFO report is forwarded for your review in accordance with existing procedures regarding documents which may indicate information of value to foreign aircraft or missiles.
N.K. It is believed that this UFO appears to have been in the vicinity of Kaisong, US military observers believe was observed by approximately 30 observers.
2. A preliminary analysis of the data in the observers reports more or less rules out meteors, fireballs, and the Soviet satellite orbital tracks. The long duration of the object(s) and information as revealed by a combination device indicates that the object was at very high altitudes and its motion faster than that to be expected of conventional devices.
3. The evaluation and comment of each Division hereon would be appreciated.
Your attention is invited to suspend data given this office.
