The image contains three photographs of what appear to be anomalous aerial objects. Each photograph shows a shadowy, oval-shaped object against a dark background, with a label below indicating the object's identification number. The labels read "AF-47528 1G", "AF-47528 1G", and "AF-47528 1G".

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

AF-47528 1G
AF-47528 1G
AF-47528 1G
