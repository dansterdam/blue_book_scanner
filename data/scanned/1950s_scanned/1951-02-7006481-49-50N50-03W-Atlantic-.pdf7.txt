Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

On 9 February 1951, while on flight 125 near the Azores islands, a strange sight was witnessed by Lieutenant XXXXXX XXXXXXX, USNR, the aircraft commander. At the time I had left the cockpit approximately 1 hour prior to this sighting. The time of the sighting was 0252 and the position of the aircraft was 49-50N 50-03W Latitude. I was called to the cockpit by Lieutenant XXXXXX to witness this scene.

When I first saw the sight it was far away from us and rapidly disappearing over the horizon. Not being too familiar with flying in this particular area, my first impression was the celestial setting of the moon and the fact that the bright layers were present to cause the bright red glow and the halo effect that was apparent.

I did not witness the entire proceedings as did some of the other pilots, but I was told that little I did see of it did seem to have an impression on several of the crew. The object disappeared at a high rate of speed, approximately 2000 mph.
