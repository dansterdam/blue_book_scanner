The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project 10073, which records an observation made on July 21, 1955 in Richland, Washington. The card provides details about the type of observation, which was a tear-drop shaped object in silver color that exhibited some balloon-like appearance. The comments indicate that the object was tracked by pilots and their ABC was positive, but it was over an area of lighting at the time of sighting. The conclusion is that the object was a weather balloon.
