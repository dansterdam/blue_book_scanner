SUBJECT: Request for UFO Investigation, Manitowoc, Wisconsin
Incident - 12 April 1958
TO: Commander
10525th Air Intelligence Services Squadron
Ent Air Force Base, Colorado

1. In accordance with paragraph 6a, AR 200-2, request that action be taken to investigate the circumstances surrounding the sighting of unidentified flying objects reported in the vicinity of Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

2. To assist you in this matter, attached is the preliminary report prepared by the local (U.S.) unit, in collaboration with the Civil Defense director and the County Sheriff's Department.

3. Aside from the obligation imposed upon the Air Force to resolve all reported unidentified flying objects, the results of this investigation could be exploited, to the diverse interests of the Air Force, by UFO studies and "flying saucer" programs, if approved. This is particularly true if it is shown that no further action was found inconclusive on the part of the Air Force.
