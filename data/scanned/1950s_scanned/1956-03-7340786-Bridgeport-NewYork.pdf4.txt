AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FLIGHT 3-9, ACCA 41233
DESCRIPTION OF REPORTING WITNESSES

1. Preparing officer concludes that this sighting was probably caused by an illuminated weather balloon. 

2. Prevailing winds prior to time of sighting would have placed weather balloons 28 miles southwest rather than over the area as reported.

3. The description of the balloon hypothesis is described in detail.

4. Due to negative radar contact, possible error in sightings reported as an object traveling luminous surrounded by halo is admitted.

5. Although the planet Jupiter did in the east at this time, it would have been considered for a UFO but dismissed on the basis of its fixed position and lack of motion.

6. Although certain aspects of the lighting corresponded to the 1 lighting described, this object is not considered by the Officer to be a star due to motion and brightness.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
