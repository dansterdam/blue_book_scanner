SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Airborne Object

1st District OSI (IG)

Detachment Commander:

advised that the mission referred to in the extract set forth above consisted of two F-86 aircraft flying between Provincetown, Mass. and the Cape Canaveral Proving Grounds. The aircraft were flying at approximately 30,000 feet and were picked up on an SCR 616-B Radar Unit at Bldg. 24 on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus. The purpose of this mission was to establish wind velocity and was done as a personal favor for TUTTLE.

The object was sighted and the 1st Lt. both the F-86's and the object had an approximate speed of 1220 miles per hour. The object was sighted at 0952 Eastern Standard Time and was observed to be at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. It was apparently much smaller than the F-86's and was flying at 30,000 feet, and it could not be determined on the radar screen.

The object's maneuvers as being a perfect interceptor pass.

1. Object first detected at about point A when F-86's were about a converging course and rapidly overtaking F-86's.

2. Object crossed track of F-86's about two miles ahead of them, about at point B.

3. Object continued out to north, then began a turn to right crossing directly over or under F-86's at C and headed in toward Boston.

CERTAIN FEATURES
1. Crossing point at B was 2 1/2 miles ahead of F-86's.
2. Turn of object was to the right.
3. Object did not go over 39 miles (did not cross 40 mile range marker) from MIT.
