The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph present on this particular page. I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

Official U.S. Air Force UFO Sighting Report

15. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? (Circle One)
Yes / No 
If so, how? by suddenly accelerating to a very high speed

16. Did the object move behind something or disappear from view? (Circle One)
Yes / No
If you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Color:
b. Size: as large as a wash tub, i.e., about 5 feet in diameter
c. Shape: round or disc-shaped
d. Number: one

18. We wish to determine the angular size (hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the match stick covers the object). If you find this impractical, try to estimate how much of the match stick the object would have covered if you had done this test. 
1/2 (One Half)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[There is a handwritten sketch showing a round, disc-shaped object with some notations about its size and appearance.]
