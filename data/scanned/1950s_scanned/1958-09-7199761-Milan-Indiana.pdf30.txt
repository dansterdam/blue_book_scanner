This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be text discussing guidelines for the declassification or extended classification of information under the National Security Council's directives.

Text from the document:

GUIDANCE:
1. GENERAL
2. If, upon review under these guidelines, it is determined that a document must be classified but which of the information therein could be declassified provided certain limited portions were excised, such as those which identify sensitive intelligence sources and methods, this fact should be noted. This will enable the Archivist to provide excised versions of documents to the maximum extent possible.
3. A major purpose of any classification or declassification is to make available to the general public the maximum amount of data consistent with the obligations of national security. Sensitive intelligence sources and methods, the disclosure of which could lead to counteraction jeopardizing the continued productivity of intelligence sources and methods, should be protected. Reasonable portions that provide intelligence that is clearly significant to the national security or "sources" can be identified as the origins of information and "methods" are developed. In many cases, sources and methods are inseparable.
