Dear Mr [REDACTED]

     This is to acknowledge your letter of 1 August 1959 con-
cerning various UFO sightings.

     Research of Air Force records indicates that the 9 November
1957 sighting you mention has never been reported to the U.S.
Air Force

     The 5 November 1957 Coast Guard sighting was evaluated as
several aircraft on the radarscope.

     The 24 February 1959 American Air Lines sighting was
attributed to jet night aerial refueling operations. The Pacific
sightings of 17 July 1959 were attributed to an exceptionally
bright and large meteor called "Fireball"

                                                                           Sincerely,
                          
                                                                                                                                           
                                                                           LAWRENCE J. TACKER
