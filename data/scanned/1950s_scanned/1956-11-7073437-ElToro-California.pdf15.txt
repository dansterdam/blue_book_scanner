UPON ARRIVING AT WORK AT 2330, THE EVENING WATCH OFFICER STATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS OBSERVED IN THE SKY DURING THE NIGHT. THESE OBJECTS HAD BEEN TRACKED BY AN EARLY WARNING RADAR STATION AND A FIGHTER INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON HAD BEEN SCRAMBLED TO INVESTIGATE. THE OBJECTS WERE DESCRIBED AS ROUND IN SHAPE, ABOUT 30 FT IN DIAMETER, FLYING IN PAIRS AND MOVING WITH GREAT SPEED. THE OBJECTS WERE TRACKED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BY THE RADAR STATION UNTIL THEY DISAPPEARED FROM THE SCREEN. THE FIGHTER PILOTS WERE UNABLE TO MAKE VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE OBJECTS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE IN THE GENERAL AREA THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. I WAS UNABLE TO SEE ANY OF THESE OBSERVED OBJECTS.
