The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

in an apparent discutsion on an object seen, the report states:
"as an interesting fact it should be noted that several cases of unidentified flying objects, seen especially at night, have been reported from various parts of this country in recent months. The main cuse of these mystery objects appears to be merely a well known atmospheric effect, sometimes called "ball lightning" or "fireball", which under certain conditions can give the impression of being at high or low attitudes, and can sometimes appear to be slowing down, stopping, or changing directions."

The report continues to discuss the various characteristics and observations of the object seen, including its size, motion, and duration. It notes that the object was not immediately identifiable and required further investigation.
