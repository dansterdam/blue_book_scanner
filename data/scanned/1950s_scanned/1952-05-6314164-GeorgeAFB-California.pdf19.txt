Memorandum for Record
SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952

On 17 May 1952, Major Vincent Voirath, Wing Intelligence Officer at George AFB, Calif., contacted Major Voirath who revised sightings and plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 20 May 1952.

On 21 May 1952, Major Voirath was contacted again and further revision of plans was made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 22 May 1952.

The T-6, during previous observations, was considered unsuitable for the mission and plans were made to utilize a better aircraft. Both the Ground Control Intercept and the Fighter Interceptor Squadron of ADC contacted and briefed on the sightings and plans to observe from a T-6. They agreed to stand by all afternoon on 22 May. The object was sighted. If it was, F-86's would be scrambled and made attempts to pick-up the ground vision and a ground observer with Major Voirath to track the object. 

At 1930 PDST, the T-6 was airborne and had a Loran with a 135 mm camera. The observation team called the F-86's and stated they were observing the object through a telescope and it appeared to be a balloon. Also it was identified to several of the previous reports as the object seen on the ground watching. The aerial search was broken off and the T-6 landed.

It was concluded that the object was this balloon.

On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It will be noted that although some of the reports were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.

Lt Rappelt returned to W-F AFB on 23 May.
The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.
