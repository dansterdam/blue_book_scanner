SUMMARY: (Those portions of the report which give key information are underlined.) On 26 May 1954, at about 10:30 PM, Ray A. Brantlinger, a 38 year old engineer, observed a brilliantly illuminated object in the sky near his home in Cleveland, Ohio. The object was circular in shape and appeared to be self-luminous, emitting a reddish-orange glow. It was observed to make a straight and level flight for about 2 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. Brantlinger stated that the object was at an estimated altitude of about 2,000 feet and was larger than a B-29 aircraft, appearing to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. He further stated that the object made no sound and seemed to be under intelligent control. No other witnesses are known.
