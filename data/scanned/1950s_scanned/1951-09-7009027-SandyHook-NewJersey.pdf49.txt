AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

TR-52-32
On 10 September, Major Ballard of the 119th Fighter Interceptor Squadron spotted an unidentified object over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Their F-51 aircraft was well above the object, which was moving southward. Lt. Rogers was first to sight the object (11:35 EDT) since Major Ballard was making a position report. 

Lt. Rogers followed the object in a diving turn to the left, descending to an altitude of about 8,000 feet with the object descending to about 6,000 feet below and to the left of the aircraft. Thereafter he tried to keep a course paralleling, but above, the object.

As soon as Major Ballard completed his radio check-in he was notified of the strange object. Both watched it make a 90 degree turn to the left and kept it under observation while it slowly disappeared to the southwest, before it disappeared entirely.

The object had been in sight for about two minutes with the object covering a distance of about 35 miles. Major Ballard had the object in sight for a minute as he was maneuvering and description of the object is attached.

On the same date a radar station at 95 ft. reported two targets that were unidentified, brightly lighted, and making high speed and erratic maneuvers. After refueling, Major Ballard stated that on his return to base the radar site was unable to relocate the targets. However, the probability of being inverted in speed and being inconsistent with known aircraft types could not be ignored. This fact and the fact that four such incidents are reported in two days. However, the probability of being inverted on reported results and results will admitted upon receipt.
