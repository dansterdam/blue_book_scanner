On 4 February 1953 at about 1835 hours I was observing 1-25 lights objects northwest of Desert Center, California at 23,000 feet. At that time the navigator called my attention to an unidentified object above and behind the aircraft. I checked the position and found it to be about 5 miles east of Desert Center. I then went back to the 1-25 lights forward of the aircraft and continued to observe them. They moved much faster than the light objects behind the aircraft. I would estimate the altitude as 20,000 feet and the cruising speed 25 miles per hour of the aircraft. The motion was erratic. The sun was behind me as I looked toward the object. This object did not appear to be an airborne vehicle of a weather balloon. I have no further opinion as to the identity.
