The image contains several sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch depicts a curved line with a point marked "A" to show how high an object was above the horizon when first seen, and a point marked "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second sketch shows a larger view, with an "A" marking the position of the object when first seen, and a "B" marking its position when last seen. A smaller sketch is provided as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
