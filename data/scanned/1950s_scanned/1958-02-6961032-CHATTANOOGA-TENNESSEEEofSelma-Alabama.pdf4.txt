Unidentified flying object observed by witness on February 6, 1958 at Chattanooga, Tennessee.

"She was leaning against kitchen window looking out at a bush outside when she heard a noise like the scraping of a bird in distress. She looked and saw what she at first thought was a cloud coming up rapidly. It then realized it was not a cloud but an object traveling rapidly, round, metallic gray in color. 

Then she noticed that it increased in size and was closer as it descended to about 500 feet off the ground. The object then levelled off and was hovering. It was round, metallic gray in color, perfectly silent and motionless. She watched it for about 3 minutes.

The tail was iridescent and the center was light, but a darker color than the sky. The center was emitting a glow and there appeared to be portholes or markings on the surface. She did not see any rivets or seams on the object.

The object left no trail and seemed to disappear directly upwards."
