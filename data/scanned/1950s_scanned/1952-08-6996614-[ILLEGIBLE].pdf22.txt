Organization: 4370 Air Transport Squadron, APO 953
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFOB) REPORT (62-7-20)

1. The above described object was observed by me on 24 June 1952 and reported to Colonel G. H. Lane, Commanding Officer, 4370 ATI Squadron, on 25 June 1952.

2. On basis of information as the observation was transmitted from the aircraft Gunnery Officer, Lt. Colonel S. H. Exner, I am submitting the following report:

Observers: Captain Alfred Craven, Pilot, 4370 ATI Squadron
Lt. Colonel R. H. Exner, Gunnery Officer, 4370 ATI Squadron

3. The object was first observed at approximately 1225 hours on 24 June 1952 while the aircraft was flying at 10,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean, approximately 250 miles northeast of Honolulu, Hawaii.

4. The object, traveling at high speed, was first observed off the right wing tip of the aircraft. It was a long, slender, apparently metallic object, approximately 30 to 40 feet in length, with no visible means of propulsion. The object appeared to be traveling at an estimated speed of 600 to 700 knots.

5. After observing the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

6. Station RTFD is the GCI station at Honolulu.
