1. An unconventional unidentified aerial object was observed by Chief Aviation Radio-maman Chides at Terre Haute, Indiana. Observation was made on 9 October 1951 at 13.12 CST for approximately 15 seconds.

2. The following descriptions were obtained in an interview with the observer:
Object appeared as a shiny disc-like object approximately 1-1/2 miles in diameter, silver colored with no vapor or exhaust trail and no sound. Propulsion was unknown, seemed to hover and then accelerate at a terrific speed.

3. Object was sighted visually from the ground and observed to travel a straight course southwesterly. Object maintained a steady altitude and was visible for approximately 15 seconds.

4. Weather: CAVU with bright sun, winds at Chanute AFB on 9 October at 13.00 CST average direction 230 degrees, average velocity 15 knots. No physical evidence available. No interceptions made.

5. Conclusion: Object appeared to be a solid, shiny object slightly smaller than a small house, no vapor or exhaust trail and made no sound. It hovered briefly and then accelerated at a very fast rate of speed. Two sightings were of the same object at 13.12 CST just east of Paris, 13 Illinois, at 5,000 feet altitude. No other corroborating data available. Recommendation: Sighting could not be identified. Description south of sound.

6. Although an accurate measurement of the distance between sighting and observer was not possible from the information furnished, the object could not have been more than 4-5 miles away from the observer. The information furnished gave no indication that the two sightings were of the same object.
