15 August 1952

On the night of 14 August 1952 shortly before 2200 hours the following incident took place at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan. A pilot on duty on the flight line saw a strange object hovering over the field. He called the control tower and they also observed the object. The object then proceeded toward the northwest and disappeared from view. The control tower then notified the office of special investigations (OSI) and the on duty officer Lt. -----. Lt. ----- in turn notified the radar station who picked up the object on radar. The radar personnel reported that the object moved at an extremely high rate of speed, making almost instantaneous 90 degree turns. The object was under positive radar contact for approximately 20 minutes before it disappeared from the scope.

The weather was clear and the object was observed both visually and on radar. The object was described as a white or luminous sphere, hovering and making extremely rapid maneuvers. It was much larger than any known type of aircraft. The pilot and control tower personnel estimate that the object was approximately 3 to 5 miles distant from the field and at an altitude of between 3,000 to 5,000 feet. It was under observation for a total period of approximately 30 minutes. No sound was heard and no exhaust or trail was observed. 

The persons observing the object are considered reliable and their reports are considered to be accurate. This incident has been reported to higher headquarters.
