May 1, 1957: In Greenwich, Connecticut, the wife of a commercial artist went outdoors to look for the comet. To the northwest she saw a streak of very bright white light, straight and miles in length. This reached it for about 60 seconds, then went indoors to look for her husband, telling him "This is the brightest comet you ever saw!" When they went outdoors, no more than a minute had elapsed, but the streak was gone. It had been observed, however, that the ending streak showed no diffusion as is the case with a jet trail. This case has not yet been followed up completely, but CSI hopes to obtain more details. Paul Harris brought the case to the attention of the Research Section.
