The image contains a topographic map but does not include any photographs. As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

FOUNTAIN, COLORADO 
EL PASO COUNTY

INTERVAL 20 FEET
CONTOUR PROJECTION
AMERICAN SYSTEM
TRANSVERSE MERCATOR GRID, ZONE 15
TRUE NORTH - GRID NORTH 0 DEG 08 MIN WEST
POLYCONIC PROJECTION OMITTED

ANNUAL MAGNETIC CHANGE 6' WESTERLY

To determine accurately earth lines, proceed the
following steps: 1. Measure the grid distance between
two adjacent ticks on the east-west grid lines and 
divide this distance by the actual ground distance
between the same two ticks on the earth. This will give
the scale of the map in feet per inch. 2. Measure the
angle between grid north and the north-south grid
lines. This angle is the divergence of grid north.
