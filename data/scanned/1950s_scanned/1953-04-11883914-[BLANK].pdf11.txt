There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

The evaluation of 1952 reports will be more time consuming than was the case for earlier reports, because reports now are in more detail and often consist of sightings of one object by more than one individual.

Since October 16, 1952, it has been necessary to establish a rotation system for handling sighting reports, no more than 100 sighting reports being permitted away from WPAFB at any one time. Questionnaires and work sheets completed here must therefore be put in duplicate before sighting reports matching these questionnaires and work sheets are returned to WPAFB in return for unprocessed sighting reports. When evaluation conferences are held, these folders must be matched before an evaluation is made. The necessity for establishing a rotation system has caused some delay in progress.

ANALYSIS OF SOIL AND VEGETATION SAMPLES

Two samples of vegetation and soil from Pittsburgh, Kansas, which were submitted by WPAFB for analysis, have been thoroughly studied. Examination by experts on soil and vegetation disclosed no difference between the two samples from the two areas where the specimens were obtained. Tests for radioactivity likewise showed no significant difference between the two samples of soil and vegetation. Tests were made for beta, gamma, and alpha radiation. Samples of the "Kansas" soil and the vegetation will be returned to WPAFB in the near future.
