Reference the attached negatives. These photographs were received in conjunction with an observation of the star Arcturus. The observation was made by the Air Force and F-94C members at Bellow Falls, Vermont. The negatives were submitted to the Aerophysics Laboratory at Cambridge, Mass, 11 July 1958 and there reported concerning his observation. This is the first contact from this sighting since July 1958.
