GONZALEZ, Geronimo P. 60 ELECAVAT-23308
DMZ Company, 1st Cavalry Division
One 6 November as 0500, I was walking with a patrol into the DMZ area south of Kum Songi-Ri. At approximately 0530 hours, SSG. MONTEZ, No. 7 Patrol member, discovered an object directly behind one of the rice paddy dikes, glowing with an intense orange-red light. This light was of such intensity that the whole area in the immediate vicinity was illuminated. The light lasted for approximately 5-10 seconds, then subsided to a greenish hue. The object then began to rise vertically and silently to an estimated altitude of 800-1000 feet. The object then took on the appearance of a white sphere about the size of a basketball and moved in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed, climbing at a 70 degree angle. The object had completely disappeared in about 5 seconds. The only sound heard was a slight whistle, like that of a bullet passing nearby. The object was observed by 6 other members of the patrol.

The report states that a drawing accompanying the description was attached, but no image is shown in the provided document.
