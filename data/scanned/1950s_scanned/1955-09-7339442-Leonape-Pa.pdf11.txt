AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: LEGEND:
Flight 9-H, 46024 A139

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORT:

1. The officer on duty at the New Castle, Delaware, County Airport Weather Station (GCQK 2640) was contacted and furnished the following information. His station received a call from this office on 23 September, inquiring whether balloons had been launched that day. No balloons had been launched on 23 September. However, on the 24th September, balloons were released at about four intervals through the day and they would have floated in the direction of West Chester, Pennsylvania, after passing through the Chester, Pennsylvania area. After the caller's report, the station received no further information.

2. The US Weather Bureau at Philadelphia International Airport (GCQK 4639) was contacted and queried about balloon releases on 23 September. The records checked revealed that five pilot balloons had been released and tracked on that date. This agency referred the ATIS investigator to the field unit which supplies them with such information.

3. A check with the 24th AA GP located at Swartnhmore, Pa. (GCQK 3754) disclosed that balloons in 1000 FT., 1600 FT., 2000 FT. and 2400 FT. and this schedule was adhered to on the 23rd September. The balloons were of the regular type, carrying radiosondes equipment consisting of a small modulator and two thermistors. The last balloon was released at 1030 EDT. The balloons were released at 1000 EDT. The reason this was done, was to determine the wind aloft information for use in weather forecasting.

4. A further check with the 24th AA GP Ground Meteorological Section near Swarthmore, Pa. (GCQK 3756) disclosed the following data obtained from the balloon which was released at 10:16 EDT on 23 September 1955:

Time After Flight: 
10:16 (Released)
10:18 250.Â° 
10:20 274.8
10:22 302.9
10:24 307.4
10:26 125.9 
10:28 124.9
10:30 (Last Reading) 122.0

This balloon may have burst shortly after the last reading was made or it may have risen higher and drifted into winds which could have carried it towards the vicinity of West Chester. It is believed that the balloon contained sufficient helium to have remained aloft for some few hours after its release at 10:16 EDT, and could have drifted into the West Chester, Pennsylvania, and the Coatesville, New Jersey area.

G.CQK 2639 notes that the officer on duty at the New Castle Air Force Base, Delaware, stated that no other balloon data nor any weather information for inclusion in the preliminary report. The ceiling at that time had been 2500 FT. To the Weather Officer's knowledge, there had been no meteorological releases of any kind in the immediate vicinity of West Chester, Pa. on 23 September 1955.
