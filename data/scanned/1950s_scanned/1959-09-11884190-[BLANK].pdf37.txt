Text from the document:

Dear Mr. Kinsley:

Your letter of September 29th, concerning information relating to material allegedly observed by Pilot John W. Brister, has been referred to me.

The Air Force has made a thorough check of all reported sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Pensacola, Florida, area on September 11, 1959, the date mentioned in your letter, and no reliable report of such a sighting has been received.

I have reviewed the official reports of the scientific analysis made by Air Force personnel, and have found no evidence to support the claim that an unidentified flying object was observed on that date in that area.

Much of the descriptive material in your letter appears to be hearsay, and we have not been able to develop any factual data to substantiate the report. 

While the Air Force is always interested in reports of genuine unidentified flying objects, we cannot take official cognizance of reports which appear to be unsupported by reliable evidence.

I trust this information is responsive to your inquiry.

Sincerely yours,
COL. OGRO
