The VHF omni-directional radio range provides azimuth information and course indication to aircraft when flying at relatively low altitudes. These ranges operate in the frequency band between 112 and 118 mc. Note that the azimuth indications are simultaneous voice communications and 1-letter (Morse code) identification. In operation, the pilot sets his course selector to the desired magnetic bearing and flies the aircraft to maintain a "needle-center" indication on his instruments. The needle will center when the aircraft is on the selected course.
