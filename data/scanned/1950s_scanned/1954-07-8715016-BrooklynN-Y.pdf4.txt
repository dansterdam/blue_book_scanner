Dear Professor Hynek:

I cannot begin with an obvious pretention for my inclination is natural enough! I desire to approach the road dead-center, in the hop it can lead to the Inn, where Man can reside in comfort. Long ago, sir J. Arthur Thomson wrote a fine book Riddles of Science: and this I pos to you, as a Scientist, certain riddles that have appeared, albeit, sin the atoms have been exploding and since we, Mankind, have been explorin the regions above our atmosphere: but kindly exculpate any of my in ferences realizing, I am a self-educated man, ever seeking fruitful knowledge. (I had had High School experence and Nonmatriculating cou in College.)

The first riddle: is the question of UFO'SI Sighted by numer persons of creditable background. I myself had one Night Sighting in July 19fifly four: which I outlined in detail for Professor Menzel; and he admitted I had an interesting sighting: but murely imagined it was the result of a fancied searchlight.  The second sighting was a probab Jan. twenty fourth instant! It was a daylight sighting: and a witness though unperturbed by the opinions I held, was there at the time. 

The AirForce sent me about ten pages of detailed information to fill o To go grindingly through this ritual over nothing is surely a vitiation of some sort.  This is the first riddle.
