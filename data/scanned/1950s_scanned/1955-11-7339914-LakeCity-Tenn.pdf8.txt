It. These deductions seem to eliminate all of the possibilities ex-cept optical or weather phenomena. They would have no restrictions as to size, shape, length of observation, course, speed, color or distance. They would not necessarily have a known reason for existing. They are probably more difinite than those mentioned above. The object was low on the horizon and some stars could already be observed. It was indicated in the initial report that interceptors were sent out but re-ported negative results. This seems to substantiate the premise that the object was some type of phenomenon rather than material. The preparing officer believes that this larger deduction is more possible than the former so-lutions.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Further investigative efforts revealed the presence of two temperature inversions (surface to 2,000' and 11,000' to 13,000') in the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting.
It is the opinion of this headquarters that the sighting was probably caused by the viewing of the planet Venus through the above mentioned temperature inversions.
