20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.
22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One): a. Head of a pin, b. Pen, c. Nickel, d. Grapefruit, e. Basketball, f. Other.
22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): a. Not very sure, b. Fairly certain, c. Certain, d. Uncertain.
23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
24. In order that you will see as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object which you saw. Of what type material would you say it was made, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
