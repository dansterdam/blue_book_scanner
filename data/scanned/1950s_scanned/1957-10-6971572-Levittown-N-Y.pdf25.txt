Transcription of the text in the document:

December 12, 1957

Dear Harry:

Your letter of December 2 is a very important one and I am pleased to tell you that I will do what I can to assist you in your investigation and analysis of the sightings. I will be glad to send you any information I can regarding the sighting, and I will also ask you for your permission and that of your friend to do more detailed work on the analysis. Your findings as to a good description of exactly how the sighting occurred would be most helpful to us, and I suspect that many other similar sightings may be usable by publication of this that might be unavailable by public account of this that might be unavailable by public release. I intend to discuss this carefully with the various persons concerned, and pass them around among the various departments and students.

In this field of endeavor much remains to be done, and your cooperation may be most helpful. Hope everything is going well with you.

Sincerely,

Fred T. Whipple
Director
