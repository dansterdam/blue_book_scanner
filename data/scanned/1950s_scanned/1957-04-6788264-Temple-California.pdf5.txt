The image does not contain any photographs, but rather shows a page from an old Project Blue Book document with text describing a UFO incident. I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

"Crater, estimating was about 40 feet in diameter. Inside the crater there were yellow marks like paint marks. He mentioned that he had seen some time before in this vicinity some yellow paint marks, but now that he looked closely, they seemed more like hue or discolored area rather than actual paint.

He admitted the possibility that he might have imagined the whole thing, but stated that he was certain he had seen some unusual markings and a crater in the ground.

One thing that struck the witness was the fact that the Army men were unwilling to trace the underground area, presumably for security reasons. He found this unusual and rather mysterious.

He was told by the local sheriff deputies that this area where the supposed incident took place was a site of an ancient Indian village. The sheriff pointed out some old Indian pottery fragments scattered in the area.

On the missing operation. We cannot find any record of this incident in our files. We have checked the records of the Air Force, Army and Navy with negative results. We do not know anything further about it.

J. D. Smith, Air Force man name added by a word crossed out. A copy of this report has been sent to 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron at Hamilton Air Force Base, California, for information.

Also a copy sent to Dr. Charles R. Hopkins, 409 South Eighth Street, Moneca, California, for his information."
