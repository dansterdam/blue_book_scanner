Gentlemen:
I thought you might be interested in the fact that we saw a flying saucer last night. It had come close and I had gone out of the house and called, "Have you ever seen a flying saucer?" I answered, "Be careful and look." As I got out of the car, it could see it through the windshield disappearing to the south, but I did not see it any closer.
At first, it was traveling from east to west, then turned abruptly northerly. Going very fast. It was large and round in shape and had a glow "like a lot of lights". 
Hoping this will help you in some way, I remain
Yours truly,
