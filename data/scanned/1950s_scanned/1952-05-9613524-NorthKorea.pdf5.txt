STATEMENT
15 May 1952
Returning from target area May 15, 1952 I was flying number four position. At approximately 1835 hour I first sighted this object. Our altitude was 9000 feet. First sighted object at about one o'clock position from our flight. By the time I called the object in on a begin, it had moved to the three o'clock position and started a steep climb, which I assumed was the beginning of a loop, but at the vertical position in the loop, the object moved forward in its original course of travel (3600) and wavered momentarily and disappeared into the haze which reached an altitude of approximately 7000-8000 feet.
