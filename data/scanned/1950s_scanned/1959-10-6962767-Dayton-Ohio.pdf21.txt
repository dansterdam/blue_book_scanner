HUGE SPACE BALLOON PAYS TECHNICIANS 
INFLATED 350 MILES ABOVE EARTH

Big Balloon 
Spectacular
Thing to See

WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 --The United States succeeded in the space program by sending up a huge balloon to the highest altitude ever reached for a high altitude scientific observation. The balloon, 100 feet in diameter, was the biggest ever inflated in the fringe of space. But it made an unscheduled landing from a record-high altitude of over 350 miles when high-altitude winds and space administration difficulties forced the balloon to break up and the gondola and instruments to descend out of hundreds of miles of space on the Eastern seaboard.
