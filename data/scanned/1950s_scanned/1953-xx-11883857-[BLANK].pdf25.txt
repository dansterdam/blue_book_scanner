BALLOONS

1. Shape: Round, cigar, pinpoint, or bowling pin.

2. Size: Balloons up to a hundred feet will generally appear from
   pinpoint to size of a pea held at arm length.

3. Color: Silver, white or many tints. It may possibly appear dark
   as when projected against the clouds. Sometimes transparent.

4. Speed: Large scale erratic speed ruled out. In general hovering 
   to slow apparent speed.

5. Formation: Single to cluster.

6. Trail: None.

7. Sound: None

8. Course: Straight with a general gradual ascent, unless falling.

9. Time in Sight: Generally long. Note: Balloon may suddenly burst
   and disappear.

10. Lighting Conditions: Night or day but especially at sunset or
    sunrise.

                            WIND EFFECT: BALLOONS MOVE WITH THE SPEED AND
DIRECTION OF THE PREVAILING WIND IN
           THE AREA AND ATTITUDE. IF BALLOON DETERMINED
      TO BE IN VICINITY WITHOUT REASONABLE DOUBT, AND
CONCURS GENERALLY WITH THE DIRECTION AND SPEED
OF THE OBS REPORTED, THEN, THE PROBABILITY THAT
THE OBJECT WAS A BALLOON IS HIGH.
