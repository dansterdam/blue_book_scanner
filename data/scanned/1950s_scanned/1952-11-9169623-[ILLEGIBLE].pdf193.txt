SUBJECT: Incident in the Vicinity of Oeming Reservoir, New Mexico, on November 2, 1952

REFERENCE: Your letter dated [ILLEGIBLE] November, 1952, requesting certain information regarding the above subject.

This incident was investigated by Project GRUDGE and the following is a summary of the findings:

A USAF officer reported that at approximately 1:00 A.M. on November 2, 1952, he observed a glowing object in the sky while driving near Deming Reservoir, New Mexico. The object appeared to be round and glowing, and was observed for about 30 seconds before it suddenly disappeared. The officer was unable to determine the size, distance, or altitude of the object.

A check of available meteorological data for the area indicated no unusual atmospheric conditions which could account for the sighting. An investigation of the area failed to reveal any evidence of the object's having landed. No other witnesses were found.

This incident was analyzed and evaluated by Project GRUDGE, and it was concluded that the object was probably a meteor or some other natural aerial phenomenon. No further investigation is planned.
