TEXAS LACKLAND (U.S.A.F.)
6 MAY 1953
The following is a report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object made by Airman First Class Raymond P. Ryan of the 271st Air Police Squadron, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, at approximately 2330 hours on the evening of 5 May 1953.
Ryan was on routine patrol at the northwest corner of the base when he noticed a bright light in the southern sky at an approximate altitude of 2000 feet. The light appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed toward the northeast. It was observed for a period of about 2 minutes and then disappeared from sight.
In Ryan's opinion the light was not an aircraft, meteor, or any other known object. He described it as being a bright white light approximately the size of a match head when viewed at arm's length. No sound was heard.
Ryan immediately reported the incident to the Base Operations Officer and the Base Commander. An investigation was conducted by these officers and a statement was obtained from Ryan. The Airman's report was considered to be credible.
