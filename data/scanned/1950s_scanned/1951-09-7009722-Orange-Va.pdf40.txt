There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

1. Report states "objects were seen in Amarillo, Big Spring, Lamesa, Brown Field and other scattered places - South Flying cities."
Check these to see if description, course, and speed are about the same. Hamper investigators are probably a good source. Try to plot a track. Check Big Spring Airport people.
2. Report states that six pilots observed the flights. What was their opinion and did they make any measurement?
3. Article stated that the object transversed a 120Â° in two seconds. How was arc measured? What chance of error?
4. Was ground around spot where Mrs. [REDACTED] and Mrs. [REDACTED] saw object examined?
5. Get weather for all nights?
6. Were ducks seen in daytime?
7. Did Mrs. [REDACTED] and Mrs. [REDACTED] hear about Lubbock incident before their sighting?
8. Wind, winds go with, into it, or any special direction in relation to wind? "Was drifting slowly cast"? "Began rapid ascent to cast"? (What was NE 3-5 knots.)
9. What is possibility of hoax started by college professors? Assume they wanted to start a mass hysteric experiment. Since they are supposed highly qualified, their statements would go over big. Maybe they planted the photos?
10. Attempt to get angle at which [REDACTED] shot the picture. How about clouds, above or below?
