SAN MARCOS, TEXAS
AUGUST 8, 1954, 8:45 P.M.
THE WITNESSES, TWO TEENAGERS, STATED THAT THEY OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) IN THE SKY OVER SAN MARCOS, TEXAS, ON AUGUST 8, 1954, AT APPROXIMATELY 8:45 P.M.
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED NEAR THE HORIZON AND IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY. IT WAS REPORTED TO BE DISK-SHAPED AND EMITTING A BRIGHT REDDISH-ORANGE GLOW.
AS THE OBJECT APPROACHED THE WITNESSES' LOCATION, IT INCREASED IN SPEED AND BRIGHTNESS. AT ONE POINT IT TOOK A VERY SHARP 90 DEGREE TURN AND CONTINUED ON A STRAIGHT COURSE, THEN TURNED BACK INTO FLIGHT PATH AND CROSSED OVER THE WITNESSES AND DISAPPEARED.
