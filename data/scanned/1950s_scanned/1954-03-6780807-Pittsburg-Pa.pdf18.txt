The image appears to be a photograph or a scan of a page from a Project Blue Book document. The image shows a circular radar scope or display, with a wavy pattern visible inside the circle. The text at the top of the image reads "Scope Pips Observed as 1/20/52", indicating that this radar scope image was observed on that date. The text below the circular display states "Scope Appeared the Same in all 3 A Scopes", suggesting that the observed radar pattern appeared consistently across multiple scopes.

The image does not contain any human faces or identifiable individuals.
