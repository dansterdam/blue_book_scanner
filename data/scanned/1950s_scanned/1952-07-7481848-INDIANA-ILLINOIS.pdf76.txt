The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated August 13, 1954.

August 13, 1954

Dear Mr. _____,

We have received your letter of August 7, 1954 which described the sighting of unidentified objects on July 11, 1952. However, we have not received the questionnaire report of the sighting by the date of July 11, 1952.

We are therefore including another questionnaire and request that you complete the questions and return it to us. Upon receipt we will again attempt an evaluation of your sighting.

Sincerely,

HARMON M. JACKS
