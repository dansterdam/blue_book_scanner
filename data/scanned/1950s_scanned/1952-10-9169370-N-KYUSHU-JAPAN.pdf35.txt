INVESTIGATING OFFICER: Second Lieutenant Harold Goldman, AO 2 223 937 

PLACE OF INCIDENT: Kyushu, Japan

DATE OF INCIDENT: 27 October 1952

Friendly was making practice instrument approaches on identified aircraft on 27 October 1952, by Second Lieutenant Harold Goldman, AD 2 223 937. 

2nd Lt Goldman was airborne on a Combat Air Patrol at 17,001. 

Friendly was making practice instrument approaches on identified aircraft at 17,001 - 20,000' and 13,000' - 17,001' over HAKODA Air Field, 35° - 40' N and 130° - 22' E.

Air Force personnel were instructed to investigate unidentified flying object 50 miles north of ASHIYA Air Force Base, 339° - 33' N and 130° - 22' E. This friendly aircraft made visual contact but could not close to get a good identification. 

This friendly aircraft at one point came to a point 20 miles north of ASHIYA, then climbed to about 22,000' and circled the object. The object appeared somewhat elliptical and was emitting a pulsating light that would be seen for a few seconds, then disappear, then reappear in another position. There were 3 stars behind the object. Friendly attempted to close again for identification but the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared. 

Friendly then took up a heading of 210° and object no longer appeared to be in visual contact. Friendly was descending and object disappeared at approximately 17,000'.

As friendly was returning to ITAZURE Air Force Base, 330° - 33' N and 130° - 22' E, a second object appeared to be at 9,500 feet and this object also disappeared.
