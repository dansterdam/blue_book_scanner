STATEMENT

Upon completion of a tour of duty from 1950 to 2300, 27 February 1953, I was in the USAF control tower at Kelly AFB, San Antonio, Texas. Preparing to land an aircraft, I noticed to my attention what they considered to be a flying saucer. I looked up at it as it was moving over the field on a heading of approximately 290 degrees true, and it was rocking back and forth. This man that I was probably incorrect in my interpretation, as it was probably an astronomical object. 

The object made a slight dive and then pulled back up. Its speed appeared to be silght. Later as I watched it, it was rocking and making what appeared to be oscillating moves. Its motion seemed to slow down and then speed up. I wathced this object for about thirty minutes until it disappeared.

At this time the weather was clear, wind at 320 degrees, 9 knots, visibility unlimited. I notified the Base Operations and reported what I had observed. They asked me several questions and I decided to go to Base Operations and report what I had seen.

There was no one at Base Operations at that time. I then called flight service in Austin and made a report of the sighting and requested that they have a officer from the District Intelligence Office contact me. They said they would do so. No one from the District Intelligence Office ever contacted me. However, I was contacted later that day by a civilian from the Security Division. After interviewing me, he stated that they had received similar reports from other observers and that he was satisfied with my account. He stated that they did not wish to take any further action and that I need take no further action on this matter.
