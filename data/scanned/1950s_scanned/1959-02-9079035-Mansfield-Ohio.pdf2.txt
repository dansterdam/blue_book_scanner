1.  Enclosed with the black and white negative and print is an enlarged color print which was developed from the color negative. This color print shows shadows of the vapor trails which were omitted in cropping the black and white negative. There is no indication that the black and white version shows the sky in a vapor trail.
2.  The two dark streaks accompanying the vapor trail are not parallel to it. We do not have an explanation for the possible shadows of the vapor trail cast upon the ground, but since we were limited to just the one frame we were unable to form any opinion.
