There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document titled "STATEMENT" which describes a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

STATEMENT

Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, authorized to administer oaths in cases of this nature, Willie Lillebridge, who, being duly sworn according to law, deposes and says:

While attending the Beach Drive-in Theater on the night of 15 March 1952, my wife and I observed in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico an object which appeared to be about the size of a weather balloon. The object remained stationary for approximately 10 to 12 minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared at a tremendous rate of speed, going in an easterly direction. The object's color was a fluorescent white, and there appeared to be no sound or trail of any kind. This sight was observed by myself and my wife, and several other persons in the vicinity.

We believe that the possibility of sighted objects being caused by the failure of optical instruments of the observers, or to the diffraction of light from natural sources, is not applicable to this case, since the object was clearly defined and the difference in color between a star and the observed object was quite distinct.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this, the eighteenth (18th) day of April 1952, at Biloxi, Mississipp.
