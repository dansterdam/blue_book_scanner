IN THE SAME DIRECTION IN A LINE ABOUT 250 MILES LONG. TOOK ME ABOUT FOUR MINUTES TO QUITE THE PLANE WHICH HAD WHIPPED VIOLENTLY AND FALLEN WHEN I FINALLY PULLED IT UP; SLAPPED HER OVER THE OVERSPEED LIMINTIT. HER OVER!--
SHE WAS TOO BUSY TO ANSWER; I SAW WHATEVER IT WAS SLIP BY UNDER MY RIGHT WING AND KNEW IN AN INSTANT IT HADN'T HIT US. THEN WE HAD SHUDDERED BY THE GROUND AND START WORRYING ABOUT THE OTHER THINGS I COULD SEE.
