UNCLASSIFIED 2D 12-9-0-7

1. On 6 May 1953 the writer, in the oouxea of an interview with a Constable Coulombe of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was informed of the following details:

On the night of 17 March 1950 at approxtmately 2130 hours, Constable Coulombe was patrolling in the vicinity of Sheaves Cove, Newfoundland when he observed a bright light in the sky. This light appeared to be about the size of a man's head at arm's length and seemed to be descending slowly towards the ground. As Constable Coulombe continued to observe the object, he saw it stop abruptly at a point about 75 yards away from him and it then appeared to rise straight up again and disappear from sight at a very high rate of speed.

2. Constable Coulombe stated that the object which he observed emitted a bright reddish glow and was approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. He felt certain that it was not an aircraft or any known type of aerial vehicle. He stated that it made no noise whatsoever and that the ascent and descent were absolutely vertical. He felt it was definitely not a star, satellite, or any other known celestial body.

3. On 6 May 1953 the writer was only able to interview Constable Coulombe briefly, as the latter was about to go off duty. However, the writer did obtain the foregoing details and felt that the observation was of sufficient interest to warrant a further and more detailed interview at a later date. This was not accomplished, however, as Constable Coulombe was subsequently transferred to another district and the writer was unable to locate him.
