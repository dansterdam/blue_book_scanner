Request for Photo Negative

SAFOI-3d (Lt. Tacker)

1. The photographic print of an alleged UFO sent to this Center by Lt. Tacker is returned. We are asked to send the negative, plus a description of the camera and lens which was used. This should be forwarded for completion concerning the photograph.

2. It is further suggested that we are informed that we are not requesting the negative because we think there is something unusual on it, but that it is necessary to increase the probability of a positive identification being made by the Air Force.
