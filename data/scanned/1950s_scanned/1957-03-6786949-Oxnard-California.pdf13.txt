PART ONE

I. SOURCE: 
Name: Deleted 
Address: Oxnard, California

Sex: F
Occupation: Housewife
Education: High School plus 2.5 years of accounting

II. DETAILS:
If, at any time, this informant was a Government employee or connected with the Armed Forces, it is not known... The informant was a Registered Nurse of about 35 years of age. Though appearing in good health when seen, she said that she had been ill for the past 6 months with "hardening of the arteries." She seemed to be an intelligent and responsible person. 

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING AND EVENTS:
At approximately 7:20 P.M. PST 3/5/57, the witness was excited to see an object that appeared to be "streaking" skyward. She called her husband, who also observed it. They both observed the object for about 10 minutes. 

The object appeared to be spinning and was changing shape constantly, but maintaining an overall round or oval shape. It appeared to be about the size of a "silver dollar" at arm's length. It was a bright bluish-white color and seemed to be emitting a pulsating light. The object seemed to be at an altitude of about 1,000 to 1,500 feet. It seemed to be ascending at a moderate speed, not extremely fast. The object appeared to be about the size of a "silver dollar" at arm's length.

Source described the glow from the object as giving the impression of a "glowing glass jar" with a bright light source inside. Source said the object appeared to be osculating or pulsating rather than emitting a steady beam of light. The object was clearly visible and well-defined, not hazy or indistinct. It appeared to move in a straight line at a constant speed until it disappeared from view.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
THIS SIGHTING IS CONSIDERED TO BE POSSIBLY VALID BASED ON THE DETAILS REPORTED AND THE APPARENT RELIABILITY OF THE SOURCE.
