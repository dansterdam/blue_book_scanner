The image contains a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a report or investigation regarding an unidentified aerial object. The document includes a section labeled "SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT", which provides details about the object observed. However, the image does not contain any photographs or visual representations of the object. 

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the textual output from the document:

I. SOURCES: BILLY JOE ELLIS, Capt., USAF
AGE: 27
DUTY: Demonstration Aerobatic Pilot with Thunderbirds
EDUCATION: College Graduate, Graduate of Pilot Training

QUALIFICATIONS: Pilot

STATION: SEOCPA Demo Fit., Luke AFB, Ariz

II. Reliability: SOURCE was a young man with a nonchalant manner. He seemed to be a highly reliable type person. This may be attributed to the fact he had already filed one report. However, he seemed to be lightly concerned about reacting to this particular sighting.

III. SOURCE'S Description of Object:
1. OBJECT was described as round, white or silver in color. It appeared to be glowing and leaving a phosphorescent trail. OBJECT was from 200-300 feet in diameter.
2. It was a bright day and the sight was very brilliant and dazzling. The object appeared to the pilot right. SOURCE was flying over open country in a southwest direction. The OBJECT was flying over the hills and appeared to just climb and then leave the area.
3. SOURCE could hear no sound from the OBJECT and the color was bright and brilliant. OBJECT seemed to linger for an instant but was in rapid motion.
4. SOURCE could not estimate the real size of the OBJECT but compared it with a star as a common object. Estimated the size to be that of a pea held at arm's length.
