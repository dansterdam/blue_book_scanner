AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SOUSCE: UFOB-23-57, TEXAS, 
Date: November 2, 1957

Address: Levelland, Texas

Age: 30 
Occupation: Farmer

SUBJECT'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On November 2, 1957, around 12:10 A.M., SOUROE was driving from Levelland, Texas, to his home approximately three miles south of Levelland, when he observed a bright light which at first appeared to be a car approaching him. As the object came closer, however, SOUROE noted that it was much larger than a car and had no lights on the front or rear. The object, described as pear-shaped and about 40 to 50 feet long, was hovering just above the highway, approximately 15 to 20 feet off the ground. SOUROE stated that the object made him lose control of his vehicle, causing it to stall. He further stated that the object gave off a pulsating glow, and that after hovering for a few minutes, it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight. SOUROE reported this incident to the Levelland Police Department, and they notified the Air Force.

CONCLUSIONS: SOUROE's statement that the object caused him to lose control of his vehicle and made it stall indicates the possibility of an electromagnetic effect. The pulsating glow and rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object are also significant factors. The Air Force has not been able to offer a satisfactory explanation for this incident.
