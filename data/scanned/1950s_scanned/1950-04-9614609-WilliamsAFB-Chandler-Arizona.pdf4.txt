The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and asks the viewer to imagine that they are at the point shown. The viewer is then instructed to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when they first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when they last saw it.

The second sketch contains two smaller sketches. The larger one shows a road or path leading to a town or city in the distance, with a person standing in the foreground. The smaller sketch shows a circular view with mountains or hills in the background.
