The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document page from what appears to be a Project Blue Book UFO report. The document is a typewritten letter describing the writer's observations of a large, bright yellow object in the sky that moved across the avenue in Brooklyn, New York on October 7, 1957.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Brooklyn, 21, N.Y.
Oct. 7, 1967
Mr. President:
This morning at about 11:30 A.M. I gave the following information to Miss------of Col. Draper's office to be transmitted to you. She said she would pass it on.
On either Sept.24 or 25th of this year when I emerged from the 50th St Station of the 8th Ave. Subway at about 5 A.M. and I reached the curb to cross westward I looked north up the avenue and saw an unusually large ball of light of a bright yellow cross she sky from west to a northeast direction. It seemed as large as my fist. It moved across the avenue about two thirds and then disappeared. I took it for a shooting star and told Mrs. ----- about it when I got home. Since the news of satellites appeared in the papers, I recalled this experience and suspect that what I had really seen at that time was the satellite. Perhaps your physicists can check this observation. I thought that this information might in some way be helpful.
Thanking you for your attention, I am
Most respectfully yours,
