DAYTON, OHIO

8 March 1950

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Object in Vicinity of
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

At approximately 7:45 A.M., I was informed by the Control
Tower that a pear-shaped object was sighted over the field. This
object was high over the field. The Tower told me this
object had been intermittently on their radar and that two airplanes
had been scrambled to investigate it. The pilots described it as
a long, round object about 30 ft. in diameter, approaching from
the north. By the time they reached it, the Control Tower had
lost the object sighted with their field glasses.

At approximately 8:15 A.M., Capt. C. Chiles from
took off in an F-80 to search for it. At this time end
they reported having the object visually located, and they gave its location
as about 1/8 mile southeast from the tower. They said it
did not know the altitude or distance from the station, but they
estimated it to be at 10,000 feet. These clouds were at an altitude of 5,000 ft.

At approximately 8:30 A.M., I called Colonel Gascopp of
the Electronic Surveillance to get any Radar assistance the
Division might be able to give. I also contacted Captain
Wilting of the All Weather Division for assistance in the
All Weather Center. Both were unable to locate the object at Dayton, Ohio.
At this time, the Vandalia Tower was still in visual contact
with the object. Their observer informed them it was definitely
not an aircraft, but they were unsuccessful in identifying it
as any known object. They were unable to identify any object or body or
anything.
