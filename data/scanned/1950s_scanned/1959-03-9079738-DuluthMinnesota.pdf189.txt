III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 9 March 1959 at 0840Z, 1st Lt. Tony A. Cox, Jr., Pilot, 11th FIS, Duluth Municipal Airport, Minnesota, observed a bright seemingly metallic object, in the Westerly direction at an altitude of approximately 20,000 ft. The object was reddish-orange in color and changed to a bright white luminosity. It appeared to be approximately three times the size of a B-29 Bomber and remained stationary. Lt. Cox called this sighting to the attention of other pilots in the flight. He maneuvered his aircraft in an attempt to close in on the object but the object then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. This incident lasted approximately 1 minute. The object was observed again at 0900Z when the flight returned to base. Attempts to contact the object by radio on UHF and VHF were made but no positive results.
