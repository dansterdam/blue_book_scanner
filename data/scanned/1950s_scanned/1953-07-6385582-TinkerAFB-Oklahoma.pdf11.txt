The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an observation of an unidentified object.

I saw this (1) object. It was white or silver in color. I would say that it had approximately a 20 to 30 foot diameter. It was almost directly overhead, and a little to the south. I sighted this object around 1935 and I watched it for about a minute.

I was uncertain as to the exact size, as I could not determine the distance to the object very well from the ground. I should think the object was visual from the ground. 

The object was almost directly overhead at a little under 2,000 feet altitude where I have been on the guard force at Tinker Air Force Base for some time. I then in the infantry (1.5) years. I was observing aircraft carriers observing aircraft.

There was very little surface winds. There was a small haze in the atmosphere.

It seemed to me that this object was around 1,000 feet to 1,500 feet. I don't know the exact altitude as there was no reflections or physical evidence of the object that I observed.
