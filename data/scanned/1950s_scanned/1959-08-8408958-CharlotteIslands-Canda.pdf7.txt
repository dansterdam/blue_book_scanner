STATEMENT
"At approximately 0540 Z I was notified by my Radar Operator reported a return 2 miles behind us in the # 3 position of a 3 ship cell. My gunner sighted what appeared to be a rotating beacon at 5 o'clock low and after about 10 minutes it descended and was lost. A check with "Consort" control revealed no reported traffic in the area.
After about 30 minutes we had another return in the same position for a period of 20 minutes it was intermittent. No visual contact was made but our tail radar had a return at 8,000 yards for a few minutes.
All ground stations reported no traffic or sightings."
