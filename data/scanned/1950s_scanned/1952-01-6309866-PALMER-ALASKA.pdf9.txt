5th and final
This end did not return
June 7-at about 7:15 p.m.
I was on the highway a short distance from Anchorage. About 3/4 mile south of Anchorage we looked up and saw an object in the sky quite high, white in color and seemed to be going at a very rapid rate. As it passed over us it did not make any sound. I looked like a large white object. The object just disappeared. There was no flame trailing the object. The object did not seem to get any larger or smaller as it passed over us. There was no other air traffic that we could see at the time.
There was no peculiarity in the maneuver -
It was very bright and quick.
