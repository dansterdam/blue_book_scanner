K. DONALDSON AFB TCO DUTY OFFICER. CELL WAS TAKEN FROM MPS
WHO SEEMED EXCITED AND REASONABLY SURE THAT OBJECT WAS
VERY NEAR. TOWER PERSONNEL FEELS THAT OBJECT COULD POSSIBLY
HAVE BEEN A METEORITE BUT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER AND EXPLOSION OF
OBJECT CAUSED DOUBT THAT IT WAS A METEORITE. MPS ESTIMATED
ALTITUDE AT 20,000 FT BUT TOWER COULD NOT GIVE AN ESTIMATE
BECAUSE DISTANCE TO OBJECT COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED. (2). NONE
