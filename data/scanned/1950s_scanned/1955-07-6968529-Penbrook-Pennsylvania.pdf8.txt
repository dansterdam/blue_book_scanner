The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and another curved line labeled "B" to illustrate how high the observed object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen and when it was last seen. 

The second sketch contains two larger drawings. The drawing on the left shows a landscape with buildings and mountains in the background, and a person standing in the foreground. The drawing on the right shows a more abstract landscape with a curved horizon line.

Based on the instructions provided, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
