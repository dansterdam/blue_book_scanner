IOD 24/27-5

the balloon previously  so referred at the scene alites was 4l-inches in diameter and had a burst rate of 12 psi which in turn created a large hole in the side of the balloon causing it to plunge to the ground. The object observed was seen to remain stationary for approximately 30 minutes and then it rose rapidly in a vertical manner and disappeared from view at an estimated height of approximately twenty-five (25) degrees. Before the balloon came into view, the object was observed because its movement and abnormal behavior attracted attention. As it rose to an estimated height of approximately three (3) miles, it was observed to change direction several times and its apparent size changed from the size of a dime to the size of a quarter, indicating its motion was neither straight nor uniform. It had been observed carefully through a telescope and binoculars.The size of the object was estmated to be approximately 25-30 feet in diameter. It's movement was absolutely silent and gave the impression of a controlled flight though it was an irregular shape rather than the usual streamlined shape of airplanes. The color of the object could not be determined due to the lack of sunlight. However, it's movements were so unusual and the silence of its flight so striking that it could not be dismissed as an ordinary aircraft. The report indicates the object was at all times clearly visible against the sky on a clear day and its motion was carefully observed through binoculars and a telescope.
