Some of the constellations are visible in the southern sky during October, which also brings an unusual solar eclipse visible from Antarctica.
BY JAMES STOKLEY
As the long nights of autumn return, we have the brilliance of stars of winter. There are many interesting and characteristic constellations to be found in the evening sky during October.
At present Venus is in Scorpio. It was, at the beginning of September, almost in the middle of the constellation. Now it has moved higher, and by the end of the month it will be near the bright star Antares, the heart of the Scorpion. Venus is by far the brightest object in the evening sky at present, some 35 times as bright as Antares, the nearest star.
The other naked-eye planets (Mercury, Mars and Jupiter) are also prominent in the evening sky during October. Mercury appears low in the west shortly after sunset, Mars is in the east, and Jupiter is in the southeast.
According to the map, we find that some of the constellations of the Zodiac are prominent. Scorpio, with Antares, can be found in the south. Libra, the Scales, is next to it, and to the east we see Ophiuchus, the Serpent-bearer. Above Scorpio is Sagittarius, the Archer, and further north is Aquila, the Eagle.
The course of the stars extending downward from the zenith shows the three prominent winter constellations - Cassiopeia, Perseus and Andromeda. Cassiopeia can be recognized by its conspicuous W-shaped figure.
The figure of Pegasus, the Winged Horse, is almost directly overhead. Beneath it is Aquarius, the Water-bearer, and to the east are the stars of Pisces, the Fishes.
This may be a good time to look for meteor showers, as the Zodiacal constellations are prominent. Prolonged observation often shows a number of "shooting stars," especially around the times of the meteor showers. These should not be confused with satellites or other artificial objects moving across the sky, which are seen quite often these nights.
