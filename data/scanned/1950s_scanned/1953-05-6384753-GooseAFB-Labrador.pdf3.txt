NEGATIVE ANSWER- THE CONTROLLER IN THE GOOSE TOWER ALSO TOLD ME THAT ONE PERSON WAS HURT AND ASSISTED FIRST AID. A LARGE OBJECT WAS SEEN FLYING OVER TURF STATION AND THEN IT CAME DOWN AND DUE SOUTH GOOSE AS AIRCRAFT WAS IN A PORT ORBIT WHICH WAS ABOUT IN THE SAME AREA WHERE FIRST SIGHTING. ACCORDING TO THE TOWER THE SIGNAL OFF THE OBJECT 22293792 WAS RECEIVED BY THEM, 2ND LT BROWN, WHOM THE TOWER RELAYED THIS TO.

I HAVE 1292 HOURS FLYING TIME OF WHICH 2080 HOURS ARE AS JET AIRCRAFT. THIS IS THE FIRST SIGHTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. ASIDE FROM THE STRANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE OBJECT, THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT IT WAS ITS TREMENDOUS SPEED AND THE APPARENT LACK OF ANY VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION. AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST SIGHTING IT WAS AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 2500-3000 FEET AND THE OBJECT CAME DIRECTLY TOWARD ME ATTAINED A SPEED OF PROBABLY 1000-1500 MPH AND THEN MAKE A SHARP 90 DEGREE TURN AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN ATTEMPTS TO MAKE RADIO CONTACT WITH IT. BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE CONTACT COULD HAVE CAUSED, I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO INTERCEPT OR FOLLOW IT. I HAVE A STATEMENT FOR THE 15-7 REPORT THAT I WAS PREPARING, CAPT EMBERS REPORT.
