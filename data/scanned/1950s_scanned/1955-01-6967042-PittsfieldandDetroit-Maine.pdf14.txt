Dear Major Foster:

This is in reply to your letter of 25 Dec 1954 concerning your intention to write a magazine article on an unidentified flying object sighting in Alaska during the winter of either 1954 or 1955.

In your letter you state that the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has a record of this sighting, therefore, the evaluation or solution must have been made locally as this office has no objection to your writing on this particular sighting for publication provided the manuscript is submitted to this office for security, accuracy and policy clearance in accordance with AFM 190-4.

Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
