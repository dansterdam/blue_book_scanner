the military office of Defense,
Washington, D.C.
Gentlemen, the celestial appearance.

I was waiting in the "Warehouse" Ahead of the 12.12.60 a 11.47, waiting. That your military office of Defense has observed an celestial body of unusual appearance, a strange object, entering in our atmosphere.

For compare with your observation I send you a little sketch about an appearance I watched by accident.

Now the facts:
The observation takes place at the 21.b.d 23.-- in Berlin-Dahlem, Grunewaldstrasse 12-13 (52 53/26) I was just a coming at the gate, when I saw a celestial body, coming from the West and going the East, at the rate, when I saw the celestial body, about 1 mile away. The object was roundisch, about 8-10 meter in diameter, with a diameter on the tail, which was visible flaring red some-like a tail. The body was a brilliant white, ball with a diameter of 0.1 - 0.15 m much greater than the tail. The light from the ground was brightly reflecting on the surface. The observation lasted not more than 2 seconds.
The light from the ground was mainly 30 - 40 times above my head a red the constellation of the "greater Bear" and reflecting and disappeared near the "Aries". And disappeared near the "Aries". It did not made no noise. 

Afterwards I call to the authorities, Berlin, Bundesgrenzschutz and made a report for my own remembrance. You receive it as a little bit enlarged to make all details to be sure. 

It is possible give an answer if my observation is an new or unusual appearance.

Excuse my funny style and the mistakes.

Respectfully
