STATEMENTS OF WITNESSES
1. On 9 October 1952, at approximately 2210 hours, I was on interior guard duty at the Laurinburg-Maxton Air Force Base, North Carolina. I observed an object in the sky approximately 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon in a north-westerly direction. The object appeared to be circular in shape, with a luminous glow around the edge, and a red light in the center. The object moved in a north-westerly direction, stopped, hovered, then moved again, repeating this maneuver several times. The object then made a rapid vertical ascent and disappeared from view. It was observed for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes.

I, the undersigned, heard a low humming sound from overhead while lying in the barracks. The object was about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. It was traveling at a constant speed and disappeared in a circular motion in about 2-3 minutes. A/2c DeMontel, who was on duty, observed the object at the same time from another location on the base.
