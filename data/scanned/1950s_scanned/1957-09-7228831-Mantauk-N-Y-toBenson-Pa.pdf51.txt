The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a declassified document related to Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text output from the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED
SAC aircraft: A check of the Omaha, Pa. Unit disclosed that there were two station on 6 Bept that dropped targets which triggered both the ground radar set and the airborne set. The targets had very irregular characteristics and the detection and characteristics of these targets were completely abnormal.
6. Other applicable units were checked.
3. Conclusions: In brief, the conclusions are as follows:
a. The information and data studied from all pertinent units appeared to be identified, and the fact contradictory to each other.
b. It is therefore impossible to draw any valid conclusions or make any indication that the targets were hostile or identifiable.
This report has not been channeled through the Electronics Division, and the results thereof cannot be transmitted immediately to your attention for subsequent transmission to ATIC in this report; in the opinion of the undersigned, should be of value to personnel involved in projects and forwarded to ATIN-481 for their possible guidance.
