Number two assumed lead, passing number one to left before disappearing to North-east. Observer was emphatic that objects were not conventional aircraft, and wrote down his observations as to speed, manoeuvres, weather, size and distance, although his report was not made to Air Force until after a "Flying Saucer" newspaper story appeared in Chicago papers.

This report is forwarded in compliance with AFI 200-5, dated 20 April 1952.
