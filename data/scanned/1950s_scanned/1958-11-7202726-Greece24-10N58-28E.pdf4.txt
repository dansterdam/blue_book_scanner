15 December 1958

Dear [redacted],

Craig is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 22 November 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object you saw on 20 March of this year in the vicinity of the ATHENS GULF.

The information received in your letter was limited, but it is to the effect that the Air Intelligence Center finds that the phenomena viewed by your group was a fireball. A fireball is a meteoric phenomenon identifiable by definition brighter than minus three magnitudes.

Fireballs do have a short trail, are sporadic in their origin and often change color in flight. A study of the factors leading out the irregularity of their occurrence, experienced astronomers rarely see more than one in their lifetime.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Intelligence Division
