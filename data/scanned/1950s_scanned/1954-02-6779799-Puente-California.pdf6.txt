REPORT MADE BY:  LEROY P. BETZ, S/A
REPORT MADE AT:  LGI / /13, Maywodd, California
TITLE: (Confidential) Unidentified Flying Objects sighted
BY: D / /13, Maywodd, California  
SYNOPSIS: This investigation requested by Colonel ARTHUR F. GEBICKI, District Commander, DGI /13, Maywaad, California, upon receipt of information that "an unknown object appearing above that location" was observed on 3 and 5 February 1954.
DETAILS: D / /13, Maywaad, California reported that while watching the sky on 3 and 5 February 1954, between approximately 1915 hours (7:15 p.m.) and 1945 hours (7:45 p.m.), an object appeared above that location which displayed various shapes and colors. The object was observed to move in apparently erratic flight paths, hovering at times and at other times moving at a considerable rate of speed. Witnesses stated the object appeared much larger than a normal aircraft, and cast a reflection on the ground below it. No definite shape could be determined, but the witnesses stated the object appeared to "change" shape and size during the observation. They further reported that the object seemed to ascend vertically at a high rate of speed when it finally departed the area. No sound was heard. Witnesses claimed that the object was visible to several local residents who also witnessed the incident.
