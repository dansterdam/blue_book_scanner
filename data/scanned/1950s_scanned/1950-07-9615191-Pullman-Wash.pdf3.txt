This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with a text block that states: "FAIRBANKS, Alaska - July 1 - (ATPR) - The Alaska air command today says that a flaming object that flashed across the sky over Fairbanks was a meteor, not a UFO as first reported."

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

NO CASE (Information Only)

Fairbanks, Alaska

FAIRBANKS, Alaska - July 1 - (ATPR) - The Alaska air command today says that a flaming object that flashed across the sky over Fairbanks was a meteor, not a UFO as first reported.
