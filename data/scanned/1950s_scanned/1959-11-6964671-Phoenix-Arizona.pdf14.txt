Transcribing the text from the document:

This is really a weird object that appeared over my house last night. I watched it for about an hour or so as it just hovered there. I called the Police and the Sheriff's Office, but they said they were not interested. The object finally just disappeared, but I'm still shaken up by the experience. I wish I could have gotten a photo of it, but the camera was not working. I hope this report is of some use to your investigation.
