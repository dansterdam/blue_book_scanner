SUMMARY. (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final comment paragraph. List indicators on lower left. Begin rest of report on AF form 112-Part II)
Unidentified objects with magnitude and sheer of size reported seen by four civilian and one Air Force officer off Ventura, California coast for an cumulative total of 66 seconds within a time span from 2105 hours to 2125 hours on 12 August 1953.
1. Objects illuminated in flight and appeared twice to some observers located on guard end of public pter in Ventura, California and once to an Air Force Radar Observer while standing on end of runway at Oxenrard Air Force Base, California.
2. Color of objects white in three appearances and red in another. In the latter instance, observers reported the possible objects close together, one red, one white.
3. Altitude of object unknown. Sound, trail or exhaust not detected, propulsion system not observed.
4. Observers considered reliable. Three are airmen at Point Mugu Naval Air Missile Test Center and another a Civil Air Patrol member. Air Force Officer is the Senior Radar Observer at Oxnard Air Force Base.
5. Jet aircraft were in vicinity of observation area, but neither aircrews nor GCI sites reported anything unusual.
6. The possibility that object might have been lights of F-94C Starfires was advanced to the observers, but they discounted theory due to total absence of soul on an usually quiet evening and also the very audible sound of planes in the area son after the observation.
    
    
COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Evaluation of information is C-3 due to above average intelligence of observers and their highly factual reports of the objects allegedly observed.
