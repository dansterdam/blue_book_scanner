STARS OR PLANETS

GENERAL
The planets, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are generally brighter than any star, but they twinkle very much less (unless very close to horizon). Stars twinkle a great deal and when near the horizon can give impression of flashing light in many colors.

1. Shapes: Brilliant - starlike.
2. Size: Never appreciable.
3. Color: Yellow with rainbow variations.
4. Speed: Stars apparent speed carry them from east to west in the course of the night but they are often reported as erratic. The effect is psychological, most people being unable to consider a point as moving stationary. Occasionally turbulence in the upper atmosphere can cause a star to appear to jump (rare) but somehow twinkling gives the impression of movement to many people.

5. Formation: There are no clusters of very bright stars but faint stars are grouped in their familiar constellations.
Notes: A report of 4 or 5 bright clustering lights would rule out stars.

6. Trail: None.
7. Sound: None.
8. Course: Always describe 24 hour circle around pole or sky from east to west.

9. Time in Sight: When clear, stars are always visible. Most stars rise or set during the course of the night. Stars low in western sky at dawn are difficult to see.
