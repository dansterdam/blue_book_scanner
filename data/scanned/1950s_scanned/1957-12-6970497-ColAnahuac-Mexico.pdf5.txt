The image appears to contain hand-drawn sketches of what seem to be UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) sightings. The sketches depict swirling, spiraling shapes that resemble tornado-like formations or vortices in the sky. There are three distinct sketches, each labeled with a figure number (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4). The location of the sighting is described as the Central Airport of Mexico City, with the date and time provided as 19-23-42N; 99-05-19W.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:
