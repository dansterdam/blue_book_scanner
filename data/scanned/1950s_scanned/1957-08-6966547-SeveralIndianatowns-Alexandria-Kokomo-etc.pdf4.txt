JECTS THROW INTO DITHER

'Saucers' Reported 
in Many Places

One or more unidentified flying objects, flashing red, blue, green and white lights, hovered over north central Indiana early today and sent residents scurrying to their telephones.

State police at the Marion County sheriff's office said the objects were sighted from Indianapolis northward as far as Portland.

They were reported from Alexandria, Kokomo, Elwood, Jonesboro, Gas City and Muncie. Some described them as circular in shape, others said they were cone-shaped.

At 12:24 a.m. a report from Alexandria said the objects moved about rapidly and seemed to be changing color as they did so. Some reports said the objects came in clusters and that there were five or six at one time.

Along with Indianapolis, residents from Gas City, Anderson, Muncie and Kokomo reported seeing the objects.

A state police bulletin included reports saying the lights seemed to be going off and on. There were flashing lights of many colors. The objects were reported moving at a high rate of speed.
Officers at the Marion County jail reported that most of the calls were made from frightened residents about the mystery objects.

There were flashing lights described as both green and red in color and moving at a fast rate of speed. Some said the objects were hovering and seemed to be giving off a possible gas or vapor. 

Indications that it was not just one object were that the reports came from several towns in an area of at least 100 miles.
