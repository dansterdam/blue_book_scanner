AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 15 April 1952
PLACE OF OBSERVATION: Western Pacific Ocean
DETAILS: 
1. A delayed report, received from the Intelligence Officer, 1500th Air Base Wing, Wheeler Air Force Base, T.H., reports that on 15 February 1952, a MATS (VR-3) aircraft, enroute from Travis Air Force Base to Hickam AFB, T.H., sighted an unidentified object. The pilot reported that at 0925 Hawaii time, his aircraft, while cruising at 13,500 feet, sighted a bright metallic object, circular in shape, and estimated to be approximately 40 feet in diameter. This object was observed for approximately 12 to 15 seconds and then disappeared at a very high rate of speed. The pilot stated that the aircraft was at an altitude of 13,500 feet and the object appeared to pass over the aircraft and climb out of sight at a tremendous rate of speed, estimated to be in excess of 3,000 feet per second. The pilot further stated that the incident was witnessed by the navigator and the flight engineer.

2. No other descriptive data was furnished this headquarters, and it is considered that the sighting may have been of a conventional nature. The drawing was reported to be tentatively of the opinion that the incident may have been of celestial origin.
