On the night of November 24, 1951, there was a definite indica- tion that a flying object with bluish-green lights was seen to fly over Washtenaw County, Michigan, according to a statement submitted by a Michigan field officer.   The object, he stated, was seen coming from the east and traveling at a high rate of speed, at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet or more, in a westerly direction. The object gave off a bluish-green light, and was observed for a period of approximately two or three minutes. It was also reported that in the area of Detroit, from a soldier on leave at Battle Creek, a similar experience was reported, apparently about the same time, and traveling in the same direction.   All those who reported the incident stated that the object seemed to be a jet propelled aircraft or some kind of unconventional aircraft. However, from the description given, it is evident that this was not a conventional aircraft, but rather some kind of unconventional aircraft or perhaps a flying saucer.   As this incident occurred during the period when much sighting and speculation was directed toward the so-called flying saucers, it is considered pertinent to include this report in this file.
