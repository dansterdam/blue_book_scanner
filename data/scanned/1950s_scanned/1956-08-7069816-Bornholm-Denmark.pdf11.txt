Bornholm Case (AW Base). The "electrification-temperature inversion" appears to be the electrical reaction of the OBECT with USAF was considered appropriate, considering the limited information.

The Bornholm Case.

There is inconsistent track data starting to accumulate on the matter of the track-whether it is certain, changing speed and direction rapidly, or whether the race characteristics are smooth, although speed spread appears considerable.

The distance to Picking up was from 15 to 20 identified object not larger than most commercial aircraft, but were appearing and disappearing rapidly. They were appearing true to the Azimuth "quick look" even though the objects were there one moment and very rapidly disappearing to re-appear, the next instant, at a different location. This indicates the presence of a track but with characteristics that are a bit confused.

It is the other sightings, it is not possible to make a thorough evaluation without scope, while more complete data with all possible information would be highly desirable.

RECOMMENDATION : In view of the other sightings, it is not possible to make a thorough evaluation without more complete data with all possible information would be highly desirable.
