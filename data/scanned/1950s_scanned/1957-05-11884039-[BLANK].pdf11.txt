COMMENTS: (for action, if necessary)

ATIC for final coordination.  The USAF certification has been accomplished and since a public consultation has AEC have been informed, the Regulation is ready for
publication.

2. No substantive changes have been made to the most recent ATIC revision
which would vitiate the support for co-accomplishing the revision as stated in paragraph 3 of Colonel Chappell's letter of 10 May 1957. The changes are essentially
editorial and clarifying in nature and serve merely to develop the organization and sequence of the Regulation which might provoke scrutiny or clarification. The changes arenecessitated by comments received from the field and are considered constructive because of public interest in UFOs, the subject regulation would receive close scrutiny and possible misunderstanding or policy regarding UFOs. Every effort was made to avoid any alteration which mightimpact adversely on the interest of the Regulation.
