The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the Office of Information Services, addressed to Mr. [REDACTED], discussing a report of a "burning object" over Houston, Texas on January 12, 1958. The letter mentions that without photographs or accurate measurements, it is difficult to definitively evaluate the sighting. It is signed by Lawrence J. Tacker, Major, USAF, Executive Officer, Public Information Division, Office of Information Services.

The text of the document is as follows:

15 April 1958

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 17 January concerning unidentified flying objects sightings.

The Air Force has no report of a burning object over Houston, Texas on 12 January 1958.

With reference to the objects sighted on 14 January 1958, they were probably high flying jet aircraft.

Without photographs, accurate azimuths, evaluations, description of time and identification based upon the observer's own description it is difficult, if not impossible, to definitely evaluate such sightings.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
Office of Information Services

Mr. [REDACTED]
Houston 6, Texas
