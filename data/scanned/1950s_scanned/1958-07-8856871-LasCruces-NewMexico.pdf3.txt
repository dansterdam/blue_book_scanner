Dear Captain:

The item on the eve of my departure for Moscow, and I am taking up my departure for the impression, first given my visit which it was on 27 July.

I honestly don't know which of the alternatives to give greater credit: certainly a possibility. I do not favor it myself very much, as a large saucer sighted according to observer who observed it.

Apropos of that, Dr. "XXXXX" called me just yesterday to report that the date on his letter is as follows: 3:27 UT (Zebra) July 25, 1958; 8:27 Mountain Time. An examination of the data (that is much more convincing, and omitting sparks as it went along) was first sighted at 12:00 am (EDT) on July 25, 1958, at a point approximately 10 miles ESE of Las Cruces, New Mexico, covered the 180 degrees in about 20 seconds, thus giving a speed of approximately 12,000 mph. This object was reported by 4 separate and reliable observers. The object departed on a trajectory toward the southeast.

It is too fast for a satellite unless the object were a foreign satellite. For instance, the Soviet satellites are going at the rate of 17,400 mph. Several people saw it, so I do not see how it could be a figment of imagination. However, until we have definite evidence that it was not a satellite, I would still consider that a possibility. How-ever, the slow-moving objects that intelligence has recently reported, I think are probably genuine, and even the very bright slow-moving objects, because intelligence data at a later date may reveal that some strange things were up there.
