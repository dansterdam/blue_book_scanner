AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

6th Bomb Wing, Heavy                      17-99-52   PAGE 3 OF 4 

In the first instance, HOLLYWOOD was tracking one object, holding it in the position, and the object was seen to disappear from the scope at point "C" and moved to an inverse bearing, reversed into position "D". Its rate of closure on object "A" was described as "faster than a jet".

In the second instance, SPINA was tracking an object in the position indicated by the diagram. The object appeared to be moving on an approximately the same course, speeding up and slowing down, and moving out of the scope. The object was a dark appearance and the scope indication was it was moving with the speed of the scope, indicating the object was a distance of 20-30 miles. It was not possible to determine whether this was a difference in the relative speed of the object or a difference in the scope presentation.

A total of nine objects were observed during the period 0825 to 0930. However, most of these cases were of a fleeting nature with the objects being detected for a very short period of time, giving only a small proportion of the cases which were in the atmosphere at the time. No identification has been made at this time. There is no indication where these objects came from or where they went to. All that is known about them is that a small proportion of the cases which were in the atmosphere at the time were detected and tracked on the scope.
