March 23-24, 1957: In News Letter #17 (p. 52) we described a UFO sighting over Oxnard AFB, California, in the early morning hours of March 23. In the evening of that same day numerous other reports were received from the same locality and nearby.

At 9:52 p.m., from Downey (about 40 miles southeast of Oxnard), a resident of Pasadena reported seeing a "silent, bright red object" in the south. At about 11:00, a resident began to come in from the Pasadena Hundreds of people along Colorado Street stared into the sky at an object. The Pasadena police on station on the ground confirmed that center received "many telephone calls reporting the object." They had reports that the UFO was "orange-red, flashing a bright white light." Some of the callers claimed they heard the "roar" of the object when the light flashed from it.

The Filter Center notified "our radar contact" (an unidentified object passed their radar screen).

Major E. H. Porter, Information Services Officer of the 27th Air Division, stated to a news media representative that " were not able to pick the object up on radar." No Air Force personnel saw the object. (Both of these statements appear on NICAP for details)

Bowers added that other reports had come from Los Angeles and (Oxnard) and he believed that the same object had been sighted up and down the coast. Among the Pasadena observers were Air Force T/Sgt. Dewey Crow and Ens. Wagner, thinking the object may have been a balloon, checked various sounding and tracking balloons, but failed to learn of any releases that might account for the object.

Finally, in the early morning hours of March 24, near Oxnard, a UFO "swooshed" low over a car driven by a member of the U.S. Navy. The UFO passed all the way to the other side of the U.S. Naval Station.

Finally, among the residents of Pasadena calling the news media were a few saying, "Summer issue, 4/25."
