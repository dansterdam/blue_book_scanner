STATEMENT

Voluntarily appeared before me, the undersigned, certain information regarding an incident which occurred in the vicinity of Biloxi, Miss, on the evening of 25 August 1952.

On the above date, at approximately 7:15 PM, I was standing in my back yard at Biloxi, Miss, when I noticed a bright light in the sky approximately 35 degrees above the horizon to the southwest of my location. This light was brilliantly illuminated and appeared to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter. As I continued to observe the object, it began to move in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. The object then stopped, hovered for a period of approximately 30 seconds, and then accelerated in a westerly direction at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The entire observation lasted approximately 45 seconds. The object did not appear to be an airplane, meteor, or any other known type of aerial vehicle, nor was there any sound associated with its movement. I have had considerable experience in observing aircraft and I am absolutely certain that the object I observed was not a conventional type of aircraft. 

I hope the above statement is of assistance in your investigation of this incident. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

Respectfully,
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED], Biloxi, Miss.
25 Aug 52
