**FLYING SAUCER OR SOMETHING?â€”No, not a flying saucer. Something. Actually, some ambitious jokester went to a lot of trouble for a hoax in Martinez, Cali. It's a-riddled washtub with toilet antennae rods taped with glowing red lights, and a parachute. It was found dangling from wire. That's officer Art Muilar showing it. (International Soundphoto)**
