Departed 4122, Va. for Goeburn, Va. Contacted Mr. concerning the objects he had observed.

(Case Tab C) Mr. and his family had been seeing strange lights in the area for a number of years. They drive around almost every night looking for them.

(3) Contacted Mr. of Goeburn, a forest ranger, who Mr. has observed the objects for about a year, hearing noises like a strong wind blowing through power lines.

b. Sunday, 7 June 1959.
(1) Departed Goeburn for Norton, Va. to look around the area.
This area of Virginia has only coal mining industries and there was found to be a large number of coke furnaces burning at all times. They are outdoor furnaces and an orange flame is emitted straight up through the top of the furnaces. They are located around Goeburn.
(2) Returned to Goeburn and contacted Mr. and Mrs. 
They couldn't remember the date of their sighting, but the sighting itself was still vivid in their minds (see Tab C). Their description of the three lights they saw was identical to the railroad right-of-way lights used in this area, except the strange lights were seen through the tops of some trees approximately 100 elevation from eye level. The trees were approximately fifty yards from observers.

c. Monday, 8 June 1959.
(1) Visited the Clinch Valley College located near Wise, Va. However, we could not talk to the individuals concerned with the UFO sightings as they were having an open house party for parents and relatives.
