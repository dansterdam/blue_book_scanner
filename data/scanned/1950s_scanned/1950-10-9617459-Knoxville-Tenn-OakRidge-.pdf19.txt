Description of object seen by Atomic Energy Commission Security Patrol Trooper at about 1230 hours on 12 October 1950, at (13) thousand feet, as reported by persons at Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies, Oak Ridge, Tenn:
The object was sighted at about 1230 hours on 12 October 1950, at (15) thousand feet, by an Atomic Energy Commission Security Patrol Trooper who was in a vehicle on the road between Knoxville and Oak Ridge, Tenn. When first seen, the object was estimated to be approximately one-fourth (1/4) of a mile long. The object then appeared to contract, and the "trail" followed the object. "It" then appeared to take the shape of a large ball, and then appeared to break into several smaller parts which scattered and seemed to fall. The object was a metallic color and reflected the sun. The entire incident lasted about two to three minutes. The object was reported via telephone that this object was a "falling object" as the object descended to land and then took off again. Attempts to approach the object, but when he got within fifty (50) feet of it, the object moved toward the Southeast at a high rate of speed, like a jet aircraft, and the witness was unable to keep the object in view. The Gatlinburg Air Force post was notified, and they stated they had no reports of jet flights in that area. No other reports have been received. UNCLASSIFIED
