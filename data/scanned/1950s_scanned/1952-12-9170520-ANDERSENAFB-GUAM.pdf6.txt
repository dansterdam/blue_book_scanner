SIGHTING OF MAJOR JAFFIN

On the morning of 19 Dec. 1952 while enroute from Kadena to Anderson AFB, Guam in an R-47G, as the pilot, I was flying in the left hand seat. Capt. McDonald, who was in the right hand seat, spotted an object which appear ed to be another aircraft in our vicinity, this object at times appeared to be another aircraft in our vicinity, at times appeared to be lighted and at other times it was not visible.

It was cylindrical in shape and I was unable to notice any distinguishing shape or marking section.  The tail colors of the object were not discernible to me; however, the body color was a luminous color and was moving horizontally in a westerly direction.

This incident occurred prior to our at 0700K, at the 10-mile boundary to Guam. I would estimate the time to be between 0645 and 0655 K. We were flying at 7000 feet and the object appeared to be at about 5000 or 6000 ft. Our ground speed was about 150 degrees at 150 degrees.

The object was easily discernible to me when first sighted but only remained in view for approximately 20-30 seconds. From the clouds and horizon, I estimated the distance between the object and our aircraft to be 20 - 25 miles.

Checking with Guam control at 0700K, I inquired if other aircraft were in the area and was informed that there were no other aircraft known to be airborne in the vicinity.
