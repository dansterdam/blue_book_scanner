10. COMMENTS: Observer noticed an unusually bright object in the sky, brighter than any star in the area. It moved slowly SW to NE at a steady speed, changing colors from red to green to violet to white. It was much larger than a star and did not blink or twinkle. Follow up investigation by Flight 2-0 revealed no evidence of the object sighted. The investigation was concluded because of insufficient evidence. It is the opinion of the investigating officer that the sighting was possibly astronomical in origin. Source has reputation for reliability, however some cases like this could lead to hallucinations.
