INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:
MR. HARRINGTON APPEARS TO BE A RELIABLE WITNESS. HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF OTHER REPORTED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. HOWEVER, WITHOUT CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DRAW ANY FIRM CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED.
