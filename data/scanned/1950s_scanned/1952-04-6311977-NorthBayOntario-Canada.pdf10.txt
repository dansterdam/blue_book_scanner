Flying Discs 
No Joke Now
In Air Force
The Air Force, which once laughed off flying saucer reports as products of over-ripe imaginations, today ordered its intelligence experts to study the causes of several discs tricking through the air over the North Bay, Ont., base.
Four airmen stationed at the North Bay base told their superiors they saw flying discs flash silently over the local air station and an RCAF statement said there was no reason to doubt the statements.
The men, described as veterans with several years' experience identifying conventional aircraft, said they spotted a "bright amber disc" in the sky over the airfield around 5:30 p.m. Saturday.
The object, they said, slowed down, paused momentarily, and then shot across the air field, stopped and then took off in the reverse direction. It climbed at tremendous speed and disappeared.
U.S. and R.C.M.P. telecommunications superintendents and G.C.C., an instrument technician, reported seeing a flying saucer the night of January 1. They said it appeared to be moving at supersonic speed.
One airman said Canandell said they turned the object for eight minutes and concluded it moved "exactly parallel to the earth". They said it changed direction slightly at times, sub-zooming and climbing and diving without a sound.
The Air Force quickly declined official comment about the latest saucers, whose sightings at one time were investigated thoroughly by the United States Air Force and declared questionable.
