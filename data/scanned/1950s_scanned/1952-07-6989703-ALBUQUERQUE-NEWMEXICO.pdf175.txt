There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

POSSIBILITY OF CONFUSION: The image was not confused with either the planet Venus which appeared larger than the actual image, or the cloud-like image which is produced. Bearings were different, and there was a distinct difference in color, size and shape while the image at original sighting was yellow and gave the impression of pulsating substanses and solidity.

The image was not confused with the moon, which did set a few minutes later (6:37 hours). The bearing or azimuth was 30 degrees less than that of the "sighting" seen. And the elevation was 25 degrees more than the actual sighting viewed. Additionally, the moon on July 29, 1952 was in its last quarter which would have made it appear elongated rather than appearing as the image.

The Albuquerque Air Force office at Kirtland AFB seems unlikely to have been mistaken for a weather balloon, since it would have been encounted at a much smaller angle. While a possibility existing, it would probably not have appeared quite so large if illuminated not by any actual source of light.

SUPPORTING WITNESSES: There were none present with the observer at the time of sighting.

I hereby certify that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

at Albuquerque, New Mexico, this 30th day of July, 1952.
