It would sometimes change direction abruptly, but maintained a steady, smooth pace. The object was bright and metallic, reflecting the sunlight. It seemed large, perhaps the size of a car, but it was difficult to judge the exact size given the distance. The object did not make any sound that I could hear. I have no explanation for what it was, but it did not resemble any aircraft that I'm familiar with. The way it moved and its unusual appearance made it stand out starkly against the clear sky.
