The image contains two black and white photographs, both showing a cityscape or skyline across a body of water, possibly a harbor or bay. The photographs appear to be low-quality reproductions or copies, as they have a grainy and somewhat distorted appearance. There are no obvious signs of any unidentified flying objects or other unusual phenomena in the images.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
5/6/56
P-M

BACKGROUND: The observer, who works for an engineering firm in downtown Boston, was on his way to lunch when he observed an unusual object in the sky over Boston Harbor.

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: The observer stated that the object was approximately 1 mile away and at an altitude of about 1500 feet. It appeared to be circular in shape, silver in color and about 40-50 feet in diameter. The object was moving very slowly across the sky in a north-to-south direction and did not make any sound. There was no trail or exhaust visible. The object was observed for about 5 minutes before it disappeared from view.

INVESTIGATOR'S NOTES: This case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The object's size, shape, color, lack of sound and slow, steady movement are all characteristics that do not match any known aircraft or other conventional object. The observer appears to be a reliable witness. No other reports of this object have been received.
