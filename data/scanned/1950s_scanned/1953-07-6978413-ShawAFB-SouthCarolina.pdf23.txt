18 - Very probably a meteor. Sending questionnaire. Ask your confirmation.
13 - Sending two questionnaires on this one since aerial and ground observation combined. Again this seems like a fast-flying object.
11 - Possibility have or upper air research balloons. Although our tracks on Moby Dick balloons show none in Arkansas for this date.

UAR activity starting from Carolina, area, prepare. Sending questionnaires to various observers involved. This is worth (COLDS) for local balloon release. Carrying this as unsolded.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

It has been a visiting since we have received any comments on the sightings and analysis to be given the cases. I am clearing base on 31 July but will have to see you if at all possible at Shaw AFB before I leave. I am going to Washington this Thursday this week on Press Release and new AF regulation for this project and expect to die to IV project in console.

Capt Ruppelt is due back today and are anxious to see him, and as I think I have told you, he will be predicting this project until my replacement arrives.

Best regards,

Bob Olsson
