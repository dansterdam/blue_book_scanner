1. The point of observation was 47 degrees 35' N and 117 degrees 25' W. This location is approximately 2 1/2 miles south of the junction of Ash St. & Maple, Spokane, Washington, at an elevation of approximately 1700 ft. above sea level. The object was first observed to the north at about 1300 and was under observation during the succeeding 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it disappeared from observation.

2. Neither observer professed much knowledge of aircraft, stating that neither one had ever been up in an airplane; however, they claimed to be able to identify various types of aircraft that every day fly over this area.

a. In the opinion of the observer, neither the weather conditions nor the convective activity nor the specific situation over the area could likely have induced the optical phenomenon observed.

b. The witnesses stated that the object came on the horizon from about the northwest, and seemed to hover and glide at times, but always maintained an altitude of approximately 2000 ft. above the ground, until it disappeared from view by descending gradually over a period of from 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

c. A thorough inspection of the area failed to reveal any tangible evidence of the phenomenon.

4. None.

5. Aircraft observed in local area at time of observation:
The Navy operations at Geiger Field reported negative on any Navy types in the air at the time. No aircraft of any type were sighted in the immediate vicinity at the same time as the unidentified object.

Spokane radio reported the arrival of three aircraft at Geiger Field, two Lockheed Loadstars and one B-26. All are returning from missions via air ways (Blue 5) and at this date were not considered in connection with the unidentified object.
