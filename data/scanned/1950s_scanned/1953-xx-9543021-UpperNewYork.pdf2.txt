The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a UFO analysis sheet with various fields filled out, including the location "Upper New York", the date "1952", the hour "Night", the satellite information, astronomical phenomena, radar analysis, natural phenomena, and aircraft/balloons/airships. The bottom part of the document discusses the "Evaluation of Source Reliability" and mentions that the witness did not report the sighting until November 1952, and that the construction of a later design would indicate that very little information was obtained.
