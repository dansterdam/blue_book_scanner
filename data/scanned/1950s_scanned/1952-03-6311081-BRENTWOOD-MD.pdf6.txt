Subject: Unidentified objects in sky

Gentlemen:

The picture on page 4 of today's Washington News of "V" formation of unidentified objects photographed over Lubbock, Tex. last August recalls to me a similar phenomenon observed here recently. 

The experience about which I am writing occurred either on October 30 or October 31 (November 1 or 2) in the middle of the day. I keep these objects in sight about one minute. 

When these objects were first sighted I was gazing west and a little north at an angle between 45 and 50 degrees with the ground. The objects appeared to be traveling north.

These objects were in the "V" formation. The two lines of the "V" did not come to a single point, but appeared to flutter, as though some of the objects, but not adjacent ones, were continuing dropping slightly, behaving somewhat differently from the others, then catching up with the main group. The objects appeared gray in color.

The size and speed of these objects and the distance from me would be greatly distorted by my judging any one of these factors. I was impressed by the apparent great speed of the formation - I thought at least two miles. I could not readily distinguish the individual objects. In my judgment the formational distance was less than a jet plane. It still appeared to be at a great altitude when it faded from my sight in the distance.

I am employed by the Interstate Commerce Commission.

Yours truly,
