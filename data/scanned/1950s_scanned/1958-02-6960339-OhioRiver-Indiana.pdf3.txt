There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be an excerpt from a project blue book UFO report document.

The text reads:

The Device is a magnetometer for remote measure ment of the strength of the earth's magnetic field. The sensing element being supported by a pendulus mounting shows that it measures the strength of the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field.

It was probably carried to a high altitude by a balloon and then transmitted field strength measurements by telemetry to a ground station.
