Canadian, Texas 													27 December 1952

I. Description of Incident

Several civilian eye-witnesses observed an unidentified aerial object between 2200 and 2300 hours CST, for two to three minutes. It was described as round, bluish-white light of high intensity and disappeared by going out of sight to the southwest. The object passed low overhead then appeared to climb upward at the end of the sighting. 

II. Discussion of Incident

Local air traffic has not been identified in this sighting. Pending this, the object appears to be a jet aircraft's exhaust seen at a low altitude, perhaps with its afterburner cut in. The night of sighting was extremely clear facilitating observation of any object crossing the sky. No jet noise was heard, however, the observers were in a moving car. The jet may have been based at Amarillo, a nearby air base. 

III. Conclusion

Possibly aircraft.
