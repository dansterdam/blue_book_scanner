CASE #9
29 JULY 1952
DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On the night of 29 July 1952 an Army station in Michigan observed an unidentified object. The object was described as being cone-shaped. The target was plotted at 350 knots on a 360 degree heading for 20 minutes.
Three F-94's were in the area making practice runs on a 3-25. One of these F-94's was requested by GCI to investigate the unknown target. The F-94 climbed out of the practice area on a heading of 270 degrees to 20,000'. GCI called and requested a visual search be made at 3 o'clock. A turn to 3 o'clock was started when the radar operator got a lock-on from a target at 2:30 o'clock level, 8 miles away. The lock-on was held for only 30 seconds. As the F-94 was turning, the target became a bright, flashing, object. The F-94 could not get close enough to the object because it was traveling at a speed of 750 knots or 360 degree turn followed 16 course minutes at an IAS of 350 knots at 21,000'. The light remained between 12 and 1 o'clock. At the time of the lock-on, the F-94 was 20 miles W of Port Huron, Michigan.
The GCI radar was tracking both the unidentified target and the F-94's on the scope. Since the F-94 could not close, it was assumed by GCI that the object increased its speed.
The other two F-94's were airborne, but they continued making practice runs on a 3-25 and were not in the area at the time of the sighting.
The stars, Capella, is directly in line with the F-94's line of flight and the F-94 would have been flying straight toward it. It is very low on the horizon and appears to be flashing green, blue, and red, etc. At first it was believed that this what the pilot saw, but when it was established that both the F-94 and the UFO were being carried on the same GCI, this could be ruled out.
It could be that this is a series of coincident weather phenomena affecting the
