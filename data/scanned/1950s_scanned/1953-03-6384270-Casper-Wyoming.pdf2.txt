Q. When you saw it, where was it flying?

A. (censored) Towards the south and south. It was about 10 degrees north of
southwest. I leaned against the building and took a sight across a light
pole top so I watched, and I got a fairly good estimate of its direction.
It was going just a little south of southwest, but I got its variation
when in a constant position with the right and left eye and came down
in the building gutter. My guess of its location was about two or three
miles away. I watched it two to three minutes which I thought to be a.
cloud due to its laminated front of different shades.

Q. You did not attempt to try to gauge between telephone lines, etc.?

A. (censored) No, there was no arrangement to get an accurate gage.

Q. You were once in a balloon cut-away in World War I. You know how they move?

A. (censored) Yes.

Q. Have either of you ever flown an aircraft?

A. (censored) No.
           (censored) Several times.

Q. Have you seen jet aircraft at night?

A. (censored) Yes.
           (censored) I do not recall whether I have or not, but I know in the
daylight.

Q. Ever seen jet aircraft at night, did this resemble the tail cone at night?

A2 (censored) No, not at all. The only brilliance I saw at all except in the
center of the tail was a radiant, reflecting lens as in a star. They were
quite distinct but very quickly became indistinct and dulled away as the
object got farther away.

Q. You said the lights seemed to be occasional intermittent on and off?

A. (censored) It would flick off for just a second, not in a regular
blinking pattern as to intervals.

Q. What would you say was the elapsed time from the time you saw it until it
disappeared?

A. (censored) Not over five minutes from the first sight until disappearance.
       (censored) I saw it about three minutes.
