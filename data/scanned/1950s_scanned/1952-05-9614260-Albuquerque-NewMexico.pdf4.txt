This page from the Project Blue Book report contains a text-based description of an incident, but does not include any photographs. The text is formatted as an "EXTRACT FROM STATUS REPORT #7" and provides details about the incident, such as the date, time, location, and description. However, the section describing the incident indicates that there were "three pinkish objects" observed, but no photograph of these objects is present on this particular page.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe all the text found in the document:
