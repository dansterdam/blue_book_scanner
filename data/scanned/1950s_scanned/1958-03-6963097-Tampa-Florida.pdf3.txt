There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document, specifically an "Office Memorandum" from the United States Government addressed to the Director of Intelligence, USAF, Att: AFCIN-2AL, from the Office of Program Planning, Directorate of Intelligence, with the subject "Unidentified Flying Object".

The text in the document is as follows:
