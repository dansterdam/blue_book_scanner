The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a "Disposition Form" which seems to be a form used to document details related to a UFO sighting or report. However, there is no photograph present in this particular image.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

DISPOSITION FORM
