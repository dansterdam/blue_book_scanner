The image appears to show a black and white photograph of a night sky over water, with a splash or disturbance on the water's surface. The text below the image reads "BAD CANCELING" and includes some handwritten notes, but does not identify any individuals.

As an OCR system, I would output the following text found in the document:

ACTUAL OBJECT AS MAN STATES
HORIZON
HARRISON
BAD CANCELING
