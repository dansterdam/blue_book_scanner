U.S. NAVAL STATION
NAVY SECTION UTILITY FLIGHT ZERO
San Francisco, California

Time: 2030/3
Date: 22 Mar 59
Incident: Sighted unidentified aerial vehicle
Position: Midway Island, Pacific Ocean
Time: 0235/4 (Local)
Altitude: 0350 (Local)
Speed: 0244 (Local)
Bearing: 0225 (Local)
Duration: 0233 (Local)
Remarks: Aircraft sighted by three officers at Midway Island during routine watch. Craft appeared to be cigar-shaped and exhibited no visible means of propulsion. It was larger than a jet fighter and traveling at a speed estimated to be 3 to 4 times faster than any known jet aircraft. The craft was witnessed for approximately 3 to 4 minutes before disappearing from view. No sound was heard and no lights were visible. The object was observed to be maneuvering erratically, with abrupt changes in direction and speed. I cannot identify the light or object sighted. I have known errors in the past to occur with human sighting and have seen objects in the sky that later proved to be natural phenomena. It is my considered opinion, however, that this sighting represents something out of the ordinary. I believe whoever was responsible for this report should not accept something unless it was true. To do so would be irresponsible. The object in the aircraft was, in the opinion of those who witnessed it, highly unusual and warranted further investigation.
