At approximately 9:35 p.m., the object was observed moving rapidly through the sky from north to south at the south edge of the base. The object appeared to be larger than a star and smaller than a planet. It seemed to have a flickering and flaming effect, and at times appeared oval or circular in shape.

The object gained speed and disappeared over the southern horizon. It was under observation for approximately 2-3 minutes. There were no apparent sound or other effects associated with the object. After it disappeared, the observers did not notice any trails or residual effects in the sky.
