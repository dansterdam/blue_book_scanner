FUTURE WORK
The available files will be coded and punched cards will be prepared. When cards for the sighting reports for one year are completed, preliminary statistical studies will begin. The results of these studies will be used to appraise the adequacy of all the forms and codes which have been devised. Necessary corrections and additions will be made after this limited study. Then, the remaining sighting reports will be analyzed statistically.
