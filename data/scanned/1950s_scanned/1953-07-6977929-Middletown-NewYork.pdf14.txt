The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and a point labeled "A" on it, representing an object above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second and third sketches show larger scenes, with one depicting a person standing on a road surrounded by a landscape, and the other showing a landscape with some clouds.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where the object was when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
