AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PE 1 600/4th AISS, APO 970 52-359 PAGE 2 of 4 PAGES

The report describes an observation made on 15 November 1952 by Capt. Bernard and Lt. Bernard, who were flying at 13,450 feet over Germany. They observed an unidentified object that was initially about 1 mile away, but gradually increased in size, indicating it was approaching the aircraft. The object was described as circular in shape, with a halo of hazy light around it. It was estimated to be 30-40 feet in diameter. The object appeared to be turning in a left-hand orbit around a central point, and the radius of the orbit continued increasing. The report provides details about the speed, size, and movements of the observed object.
