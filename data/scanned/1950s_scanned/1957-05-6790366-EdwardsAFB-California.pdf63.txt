OUTPUT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

SUBJECT: Detailed Analysis of Edwards AFB Base UFO Sighting - 2 May 57

(1) Testimony given by both observers is that the time of their sighting was between 0755 and 0820 (see attached copy of UFO questionnaire, Form 14-C).

(2) A rawinsonde balloon was released by the Edwards AFB weather station west of the observers, at 0745 hours and subsequently tracked until 0320 hours (UFO Report, 14 May 1957).

(3) Observers both estimate the bearing of the object to be 75 degrees when it first appears, continuing at 075 degrees.

(4) Official time-tracking of the balloon (UFO Report, 15 May 57) was as follows:
(a) 0750: True Bearing - 70 degrees
(b) 0800: True Bearing - 80 degrees
(c) 0810: True Bearing - 60 degrees

(5) Observers: interpolating for the first two time-tracks, the bearing is exactly 75 degrees. Using an average of all three, the bearing is 70 degrees.

(6) Observers' state that when first observed, their estimated altitude of the object was 45 degrees, and 15 degrees when it disappeared.

(7) A trigonometrical treatment of the data in the official UFO Report (Paragraph 6 (1)) indicates that the angle of elevation during the periods given by the observers was approximately 50 degrees and 22 degrees respectively.
