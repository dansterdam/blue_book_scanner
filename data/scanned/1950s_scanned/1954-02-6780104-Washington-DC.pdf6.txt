There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

It is reported that the object was not an airplane or a lookout for the following reasons: the extreme rate of speed of the object which enabled it to fade from view in such a manner, and the fact that it had changed direction in such a manner.

The text indicates that the surface was flat, and that this was substantiated when the object passed directly overhead as a witness. The text also mentions that the object was observed for a relatively short duration during the time it was visible.
