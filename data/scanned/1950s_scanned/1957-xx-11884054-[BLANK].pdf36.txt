It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a blank page with a text block at the top that reads: "This handbook has been prepared by laymen in the hope that it will provide guidance in the identification of flying objects which cannot be identified. Comments and suggestions for improvement will be welcome."
