UNCLASSIFIED

Technical data and radar performance characteristics associated with B-52 aircraft are non-existent at this time and as a consequence, the NORAD team was without a capability to effectively assess the target data derived and properly associate this data with B-52 characteristics.

At the time of the incident, Benton had one OA-99 PPI console on each of the three vertical beams and the Air Surveillance Officer used a fourth OA-99 to monitor all beams. Of these, only one OA-99, manned by two airmen, displayed the targets (first on the VH and then on the VG beams). No detection of BB-6 or BB-11 was made on any other scope in the station. No detections were made on FB-6 or on the VL or search beams of the FPS-10. The operating parameters of the FPS-10 were within normal operating limits. Weather at this station was low overcast with slight drizzle.

B. NORAD Team Observations: The NORAD team was unable to duplicate the above condition by scope analysis. ALL scopes had indications of interference patterns typical of those that would be generated by interference from other radars. The technical parameters associated with this type interference should not produce crossing tracks. The degree of this interference was not sufficient to deteriorate the performance of the station. The radar returns as described by the operations personnel indicate that these returns were not characteristic of normal radar targets. Except for the high rate of speed and unexplained variations in speed, the blips described a normal aircraft track. These blips differed from normal returns in that they were round in shape with very sharp edges.
