The text extracted from the document is as follows:

---

This sighting occurred about 8 hours later than the other sighting (same report number) - with all conditions similar except for time, duration of tracking, and direction of the track.

The temperature and altitude information are the same, indicating no temperature inversion. It would be unlikely that two meteor trails would be observed the same day, and 4 minutes seems too long for this type of target

There isnâ€™t sufficient data regarding the track direction, range, changes, etc., to enable a meaningful evaluation to be made.
