1. Girvis.
2. Ladd Air Force Base, Alaska, 147° 52' - 64° 49' N.
3. Unidentified airborne object (light) heading approximately 205° true at 2,000 feet altitude. On straight course for approximately one (1) minute then it started increasing its speed noticeably. Altitude 2,000 feet. Speed increased up to approximately 600 knots, travel 4½ miles in approximately two (2) minutes. Object white in color, oval in shape. Altitude 2,000 feet. Continued on 240° heading at 2,900 feet for approximately two (2) minutes. No jet or rocket stream noticed.
4. Normal number 55-2282, F-94A, Znd-Jett, F-94A.
One engine, 23,000 feet altitude, speed 600 knots per hour. Sighting, certain number 19-2522.
5. Not applicable.
Dictamen: Aircraft serial number 49-2522, F-94A. It is Donald A. Davies, Lt. Col. USAF, radar observer. Was on base leg to approach for landing when at last 18 Davies called attention to pilot on unknown object at 18,000 of 20,000 contact altitude, object moving from northeast to southwest to port. Target confirmed by pilot. The F-94A was heading 060°, target was heading 205° true, difference approximate 120°. When F-94A, serial number 29-2522, turned on base leg, heading approximately 220°, the object continued on heading approximately 205° same altitude. From position or base area target is passed to ascend at a reasonable rate with a probable control very soon at target characteristics. The object descend to light cloud cover, then reappeared same position at same altitude. The conclusion be able to affect on target was unlikely, at extreme altitude. Object unidentified speed with a maximum of 600 knots and position of observer. Object not audible. When on ground, nothing or a motor sound or engine could be heard as a very long distance with light to moderate visible haze. Upon landing (2) minutes after observation, pilot stated (2) ground crew members said it was pointed out again to the pilot and two (2) ground crew members. Then it broke up at 18,000 and speed until it looked like a falling star or meteor. Depending on the time, it continues to become clear until it is concluded it was a meteor with more luminescence and speed than normal. This would indicate the light was probably more red than before. Time 2050-2052.
