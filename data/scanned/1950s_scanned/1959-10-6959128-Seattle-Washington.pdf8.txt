Analysis and Conclusions: The weather conditions at the time of this sighting indicate that the objects were not normal aircraft or astronomical phenomena. The erratic flight patterns and the fact that the objects faded in the area of observation suggest that they were not satellites or other natural phenomena. The observers appear to be reliable and their report is consistent. It is therefore possible that the objects observed were of an unidentified nature.
