1. Lt. [REDACTED] was contacted and interviewed regarding his sighting of unidentified aerial objects over Artesia, New Mexico, on 10 January 1952.

(1951) Lt. [REDACTED] stated that on the night of 10 January 1952 at approximately 7:50 P.M., while on duty at the Artesia City Police Department in Artesia, New Mexico, he observed four bright lights in the sky which appeared to be about 1,000 feet in altitude and traveling at a very high rate of speed. The objects were observed for approximately 10 to 15 seconds before disappearing from view. Lt.
