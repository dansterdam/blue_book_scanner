It appears to be a page from an old report document with a text excerpt about a "Nuclear Test Today" scheduled for April 5, 1955 by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The text discusses the details of the upcoming nuclear test, including that it would be observed and evaluated, and that the test shot was planned to be touched off six miles above the plateau.

Nuclear Test Today
LAS VEGAS, Nev., April 5 (AP) - The United States Atomic Energy Commission announced today that it plans to conduct a nuclear test tomorrow, the first of a series scheduled. The test shot is an earlier shot than previously announced, the announcement said, there would be no further test tomorrow because of unfavorable weather. However, a later evaluation apparently indicated conditions suitable for the test, which was to be touched off six miles above the plateau at Yucca Flat.
