The image contains a drawing that appears to be a diagram related to the UFO report. The drawing shows mountains, a horizon, and an object labeled "observer" in the middle of the image.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION: This phenomenon was witnessed by two other observers at the same location. The observers are familiar with astronomy and have studied the necessary data on accurate dates. 

VISUAL CONDITIONS: The sky was cloudless. There was a full moon. It was an ideal night for observing phenomena.

I would like to state that the object seen was not a balloon or any well-known astronomical object with the exception of a meteor. One of the observers with a telescope described the object as seen to increase in brightness. It then disappeared and I watched them fall and I did not remember a trail.

This is a drawing of the phenomenon.
