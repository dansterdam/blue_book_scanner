Mysterious Object 
Seen Flying Over
City Early Today

At about 6:30 this morning, residents of this city reported sighting a mysterious flying object in the skies over the area.

But as usual, there was no official identification of the object. Pilots of commercial air liners flying near the vicinity could not confirm having seen the object.

Numerous eye-witness reports of the brilliant, fiery object varying in size and shape were called into the Columbus Air Force Base, but no definite conclusions could be drawn.

According to most reports, it was not a jet plane, satellite, meteor, or balloon. Some said it had the likeness of a silver ball, others said it had a brilliant, fiery appearance varying in size and shape.

In addition, some thought it might have been a jet or a meteorite, but the object moved at a tremendous speed and then seemed to disappear from view.
