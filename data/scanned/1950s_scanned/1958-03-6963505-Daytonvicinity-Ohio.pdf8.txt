Unless Venus Wears Tail

On the morning of March 6, The Daily News stated, a local expert and aviationist) mentioned that a UFO (unidentified foreign object) was spotted. Although many more sightings have occurred, this particular one was noted at approximately 7 o'clock that morning as it moved a small blinking light moving very slowly southeast from the vicinity of Dayton.

Bad Films Are Blight
On Whole Community

A theater in Oakwood showing Class "x" movies is what is going on and the public will not take. There are others waiting to add their blight to this community if steps are not taken immediately. This blight can breed into an uncontrollable scourge unless we stop it by public demand.

New Expense Wipes Out
Cost of Living Gains

Since the first of the year, we received a threecent-an-hour increase for cost of living when I work. This is $1.20 a week or $4.80 a month.

This same week I was informed that the rent raised 50 per month. Therefore, with a raise of 50 cents, I am actually losing $1.20 a month.

How anybody say the cost of living is helping the working man? I am against it 100 per cent.
