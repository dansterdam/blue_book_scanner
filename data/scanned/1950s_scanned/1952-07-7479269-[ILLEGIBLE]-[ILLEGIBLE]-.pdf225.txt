1. This anomalous propagation has been reported in the past at this site, and did not indicate the presence of any object at the time that unknown propagation was observed.

2. Yes, anomalous propagation has been observed. This condition did not exist.

3. No unusual effects of rain storms and lightning have been observed on this radar. Careful checks made to determine if unknown target could have been one of our own aircraft.

4. Was any interception attempted? If so, give details.
No

1. What technical personnel observed the unknown target? Have they been questioned regarding their opinions?

2. What is permanent record "tracks" made of the target positions as they appeared on the indicators? If so, attach to this report.

3. At what range, azimuth, altitude, and time was the target observed?
Approximate range was 150 nautical miles. Azimuth - 320Â°. Altitude - 35,000 ft. Duration - 0920Z - 0957z.

4. How did the target appear in size and shape as compared with conventional aircraft flown in this area? The target appears large in size and shape as compared with conventional aircraft. Its estimated speed was up to 600 mph.

5. Was the target of consistent size, or did it change rapidly? The target tended to vary in size up and down with a change of three (3) degrees.

6. Was the speed of the target constant or variable? Explain.
The speed of the target varied from approximately 130-600 mph and was observed to change along with the size of the target.
