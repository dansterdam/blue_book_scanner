The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program to investigate UFO sightings. The text in the document is as follows:

I saw a white spot in the air. It looked like a star, going out, 
there was no trail nor contrail. It came straight down very fast, and 
there was no sound. Where it went I can't say, it just vanished.

I don't know what this is, I can't think of this object. I watched it
with binoculars. I couldn't find it with binoculars when I scanned the 
sky. 

This object was directly overhead so finder air crews could have seen it. Idea how high it was.

From what I tell the present time I have been a member of the Air Force 
for several years and employed as a millwright air force base.

The weather was clear, I don't remember any clouds. There was something 
on the horizon but nothing unusual.

I have observed weather balloons, but never saw one as bright as this 
one was.

No fragments or physical evidence of the object were observed.
