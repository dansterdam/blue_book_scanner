Dear Sir:

I have searched in formation on a mysterious 
object which I saw following an airline. I hope 
if you can give me an answer. In what we saw, you 
will let me known. I have yet to think, that 
what I saw was not a flying saucer, but must 
have some logical explanation. I can assure you it 
was not any astronomical phenomena, because I 
am the avid student the astronomical 
attractions, and I know most of the astronomical 
objects, such as meteors, comets, or asteroids, and what 
it did look like. Please, if you can give me any 
information on this, please let me know.

Sincerely yours,
