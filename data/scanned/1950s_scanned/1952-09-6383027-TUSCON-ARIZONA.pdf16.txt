STATEMENT

At approximately 2230 hours, CST, 7 September 1952, my wife and I were visiting friends at Billy Mitchell Village. We were just leaving the premises when we noticed an unusual phenomenon in the sky. A dark opaque object, circular in shape, was observed and remained visible for approximately three seconds as it went out. This object appeared to be approximately fifteen miles distant at approximately twenty thousand feet altitude and appeared to be the size of a new halftone range.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
