AT 1530 HRS. ON THE BOARD OF THE AREA HOUSING THE P.I.D.'S OF THE AIR MEN ABOARD, I NOTICED MANY OF THE AIR MEN LOOKING OUT OF THE COMPARTMENTS AND OCCASIONALLY DIMINISHING IN BRILLIANCE. UNTIL IT APPEARED TO BE ROUND. IN COLOR IT WAS WHITE IN APPEARANCE AND IT DIMINISHED IN BRILLIANCE UNTIL IT FADED OUT COMPLETELY AT 1941. THE ROUND OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO BE STATIONARY FOR THE ENTIRE SIGHTED PERIOD FROM 1530 TO 1941. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 3 TO 4 MILES DISTANT AND AT AN ELEVATION OF APPROXIMATELY 15,000 FEET.
