Dear Sir:

Approximately on 22nd of May, I was traveling with my wife to the City of Nogales, Arizona. Around 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon when at the same time we saw that something came down from the sky like a meteor and ball surrounded by flames. Like he said it was around 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon and was traveling in south to north direction perpendicular to earth. I am sending you this information so if it might be of any interest to your investigation and I'm ready to indicate the place where I saw this phenomenon.

Sincerely yours,
