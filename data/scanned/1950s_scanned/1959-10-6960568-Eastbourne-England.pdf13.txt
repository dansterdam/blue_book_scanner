The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a project Blue Book document, which is a report on an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) incident.

1. A positive identification of the objects which appear in the attached photographs is not possible with the limited data available.

2. It is suggested that the negatives of these photographs be obtained, and also that more detailed information concerning the conditions under which the pictures were taken should be made available. As it is, the three images which were taken from an automobile? appear to be out of focus, and do not show the objects clearly.

3. The two photographs taken 26 Sep 60 show three images which cannot be explained from photo analysis. It is stated the objects did not appear until the photographs were developed.

4. The objects are out of focus which could mean either that they are very small and far away, or that the camera was not properly focused when they were photographed. It is suggested that the objects may have been retouched since the intensity of the dark objects is much greater than the other dark objects on these prints.
