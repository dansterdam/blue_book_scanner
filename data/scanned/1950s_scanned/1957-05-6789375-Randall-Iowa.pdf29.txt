On Monday April 22, 1957 at 1:00 P.M. Mr. &Mrs. ****** could be found in 
a little wooden cabin on the far side of their wine vineyards after lunch. Mrs. 
****** was washing the dishes when all of a sudden she heard a terrible racket and 
noise all around the little cabin. She ran outside and when she glanced up she ob- 
served an enormous whirlWLind of blue and red flames that at approximately 10 -15 
meters of" altitude began to descend on the vineyards. 

Frightened Mrs. ****** asked her husband to come' and join her and see what she 
was frightened about. The "thing" had the aspect of a cone of flames that were 
whirling around the thing itself at a slightly turning speed but the "thing" did 
not displace even slightly from its bearing. 

The flying object stopped for approximately 1 minute at 5 meters from the west- 
ern part of the field, It maintained itself at an altitude of approximately 5 me- 
ters from the ground. In the course of the first stop the vine stocks were strongly 
agitated and so was the ground as they underwent a sort of aspiration that was 
directed in an upward direction (therefore towards the apparatus) and the appara- 
tus was meanwhile violently whirling. The object whose giration on the spot was 
accompanied with a deafening sound, recovered the flight above the field and then 
descended towards the south at approximately 400 meters from the first stop at 
5 to 10 meters from a clump of trees (cherry trees) in a gap in the ground near a 
bridge. 

The gyrating cone created a violent turbulence (?) that brutally and roughly 
made the leaves and the branches of the trees shake. The latter, according to the 
witnesses, were bent in several manners. Their branches and leaves seem to be on 
the point of being yanked out. The cone of red and blue flames once more started 
on its slow course and trajectory and then climbed the direct side of a hill (at 
approximately 30 meters from the ground) then having reached the top of the hill 
it rapidly ascended into the sky at a very rapid rate of speed and disappeared. 
The latter disappeared in a North-Easterly direction.
