Attention: Major General Garland

Subject: Hampton Bays Sighting

Dear Sir:

Yesterday I visited Mrs. - and, without revealing any connection with ATIC, discussed her sightings with her. She gave some photographic slides she said were taken just outside the Police Station at Riverhead, New York, and the South Hampton Town Police.

Mrs. - appeared to be quite normal and appeared sincere in the information given in her report very accurately. As far as I could tell she did not appear to be delusional in her statements. For husband was away at the time and she said several of her neighbors also saw the object, so other experiences corroborate mainly in observing lights and small torpedo-like craft which showed no lifting mechanism which she said cast strange footprints which looked remarkably similar to your findings.

A number of strange "goings on" appear to bear very little relation to the sighting itself. Mrs. - was under the impression that she had called the State Police as she described to me that on her report. I checked in the Riverhead Station and the State Police had no record on the sighting of October 6, I talked to Patrolman Eng and he said that after watching the lights which did not appear to move in the manner that Mrs. - thought they moved, he came to the conclusion there was a reflection of headlights across the bay. After leaving Mrs. - he drove over to the scene but concluded that it was ordinary car following the movement as the craft. It might appear to someone unfamiliar with the area it might appear to be something quite unusual.
