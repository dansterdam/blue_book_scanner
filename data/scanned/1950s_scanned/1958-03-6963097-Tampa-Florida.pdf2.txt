March 2, 1958, Tampa, Florida:
Observers ST/T/Sgt. T. D. Nevels were dispatched by the USAF-7021st Air Intelligence Service Guard Squadron in response to a report from a Tampa/Hillsborough County Deputy Sheriff who reported seeing a bright light which he at first thought was a plane but then realized was not a normal aircraft. The observers ... reached the site within 8-10 minutes and observed an unidentified flying object which rose vertically and immediately disappeared at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes before the sighting.
