SUMMARY (Cont'd)
b. The object was sighted for only a very short duration--1-2 seconds--and it is impression of the observer that it was round. The object appeared to be quite small but a definite round, disc-like object.

c. The object maintained a fixed relative position and altitude without any appreciable visible motion.

g. The object appeared to vibrate--it also was likened unto a jellyfish, as one observer remarked, and contained no other distinguishing characteristics.

h. Sightings at regular 3 minute intervals except the last when only two sightings had elapsed.

2. Description of courses:
a. Observers were by chance looking skyward at the time. Object was estimated to be at an elevation angle of about 45 degrees and an azimuth of 235 degrees. The object was apparent for about 1 to 1 1/2 seconds, then disappeared and reappeared with a slightly different azimuth and elevation angle, but again the pass was basically north to south direction.
b. On the second observation the object was seen for about 1 second from an azimuth of 200 degrees and an elevation of about 40 degrees. The third sighting came from an azimuth of 210 degrees and an elevation of about 35 degrees. The fourth sighting was from an azimuth of 200 degrees and an elevation of about 30 degrees.
