UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FEATURE: 
PLACE: Hearne, Texas
DATE: 27 September 1952
TIME: 2107 hours
COUNTRY: United States
REPORT NO.: 
EVALUATOR: Intelligence Officer
SUMMARY: On 29 September 1952 information was received concerning a "flying saucer" sighting reported to the Bryan Air Force Base Control Tower by a Dr. ... and others. The informant, who is reportedly a member of a party of seven, allegedly had seen an object flying over Hearne, Texas, at 2107 hours. Few definite facts were given, and the phone connection was poor, causing the report to be rather sketchy. The accuracy of the information and reliability of the observers cannot be determined.
