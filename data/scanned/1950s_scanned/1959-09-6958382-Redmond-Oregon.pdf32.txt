APR 2 2 1960
Dear Senater Keating:

    This is in respome to your inquiry of 6 April 1960
in behalf of "mu""" ........concerning the unidentified
flying object sighting near Redmond, Oregon, on 24 September
1959. 

    As atated by Mr. _ _ .............. the National Investigations
Committee on .Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) asked the Secretary
of the Air Force for an explanation regarding this case.
The Air Force explanation was sent to NICAP on 25 March
1960 and a copy of this letter to Maj ..........
Director of NICAP, is inclosed. The letter is self-
explanatory and indicates that the finding of "insufficient
data" in this particular case was definitely a valid con-
clusion.

    I trust this information will be of assistance.


                                   Sincerely yours,



                                ?
