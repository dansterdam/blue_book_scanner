AF FORM 112â€”PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 3-D, 4602d AISS 
Incl: 1) PART ONE, Report # 3D-URF-1-56
Sgt. Kenneth C. Mckinley 

At approximately 8 PM Feb. 29, 1956, I was working at Ben Otto Motors in Hamburg when the station attendant called me to come out to look at a strange object in the sky. The object was first observed to the west of Lake Erie or Canada. It appeared to be slowly move in a pendulum motion against the wind. The object moved close enough for me to get a good look at it and it appeared to be round and glowing. It remained in sight for about 10 minutes and then seemed to disappear over Lake Erie near Buffalo. It came back about 9:15 and it still was in the sky but appeared farther away.
