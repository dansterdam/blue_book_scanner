The image contains two drawings, not photographs:

1. The first drawing is a demonstration of sighting an unidentified object. It shows a semi-circular frame, an arched trajectory marked with "A" at the beginning and "B" at the end, depicting the movement of the object across the sky. There is a burst of lines at the bottom left, suggesting the origin or movement direction of the object.

2. The second drawing is more detailed and depicts a view down a road lined with trees and houses, simulating a person's perspective. A small disk-like object is marked with dots forming a dashed line across the sky from left to right, starting at "A" and ending at "B," showing the observed path of the object overhead.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
