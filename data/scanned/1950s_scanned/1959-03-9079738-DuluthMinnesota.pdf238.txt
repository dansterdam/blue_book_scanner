WITNESS STATEMENT  On March 13, 1959 at 5:40 p.m. I observed an unidentified flying object in the sky. The object was approximately 1 mile west of the Bong Bridge, Duluth, Minnesota. It was moving in a southeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and about the size of a car. It had no wings, fins, or visible propulsion system. The object was traveling on a level course and was observed for a period of 8-10 seconds. There was no sound associated with the object. The weather conditions were clear and visibility was excellent. I am a licensed pilot with over 600 hours of flight time and this is the first time I have observed an unidentified flying object.
