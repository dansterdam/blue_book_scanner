AERIAL OBJECTS: 
At approximately 2:40 hours, 23 August 1952, Master Sergeant Frank Polk, Williams Air Force Base, Williams, Arizona, reported the sighting of several unidentified aerial objects. Polk was driving a 1941 Ford sedan on the highway approximately 12 miles west of Slagle Lake, La. He observed 5 lights moving across the sky in a southwesterly direction. The objects appeared to be disc-shaped, and emitted a glow. They were moving at a very high speed, Polk estimated their speed at 1000 mph. The objects were observed for approximately 3 to 4 seconds and blinked out instantaneously. 
CONCLUSIONS: 
All aircraft at a distance were moving away from the observer's location. No aircraft were found in the area which could explain the sightings. It is possible for the normal night sky to appear to contain moving lights which may be mistaken for unidentified aerial objects. Unless the aircraft involved can be positively identified, it is impossible to conclude whether the sightings represented conventional or unconventional aerial phenomena. The phenomena were of such short duration that no further investigation could be conducted.
