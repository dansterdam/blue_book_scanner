Transcribed text:

Received from Captain F. R. Brown, USAF, at Roswell, New Mexico, a strange message-like document, enclosed herewith, concerning angels or celestial beings. The document describes the visitation of several such celestial beings to a ranch, the "Holy Spirit" as they refer to themselves, and their pronouncements and warnings. According to the document, these celestial beings have been visiting the earth periodically and are known as the "Angels of Revelation".

ANGEL, is being a messenger of God. How many forms in his Bible are mentioned, we cannot tell. The angels mentioned, if quite at home here on the earth, as the document would indicate, and if we are assured they are "good angels", there is no need of alarm. But the document is confusing and uncertain. For the present, we can only marvel at this strange communication, which seems to be either a hoax, a delusion, or something beyond our present understanding. More investigation is needed.
