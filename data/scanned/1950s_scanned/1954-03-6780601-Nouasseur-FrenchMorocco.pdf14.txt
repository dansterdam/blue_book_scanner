On 6 March 1954, V/C GEORGE D. VAN DYKE, AF 11215726, stated that on that day at 1900 hours, he and four other officers of the 2402 base personnel were near the site of a crashed object which had occurred the prior evening. This report is in reference to the report submitted by V/C VAN DYKE. 

VAN DYKE stated that while inspecting the reports indicating the presence of unidentified objects which had appeared over this area, he had discovered that one report showed the objects were circling the Traffic Control Tower at the base, and that he was informed by USAF personnel that three persons had been in the room at the time and had witnessed the objects. VAN DYKE stated that conditions were as follows: (1) clear, (2) lights - runway in use - amber in color, (3) no wind. 

VAN DYKE further stated that USAF Air Traffic Control personnel had made certain observations which they did not wish to include in writing. These included such things as the objects' ability to accelerate from a standstill to high speed in the blink of an eye, and the fact that one of the objects came within 300 yards of the control tower and then rapidly climbed straight up until out of sight. VAN DYKE added that neither he nor the other 4 officers were able to make any worthwhile visual identification as the objects were extremely high and fast moving.

On 6 March 1954, Major RICHARD B. MC GANN, AO 798377, Wing Intelligence Officer, 406th Bomb Wing, USAF, stated that at approximately 1900 hours on 5 March 1954, an unidentified aerial object/objects was/were observed to make a high speed run over the base area. He said that the object(s) was/were observed by members of the 406th Bomb Wing and that they had not been able to make a positive identification of it/them.

On 6 March 1954, V/O JOSEPH K. GROSSMAN, AF 12384667, 1975-1 GCA Operator, stated that on 5 March 1954, at approximately 2030 hours, he had observed two unidentified aerial objects through the GCA radar scope. He said the objects were traveling at a very high rate of speed and that they were observed for approximately 10-15 seconds before disappearing from the scope. GROSSMAN added that the GCA had been tracking these objects and that their conditions were as described by VAN DYKE.
