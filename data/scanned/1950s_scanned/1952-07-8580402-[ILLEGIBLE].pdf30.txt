UNCLASSIFIED 

Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statements:

On 26 July 1952 at 0005 MST, I observed 8, 9 or 10 bright orange objects. From ground level, these objects were approximately 50Â°. The speed of these objects was faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen. 

I did not observe any exhaust or trail from these objects. They were flying in a triangular formation with the apex of the triangle appearing to be open. I observed these objects for approximately 3 or 4 seconds. They seemed to be traveling from west to east and were located north of my position. Ceiling was unlimited and visibility was approximately 50 miles. The winds at time of my observation were North 16 MPH.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 27th day of July 1952.
