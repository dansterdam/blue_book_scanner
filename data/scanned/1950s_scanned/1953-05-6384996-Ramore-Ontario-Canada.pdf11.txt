STATEMENT
On our way back to the base on the morning of May 21, 1953 about 0430 in the morning this object was following close to our car along the top of the hill. We kept on watching the strange object move along at a steady pace all the way up to the top of the hill. We asked the airman on duty if he had noticed the same object, but he hadn't. In fact when we brought the object to the attention of the Command we were pointed for a new incident, as far as they were concerned.
We raced up to the top of the hill to see if we could get a closer look at the object, but it was too far off of the top of the hill for us to get a good look at it. As we stopped the car and got our glasses to take a closer look, the object disappeared into the dark clouds. We waited while to see if it would come out of the clouds again, but it didn't so we reported it to the Commanding Officer.
