Gentlemen:

I wish to report a sighting of an unidentified flying object, called "flying saucer" in certain circles, on September 28, at about 11:25 P.M., while passing the street in front of my home.

The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed in a search-southeast-easterly direction and at very first sight seemed to be a meteorite but was traveling at a flat trajectory and was far larger than any meteorite I have observed. It disappeared past a rooftop. I would not venture to speculate as to its actual size or altitude. It seems to appear at each end of the disappearance "puffed up" as though by propulsion, etc., showing "speed trails" on aircraft (which in the latter are of course invisible).

My first impulse was to report this to the local office of the U.S. Weather Bureau, and then I decided to spend a few days thinking over this unusual experience. I am a former airline pilot, having flown thousands of hours, and am even hesitant to report this to anyone but my closest friends.

I feel that I am unusually qualified in my observation inasmuch as I am a former airline pilot. I am a Comm. airline pilot, having Airline Transport Certificate No. 4765.

The length of my sighting was from 1 to 1 1/2 seconds as nearly as it was possible to estimate. Other than the facts contained herein, there is nothing else I can add except to say that an airliner passed several seconds after the object disappeared.

It will be greatly appreciated if you will extend me the courtesy of an acknowledgement.

Yours very truly,
