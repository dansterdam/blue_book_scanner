There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

I remember reading a particular newspaper account which this woman had bid a child somewhere up in the New England area somewhere and there was litigated up in progress in connection with it and uh it so happened that this woman had hid a child and there well in any x case I went the RCA security gate at Patrick AFB and reported this incident. And he told me that this was a bit outside of his jurisdiction and that this uh kind of uh thing would have to be handled by the FBI and uh I would come back in about four days uh he would tell me something. Well uh I went back in about four days and I got absolutely nothing. Uh I went back at least once or twice more. And I got absolutely no information. Well uh it is safe to assume that this type of thing that when you don't get a negative or nothing is said it is a positive. In other words I believe that it was positive identification that I had the right people pegged. uh as a matter of fact after this I did a little investigation on my own. Now, I asked the RCA security chief what I should do. Shall I move? Uh no particular reason for you doing anything. Stay where you are at. At the particular time x I was slated to go back down range a missile range but uh to Magurana and so uh several days after this I left for Magurana again. I uh absolutely got no where. I have discussed this with the FBI.
