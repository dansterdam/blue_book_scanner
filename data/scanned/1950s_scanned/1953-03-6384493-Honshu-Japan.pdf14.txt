A: DETAILS:
1. The source whose information comprises this report, experienced two encounters with an unidentified flying object. These encounters are described as follows:
a. On 28 December 1952, at approximately 2330 (Japan time), while flying a routine operational night mission, the source sighted an unidentified object at an estimated altitude of 12,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 5-7 minutes. It appeared to be spherical in shape, emitting a bright orange-red glow which illuminated the surrounding area. The object seemed to be stationary and was observed by several pilots. The object suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed, making an abrupt 90 degree turn and disappearing from view.
b. On 29 December 1952, at approximately 0100 (Japan time), while flying a similar night mission, the source again sighted an unidentified object at an estimated altitude of 8,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes. It appeared to be spherical in shape, emitting a bright orange-red glow. The object made erratic movements, rapidly changing direction and speed. It suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.
2. The source was unable to obtain any photographs of the objects due to the poor visibility conditions existing at the time of the sightings.
