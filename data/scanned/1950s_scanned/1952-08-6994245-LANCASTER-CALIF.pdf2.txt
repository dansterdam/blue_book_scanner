While on patrol at location, two bright objects were observed in the southern skies, at the same altitude. The objects appeared to be stationary and then suddenly they appeared to descend toward the western horizon, for approximately five seconds, then stop and appeared to remain in that position for a few seconds. At this time one of the objects appeared to move in an easterly direction and traveled at a moderate rate of speed and parallel to the horizon, for approximately 10 seconds. At this time it appeared to turn in a southerly p__lyotion and disappeared from view.

The other object remained stationary for approximately 10 minutes and started to descend toward the horizon in downward pendulum like motion and disappeared from view.
