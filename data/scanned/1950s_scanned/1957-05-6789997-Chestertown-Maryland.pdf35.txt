by AITC. Mr. **** also stated that he "was sure he had
seen something but didn't know what it was." It was then
arranged to have an interview with Mrs. **** the following
morning at her **** Washington residence. Mr **** took
an extra AF Form #164 for Mrs. **** to complete.

b. Interview with Mrs. ****, ****, Washington, D.C.

   (1) Mrs. **** in substance gave the same account of subject
sighting as her husband, and submitted the completed AF
Form #164. Mrs. **** and the undersigned had approximately
an hour's discussion on the subject of UFO's and various
writers who have published books on the UFO's. Mrs. ****
stated she was positive they had seen an unusual object
but was of the firm opinion that it was man-made and
nothing of an extraterrestrial nature.

c. Interview with ****, 14 years old, at Wharton Creek,
a few miles from Chestertown, Maryland.

   (1) **** gave in substance the same account of the sight-
ing as had been given by his mother and father, and com-
pleted AF Form #164. He then agreed to take the under-
signed to the exact location of the sighting. This was
accomplished and photographs were taken of the area.
**** then accompanied the undersigned to Wharton Creek.

d. Interviews with seven persons at Wharton Creek Pier and Boat House.

   (1) These people did not give their names or addresses but as
they all either work at the pier or are fishermen there,
they would be available in the future if it should be
necessary to interrogate them again.

   (2) It was while interviewing these individuals that the only
reasonable solution was arrived at. These ten persons
all remembered the time and date as given by ****,
and this event was vivid in their minds because of a brush
Fire which occurred a few minutes after the sighting was
made; they all had seen the phenomenon and all agreed that
the cause of the sighting was an experiment from Aberdeen
Proving Grounds, which is located to the Northwest across
the creek or sound from the boat house. All seven stated
that they had in the past observed such experiments quite
often. None of these people completed AF Form #164 but
several forms were left with them at their requests. The
owner and operator of this boat house was not cooperative
and helpful, and stated that if he could be of any help in
the future to call on him personally.
