GLATTERING UFO MAKES REPAIRS
May 23, 1957: This report came in a letter from CSI member Jim McAshen, of Knoxville,
"A lady living some ten miles from Knoxville ran into something that shook her considerably. I talked to her several days after the incident. It occurred on Tuesday, May 21, and she didn't tell her husband about it until that night, when he got home. The sighting was at 10:10 p.m. She appeared seeing an object making a noise like a runaway power mower. When first noticed, the object was making a noise like a runaway power mower. She said it wasn't too high - just above tree-top level, and it seemed to bounce.
