AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

On the afternoon of 23 October 1954, at approximately 2213 PDT, I was on the eleventh tee at Merced Country Club golf course. With Captain [REDACTED], I heard a loud jet noise and saw the same jet circling in an easterly direction, and I observed a round, white, object, about 40 degrees elevation, traveling in a north to south path. The object appeared to be silhouetted against the sky and was about 1,000 to 2,000 feet. I was surprised with the speed and the jet sound. The object was similar to that produced when an air under high pressure escapes through a small orifice. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball. It was traveling in a north to south path. I watched it until it disappeared to the south in some clouds above the horizon.

I did not hear any further persons at the Country Club mention the object, although there were other persons playing golf at the same time. I do not recall any air traffic at the time of the observation.
