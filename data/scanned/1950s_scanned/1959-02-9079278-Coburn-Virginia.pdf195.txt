Transcription of the text in the document:

This is to tell the story of the light in the sky observed by Mr. M. V. coburn and other people at his home in Virginia on the night of February 5, 1959.

At about 8:45 PM on that date, Mr. Coburn and his family were in their home when they observed a bright light moving in the sky. It seemed to be hovering at times and changing directions. Several other people in the neighborhood also observed the light.

Mr. Coburn and his family watched the light for about half an hour. During this time, the light seemed to be coming closer and then moving away again. The light appeared to be very bright, like a welding arc, and was estimated to be about the size of a basketball.

After about half an hour, the light disappeared from view. Neither Mr. Coburn nor the other witnesses were able to determine what the light was or where it came from.
