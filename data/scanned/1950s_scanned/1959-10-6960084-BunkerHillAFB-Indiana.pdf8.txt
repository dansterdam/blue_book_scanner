Text from the document:

"Craft piloted in Dayton seemed to Tyne at an altitude of 700-800 ft and was maneuvering around in cirrular manner. Craft made no noise and showed no lights. Seemed disc shaped and appeared to be constructed of a dull gray material. Apparently went out of sight behind the clouds."
