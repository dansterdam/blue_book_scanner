The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a historical collection of UFO reports from the United States Air Force.

The text in the document is as follows:

AT BENTWATERS: - Colored object was observed visually for approximately 45 minutes. This object appeared to be orange-red in color and 20-30 feet in diameter. It was observed hovering at an altitude of between 500-1000 feet. Two pilots of the USAF interceptor squadron were vectored to investigate and made visual contact with the object. After approximately 45 minutes, the object accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from view. Ground observers on the base also confirmed the sighting.

THIS IS CONFIRMED by the original intelligence report which states that our radar observed the aerial lghting. Ground observers watched the same object through optical trackers. Radar picked it up later than the visual observers, but lost track of it as the object accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed. Visual sightings were confirmed as being of the same object. Observers were trained personnel. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and was observed over an extended period of time. Under atmospheric conditions, the object could not have been a meteor, shooting star, or any other celestial object. This event remains unexplained.
