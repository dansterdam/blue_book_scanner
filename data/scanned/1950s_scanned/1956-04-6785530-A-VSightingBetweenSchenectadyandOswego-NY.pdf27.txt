Dear Colonel Tacker:

I am inclosing the transcript of a tape recording made of the interview of Capt. - American Airlines pilot who on April 8, 1956 sighted an unidentified flying object over Schenectady, N.Y. Since you stated on the recent Garry way show that you were "unfamiliar with the existing Captain I though this account of his experience.

The actual tape recording is in our possession and we would be happy to arrange for you to hear it at your convenience. 

Sincerely yours,

(signed)
Richard Hall
Secretary of NICAP
