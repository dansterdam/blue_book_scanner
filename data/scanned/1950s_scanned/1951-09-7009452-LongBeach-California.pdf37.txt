STATEMENT
11 December 1951

1. Captain Omar J. Reichman, states: On the morning of 23 September, 1951, I was one of an element of two that scrambled at approximately 0700 hours. The nature of the scramble was to intercept an unidentified object over Long Beach Bay, California, arriving at approximately 30,000 feet. I was port orbit over position (118°40' W--33°20' N). I took up a Vector to Long Beach range at approximately 90° heading. At a period 30 seconds from Long Beach range, I say this object at 13 1/2 high above me. It appeared to be in a left orbit of an undetermined object.
At above 30,000-feet altitude, It continued on a left orbit and passed directly over me, port to starboard. It appeared to have about 15-15 yards or wingspan, and the speed of 450 and 500 mph. The prosecution of the object seemed very far away.
2. Did the pilot of your element also eye this object?
A. Yes. (Name: Jack C. Mace, Captain,)
Q. Did you attract his attention to the object?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. Did you satisfy yourself he saw and recognized object as pointed out?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. How did you accomplish this?
A. Over the radio, V.H.F.
Q. Is that on the same channel as Kill Deer?
A. Yes, that is the same information they reported, but they did not have object on the Radar scope.
