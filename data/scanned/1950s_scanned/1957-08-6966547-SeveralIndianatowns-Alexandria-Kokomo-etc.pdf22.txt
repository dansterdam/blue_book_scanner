Flying 'Object'

An unidentified flying object, in four gorgeous colors and almost as large as a house, was reported swarming across the sky near several Indiana towns today.

The strange object, said to have disappeared in the dawn after having been sighted over Alexandria, Kokomo, Anderson and other cities in central Indiana, was described in detail by eyewitnesses.

IN THE PERIOD between 12:45 a.m. and 3 a.m. it was reported traveling up, down and sideways in the air.

The "unidentified object" reported over Muncie early today was identified as a B-36 "flying tanker" state police officers said. There were no "green, blue, white and red" colors mentioned in any of the same "object" sightings at other towns.

Explosion of Dazzling Lighting like sky with combinations of red, white and green pale flashes and quivering, wavering motions were described by the witnesses.

Near Alexandria, Kokomo and Anderson, according to Jack M. Herson, a Kokomo attorney, the object hovered and manoeuvered for several minutes.

According to Deputy Sheriff Roscoe Pattison, who watched it from 3 a.m. until daylight, "it didn't seem to be an aircraft in an aerial refueling operation. They said they watched a revolving searchlight beam coming from the object."

Deputy Pattison said he watched it from 3 a.m. until daylight. "I couldn't see it any more, he said.

A BAKER HILL, a businessman, said the object didn't leave any trail as it moved swiftly through the sky. "It was doing things no known aircraft could do," he said.

"It had a peculiar pink and orange color and would change shape. Sometimes it would appear as a round, glowing object, and then change as you watched it," Hill added.
