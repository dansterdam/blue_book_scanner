REMARKS
1. Put in an urgent case to Hqtrls. Replied that 1/53
case was closed - did not warrant further search.
Would like to have them look at this again.

2. Returned the original material that had been sent out 
earlier in the week to ATIC under cover letter.

3. All information has been furnished to the project by
the reporter. Nothing more is required at this time.
