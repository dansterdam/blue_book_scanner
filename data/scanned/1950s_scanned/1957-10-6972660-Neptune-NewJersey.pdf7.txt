Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a sketch of the sky on the date and at the time when I first saw what I believe to have been a Sputnik.

I first picked up the object through the rocket shaped eyepieces of my 8" - 35mm binoculars, having a fairly wide field of view. I picked up the satellite at approximately 7:20 p.m. as scheduled, in the center of the field of view and followed it across the sky for some time, estimating it with the 8"-35mm binoculars having a field of approximately 3 degrees.

I picked up the satellite at approximately 7:20 as scheduled, and followed it across the sky for some time, estimating the speed to be approximately 18,000 mph as compared with the speed of a jet aircraft which I had observed earlier in the evening. The object which I viewed appeared to be double the size of a star and moving at a very high rate of speed. I could not hear it as there was a complete absence of sound.

The glasses showed that the object traversed the sky in a diagonal path from northeast to southwest and disappeared over the horizon. I could not hear it as it passed overhead, and I would have had to strain my eyes to the utmost to keep it in view after it had passed the zenith.

It seems that the object and Sputnik appeared to be double the size as compared with what I have read about Sputnik.

If you care to correspond with me I'll appreciate it.

Sincerely yours,
