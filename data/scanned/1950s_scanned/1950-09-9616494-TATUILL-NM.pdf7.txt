UNCLASSIFIED AF 3-2636

SUMMARY:   At an unidentified airborne object, circular in shape, was observed by source near Datil, New Mexico, on 21 September 1950. Observations were made while source was driving: a round, disc-like object, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, was hovering at a low altitude according to the source's estimate. After a few minutes the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. A follow-up letter from source to Wing Intelligence Officer of this Wing states that an object, similar in shape, was observed on the previous day, 20 September 1950, in the same general area.

A few hours later, on the same date, an unidentified air-borne object was sighted by members of this command (see IR 209-75-3, dated 26 Sep 1950).
