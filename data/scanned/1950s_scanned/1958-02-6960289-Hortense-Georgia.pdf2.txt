SATIS-3/14/30 Tacker 3/4/58

5 March 1958

DEAR MR. 

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 5 February 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object you sighted.

A thorough check with radar stations and other operational units in the locality show no unusual reports on 3 February 1958.

The characteristics and maneuvers described in your letter suggest a small glider or large model airplane.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
