March 14, 1959

At 8:15 p.m. patrol officer Edward Mathias, driving a patrol car, observed moving lights in the sky. They appeared to be at a considerable distance, and moved in a northerly direction at a rapid rate of speed. Mathias observed the lights for approximately 10 minutes before they disappeared from sight.

Mathias reported the incident to the desk sergeant, who in turn notified the Civil Defense Director, C.V. Hudgins. Hudgins obtained a report from Mathias and forwarded it to the Air Force. This report constitutes the initial report on this incident.
