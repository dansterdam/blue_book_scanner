III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE had been told about an unusual object which he had seen through a telescope on the evening of 12/29/55. The object was described as being cigar-shaped and twice as long as it was wide, and yellow-orange in color. The object rose from the ground vertically to a high altitude, turned, and flew off at a high rate of speed. The time was 22/06/55 and the object was observed for approximately 30 minutes.

SOURCE viewed the object for approximately 30 minutes during which time he felt it to be at a distance of 1/2 mile away. SOURCE stated that he had seen no exhaust coming from the object. Object would appear to flash out at intervals and then reappear at another spot. SOURCE felt he could have made a valid estimate of the object's size and distance.
