Mr. * * * was seriously interested in "flying saucers" and read all the books and articles he could find on them. He stated that he believed there were such things and contended that they generated their power through magnetic force and also through absorbing energy from the sun. It was his opinion that these objects were from other planets, Mars or Venus, and that they should not think of us from here as being of any consequence. His information was that the occupants of these objects from another planet had to have gears to land in or on, therefore, it was his opinion that it is quite likely they are probably traveling along lower California and that the occupants are probably prospecting.
Mr. * * * was seriously injured in a fire approximately two (2) years ago, and is carrying scars and seriously injuring his hand.

While interviewing Mr. and Mrs. * * * (sic), he was introduced to the writer and when she learned what he (Mr. * * *) was being questioned about, she remarked: "I bet I could see a 'flying saucer' if I went out and looked for one long enough and used my imagination!" (ACESIONED)
