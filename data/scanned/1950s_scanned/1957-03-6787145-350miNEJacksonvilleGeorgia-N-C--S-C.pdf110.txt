In answer to your questions - there was nothing unusual about our flight before a sudden maneuver except for bad weather up until an hour, or less, before we were thrown upwards - I did not observe the object which caused the pilot to out the plane into a steep climb - One engine was not working after this encounter - or maybe this was the case before the sudden climb.
