Flight condition was right at dusk, around 1900. In this area it was still light enough to see most things. The objects looked to be about the size of a good many stars. There were 5 or 6 of them, some closer in the sky. As a matter of fact the other object as they were going off seemed to be in the sky. As I was watching the objects they seemed to be traveling in a straight line, behind each other, one following the other. The time of day is was, just before the stars came out. I have observed many aircraft at this time of day and these objects did not behave like any aircraft I have ever seen. They were traveling very, very bright light. It was a very bright light which seemed to be directed or focused on a spot. The objects would come to one spot and then it would come on another spot as if they were trying to light up a certain area. What they were doing I do not know, but it was something I have never seen before. The objects appeared to be about the size of stars, but much brighter. As near as I could see and from where I was, it would be between 15 and 20 miles due south of here.
I should say within 20 miles. Not closer than 20 miles. Well, it was closer than 20 but not as close as 15 miles. How close, I was not able to determine. However, I was not able to determine the exact location, but I know they were over 15 miles and not closer than 20 miles. Now on the size, the objects were about the size of stars, but much brighter. As I recall any size which is about the size of the largest star, a bright star.
I was observed of this daily, for a period of 15 days, continued every night and day, a total of 15 days and 2 months and 28 days naval service.
