OUTPUT OF OCR:

SUMMARY OF REPORTS (This would serve a dual purpose by allowing anticipation of the types and kinds of reports which might be received under this program, and also by giving heavy consideration to the psychological aspects of the program. Should the project now under consideration become unclassified, this report should also give heavy consideration to the psychological aspects involved making for a program that will be acceptable to the public.

The report should give such consideration to the following:

1. The best immediate solution to the UFO program is to discontinue the program. This recommendation is made to the ASAF with SAFIS, AFCIN, and AIS-4n. The program under BLUE BOOK should be eliminated as a specific project.

2. It is recommended that this study be suppressed and forwarded to the ASAF. If for consideration, this is the proposed action: It is recommended to the Air Force Chief of Staff for consideration and possible disapproval of the AFOIR-11.8 project, which is currently unclassified and has become increasingly difficult to maintain in a covert manner.
