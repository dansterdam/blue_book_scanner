WEST PALM BEACH, FLA., Aug. 8 (AP) - A deputy sheriff and two boys who "could not stand the strain" told of their encounter with a strange object in the sky near here Thursday night. 

The object, they said, was about three feet thick at the edges and high enough at the center for men to stand erect inside.

The deputy sheriff, identified as Dallas Towne of Palm Beach, said the object was spotted about 8:30 p.m. Thursday. 

"He was excited, as though he'd seen a ghost," the reporter said. Towne would say only that he had reported his experience to the Air Force headquarters in West Palm Beach.

To the two boys, as described by the reporter, the object "looked like a huge bowl of dull metal, about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, hovering some 50 to 75 feet above the ground."

"It was silent, and gave off a strange force or attraction which the boys said they could feel," the reporter wrote. 

The boys, described only as "young," said they were so frightened that they could not stand the strain of looking at the object any longer and ran home.

Towne told the reporter that he "could not discuss the incident further" on orders "from above."
