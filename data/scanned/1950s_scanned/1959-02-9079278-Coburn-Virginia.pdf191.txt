The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" placed on it, indicating the point where the observer saw the object. The sketch is meant to demonstrate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with a person standing in the foreground and a curved object in the sky. This sketch is intended to demonstrate the position of the object when the observer first saw it.

The third sketch shows a more distant landscape view, with a person standing in the foreground and a curved object in the sky. This sketch is likely an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
