FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 23-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS appeared to carry on a dogfight, momentarily they appeared in a "diamond" formation extending over an area of about four miles. Since the witnesses were looking into the sun at objects fifteen or twenty'miles away, they found it difficult to follow the course of any one for any length of time.

The objects looked like balloons, behaved like balloons, and weather balloons had been released in the area that day. Conclusion: the "machines" were weather balloons [?].
