The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report on an incident related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text extracted from the document:

"Those were eight of us who saw the object. We all have astronomical experience, so we know that this was not something ordinary or conventional.

The object was oval rather than round.

The object was extremely brilliance to the observation of the binoculars.

I have in the past made other occasions seen UFO's. On these two occasions I saw a UFO while flying a light airplane, and he object happened between ourselves and some distance ahead of our aircraft.

I shall be glad to answer any more questions on these sightings, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,
Cincinnati 24, Ohio."
