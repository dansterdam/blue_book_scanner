SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
ORIGINATING AGENCY IR-3-58
8a All-Reporting Ground Center (ARDC)
DATE 5 Nov 58
R. Comments of the Reporting Officer (Cont'd)
The technical facilities contacted at Eglin AFB had no corroborative information. The film condition could not be determined accurately due to the deterioration from handling. The film condition and possible distortion or changes in the image could not be determined. No definitive conclusion could be arrived at from the available information due to the lack of correlation with other known data.
