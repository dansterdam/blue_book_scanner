The standard procedure to be followed on any incident of this nature requires:

That the course of the balloons would depend upon the wind velocity and the altitude of the balloons, that the observation as to the objects traveling in a southwest direction, which was the case of Santa Maria, which is 175 miles North and West of Long Beach, and is south to Long Beach. That the balloon of 50,000 feet was the same as the one observed.
2. Special Agent THOMAS MC ARDLE was advised by Lt. Commander Dr. C. WEST, Weather Station Officer, to the effect that his station on 23 September 1951 released a balloon which attained an altitude of some 60,000 feet before it burst. San Diego is approximately 150 miles south of Long Beach.
3. All of the above weather officers stated that there was no possible
ability that the 24-58 object sighted were any of these balloons which had been released, however each stated that it was determined that this was identified as a project balloon.
4. This matter was coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Los Angeles, The Office of Naval Intelligence in Los Angeles, and the Counter Intelligence Corps, Fort MacArthur, California. None of these agencies had received any information indicating any identification or relation to this matter.
