The attached report, together with photographs, are forwarded for your information. These photographs were analyzed by two photographic analysts at this Command and discussed with an astronomer.

1. It was concluded that the object which can be seen in the sky on these photographs is the moon, the unusual shape being caused by the movement (possibly five to ten minutes). The variation in brilliance along the image probably was caused by clouds dimming the moon during portions of the time.

2. A new moon came up on 15 March 1950. On 20 March 1950, at the time of the sighting (about 1830 hours), a sharply defined crescent would be the only portion of the moon illuminated. This further confirms the above conclusion.

3. In addition, a close look at the photograph (see lower right hand corner) shows a streak of light which is typical of that caused by a moving ground vehicle on a long exposure photograph.

No further action on this incident is contemplated by this Command.
