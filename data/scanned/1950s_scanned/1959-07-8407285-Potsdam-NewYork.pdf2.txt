AB,

Secretary of Defense
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir,

The following experience and observation
is one which I believe should be reported to
the proper authorities. On the evening of July
10, 1959 between 8:30 and 9:00, while driving,
a friend and I noticed in the sky, consider-
ably above the horizon, a streak of brilliant
light (like lightning but constant), about
three feet long; it appeared to be about one inch
thick. There was a space of about one foot
and then there was a second one. These two
appeared to be moving rapidly. My friend said,
there was a brighter light at the front.
We watched as closely as we could for about
??? minutes, but before we could park the car
they gradually grew faint and out of sight. They
???? ???????? ??? (at least we saw them in
the western sky.) Potsdam is in northern N.Y. state
