Text extracted from the document:

A CIAM-LIKE HAND REACHED DOWN FROM THE OVERHEAD THAT SEEMED TO SHIELD THE FRONT DOOR FROM RAIN. SEVERAL INSIDE THE BUILDING SAW THE REACHING HAND AND SCREAMED TO ___ DARTING OUTSIDE...
TURNED THE SHOTGUN UP TO THE ONE SIDE...FIRED...AND KNOCKED HIM OVER THE ROOF. APPARENTLY IT DIDN'T HARM IT HOWEVER... AS IT FLOATED TO THE OTHER SIDE...LANDING ON THE GROUND WITHOUT A NOISE.
IT THEN SCURRIED OFF INTO THE UNDERGROWTH. SEVERAL OF THE MEN WERE OUT MUCH COURAGE AND THEY DISCOVERED ANOTHER ONE A LITTLE FURTHER UP IN THE TREES...AND ONE A FEARED FROM AROUND THE CORNER RIGHT IN FRONT OF __. HE BROUGHT THE SHOTGUN TO BEAR ON THE LITTLE FELLOW...AND FIRED AT POINT BLANK RANGE...AND WHEN STOOD IN AMAZEMENT AS IT PLIED OVER...
GOT UP...AND RAN AWAY WITHOUT SEEMINGLY BEING HURT. WHEN A DIRECT BLAST FROM A TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN DIDN'T SEEM TO AFFECT THE CREATURES...THEY DECIDED THE OBVIOUS...THEY'LL LEAVE THEM ALONE.
THEY ALL RETIRED TO THEIR HOUSES...AND THEY DECIDED TO FEAR WHAT NEXT TO DO. 
THE OBJECTS WOULD APPEAR AT A WINDOW OR DOORWAY...THE FAMILY WOULD FIRE...AND THE OBJECTS WOULD MESSENLY RUN FOR COVER.
SOMEONE THEN DISCOVERED THEY WERE ADVERSE TO LIGHT...THERE EYES YOU'LL REMEMBER WERE LARGE...AND APPARENTLY EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT. SO THEY TURNED ON THE FRONT _______ LIGHT...WHICH SEEMED TO STOP THEM FROM ADVANCING FROM THAT DIRECTION.
AFTER THREE HOURS OF THIS...THE FAMILY DECIDED TO GO AFTER HELP. IT HAD NO PHONE IN THE HOUSE. THE FAMILY GOT INTO THE CAR...AND SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVED AT THE HOPKINSVILLE POLICE STATION. AFTER RELAYING THEIR TALE TO POLICE...A WHOLE POSSE OF HOPKINSVILLE POLICE, STATE TROOPERS, AND SHERIFF'S OFFICERS DESCENDED UPON THE SCENE. THEY FOUND NOTHING. HERE, HOWEVER, WE MIGHT CONJECTURE A BIT...THE OBJECTS DID NOT LIKE LIGHT, AND WE CAN SAFELY ASSUME THAT
