OCR text output:

QOMDRATIG
OR ELSE RECEIVED VERY EXPERIENCED COACHING WHEN MAKING THE
REPORT BECAUSE HE HAS ATTEMPTED TO ELIMINATE ALL POSSIBLE
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE ASKED BY PERSONS IN THE PHOTOGRA-
PHIC PROFESSION. EXAMPLE: IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH HE
STATED THAT HE ADVANCED FILM AS PRECAUTION AGAINST DOUBLE
EXPOSURE. AFTER READING THE REPORT, THE READER IS LEFT
WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS ATTEMPTING
TO COVER ALL INFERENCES THAT MIGHT LEAD TO HIS BEING
QUESTIONED ON THICK PHOTOGRAPHY. IT IS ALSO STRANGE THAT SOURCE
"HAPPENED" TO HAVE A CAMERA AT THAT TIME, AND THAT A NEWS-
PAPER PHOTOGRAPHER "HAPPENED" TO OVERHEAR HIS STORY.
PART III: ANOTHER POSSIBILITY MAY BE CONSIDERED BY
VIEWING THE PRINT WITH THE "HALO" IMAGE ON THE BOTTOM.
THE IMAGE RESEMBLES A PIECE OF MODERNISTIC SCULPTURE
BELIEVED TO BE LOCATED IN NUMEROUS PLACES IN U.S. AND
CALLED "MADONNA AND CHILD" OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.
THE BLACK AND WHITE CONTRAST TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF
IMAGE IS MORE APPARENT IN THIS POSITION.
