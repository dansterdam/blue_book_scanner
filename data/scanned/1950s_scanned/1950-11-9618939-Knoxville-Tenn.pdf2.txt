IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO HAVING ITS RADIATED BEAM BENT BY "ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION" WHICH EFFECTS THE RADAR BEAM AT ANGLES WHICH ARE NEARLY TANGENT TO THE "DUCT" LAYER.

THE EFFECTS REPORTED BY THE RADAR STATION, 663RD AIRCRAFT AND WARNING SQUADRON, LOCATED AT THE MCGHEE-TYSON AIR FORCE, KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE ON THE NIGHTS OF 29 AND 30 NOV 1950, ARE CONSIDERED TO BE DUE TO A RATHER MILD (COMPARED TO THE SAME EFFECTS OBSERVED ON THIS TYPE EQUIPMENT AT OTHER LOCATIONS) "DUCT" EFFECT.

MAJOR STEELE, AMC PROCUREMENT AND SECURITY OFFICER ON THE NEPA PROJECT WAS ADVISED TO ARRANGE WITH THE WEATHER STATION AT OAK RIDGE TO HAVE PSYCHROMETRIC SOUNDINGS OF TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MADE DURING SUBSEQUENT OCCURRENCES OF THE "DUCT" PHENOMENON.

THE OAK RIDGE WEATHER STATION HAS THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT, A CAPTIVE BALLOON WIRE SONDE, TO MAKE THESE SOUNDINGS. SUCH SOUNDINGS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE PERIOD OF DETECTION OF UNKNOWN RADAR TARGETS. IT WAS ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT EQUIPMENT BE REQUISITIONED MAKING RADAR SCOPE PHOTOGRAPHS OF SUBSEQUENT OCCURRENCES OF THE DETECTION OF UNKNOWN TARGETS, PHOTOS TO BE MADE AT ONE-TWO MINUTE INTERVALS.

IT IS OF INTEREST TO NOTE THAT FLIGHTS OR DUCKS HAVE BEEN DETECTED ON THE AW/CPS-1 RADAR SET TO THIS LOCATION AND INTERCEPT AIRCRAFT HAVE INTERCEPTED THIS TYPE TARGET. DUCKS WERE DETECTED AT AN ALTITUDE OF 5900 FEET.

IT APPEARS THAT SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS AT OAK RIDGE WERE EXTREMELY CONCERNED WITH THE POSSIBLE TIE-IN BETWEEN EARLIER INCIDENTS ESPECIALLY ONE REGARDING A REPORT RECEIVED FROM A FORMER OAK RIDGE TROOPER TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD AIDED TWO MEN AND A WOMAN HAVING TROUBLE WITH A CAR.
