Project Blue Book Report Text:

The individual sighted was awakened at 0120 EST on 6 May 1954 by a bright light shining in the window. When he looked outside, he observed an object shaped like two saucers inverted and joined together with a glowing ring around the center. The object was hovering about 100 feet above the ground at an estimated distance of 1/4 mile. It was estimated to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. The object remained visible for about 1 minute before ascending straight up and disappearing from sight.
