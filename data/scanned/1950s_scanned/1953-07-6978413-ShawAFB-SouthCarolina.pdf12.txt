EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY
27 July 1953

Dear Capt. Ruppalt and Lt. Olsson:

Here are my comments on the last few items that were sent to me concerning the Navy expressions. I hope this information is useful. The other two cases are definitely more puzzling, particularly the recent one at Bellingham?? and can be dismissed as more conventional, although the report should be filed for future reference. Little can be judged about it with the information we have this far.

The Shaw AFB one may have been a fireball but certainly an unusual one. Therefore, this case should be followed up. Then perhaps, after looking at the overall situation, something worthwhile could be advised.

I shall be in New Mexico on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (28,29,30) and will take the opportunity to discuss the following with Dr. Clason. His insights probably could shed some light on the situation. I shall be back in Columbus on Friday, July 31.

Let you be fearful, this trip is not being charged to the project. Through if some legitimate expenses occur, I shall of course do so. I certainly hope to see you at least once before I leave.

Cordially,

Allen Hynek
