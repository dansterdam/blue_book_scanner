The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, potentially from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Regarding the object, it seemed to be about 5 to 6 miles distant traveling slowly in a south westerly direction. This dame is confirmed in every detail by my wife, who was also a witness. She corroborates the observation of this craft in every respect. My attention was first drawn to it by a peculiar whirring sound which seemed to emanate from the object. As it traveled across the sky, I noticed it was surrounded by a faint glow or luminescence. It was traveling at a moderate speed and disappeared from sight in several minutes. The strange craft did not resemble any type of aircraft with which I am familiar. My attention was riveted on the object for a few seconds and by this time it had traveled a considerable distance. When I first observed it, it appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length. It became smaller as it traveled away. Throughout the observation, there was no evidence of wings, propellers, or any other usual aircraft characteristics. The only sound I heard was the faint whirring noise mentioned previously. I am unable to offer any satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon. I am accustomed to observing aircraft of all types and this sighting was definitely out of the ordinary. I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding unidentified aerial craft of this nature.
