AERIAL OBJECTS OFFICER
Satsuma Air Force Base, Alabama

The sighting report from the observers indicates that two objects were observed approximately 10,000 feet altitude and traveling in a westerly direction at an estimated speed of about 500 miles per hour. The objects were described as being shaped like little Zippers with a dark belly and a light on top.

On 17 July 1953 between 1900 and 1930 hours, this observer and four other observers at the above location sighted two bright objects in the sky, traveling in a westerly direction. As the objects came closer, they appeared to be two bright lights of considerable size, definitely not aircraft or stars. The objects were observed for approximately 30 minutes, during which time they traveled from a point almost directly north to a point almost directly west, a distance of approximately 50 miles. The course of the objects was from Northeast to Southwest. Altitude of the objects was estimated to be between 10,000 and 12,000 feet, and their speed was estimated to be between 400 and 500 miles per hour.

No interception was attempted since the sightings were late in being reported.

The weather is reported as Inclosure 17.
