TEXT OUTPUT:
"star-like" object motionless in the sky and called it to the attention of the other instructors. They immediately took steps to secure data with the equipment at hand. They wheeled a T-6 around to head toward the UAC. This gave them the magnetic bearing. Sitting in the cock-pit, a pilot sighted over the canopy to get a rough-accuracy estimate of the elevation.

One instructor then took off in a T-6. He climbed to 12,000 feet, but the relative size of the object did not change. This indicated that the object was very high. Then, after 52 minutes, the object suddenly disappeared.

When ATIC received the "FLYOERT" report on this sighting, an officer first checked to see if any other reports correlated with this one. Occasionally, ATIC receives a number of reports on, say, a meteor or fireball and the various reports fit together like a jigsaw puzzle (this explains why ATIC wishes intelligence officers to send in all reports).

First-phase investigation
In this case, there were no other reports. The officer then began his investigation's first phase to check whether the object could have been 1) a high flying aircraft, 2) an astronomical body, 3) a balloon.
He found that B-36's had been flying in the area at the time of the sighting, but he quickly eliminated them as an explanation. Mathematics showed him that a B-36, even flying high enough so that it could not be recognised, would have flown through such a wide arc in 52 minutes that the change in bearing would have been readily apparent.
