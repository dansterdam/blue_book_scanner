1. Crew of C-47 Aircraft #3193 on DVFR flight from Long Beach, California
to Stead AFB, Reno, Nevada 12 April 1953 flying at 10,500 feet heading 300
degrees at 160 miles per hour, visually observed approximately ten (10) un-
identified objects directly over Sweetwater Airport (33021'11'-119121'15") heading
approximately 150 degrees at about 7500 feet MSL. Observing aircraft made a left
orbit at 1510 Pacific Time. Observers were Major Fred G. Paddleford, 2nd Lt
Frank E. White, and 2nd Lt John Clapper, all assigned to 5th Air Rescue Squadron,
Stead Air Force Base, Reno, Nevada.

2. Objects passed under right nose of C-47 - und; were observed by
Major Paddleford. He took over control of C-47 and turned to right in tight
300 degrees turn to enable better observation of objects. Objects were then
picked up unassisted by two other observers. Objects were observed to be
making a right turn of considerably greater radius than that of the C-47 and
were lower than when first observed. Objects were observed for approximately,
120 degrees of their turn and disappeared on heading approximately 300 degrees.

3. Objects were round and flat, estimated size of a flying T-6 aircraft,
metallic in color and in a loose, changing formation. No trail or exhaust
was observed; no sound was heard. Observers were unable to estimate extremely
high speed of objects because of distance and objects large radius of turn.

4. No air traffic was observed in the area and pilot reports no radio
facilities at Sweetwater Airport. No report was made until landing at Stead
AFB, Reno, Nevada.

5. Weather in the area was slightly hazy with scattered clouds and
visibility 30 miles. Winds at 10,500 feet were WSW at 20 knotsâ€”turbulence
nil.

COMMENTS:

1. Major Paddleford is Flight CO of "A" Flight, 8th ARS and has 13
years' service.

2. It is the opinion of the crew that there were no unusual atmospheric
conditions which could have caused such a sighting.
