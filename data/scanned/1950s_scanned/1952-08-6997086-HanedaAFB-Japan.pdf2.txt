CASE #3 (contd)

At 0031Z an F-94 was airborne on a scramble and was requested to search to the NE
of Haneda AFB over Tokyo Bay. They could make no visual observations, but could see the North Star and Venus. The F-94 was vectored to the object by GCI (both the F-94 and object were on the scope) and held it for 90 seconds. Shortly after this, both the object and the F-94 disappeared into the ground clutter on the GCI. At no time did the F-94 make visual contact. The radar contact indicated the target was at 5000 yards, 10° below and to the right of a 320° bearing from the station. Soon after loss of radar contact, the object was lost visually.

Comment

The F-94 crew reported excellent visibility, yet they could not visually observe the object during a thorough search of the area. They stated that the moon was bright and might possibly have caused reflections off the few scattered clouds. This, however, is not in agreement with the description of an exceptionally bright light given by the tower operators.

Since the weather was not given, it is not possible to determine whether the radar return was caused by some type of anomalous propagation.

Conclusion

Unknown
