No Case (Information Only)
6 November 1957
Boston, Massachusetts

3) November 6, 1925, about 5:30 a.m.: A lens-shaped disk came out of the sky on edge, leveled off to a horizontal position, hung motionless over Boston for a minute or two, then "stood on edge" again and went off into the sky. It was amazed at the size of this thing, says the witness who reported this to Mr. J. Boston (and who has always been considered a reliable observer). Compared with the Boston skyscrapers, it was as large as a ten-story building.
