NEW MEXICO COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND MECHANIC ARTS 
PHYSICAL SCIENCE LABORATORY
STATE COLLEGE, NEW MEXICO
16 Sept. 1947

Dr. John S. Greene
216 N. Calle Santa Rosa
Palm Springs, California

Dear Dr. Greene:

Thank you for the communication of your very interesting observation. Evidently, it was no known astronomical object. If it is remarkable that an object of small angular dimensions would be visible from so great a distance, the appearance is of some high tension arc source not of its own and not reflection of any light.

Unfortunately, I was not home when you tried to call. I made a trip to Albuquerque on some official business, if could have been visible from here it would have been a great help to measure its height by parallax. 

Until the final study of your very fine observation by some friendly observers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge, Massachusetts, I am sure that your continued observation will somewhat more disclose other information on sight. Until we have a sympathetic and free study of such reports, I am sure that their analytical work may be able to establish the nature of the object you witnessed certainly ought to receive some scientific analysis. If some other observer within 100 miles also saw it, it would provide valuable information on height, absolute magnitude, etc.

Enclosed is a copy of an account of the strangest sight I have ever witnessed. You may keep it.

Sincerely yours,

CLYDE W. TOMBAUGH
ASTRONOMER
