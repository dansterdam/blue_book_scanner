I. Description of Incident
Four bright lights in diamond formation were sighted at 1745 by a captain and a lieutenant flying in a C-23 aircraft located south of Madison, Wisconsin.

At no time was a silhouette visible, even against the lights of Milwaukee. Visibility was about unlimited to 5,000 feet. The observed aircraft.

II. Discussion of Incident

The only possible explanation would center on the speed of the object. To fit the speed of the aircraft would probably have to be in the jet category. There is no record of local or transient aircraft in the area. Furthermore, local radar was carrying the T-33 on its scope but had no return from the unidentified objects. If the unknown was an aircraft it would have been evident on the radar.
