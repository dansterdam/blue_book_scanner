I. SOURCES: 
Address: Morengo, Illinois
Age: 42
Occupation: Rendering Service (self employed)
Education: High School Graduate
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: Source was cooperative, but limited the discussion to twelve minutes due to a cold. He had been given a brief briefing about having made the report of the sightings by the police officers involved.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGHTINGS: At about 0405 hours, Central daylight saving time, on the morning of 6 August 1955, the source was awakened by a noise "like a blast from an airplane". He looked out and saw four bright round objects in formation in the southeast to northeast sky. The objects appeared to be about a quarter mile away and about 1000 feet high. The objects would go straight, then make sharp turns, and then resume the straight course. They would also tilt on their sides. The objects appeared to be four to five feet in diameter and were illuminated with a fire-fly or lightning bug type of illumination. The illumination appeared to fluctuate and change color from white to red. The objects were under intelligent control and made no sound that could be heard. The source watched the objects for about ten minutes, and then they disappeared into the daylight. The police were called but could not locate the objects prior to their disappearing into the daylight. The police officer could not substantiate the informant's account because the sightings occurred at a time when the objects could not be found.
