The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a scanned page of handwritten text from an old UFO report document.

Hearing that the saucer was hit by a burst, the "Unidentified" object suddenly began to fire something in rapid pulses going away and down at an angle. It appeared to be some type of electronic countermeasures being activated by the "Unidentified" object, which seems to indicate it may have been under intelligent control. The witness maintains this was not some form of conventional aircraft but rather something that was operating in a manner characteristic of a "Flying Saucer" type of craft.
