LOWRY AFB, COLORADO, 6 APRIL 1958
On this date at 2255 a sighting of an unidentified flying object occurred. This object had a very brilliant light and was observed by five airmen, one of whom was a warrant officer. The object was first observed in the south-west at an elevation of 10 degrees. It was round in shape and about the size of a baseball held at arm's length. It appeared to be very high in altitude. The object remained stationary for about 15 to 20 seconds and then suddenly disappeared.
Immediately after the object disappeared, a second object appeared in the same area. This object hovered for a few seconds and then suddenly accelerated in a straight line to the north and disappeared from sight at a terrific rate of speed.
A check was made of the area but no other sightings were reported. The total time of the sighting was approximately 30 to 40 seconds.
Estimated speed: 7,000 mph
Estimated altitude: 30,000 ft. to 40,000 ft.
Estimated size: 6 to 8 inches in diameter 
(held at arm's length)
Elevation angle: 10 degrees
