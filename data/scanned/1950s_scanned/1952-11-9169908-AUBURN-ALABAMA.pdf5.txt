Transcribing the text from the document:

On Sunday afternoon, 5 October 1952, about 4:30 A.M., my wife and I were returning home from a football game, and perhaps it was a twilight ray, but the sky was not quite dark. I called my wife to take a look at it. She did so, and also had a puzzled look on her face. The object was quite bright and seemed to be hovering, or making a very slow movement. It appeared to be a large oval, silver in color, and absolutely soundless. There were no blinking lights or means of propulsion visible. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and 10 to 15 feet thick. After watching it for about 5 minutes, it suddenly took off at a terrific speed, straight up, and disappeared in the sky. This was observed from a moving automobile, and I am quite certain that we were not hallucinating. The object was definitely a strange and puzzling sight to us, and I should like to know if any other reports of a similar nature were received from this area at that time.
