1. Mr. ------- sightings were evaluated as "possible balloons."
2. There is a U.S. Weather Bureau Balloon-launching site in Sacramento which possibly launched a balloon November 15, 1952 just prior to his sighting. 
3. On May 6, 1952 there was lighting of a balloons or object descending and came to rest directly over his head at an altitude of five feet, which case it would have been sitting on his head. The object remained motionless for about 5 minutes and then gave off a bright glow or take a couple of inches in size. It was described as a deep blood red and it wasn't reported until the latter part of 1954.
