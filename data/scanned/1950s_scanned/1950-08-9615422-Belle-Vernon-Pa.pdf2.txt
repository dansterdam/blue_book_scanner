The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). There is no photograph present in this particular document. 

The text that can be extracted from the document is as follows:

Reference is made to your letter of 4 August 1950 concerning an object which you could not identify.

From the information presented in your letter it is apparent that the object in question is a pilot balloon target which is carried aloft by a free rising balloon on clear, calm days. This type of balloon target is expendable and unclassified and may be disposed of in any manner which you see fit.

Your forwarding the information in question to this headquarters is appreciated.

Yours truly,

BRYAN L. DAVIS
Colonel, USAF
Air Adjutant General
