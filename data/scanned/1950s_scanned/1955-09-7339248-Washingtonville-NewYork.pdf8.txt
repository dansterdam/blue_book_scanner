STATEMENT

Director of Flight Operations
Captain [REDACTED]
9-7-55

At approximately 19:25T while southbound at 6000 ft. on R18 at Red Hook intersection, noticed a bright flash above us. Because we were flying through a slight cumulus cloud with the sun shining on it, I attributed it to the flash of this cloud while inside one of these clouds. We made no other observation of this sighting and were then advised that we had seen the sighting.

THIS IS A TRUE COPY. [REDACTED], Maj. U.S.A.F.
