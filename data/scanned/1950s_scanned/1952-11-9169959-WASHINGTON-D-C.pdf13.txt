Intelligence Report
17 Nov 52, Wichita, Kansas

1. An unidentified flying object was observed by two observers. It was described by one of them as:

Major R.L. Gillespie, radar observer, stated that on 9 November 1952 at approximately 23:39 hours, he observed a bright light in the sky, which at first appeared to be a falling star, but later increased in size and then decreased in size. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. It appeared to be much larger than a star and approximately 15 to 20 degrees to the right of zenith, moving from south to north. When it reached a point almost overhead, it suddenly disappeared. No sound was heard, and the object displayed no trail.

2. The sighting occurred at approximately 23:39 hours and the object was under observation for approximately 2 to 3 minutes.

3. The observers were:
Lt. W.G. Holder, Pilot, 3700th AAA Wing, Wichita, Kansas
Major R.L. Gillespie, Radar Observer, 3700th AAA Wing, Wichita, Kansas

4. All three observers were located at a position about 7 to 10 feet of the 3-47 transition area, operating in conjunction with a ground controlled approach (G.C.A.) approach at approximately 23:39 hours on 9 November 1952.

5. The observers were:
1st Lt. H.L. Wallace, Jr., Commander Officer of the 3-47 Transition Section.
Captain A.G. Dellinger, IO 7132322, a rated AC, presently current in the 3-47.
1/29 Dewey Jr. Philips, AS 17339313.

The observers stated that they were thoroughly reliable and claim that the object they observed was unusual and could not be identified as any known aircraft or celestial body. Their statements are mutually corroborative in the main, although differing in some details.
