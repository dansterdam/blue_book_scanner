The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

15. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - A.M.
b. Color - Light gray or dull white

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Check One): a. Fuzzy or blurred 
b. Like a light or glow
c. Sharp and clear
d. Don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
