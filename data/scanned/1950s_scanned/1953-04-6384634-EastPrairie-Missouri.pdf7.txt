The image contains two sketches, but no photograph. 

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline), with an object above it. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine that the object was seen above the horizon when it was first observed.

The second sketch shows two larger images. On the left, there is a landscape scene with a person standing on a road. On the right, there is a smaller landscape scene with a curved horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.
33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
