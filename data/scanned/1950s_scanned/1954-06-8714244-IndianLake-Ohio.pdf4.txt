According to the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output, the text in the document is as follows:

"It was 8:30 p.m. on June 8, 1954 that an unidentified flying object was observed in the sky over Indian Lake, Ohio. The weather was clear and the object was visible for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The object was estimated to be 33 miles away and about 200 feet in diameter. It was reported to be silvery in color and round in shape with a dome-like structure on top. It was observed to move with a "rocking" or "wobbling" motion and emitted no sound. The object remained stationary for a period of time and then slowly moved out of sight to the northwest. The witness, [redacted], said the object was unlike anything he had ever seen before and he was certain it was not an airplane, helicopter, or any known type of aircraft. The report was investigated by the local Air Force authorities but no explanation for the sighting could be determined."
