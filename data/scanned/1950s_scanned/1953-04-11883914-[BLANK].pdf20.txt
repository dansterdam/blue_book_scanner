Punched Card  
A typical completed punched card is included for reference in Exhibit III. This card should be compared with the observer's data sheet for this sighting, prepared from the original report. The data sheet is the completed one described previously.

Statistical Studies  
From the information entered on the punched cards, it will be possible to analyze many characteristics of sightings. (See Exhibit IV.) Some of these may be obvious, others are subtle, but all seem interesting. The planning of statistical studies is necessarily incomplete. However, some examples may suggest the possible scope of study.  

Studies have been planned to reveal the variation in sighting activity with time and position. The time of sightings in conjunction with the geographical location will be used in several ways. First, time will permit correlation of sightings with astronomical and tidal phenomenon. Second, sighting times and locations may be correlated with weather conditions. These studies will assist in determining periods and areas of unusual activity. In addition, useful data on track and speed may evolve from such analyses.

Data will be compiled on the lag between sightings and the receipts of reports and supplementary information. This knowledge will aid in evaluating reports and in determining the effectiveness of collection procedures.
