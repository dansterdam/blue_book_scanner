Dear Sir: 
Quite belatedly, I have decided to report a UFO sighting. This took place eight years ago near Bowers, Minnesota (44'51, 93"30) to the north of Litchfield, concerning which I was advised to write you.

Reciting what there is an unusual in reported sightings lately, and your office is interested in accumulating such for comparison studies, I have decided to communicate this, although the sighting is of an old grand. My experience:

On June 3, 1958 there was still considerable covering of snow on the ground. At 10:45 p.m. on that date, while walking in an open field, I observed a faintly luminescent aerial object, of an elongated or oval shape, about the size of a small automobile, passing silently at a rather low altitude from northwest to southeast. It was visible for about 15 to 20 seconds. The night was clear and starry.

I would appreciate any comments your office may care to make on this report.

Yours truly,
Bernard C. Ruik
