24 November 1959

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your recent letter concerning an Unidentified Flying Object seen by your family in August 1959. Unfortunately, this sighting does not constitute an addition to a valid statistical analysis of the subject.

There is no U. S. Air Force or Department of Defense documentary film on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. The Air Force must have been a comment you may have been told, but this is incorrect. The Air Force must be objective in its analysis and evaluation of UFO sightings. As you can see from your information, I am including for your reference a statement on this subject.

Thank you very much for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
