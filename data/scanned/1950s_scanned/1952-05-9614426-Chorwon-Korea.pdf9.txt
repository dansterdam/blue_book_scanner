The image contains a photograph of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting report from Project Blue Book, dated 1952. The report describes the sighting details, including a description of the object observed by the witness. There are also some calculations and measurements provided, likely to attempt to determine the size and distance of the observed object.

Suddenly Mrs. ________ who was four hours of receiving her Master's degree, pointed to the sky just above our house. She described an arc with her finger before her eyes, which appeared most natural under the circumstances. She said to say- that was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. My attention was, of course, immediately aroused, and without saying a word I followed her gaze up into the sky. There hung, suspended in the air, an object that appeared to be disc-shaped and definitely a thing apart from any ordinary craft.

Mrs. ________ was quite skeptical of previous reports. Why she had phenomena immediately called down apparently one equipment for my eyes, was outside but by that time the object had disappeared.

I immediately began noting the time and date and calculations based upon Mrs. ________ observations. The following represents the data gathered and calculations:

SIZE OF OBJECT = 100' DIAM. 
SIZE OF DIME = 45 " 
DISTANCE TO DIME = 22'
SIZE OF OBJECT/SIZE OF DIME = DISTANCE TO OBJECT/DISTANCE TO DIME
100'/45" = DISTANCE TO OBJECT/22'
DISTANCE TO OBJECT = 2312' OR 797'

From the data gathered it is possible to calculate the approximate distance of the object, as follows:
