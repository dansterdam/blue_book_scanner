AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM:  359th Air Weather F-1 Squadron
SUBJ:  UFO Sightings, AFO 912
DATE:  11-4-52

STATEMENT
I was the Radar Observer on the F-94 which sighted unusual lights 29 December 1952. After contacting Chitose and reporting flashing red horizontal and green vertical lights, it was confirmed that a radar blip was received and a visual contact was made.

The object was estimated to be 12 miles south of Chitose and was tracked on radar for approximately 15 minutes. Initial contact was at 30,000 feet and the object was observed to descend to 10,000 feet before it was lost below the horizon. It was reported that the object maneuvered in a zigzag course and appeared to accelerate rapidly as it disappeared.

It was impossible to determine the size, shape or composition of the object. No sound was detected and the lights appeared to be part of the object. The lights would change from steady to flashing and were observed to change color from red to white to green. The object was estimated to be moving at approximately 1,500 miles per hour.

This report is submitted for your information.
