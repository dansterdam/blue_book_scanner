Our patrol visit Sgt. Gonzales at approximately 06:20, 6 November 1957.
We had just finished making a security check to PCS by radio when we were advised that something unusual was happening in the vicinity of the radar base at Kunsan Air Force Base.
This light was flashing alternately red and yellow, and located in an area of the perimeter light a brighter flash and complely lost sight. This object was located approximately 1,500 to 2,000 yards elevation and appeared to be larger than a star. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes, After the brighter light was lost, the object appeared to diminish in size and could be seen for an additional 2-3 minutes. This was a yellow and located in the same area as the flash and cmnletely disappeared. The object was located approximately 15,000 to 20,000 feet elevation and appeared to be larger than a star. This light was observed on and off for approximately 20 to 30 minutes.
I think it may have been a shooting star.
