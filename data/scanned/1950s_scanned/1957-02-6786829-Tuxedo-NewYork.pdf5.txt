The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten or typed document describing a UFO sighting. 

February 15, 1957. Dr. a well-known physician of Mamaroneck, N. Y., was watching television with his wife when she noticed a bright light outside the eastward-facing picture window in their living room. Both of them went outdoors to the terrace, where they saw the object as "about twice as big as the landing light on a plane.'" It was oval, with a bright white center and a reddish-pink "aura" all around it. Over a period of about 10 degrees, the swings were north-south and rather slow. Then, from the top of the object, four smaller objects emerged in pairs, two from the right "edge" and two from the left. These rose very rapidly, were in view for nearly half an hour, then disappeared. No noise was heard. The main object was in view for several minutes, then disappeared abruptly. No trace was found. The doctor's report is in the general direction of Rye, N. Y. The object was seen again on a number of subsequent nights, including the following.
