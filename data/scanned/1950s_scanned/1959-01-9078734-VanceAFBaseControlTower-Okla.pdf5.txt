The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Mr. 

The sighting referenced in your letter took place on 5 January 1959. The object was seen from two vantage points, through and near the control tower at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center has determined the object as a material aircraft of apparent unidentified origin. As can be determined from the information and evidence available, the object appears to have been a material aircraft, similar in appearance to and consistent with the report, but differing in minor details. The object was reported to have appeared suddenly above the horizon, disappeared abruptly, and reappeared again. The observer's description would indicate that the object was highly maneuverable, and had the capability of instantaneous acceleration and/or deceleration. This description is consistent with the known characteristics of jet aircraft.

The official report to the Air Technical Intelligence Center made no mention of the reported ability of the object to change color or the reported lack of identification on the part of the observer.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
