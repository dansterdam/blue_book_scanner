Case 185, Denver, Colo., Aug. 12, 1956--Mrs. Mary Mettiner and Mrs. Jessie West were riding in their automobile near the Crenographic Memorial when they saw a large, luminous, circular object moving very swiftly and silently through the sky a little higher than the mountain peaks. It had a flaming red center and bluish lights around the rim. It hovered for a few seconds and then sped off toward the west at tremendous speed. There were no sounds or trails of any kind. Several other observers reported seeing the same or a similar phenomena at about the same time, including Lt. Jim McKenney and Lt. Jones of the Air Force.
