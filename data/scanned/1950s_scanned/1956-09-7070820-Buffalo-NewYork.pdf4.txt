Twin Falls, Idaho

Case 212, Twin Falls, Idaho, Sept. 7, 1956â€”Said the Idaho Falls Post Register: "A Twin Falls attorney reported that a flying saucer swooped down on his ranch 40 miles south of here when I saw a strange object about 200 feet in diameter flying over. It had a whirling effect on top and gave off a glow. It came in fast overhead and swooped to the ground near a spot where a 400-pound whitefaced steer was standing. The object sped off like a streak of light and the steer was gone." Rayburn reported this story to the sheriff's office: "I was at my ranch about 40 miles south of here when I saw a strange object about 200 feet in diameter flying over. It had a whirling effect on top and gave off a glow. It came in fast overhead and swooped to the ground near a spot where a 400-pound whitefaced steer was standing. The object sped off like a streak of light and the steer was gone." Rayburn said two employees on the ranch, Joe and Dick Farley, also saw the object, and the employees found the remains of the steer.
