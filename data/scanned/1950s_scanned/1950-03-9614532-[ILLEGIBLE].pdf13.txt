MEXICO CITY, March 14 (/P) - Thousands of residents reported seeing four "flying saucers" yesterday over this city and nearby suburbs. The saucers were seen for more than an hour, but official observers shied away from confirming the existence of the disks.

Meteorologists at the Mexico City Airport said their instruments recorded an unidentified object at 30,000 feet by using their weather balloons instruments.

DURANGO, Colo., March 14 (UP) - Charles A. Maney and Bert Lowe of Durango, Colo., said they saw two unidentified flying objects over Durango yesterday while returning last week from a trip to New Mexico.

Lowe and Tanner of Cortez, Colo., said they had tried to avoid hitting the objects, but both refused to stop the car. When he slowed down, the objects maneuvered at tremendous speed, Tanner said. The objects, about five feet in diameter, traveled at an estimated 50 to 60-foot radius around the car, Tanner said.
