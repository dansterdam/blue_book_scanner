NARRATIVE BY 1ST LT. WALTER H. BAXTER, JR. 201009A

At 1612 CST, 28 October 1952, while waiting for a commercial airliner, the observer sighted an unusual light object in the sky. The object was first observed to the north of the field and was traveling in a southeasterly direction. It was observed for approximately 3-4 minutes. The flight path was described as an undulating one, with the object climbing and diving in an irregular manner. The speed was estimated to be in excess of 600 mph. The object was described as being without any visible means of propulsion and no sound was heard. The object appeared to be circular or oval in shape and was luminous in appearance. It was estimated to be about one-half the size of the moon as viewed from the earth. The object disappeared from view to the southeast. The sighting was also witnessed by Dr. and Mrs. of Arlington, Texas, who stated that he was a former U.S. bomber pilot. The information was immediately reported to the Dallas-Fort Worth Air Force Base, but the officers on duty at the time apparently did not know what to make of the sighting. As the information was rather sketchy, it was considered to be of limited value at that time. This and other sightings are still being evaluated by Air Force authorities.

COMMENT OF PREPARING OFFICER:

The observer was questioned as to whether the object could have been a conventional aircraft. He is of the opinion that it was not, and that the description of its flight path and speed preclude the possibility of it being a conventional aircraft. This information is being made a matter of record for future evaluation.
