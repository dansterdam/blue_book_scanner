STATEMENT
"At approximately 0545 Sulu and just prior to PT # 14A of the Steeltrap route, I was station-keeping on the land aircraft of the three ship cell. I noticed a small #1 return to the rear at 4:00 azimuth, range about 1 NM. I notified the pilot, who queried the gunner. The gunner stated that the object first ascended, then descended, finally disappearing to our right.
For the next hour or so, I had continued intermittent returns in the altitude hole, always at a mile or two range, and azimuths from 3:00 to 9:00. Later observation of them led me to believe they were some sort of "mirrored" returns, i.e., a reflection of the other aircraft. I took C-18 film of this phenomena, starting at 0611 Z. Refer to Line # 6 of Camera Log for A/C G-600, 28 Aug 59, Mission # 431-29. No further visual sightings were made."
