The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, specifically the report titled "Strange Aircraft Seen At Matador".

The text of the document is as follows:

STRANGE AIRCRAFT
SEEN AT MATADOR

MATADOR, AUG. 31.-(Special)-A noiseless aircraft, flying at a low altitude with no visible propellors or wings," was reported seen early this afternoon by two Matador district women and a 5-year-old child.

Mrs. Torn Tilson, her daughter Mrs. M. C. Bethard and little Nollene Bethard said they were driving on a highway about one-half miles north of here about 12:45 p. m. when the wingless craft passed 150 feet in front of the car.

The slow-moving machine, "shaped somewhat like a helicopter," began circling as Mrs. Bethard stopped the car. As she stepped on the gas, the craft gained speed and "was out of sight within a few minutes."

The women were near enough to spot one door, or porthole, in the side of the gleaming metal, they said.

When first seen, it was moving at the rate of a commercial airliner taking off, they said. It had no exhaust showing.

Mrs. Bethard, whose husband sailed for Korea recently, has lived near several Air Force bases, and reported the machine she saw today was different from any she had seen before.
