S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

While looking in a southeasterly direction, I saw an object which appeared to be a meteor, but in the thirty-five (35) seconds of which it was observed, it traveled on a horizontal plane. I considered this a reported this to the Filter Center, Pasadena, California (WERE 5709) immediately. This white object seemed to have a slight tail which while traveling changed colors from white to orange to a formidable green in less than a minute. The object disappeared in the extreme southwest.
