Col T: The four sight
Maj B: 142th Fighter Interceptor, yes, - either Wing or Group.
Col T: All right, - we are very glad indeed to have this information and we'll evaluate it here, one reason I wanted to get a complete report from you so that I can turn it over to our Intelligence people here. And we will get in touch with you if we would like to ask you to take any more action on it.
Maj B: All right sir.
Col T: Meanwhile, I don't see anything else you could have done in the circumstances, concerning the Press. I'm glad to know that no release was initiated, but I can easily
Maj B: I assure you Colonel that my office has said nothing about this story until they were worried by the newspapers.
Col T: That's good. I understand that and that's a very good thing - I'm glad you handled it that way. So we will not take any official action to it here, - nothing, if you get any additional information please call me again.
Maj B: Right sir, - how can I give you my extension in case you need it?
Col T: If you will, Sir, please.
Maj B: It's Extension 3115, or 222. My full name is Major John Barton.
Col T: All right, - thank you very much indeed.
