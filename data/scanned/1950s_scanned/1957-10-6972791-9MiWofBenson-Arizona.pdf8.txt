The image appears to contain a photograph of an Aerobee rocket. The text provides details about the experiment conducted with this rocket, including the use of "three 'shaped charges' of aluminum pellets" and the behavior of the rocket as it ascended. The text also mentions observations made by researchers from the Holloman observatory, located about 200 miles away.

A flight, above North
AEROBEE ROCKET
The flight of this Aerobee rocket was described in this way: A 1400-pound Aerobee model in effect a three-stage rocket, carried at its nose three "shaped charges" of aluminum pellets and rocket motors. The Aerobee automatically oriented itself at the zenith point, then more miles upwards where it released, igniting the aluminum pellets which were very bright - 200 times brighter than the Soviet Sputnik and more brilliant than a magnesium flare. Rflp Observers at the Holloman observatory, some 200 miles away, reported seeing the "shaped charge" release.
SCIENTISTS SAID that most of the "grape-shot" pellets probably burned up within the first half-mile of flight. But the meteorites definitely escaped the earth's gravity. The bright glow of these objects attracted scientists to experiment on film with a ballistic camera.
Dawn said the rocket contained instruments which gave it acceleration to sonic speed and before that released dust particles in the upper atmosphere.
The experiment, which was sponsored by the California Institute of Technology, was first attempted in 1951 using former German V-2 rockets. The Oct. 18 project, however, was the first to use the Aerobee, which followed a series of failures, scientists said.
