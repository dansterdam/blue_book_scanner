Camp Carson, Colorado 24 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
0617 Observers at Camp Carson sighted a silvery unidentified flying object at 0614 MST. This object was estimated to be at an altitude of 20,000 feet and was in view for 4 minutes after which it disappeared at a high rate of speed. Observers were unable to determine the size, shape and color of the object as it was only visible as a white light while in view.

II. Discussion of Incident
Although the sighting took place two hours after a scheduled piball balloon release at Pueblo, Colorado, this report has been evaluated to show that the object sighted could possibly have been a balloon. However, the direction of travel and the high rate of speed of the object makes it doubtful that AFIT [Air Force Institute of Technology] had the opportunity to check the object against known upper air research balloon trajectories, but tentatively evaluates the sighting as a possibly balloon.

III. Conclusion
Possibly balloon.
