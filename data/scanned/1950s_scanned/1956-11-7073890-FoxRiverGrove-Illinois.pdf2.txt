The text in the document states:
"When I first saw it, it looked fairly far away. It was hovering in one position. The color was a dull red. It hovered for five minutes. Then it sped up quickly in a southeast to north course (180 to 360). As it built up speed the color turned to a bright red. The speed was at least 1000 m.p.h. I figured out its speed by this method, about a week before I saw this thing, a saw a jet plane. F-86, break the sound barrier. They travel at about 600 knots. And the object was tremendously faster. The object disappeared into the distance after a short time."
