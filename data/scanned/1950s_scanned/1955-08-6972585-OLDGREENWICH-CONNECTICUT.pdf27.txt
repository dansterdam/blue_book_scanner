The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with questions and space for answers.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. [IF POSSIBLE] Try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. (Not possible) feet.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar
g. Silver dollar
h. Baseball
i. Grapefruit
j. Basketball
k. Other

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.)
a. Not very sure
b. Fairly certain
c. Certain
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? I didn't notice the object until it was in full view. I watched it until it got smaller and vanished.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? I would build it would be made of a very strong and light metal. It would be disk shaped. I would construct the disk about 150' diameter. A very bright star moving in straight, level flight would appear the same as the object that I saw.

There is some handwritten text at the bottom of the page, but it does not seem to be part of the original form and I will not attempt to transcribe it.
