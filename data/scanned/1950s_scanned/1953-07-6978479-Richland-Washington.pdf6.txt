ABNORMAL REFRACTION

Second Officer Fiore Roschie of the SS. Evelyn G. Capt. F. Pieroni, Master, reports that on two occasions, while en route from Goode to Ballinstone, his ship's lights were affected by an abnormal refraction. On one occasion, a light which was estimated to be about 1000 sun sight, taken by three different observers, was apparently in error and was carried over to the moon position on the morning of July 15, almost perpendicular to the ship's course. On the other occasion, the refraction can be made for the observation of the morning-star and moon and that from the moon position and evening stars. On both occasions the calculated upward spread during the evening period.
