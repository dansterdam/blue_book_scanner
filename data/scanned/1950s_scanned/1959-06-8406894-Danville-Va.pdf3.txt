Transcription of the text:

"noon i look about four miles away. I told my daughter to watch for it as a point where I thought it would pass out into the clear sky. We saw nothing unusual then or at any other time during the day or night, so far as I can recall.
When questioned further, they did not claim to have any other sightings to report. They merely observed the object as described above. They made no special effort to keep it under close observation, as they did not regard it as an unusual occurrence and felt no special concern about it. They seem to have given it only casual notice, much as one would a passing aircraft, without making any special effort to study or identify it.
Based on my theory of unmanned craft-unless becoming an occupant of the object were possible, which seems highly improbable-there would be no point to close observation. Such craft would not likely respond to efforts at identification or communication and would be essentially unimportant except as data for analysis. Unless something more dramatic occurred, simple observation would be the only practical response.
I conclude that on this very hot day a quiet spot on the horizon appeared to be the destination of an object which proved to be on this occasion a natural phenomenon, since there was no other sighting, either at the time or later, to substantiate the original impression. I could find no evidence to believe that what was seen was anything more than a natural occurrence, normal in every respect.
Thank you."
