1 JULY 52

I was standing beside an AN/FPS Radar van talking with a group of men when one of the men said: "Look up there". I looked overhead and immediately spotted an object that looked similar to a table tennis ball at a large distance away. It was overhead and traveling at a very rapid rate. The object turned the north (seeming) turning toward the west. The size of the object became smaller as it increased distance and became lost behind a telephone pole and a building. The sky was very clear and very good visibility.
