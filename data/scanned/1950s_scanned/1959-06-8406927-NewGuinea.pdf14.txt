AIR ATTACHE, AUSTRALIA

a. Suggestion as an influence to "witnesses": There may have been undue influence by suggestion on the part of the inexperienced native body; there may have been influence caused by a subconscious of the native body of "witnesses" towards the observed phenomena.

d. Illusion: It is possible that "freak" atmospheric conditions or sub-normal vision (as part of the observer(s) resulted in a mis-interpretation of natural phenomena.

3. Unreliable Observers: Inexperience in astronomical observation, lighting and sensing such natural disturbances in the atmosphere; the appearance and usual movements of these.

4. Variation in descriptive evidence from different sources: (1) Misjudgment of size, distance, apparent phenomena, observers' position, from different experiences.

In absence of scientific investigation into this present report, theory and knowledge should be made with the following relevant facts concerning the conducting of the main part of the observation and execution of procedure in gathering evidence writing report.

Papuan observer: The sketch of the UFO later in this report was drawn by one significant detail from later sketches. The "underside" is described by him and drawn as showing longitudinal markings as subsequent descriptional drawings by what appeared to be four straight legs or stands pointing diagonally downwards.

Can it be assumed therefore that suggestion played no part in respect of this including oral observation in subsequent sight-seeing, though individually, thought they "saw" the general change or the whole "Object" were in fact?

(b) Drawing up of the report was conducted in the following way:

1. On the night of June 26th immediately following the disappearance of the UFO through cloud, 39 witnesses were brought together into a well-lighted room.

2. On separate sheets of paper, three observers, namely those who claimed they saw the sketches, were separately questioned and the sketches were made by them.

3. "Men" on the UFO were their alignments under collective limitation.

4. All observers were briefly addressed by the reporter and given the opportunity of signing a paper stating that a UFO as described in the sketches must be truthful and that they must be furnished with a copy.
