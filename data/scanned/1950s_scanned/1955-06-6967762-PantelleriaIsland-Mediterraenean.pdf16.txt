"Lights. It had no halo of any kind. It stream down at the ground. It was elliptical in shape. It seemed to melt in as it reached the ground. There was a glowing effect up through the center, the three was no vibration, just a steady, bright, straight line. It remained visible and then disappeared gradually. I had a note pad with me which I grabbed alder, but it slipped from my hands because they were shaking. The object was only visible for about 10 seconds total. I passed a Santa Fe telegraph operator nearby who was on the telephone with the Commanding Officer. This story is plain old. About 3 weeks later another incident occurred home 12 miles from the hotel mentioned had occurred. It related odd light thing to her. One was a saucer shape and oval in outline--oo shape. The other was like a short line like the first. Happened  to be at 9:15 pm both times."
