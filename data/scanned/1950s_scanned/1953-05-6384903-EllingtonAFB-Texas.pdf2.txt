On the evening of the 15th of May 1953, the airman were at their regular Air Police operations at Ellington Air Force Base, Texas, as a result of routine night duties. Around 9:40 P.M. CST, the airman observed a most unusual and brilliant object moving across the sky. The object was first sighted at an angle of approximately 20 to 25 degrees from the horizon traveling in a north-northeast direction at a uniform rate of speed and altitude. The object appeared to be about twice the apparent size of a star or planet and seemed to fluctuate or pulsate rather than emit a steady light. The object faded from view in approximately 30 to 45 seconds as it moved across the sky. The airman immediately reported their observation to the Operations Officer who in turn notified higher headquarters. An investigation was immediately initiated and the airman who observed the object were interrogated.
