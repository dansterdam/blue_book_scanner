FLIGHT 14 - SEPTEMBER 6, 1955

On flight 14 of the 6th at approximately 1925EST, geographical position approximately 16 miles south of the POL Camp Rayno, COO degree track, at 6000 ft. with a clear sky above, unlimited visibility horizontal, the crew sighted a smoke trail, distinct and unidentified object with a bluish-white exhaust trail of approximately one-half mile or mile directly ahead of us to approximately 1000 ft. above our position on what appeared to be about a 200-210 degree heading.

In approximately 5 to 10 seconds the object had moved from directly in front of us to about 100 ft. across from our track placing it off our left beam and was then only about a sleeve's width as we would see the blunt flame of a flight or engine. At this time, it appeared to be traversing a turning flash within, I would say, a half mile or mile of us.

Flight 412, who, I believe, was in the vicinity of ALBI at about 8000 ft. reported seeing the flash ALI seen he was reported to be about 6000 ft., also who was approaching the area south of Gascogne at about 6000 ft., also reported seeing the flash.

I could not see what the object was except that it appeared like a rocket ship - although through my imagination because all I really got to look at was this trail of flame and, I do not know what I saw. I believe it was something that had a tremendous amount of power, and that the trail like thing was some kind of a rocket type propulsion system. It did not give any position lights.

I feel certain that it was not a meteor as we had been looking in that direction and it just appeared. There was no trace of it until it got right in front of us. Its speed did not seem to have been in excess of 1000-1500 mph.
