1. The photograph which you recently submitted for interpretation and analysis has been examined. The photograph was printed to determine if it contains any significant data other than a portrayal of a UFO (unidentified flying object), precluding a detailed photographic analysis.

2. The high-colored spot in the sky portion of the photograph does appear to be an image rather than a scratch or other blemish on the negative.

3. If a detailed analysis is desired, it is recommended that the original negative be obtained.
