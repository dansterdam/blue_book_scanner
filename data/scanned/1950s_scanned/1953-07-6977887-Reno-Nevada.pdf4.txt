20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess, or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. 

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One): Head of a pin, Pen, Nickel, Quarter, Half dollar.

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): Certain, Fairly certain, Not very sure, Uncertain.

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? We were able to watch it for about 10 to 15 seconds before it disappeared, the object appeared to be circling and would suddenly go out of sight behind some scattered cloudiness.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you would encounter the object(s) that you saw. Of what type material would you expect it to be made, and what shape and size would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the appearances and actions that you witnessed. ANSWER: The object was circular in shape and about the size of a basketball, it was colored a light orange to yellowish color. It appeared to be metallic in nature, and as it maneuvered and circled it would appear to change shape slightly, at times taking on a more elliptical appearance. It seemed to change direction abruptly without banking or turning. From this to its sudden disappearance into the scattered clouds, it gave the impression of a highly maneuverable and controlled craft, rather than a natural phenomenon.
