AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT 
NEAR NOGALES, ARIZONA, SEPTEMBER 29, 1954
CASE NO. 25
24 DECEMBER 1954, Zebra
Russell F. Newman, 2ND LT., USAF  
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING, NOGALES, ARIZONA, 29 SEPTEMBER 1954.
SUMMARY: (Under separate cover)
DETAILS: On 29 September 1954, at approximately 1900 hours, an unidentified object was sighted flying over the area of Nogales, Arizona. The pilot of a Cessna 170 aircraft, call sign 32Q, reported visual contact with the object. The pilot stated that he saw a silvery object, approximately 40 feet in diameter, which was flying at an altitude of about 15,000 feet. The object was seen to make a sudden right-angle turn and then depart the area at a high rate of speed. The pilot reported that all attempts to intercept the object were unsuccessful. Visual contact was made intermittently for approximately 10 minutes. The object was lost from sight when it disappeared into the clouds.
EVALUATION: The possibility exists that sighting was not of an Air Force airplane, and that is possibly was an unidentified object. However, the intermittent visual contact, high altitude, and abrupt maneuvers are characteristic of certain Air Force aircraft under certain conditions. The inability to make positive identification and the lack of conclusive evidence make it impossible to arrive at a definite conclusion as to the identity of the object sighted.
