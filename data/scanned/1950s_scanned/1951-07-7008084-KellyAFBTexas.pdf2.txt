1. SYNOPSIS: Strange lights which might possibly have been unconventional aircraft observed in the vicinity of San Angelo, Texas, on 21 July 1951.

2. DETAILS: On 21 July 1951, Cpl REGINALD D. SWENNEY, 6011 207 Tech. Sp. Sq., while on duty at the San Angelo Radio Range, Texas, observed an unusual object in the sky about 20 miles southwest of San Angelo. The object appeared to be elliptical in shape and was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. The object moved at a tremendous rate of speed, estimated at 1,000 to 1,500 mph, and was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object was seen to ascend rapidly, make a sharp 90 degree turn, and then descend at a sharp angle and disappear. Cpl SWENNEY states that the object emitted no exhaust or flame, and that the maneuvers performed were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. Cpl SWENNEY is a reliable and stable individual, has had considerable experience in observing conventional aircraft, and is positive in his identification of the object as being unconventional. No other witnesses were obtained.

3. The yellow light appeared to have no definite shape but was more like a "blob of light" which appeared to be brightly illuminated. DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR
