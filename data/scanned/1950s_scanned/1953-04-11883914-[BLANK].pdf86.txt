There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a document about Project Blue Book, discussing security information regarding the "Kansas" samples and advice from Dr. J. Allen Hynek on astronomical objects mistaken as "flying saucers". The document also discusses the use of interrogation forms during July, August, and September to obtain information from people who report sightings of unidentified aerial objects.

Regarding the "Kansas" samples, no difference was found between either the soil or the vegetation from the two areas from which the specimens were obtained. These samples are now being examined for radioactivity.

Advice and assistance from Dr. J. Allen Hynek was received during the month concerning astronomical objects mistaken as "flying saucers". A few fundamental rules which had been given before were further elaborated.

Dr. Hynek also gave ten consulting hours to the task of improving the questions in the latest revised questionnaire.

During July, August, and September, Dr. Paul M. Fitts and associates of the Aviation Psychology Department of Ohio State University have served as consultants on the preparation of a questionnaire that would permit the United States Air Force to obtain a maximum of useful information from those persons who report sightings of unidentified aerial objects. Insofar as possible, the following criteria were used in designing the questionnaire:

1. To develop questions which could transfer from the observer to the U.S. Air Force as much detailed information as possible concerning the event, without the necessity of a personal interview.
