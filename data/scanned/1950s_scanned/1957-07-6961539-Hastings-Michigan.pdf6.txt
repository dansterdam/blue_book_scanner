Dear Mr. Grace
Pentagon 
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir:

What you told me some time ago about sighting a strange object with flashing lights, which you thought might be an unidentified flying object, or what is commonly called a "flying saucer", has been troubling me. I want you to know that I think there is more to this than meets the eye. I know what these things are supposed to look like, and I think your report is valid. Please let me know if you have any other information.

Sincerely yours,
