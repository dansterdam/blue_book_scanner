Lt. Lt. Robert Olsson
Wright-Patterson AFB.

Dear Lt. Olsson:

This is a belated report on the last batch which I received at the end of April.

Just as soon as our plans for employing Miss Gluck officially go through, I shall be able to send you a sheet with comments on each individual case as this will have my comments on each folder. The latest method of preparing folders and completing forms, I had better stick to this letter method.

In this latest batch we have only 5 really interesting cases. I might mention 5 Feb, 26 March 52, 5 April 52, Sect AFB in which I have only one observer, and I'm following my usual rule of discounting those.

9 April was a metorite.
The Great Falls (3 April) case was Venus if reported time was in error.
28 March Elwood AFB was probably Venus.
Possibly have been balloon and 30 March Lyle, Washington, are puzzling but could be explained.
The 8 April Greenland case was an obvious meteor.

There was no radio reception this time but I'm surprised that March San Antonio could hardly have been a mirage and I'm sure this did exclude this case. The Cincinnati spring should be listed as nocturnal meandering light. Hard to believe that object could have done all that in 15 seconds. An interesting case and one that the regulationist/should be sent to Dr. Caletti.

I sent a list to see Hemphill to receive more dope on it. Questionaires should be sent to see Regular to see Hemphill to receive more dope on it. Questionaires should be sent to see Regular to see if there may have been a radio transmission. Apparently ducks have been mistaken - this might be the 22 February Pauliasseur AFB. Pehaps this was a helicopter, much more information on this one. Has this been received?

Sincerely,
C.Allen Hynek
