SAUCERS BOB UP AGAIN IN RIDGE REPORTS
By BILL ANDERSON
OAK RIDGE, Oct. 26 - The saucers that are supposed to be the flying 'pancakes' that we've read about from time to time, reappeared over Oak Ridge this week. But they are all reported from such reliable sources that the flying saucer stories of the past seem very unreal.

 have become a joint effort by the Air Force, the Atomic Energy commission, and officials connected with the Oak Ridge Project and the great effort to the pollution of atomic energy.

The saucers, described by reliable sources, were seen going through the air at terrific speed, making sharp turns, and appearing and disappearing. 

"When in the air it was accompanied by the sound of jets," they FIRST RIDGE REPORT

It was the first definite report of such an object to appear in the Atomic city. The Journal said The Journal had just learned of the report and that the people who saw them have "no comment on what they are."

The reports started to filter into the Journal that Oak Ridge residents had seen the objects, but they were first discounted, due to the fact that on the same day the reports came, flying saucers in Los Alamos appeared in the Denver Post. 

The Journal says its definitive reports were obtained and they show that several of the residents there are convinced that what they saw was not a flying saucer.
