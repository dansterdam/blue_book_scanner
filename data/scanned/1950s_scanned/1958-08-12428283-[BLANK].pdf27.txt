The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a typed document, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was the official U.S. Air Force program for investigating UFO sightings.

The text of the document is as follows:

WAS SEEKING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON UPPER SPACE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE CONDUCTING A CLOSED SECRET SESSION, UNRECORDED, NAMES OF WITNESSES TO BE HELD IN CONFIDENCE (THIS CANNOT BE OTHERWISE COMMUNICATED SINCE CONGRESS SESSIONS ARE NOT TO BE CONTROVERSIALLY PUBLICLY REFERENCED WITNESSES' STATEMENTS).
Air Force Astor chiefspokesman reviewed the ten year history of the UFO program and Captain Gregory gave a detailed explanation of the analyses and techniques employed by Air Force in evaluating UFO reports. In addition, delineation of responsibility for the UFO program in the Air Force, Air Force Public Relations, and attitude toward UFO organization, etc., were discussed. All questions asked were promptly and adequately answered. Throughout the hearings, the material was considered and the matter was the expression of confidence in the committee. Captain Gregory is to be especially commended for his performing his shore on related scientific data had great impact on the members.
The hearings, which began 7 August, will continue through the week of 11 - 15 August. Additional witnesses from public life will be called in, possibly Dr. Donald MENZEL, Investigative Committee on Aerial Phenomena, Captain RUPPELT, (Res.), former chief UFO Project Officer. AGAIN may be required to answer questions posed by public witnesses.
It is anticipated that AFCIN will benefit by the subject hearings. Due to approaching House elections, the committee members may produce a statement of More or confidence in the Air Force, assuring the public that the Air Force is not hiding any information on UFOs.
