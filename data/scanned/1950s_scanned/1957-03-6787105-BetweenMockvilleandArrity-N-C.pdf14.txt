The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report, possibly from Project Blue Book, that describes various UFO sightings.

According to the text in the document:

About 120 miles to the north of a town called MOCK VILLE at 19,000 feet, Capt. _____ and his co-pilot say the object to the VSU, and described it as pacing them and then sailing upward and then falling away in a circular fashion. They said it moved on an apparently erratic trajectory.

Flying 15 minutes ahead of the sighted object, PAA Flight 257 at 15,000 feet, did not notice the object. 

Some 180 miles to the southeast of PAA Flight 257, flying at 17,000 feet, Capt. _____ and co-pilot also saw the object, describing it as a bright light, traveling fast - it grew in intensity until it was exceedingly brilliant. Its similar size to Wayland at the summit - it was greenish-blue in color.

About 220 miles SSE of Van Nuys, at roughly 27° N, 69° 20' W (650 miles east of Wayland), PAA Flight 215 at 19,000 feet, also saw the same object.

The report also mentions that the pilots of these flights claimed to the control tower that the object was seen by all the other pilots, and a second engineer who called attention to the phenomenon, estimated that it was a word for it - and was a brilliant greenish-white in color.
