The objects maintained stable and constant courses and were observed for a period of ten to fifteen minutes as they flew across the end of the runway and entering the ground clutter on the south side of the runway.

2. The undersigned has had ten months experience observing precision GCA type radar scopes.

3. Believe objects to be birds.
