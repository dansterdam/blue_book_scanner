Memorandum for Record
SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952

On 17 May 1952, Lt Ruppelt, called Major Vincent Valrath, Wing Intelligence Officer at George AFB, Calif. Major Valrath stated that some sightings of unidentified flying objects had been made at George AFB. It was decided to send one man from ATIC to George AFB. Lt Ruppelt had orders out and departed by commercial air on 20 May 1952, arriving at George AFB late on the evening of the 20th.

On 21 May 1952, Lt Ruppelt contacted Major Valrath who reviewed the sightings from a T-6 airplane. Several T-6 pilots had observed a strange object in the sky. Plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 21 May.

Lt Meiser, who had piloted the T-6, during previous observations was contacted. He stated that P.M. and Lt Ruppelt had observed a bright object which they couldn't identify as an airplane, balloon, or astronomical phenomenon. Both ground control and air control of the flights scrambled and observed the object. They agreed to stand by all afternoon on 21 May. F-86's would be scrambled and radar would attempt a pick-up. A ground station and around observer were added by Major Valrath with a genuine VHF net and would have a better chance of detecting the object. However, the object was not seen and no further sightings occurred.

At 1330 PDST, the T-6 was airborne. Lt Ruppelt had a 16 mm camera with a 135 mm telephoto lens in case photos could be taken. At 1420 PDST, the ground observer notified the control tower that they had a target on the radar screen coming in from the west and proceeding south. The target was followed and observed through the previous reports as high as 30,000 feet. The aerial search was discontinued due to the loss of the target and the T-6 landed.

The Ruppelt team then contacted the Commanding General of the 831st Air Division at George AFB and was informed that a 1235 PDST a 80 ft balloon from their station (approximately 75,000 - 80,000 cubic feet of helium) had been released with a sonobuoy attached.

It was concluded that the object was this balloon.

On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It was still be noted that although some of the incidents were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.

Lt Ruppelt returned to W-P AFB on 23 May.

The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.
