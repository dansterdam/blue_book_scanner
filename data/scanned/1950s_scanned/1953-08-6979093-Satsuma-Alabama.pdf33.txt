Gentlemen:

I am writing you in reference to some residual material which was recovered from a UFO which exploded at Trancas Beach, Brazil during September 1957. I believe Major Tack has forwarded our initial correspondence concerning this matter.

A misunderstanding concerning AFR 200-2 which we entertained earlier has been clarified and we are ready to work with a basic for cooperation. We are enclosing the current issue of our Bulletin which delivers on some of the specific terms. A technical report of a very thorough nature is being prepared by Dr. von Broen and will be finished if you wish. We will forward a copy for your information when completed.

In addition to the Trancas UFO, we have some residual material which was recovered from a UFO incident in 1955 near Satsuma, Alabama where a UFO penetrated it. Can you obtain some information as to what this material is? If not, would you like some of our experts to take a look at it?

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Director
