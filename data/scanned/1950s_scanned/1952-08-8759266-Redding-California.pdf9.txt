It is impossible to state definitely what the object was which was observed. From descriptions of it and the manner in which it moved it does not appear to have been a normal aircraft, no exhaust or engines were seen, and there was no sound. The object appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed and its motion was without any comparison to that of conventional aircraft. I would hesitate to state that it was an "unidentified flying object" but in any case, the object observed could not be identified as any known type of aircraft.
