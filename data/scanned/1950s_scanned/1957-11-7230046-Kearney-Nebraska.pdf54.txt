THE KEARNEY INCIDENT

and said, "If any of your friends are
watching you now, they will not be
able to see you."
    But I could still see the entire
countryside. I asked them while in 
flight what powered their ship -
what kind of gas did they use?
    "We get our power from the sun
and from the earth." I was told.
    Inside the ship it was like sitting
in your living room. As far as sen­
sation was concerned, their ship
wasn't any, either in flight or in the
ascent or descent.
    The ship landed on the dry river
bed again among the leaves. Inci­
dentally, both times the ship landed
on what`is called accretion land.
That is land that cannot be sold or
owned privately, only leased by the
owner of the adjoining land. At one
time this land was part of the river
bottom covered with water. Then the
river channel was deeper and nar­
rowed by man, and this part of the
river bed grew up in grass and brush
and trees. I have since wondered if
they purposely chose this land so
that. they would not be trespassing
on private property. Also, it may be
interesting to note that Kearney
is located on Highway 30, in the mid­
dle of the United States from east
to west. At a point just outside of
Kearney it is 1733 miles to San
Francisco and 1733 miles to Boston.
  The favor they wanted of me was
the answers to three questions:
  1. What would the United States
do if other planets were to set off
atomic bombs and to start Sputniks
and other satellites flying around
which would affect the earth and
interrupt its radio and TV operations
and other devices?
  2. What was the plane carrying
that disintegrated over the Pacific
on the way from San Francisco to
Honolulu besides passengers?
  3. How would your people react if a
fleet of these ships would land on a
friendly mission? Would they accep[
us on friendly terms?
  I promised to try to get the ans­
wers, and if they would give me
their address, I said I would gladly
forward this information to them.
The spokesman smiled and said,
"We will contact you again."
  Then I asked, "How did you know
I was on this road, or do you pick up
just anybody?"
  "No," he answered, and then he
said, "Your people have fingerprints
for identification; we have your
brain impulses and can pick you up
at any time."
  Then I suggested I might be in
California by the time I got the ans­
wers for them.
  "That doesn't make any differ­
ence," he said. "We can pick you up
any place, any time."
  And when I left the ship, they
said, "Goodbye, we'll see you again."
  Although they asked me no ques­
tions the first time we met, they
seemed to know all about me, and
this second time they greeted me by
my first name, Reinhold. I told them
about all the trouble I had re­
porting their first visit.
  "Yes, we knew about it," I was
told, "and we were standing by. If
they hadn't released you from the
hospital by a certain time we would
have put on a mass demonstration
over Kearney and made ourselves
known."
  When we were back at my car and
I was about to leave they said, "We
have stopped your car twice now,
and if we stop it a third time your
battery will be dead.”
  Both times my battery boiled dry.
I have a twelve-volt battery with a
three-year guarantee. It is a little
over a year old. The black top coat­
ing of this battery has holes blown
in it from the excess presure when
they stopped the car. The second
time one of the filler knobs of the
