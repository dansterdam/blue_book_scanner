July, 1950, 1:45 P.M. Sighter and wife prefer anonymity. Place: Mt. Washington, Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr. R is an engineer of C.A.A.I.; was flight engineer 11 years.
Mr. R. observed the object while sitting in his backyard. A dark spot, being gold in bright daylight, caught his eye. He described the object as "wingless and fuselage shaped" climbing up at a 60 degree angle into a sunny sky filled with cumulus clouds.
After a quick acceleration, the grayish metallic object reached its new elevation at 10 to 18,000 feet, then sailed along at about 10 seconds. While calling his wife to witness the event, Mr. R. watched the object dive back to its original elevation before levelling off and racing toward across the Cincinnati skies.
The object, which looked the size of a DC 3 as it would appear at 8,000 feet, disappeared in 3 seconds without making a sound or leaving an exhaust trail. The sound was estimated at about 5,000 r.p.m. Mr. R said the object was "definitely solid and was controlled." The Air Force, upon learning of the incident, visited Mr. R at his home ... to get the facts.
Mr. R's integrity like that of Mr. K is above reproach; both are experienced in aeronautical identification and balloonological phenomena. Both objects are unexplained unless we are willing to accept the Interplanetary explanation.
