UNDERNEATH (C) NONE (D) NONE (1) NONE (2) (A) SOURCES WIFE HAPPENED
TO BE LOOKING OUT OF A WINDOW IN THEIR LIVINGROOM AND CALLED HIS
ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS AN UNUSUAL STAR.
APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST SIGHTING SHE NOTICED
THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING AND HAD COME CONSIDERABLY CLOSER AND
SHE INSISTED THAT SOURCE LOOK. WHEN SOURCE SIGHTED THE OBJECT
HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY A WEATHER BALLOON BEING
RELEASED AT PORT COLUMBUS. HOWEVER, AFTER CLOSER EXAMINATION THIS WAS
RULED OUT AND HE AND HIS WIFE DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE TO GET A BETTER
LOOK IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHAT THE OBJECT WAS (A) APPROXIMATELY
15 DEG, 345 DEG. (C) APPROXIMATELY 28 DEG, 240 DEG. (D) WHEN FIRST
OBSERVED THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 1,500 FEET ABOVE THE
GROUND. THEN IT ASCENDED VERTICALLY AT A VERY SLOW RATE
TO WHAT THE SOURCE JUDGED TO BE 3,500 FEET. THEN IT STARTED ACCELERATING
IN ALMOST LEVEL FLIGHT TOWARD THE SOUTH-WEST AT AN EVER INCREASING RATE.
(E) WHEN LAST SEEN IT WAS AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 323 FEET.
GOING AWAY FROM SOURCE AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARED
(F) THE ENTIRE OBSERVATION FROM THE FIRST SIGHTED UNTIL IT
DISAPPEARED WAS FROM FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES. AFTER THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED
SOURCE AND WIFE RE-ENTERED THE HOUSE TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS OF SIGHTING.
