At 1900, 27 February 1953, I was occupying the right gunner's position of a B-50 type aircraft No. 9365 on a routine training mission. During this period we were under a simulated attack from four (4) F-86 type fighter aircraft from George AFB, Victorville, California. I was searching for fighters in my assigned quadrant when a light jet aircraft appeared at three (3) o'clock high crossing over course to right at (2) o'clock. As I observed this aircraft, I noticed a silver ball on the right wing. The ball was stationary and we left it behind within three (3) minutes. The ball appeared to be made of polished metal, silver or chrome. It appeared to be small, and due to this fact I could not notice any flat surfaces.
During the filming, the sequences of pictures with my G.E.A.F. camera so that only the object remained. In the second sequence I turned the vehicle on and placed the center dot on the left side of the object.
