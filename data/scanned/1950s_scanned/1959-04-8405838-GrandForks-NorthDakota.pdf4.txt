"Dear George,
I wish to report what I saw the other night at about 2:00 a.m. I will tell you the thing I saw.
A cigar-shaped helicopter powered by 3 small reactors sort of rested right over my place a few times. Each time it light [sic] up the whole area as bright as day. It got so I could see everything clear to. It seemed to fall up again clean. An the light of the air was brighter than the real right. It stayed there enough to more the same.
Yours truly

P.S. just a tip - what if something persuade is dangerous to the ground and our side, it could do enormous things all depending."
