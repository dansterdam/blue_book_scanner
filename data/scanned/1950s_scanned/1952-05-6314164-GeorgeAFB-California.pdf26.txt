STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which we are concerned. These balloons are released irregularly thus accounting for some of the unusual times of sightings reported in cases which are probably balloons.
