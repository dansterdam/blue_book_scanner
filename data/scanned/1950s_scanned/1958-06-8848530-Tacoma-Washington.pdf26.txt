The text in the form reads: "On June 24, 1958, I seen several large orange shaped objects come in over the ocean at tremendous speed and go back out over the ocean. They came in at an extremely fast speed and made a zig-zag motion in the sky. About the size of a dime at arm's length, many times larger than a jet plane and more oval shaped than round. They seemed to be traveling about 3,000 miles an hour. This went on for about 30 minutes."
