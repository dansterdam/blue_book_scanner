Saucers trail AIRLINER
By Curtis Fuller

This amazing performance was witnessed by 39 persons on the plane for 45 minutes and 250 miles.

AT 7:10 p.m. on Wednesday, February 25, an American Air Lines DC-6 airliner took off from Washington, D.C. for Chicago. Aboard were 35 passengers. As the controls were Capt. Peter Killian of Syosset, N.Y., an airline veteran of 13 years, and co-pilot. Passengers were Edna La Gate and Beverly Pinzere.

After about an hour and a half in the air, the plane was cruising smoothly at 19,000 feet over Williamsport and Bradford, Pa. At 8:45 p.m. Killian looked off to the south where he saw three bright lights in a single horizontal line overhead.

"At first I thought it was the Belt of Orion (a constellation), but then I took a better look and it wasn't the stars and the foreign objects," Killian later reported.

"When Dee caught the expression on my face he asked me if anything was wrong, and I asked him if he saw the 'things' and asked him if there were any lighting bugs in the cockpit.

"The objects were by no means stand still. At intervals, they'd back again, and change its place in the formation, while keeping abreast of the ship."

Killian decided to let the passengers have a look.
