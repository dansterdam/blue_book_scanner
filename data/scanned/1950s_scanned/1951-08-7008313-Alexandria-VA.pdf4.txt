REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SIGHTED BY LT. ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA - 19 AUGUST 1951
Time: 1805 EDT
Wind: Surface 53M/12; 1000 190/13; 5000 220/15; 10,000 310/15 (ANACOSTIA VAS 1600 EST)
Description of Object Sighted: A "frosty" silvery football-shaped object with its longitudinal axis parallel to the ground, of estimated size at time of sighting 50 feet along longitudinal axis and 20 feet vertical axis. 
Shape: Elliptical, or football, shaped. Shape did not change.
Position When First Sighted: Time 1807--appeared to be about 2 miles southeast of Masonic Memorial in Alexandria and about 3-4 miles from observer.
Apparent Altitude: 2000 to 3000 feet. Steady.
Elevation: 5-7Â° decreasing slightly as object appeared to move into distance.
Course: Away from, and to the right of observer, estimated 1559 true.
Position When Last Sighted: Time 1807--estimated 10 to 12 miles further away. Object had turned off King Street to go up Masonic Memorial hill for a better look--arrived in clear view on top of hill. Unable to sight object again.
Unusual Characteristics: Unusual in that the object did not change its reflection as it moved through the sunlight. No trails or other disturbances. No vapor trail. No smoke or other sign of propulsion. No apparent noise.
Summary: This object appeared to be progressing along a controlled flight path at a constant altitude. Its angular decrease in elevation is believed to be due to its distance from the observer which increased at the same time. It did not behave like a balloon. It did not look like any form of aircraft known to the observer.
