10 June 1953
Description
At 2310 EST on 10 June 1953 an AFROTIC cadet at Wayne University observed one large bright object that was white or light yellow in color, round in shape and larger than a star. This object moved from a high westerly position in a climbing arc toward the north and then leveled off. This object made these maneuvers in a period of 60 seconds and disappeared over the northern horizon. The object, though bright, cast no beam nor left any trail or exhaust. No sound was noticed.
Discussion
Movements of this object and length of observation eliminate the possibility that it was of astronomical origin. Checks with airports in the vicinity revealed that there was no aircraft in the area. This was a DC-4 enroute to Chicago on a heading of 270 deg and was probably not in the area. The object was only seen for a short time and the weather balloon was determined to be eliminated 0800Z but it could not have caused the sighting since it burst before 0002Z.
Conclusion
Unsolved
