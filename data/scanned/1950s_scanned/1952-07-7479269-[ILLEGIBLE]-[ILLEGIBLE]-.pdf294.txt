STATEMENT OF Private Frederic A. Firouzi (Cont'd)
angle that of a plane, which gave the impression that they were flying in
this same direction. I would say that plane was going very fast, but this
object's acceleration was tremendous, it made the plane seem to stand still.
To the best of my ability, I would describe it as being round in
shape, clean looking, and shiny as it stood very high in the sky. There
was no blurred edges about it, or anything in my line of sight.
The two outstanding features of this event were:
1. the swelling motion, and standstill of the object.
2. the acceleration; I fortunately had the presence of the antennae
edge, and the plane to compare it with.
I am also sure it was maneuvering at a higher attitude than that
of the plane.
