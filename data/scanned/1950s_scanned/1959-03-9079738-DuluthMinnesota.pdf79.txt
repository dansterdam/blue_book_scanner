DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO. SUBJECT UFO #D7-UFO-8-1-59
TO AFOIN-4Hqs FROM AFOIN-4H1 DATE 6 May 1959 COMMENT NO. 1
The following information is forwarded based on an analysis of UFO #D7-UFO-8-1-59.
1. It is difficult to accurately correlate the attached film with the report, without identification of the shape, orientation, range setting and time indication.
2. The reports of airborne contacts cannot be evaluated as actual airborne objects due to the insufficient data as the interceptor approached the radar target.
Since the AN/FPS-6, height finder, was unable to pick up the targets at such a close range (15-18 miles), it is believed that the phenomenon of "angels" could have been due to meteorological conditions rather than actual aircraft. Such indications of "angels" have been experienced before.
