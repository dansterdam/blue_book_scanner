PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

The object observed approximately 5 miles south of El Tovar, California on 1 May 1952 at 1450 PST appeared to be shaped like a elliptical or cigar-shaped object of tremendous size. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed, estimated to be between 500 and 600 mph.

The object was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in length, and 10-15 feet in width. It was observed against a clear sky, and appeared to be a metallic light-gray or silver in color.

The object was observed by the reporting witness, who is a reliable and intelligent observer, for a total of 3 minutes as it passed overhead. During this time, the object made no sound and left no trail of exhaust or vapor. It was observed to make one slight turn or adjustment in its course, but maintained a generally straight-line flight path.

Reliability: The witness is considered a reliable observer. The phenomena observed is not explained by any known aerial vehicle or natural phenomena, and the reliability of the witness, the nature of the sighting, and the lack of any logical explanation leads the undersigned to believe that the report is of a genuine unidentified aerial object.
