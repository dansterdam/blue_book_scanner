UNCLASSIFIED

For the period from 7 September 1951 to 10 September 1951, the matter of sightings of unidentified flying objects was investigated . The observer's report contained the following details:

At approximately 2200 hours on 7 September 1951, the observer sighted a strange light in the sky. The light appeared to be stationary at first, but then it started moving in various directions, alternately fast and slow, for a period of about 15 minutes. The light was observed to be about the size of a star, but much brighter. There were no other objects or lights visible in the sky at the time. 

The report states that the observer was a reliable person, and that he was certain that the object he observed was not an aircraft, balloon, or any other known object. However, the report concludes that the object observed was likely to have been a meteor or some other natural phenomenon, and that there was insufficient evidence to determine its exact nature.

The report does not contain any photographs or other visual evidence of the observed object.
