INCIDENT REPORT

DATE 6 October 1959 

LOCATION Langley AFB, Va.

WITNESSES: MSGT J. Frank Jablonski
A/lC Claude R. Smith

DESCRIPTION:

At approximately 11:20 PM, October 6, 1959, MSGT J. Frank Jablonski and A/lC Claude R. Smith were returning to Langley APB, Va. from Yorktown, Va. when they observed three bright lights in the sky. The lights were moving at high speed in a north-easterly direction at about 45 degrees above the horizon.

The lights appeared to be a bright white in color and triangular in shape. The lights seemed to be about the size of a 50 cent piece held at arm's length. They appeared to be spaced about 50 to 100 yards apart. 

The witnesses watched the lights for about 2 to 3 minutes until they disappeared from sight. They appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed and made no sound that was audible to the witnesses. 

The witnesses were unable to determine the altitude or exact size of the objects. Weather conditions at the time were clear.

RECOMMENDATION: None
