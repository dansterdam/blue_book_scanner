STATEMENT

This was scrambled from Misawa Air Base, at approximately 2001 hours, 8 Jul 52. It was at an approximate altitude of 10,000 feet, proceeding at a high rate of speed toward the southwest. It was observed to travel a distance of approximately 5 miles in approximately 5 minute(s) (5) and disappear to the west. 
A civilian pilot, who was flying at 9,500 feet, reported that he saw a greenish-white light approaching his aircraft. The pilot stated that the light appeared much brighter than the intensity of the running lights on his aircraft, and was traveling in a straight line. The radar operator was directing his attention to the scope at the time of the encounter. The object dove toward the scope and tried to follow it down, but reportedly dove below the scope coverage. A search of the area showed nothing unusual.

Dix TRAB Comments:
The "strange phenomenon" referred to in the statement by Captain Lamb was very brief in duration. As approximate 5-minute sighting of an object traveling several miles indicates nothing except a very brief observation which leaves no certainty of the true nature of the phenomenon. The radar operator was apparently distracted by other tasks at the critical moment, and missed making an accurate identification or tracking of the object. Little of value can be determined from this incident other than to note the report that it was seen and could not be tracked further.
