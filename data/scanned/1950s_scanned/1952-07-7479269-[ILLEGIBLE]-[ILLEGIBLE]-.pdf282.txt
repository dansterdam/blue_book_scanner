STATEMENT OF: PFC MARTINELLI

We happened to be looking at jet planes and accidently seen a white disc in the air about 20,000 feet. The disc seem to be still then when at a terrific speed towards the south. We then took the speed of the disc compare with the jets and it seem to be that the disc was going faster than the jets. In less than 1 minute it was reported it to Mr. Miles.

Mr. Miles then asked us questions about it, he then told some of us man to go back and see if we could see any more of them. I then came back and get a polaroid from one of the JPO. I kept looking for one about ten minutes and then seen one come from the north going towards the south. The disc seem to be going at a terrific speed much greater than a jet plane. This happen at 1600.
