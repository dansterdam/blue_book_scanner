"THE A.P.R.O. BULLETIN

March, 1960

Trinidade:

The incident which occurred on this island south of Brazil on January 16, 1958 when the USS subchaser Almirante Saldhana spotted a strange object in the ocean and contacted the Navy for assistance, is still very much in evidence. By the end of August, 1958, the Brazilian Navy had received 1253 reports of unidentified flying objects sighted by personnel of the ship. These strange objects were variously described as silver metallic, round, disc-shaped and surrounded by a greenish glow. The whole incident is well-documented and there are signed statements from the commander of the ship, Almirante Saldanha, as well as other officers and crew.

The sightings were made at various times during the day and night, sometimes hovering and sometimes moving at very high speeds. Flashes of light were also observed coming from the object, and on some occasions, smaller objects were seen emerging from the main body of the strange craft. The main object itself was estimated to be about 60 feet in diameter. 

There were many observers on the ship and their testimony was confirmed by a military report by a naval officer who was present. The object was tracked by radar and photographed by Lt. Jose Teobaldo Viegas, the ship's photographer. He stated that the object was metallic, shaped like two saucers placed rim to rim and was under intelligent control.

The Navy ordered the ship to close on the object, but as they neared it, the strange craft rose vertically and disappeared from sight very rapidly. This incident is considered one of the most important and best-documented sightings on record. The photographs and official reports are on file with the Brazilian Navy."
