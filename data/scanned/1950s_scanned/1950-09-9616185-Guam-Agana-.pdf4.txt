The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of UFO reports from the U.S. Air Force.

Mr. President - 
I feel that if I were questioned by competent scientists I could give more information on the type of unknown objects I have sighted which I know from experience must be outer space craft. My life's experience is not very long and times awaitin'

Sincerely,
Dallas
