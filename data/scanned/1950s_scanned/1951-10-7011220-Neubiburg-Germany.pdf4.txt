STATEMENT OF CARL E. LUCAS

AT 0845 on 11 October 1951, Sergeant Robert E. Vick called me from the control tower and stated he had observed an object in the sky. He swung his hand toward the southwest and instantly saw the object. It was about 2 miles distant and appeared to be at an altitude of about 5000 feet. It seemed to be metallic and had a dark center. As I watched, it seemed to oscillate or shimmer like a reflected light. After observing it for about thirty (30) odd seconds, I looked for about thirty (30) odd seconds and immediately left to get someone else. I did not see it again.
