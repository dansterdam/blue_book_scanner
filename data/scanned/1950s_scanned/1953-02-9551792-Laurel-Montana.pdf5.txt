Transcription of the text in the document:

At 8:45 a.m. a very bright light was observed crossing the sky from the north to south. It was estimated to be travelling at a rather slow rate of speed as it crossed the sky in about 7-8 seconds. The light appeared to be oval-shaped and had a greenish-blue color. It was a rather clear day with a few scattered clouds in the sky.
