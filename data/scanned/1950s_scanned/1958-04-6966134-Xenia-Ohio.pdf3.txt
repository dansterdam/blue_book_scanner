The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon with a point labeled "A" to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when first seen. The second sketch shows a larger view of the object's position, with a point labeled "A" and another point labeled "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon.

The third sketch depicts a road with a person standing on it, along with a landscape in the background.

Text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
