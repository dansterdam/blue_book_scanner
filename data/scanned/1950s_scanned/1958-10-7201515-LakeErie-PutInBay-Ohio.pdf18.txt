There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Light had been a visibility was good against a clear blue sky. I talked with one of the men who took the light on the same date and he told me they saw the same light as I did. My father told me he saw it 3 weeks ago. There were other times the light behaved in the same manner.

All of these men average about 20 to 25 years of experience on the lakes and are quite familiar with airplanes sightings. They said that it definitely wasn't an airplane or anything else they have ever seen. It seems to me that we ought to watch this area carefully in case you are still interested in these things. It might be worth your while to check on it or at least somebody else.

Yours truly,
