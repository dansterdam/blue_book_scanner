The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a typed document. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

I saw one object. It looked like a large brilliant star. It was a brass coloured object, approximately 1/2 the size of a full moon. It seemed to be hovering motionless over the tree tops for approximately 30 minutes.

I didn't see the object move at all. The object was directly overhead.

I observed this object for approximately 1 or 2 seconds at a time.

I observed this object visually from the ground.

I was the 32nd person who reported this, when I saw this object. I couldn't estimate how high the object was.

I have been on the guard force, Tinker AFB, for about 13 1/2 years. I have had a lot of weather balloons and other objects seen in the sky during this time.

I don't remember about the weather.

I didn't take any photographs and didn't obtain any fragments of it.

I didn't see any aircraft in the air at that time.
