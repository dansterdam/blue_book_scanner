The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document. As per the instructions, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

The attached drawing and photo is a photo of a strange object seen in the sky over Tinker AFB, Oklahoma on July 17, 1959.

The object was not visible to the naked eye but was photographed through binoculars. It appeared oblong in shape and moved quite rapidly through the sky.

I would normally state that this was no doubt some type of aircraft, however, the witness states that the object had no visible means of propulsion and that it moved in a very erratic manner.

I would not consider this of any great importance except that the witness is a reliable observer and I have checked the area and find no record of any activity in the vicinity at that time.
