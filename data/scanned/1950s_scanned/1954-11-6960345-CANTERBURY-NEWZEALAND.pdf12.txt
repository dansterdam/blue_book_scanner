Did I See a Flying Saucer - or Cigar - Over Canterbury?
By a Staff Reporter
Who saw anything strange that Wednesday at noon-time that some hundreds of Canterbury residents have been discussing since?
Nearly everyone seems to know about this or that man or woman who claims to have seen something unusual in the clear Canterbury sky on that day.
Sceptics say, with some cynicism, that some persons who claim to have seen something will admit, on close questioning, that they saw "only a balloon" or "only an aeroplane".
But there are others who firmly insist that what they saw was neither balloon nor aeroplane - but something very different and much more mysterious.
Not balloon
According to their story, a gleaming cigar-shaped object, high in the sky, appeared suddenly and started to move rapidly across the Canterbury landscape.
It was not a balloon, they say, for it was too fast and too high-up for that. Neither was it an aeroplane, for the shape and the speed were quite unlike those of any known aeroplane. The object moved in a jerky fashion, now stopping, now moving, and it seemed to change direction frequently.
After a while it disappeared from sight, leaving many onlookers puzzled and more than a little intrigued by what they had seen.
