STATEMENT:
It approximately 2125 on the evening of 11 November, 1956, I received a call from the control tower at the Marine Air Station at ElToro, California, stating that they had observed several unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the vicinity of our unit and observed the objects myself. I called up the squadron commander, ordered up the squadron photographer, crawled up the shop control tower, and observed the objects myself. I called for a photographer, grabbed up the binoculars and watched the objects for about 10 minutes. The objects stated that they were on my trying but (I) could not observe anything. As about 2230 I had the photographer come out with about 200-300 feet of movie film to take movies of the objects, as there seemed to be a build up of some constant large objects in the area, without increasing or decreasing distance for a period of about five minutes. I advised Radar that they were on the screen, and they advised me that they were painted on the screen, then they lost them. As about 2300, then came back and refused. I then requested Radar to please contact the dispatcher at Los Angeles Center and advise them to notify aircraft in the area of these objects, so that they could also observe them. Radar contacted them and they replied back and we took off.
Again, at about 2330, I saw movement of some objects to the North of us, very close and after watching them for about 10 minutes they disappeared. We called Radar again and they reported that about 2320, some 6 separated objects were painted on the screen and the last time they were observed were at about 2330. They called back and said the objects had disappeared. 
As at about 2335, I again observed an object or objects, at about 300 feet, and seemed to be amber in color and hovering. Radar had him, he stopped as I watched, then the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared, all in about 5 seconds. I then could make out 5 or 6 smaller objects hovering at about 2,000 feet for about 15 minutes, then they too disappeared.
We discontinued at 0635 on the morning of 12 November.
