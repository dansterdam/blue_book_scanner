On 30 March 1950, an unidentified flying object was observed
at a point between two to five miles ENB of Greater Pittsburgh Airport. The
observers of the object were Ist Lt James A. Frazier, 40-86522, a member of
2239th AFRTC, Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who was on
duty at that time as officer of the day, and Paul Raymon, AF 19226092, a 
member of the same organization, who was on duty at the time of the incident as a 
military policeman.
No photographs or sketches of the object were made, however,
described as being round with a 50 ft. diameter; its color was white. The object 
was first sighted at an altitude between 2,000 and 2,500 feet and was observed until
it went out of sight at 20,000 feet. It was observed for a period of approximately
five minutes. The object appeared to hover and then began climbing out of sight.
to the east at an approximate speed of 50 to 60 mph.
The object's rate of climb was estimated to be about 5,000 feet per
minute. It emitted no sound. No trail was given off by the object but it had
what seemed to be an exhaust flame in the center of the disc. The object appeared
to be shaped like a parachute 50 to 60 feet in diameter. It was flat on the 
bottom but circular in shape.

Appearance of object at Night Service Center. Weather at the time of
sighting was Clear, with 10 mile visibility.
