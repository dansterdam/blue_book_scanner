1. I am investigating an alleged sighting of unidentified flying objects in the vicinity of Fairfax, Oklahoma on the morning of 2 November 1958.

The observer states that he saw four orange colored discs in the sky formation headed due south, and that they passed through his front windshield for about five or six seconds.

I would appreciate a possible confirmation of any aircraft in this area under your observation in the vicinity of Fairfax, Oklahoma, on 2 November 1958, that might be the observer's UFO's. If you have heard or know of any other information on this particular incident, please forward same.
