The image contains a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. There are two diagrams labeled "A" and "B" illustrating the position of an object in the sky according to a witness.

Project Blue Book Text:
In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown by the "+" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. Place a "+" at the same curved line to show how high you last saw it.
In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was at its position when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
