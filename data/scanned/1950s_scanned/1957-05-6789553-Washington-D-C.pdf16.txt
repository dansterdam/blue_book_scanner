At approximately 8:15 p.m. on 6 May 1957, the observer, [redacted], was outside his residence at [redacted], Washington, D.C., when he observed a bright light in the sky. The light was initially stationary, but then started to move in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed. The observer estimated the object's speed to be approximately 1,000 mph. The light then stopped and hovered for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

The observer reported the incident to the nearest Air Force base, and this report is the result of the subsequent investigation.

The high rate of speed and maneuverability exhibited by the object are not characteristic of any known aircraft.
