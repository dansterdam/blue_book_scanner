Dear Colonel ------

We have received a call from our 1950 crash and are unable to find a sighting under your name. If you would inform us of the exact date and location, we may be able to locate your sighting.

I am enclosing FTD Form 164 which is used in making such reports to the Air Force. The form should be completed as fully as possible and returned to Headquarters, Foreign Technology Division, AFSC, USAF Base, Ohio 45433.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
