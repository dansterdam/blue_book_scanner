20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. If possible, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with the following objects held in the hand at arm's length?

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine as nearly as you can what the object that you saw would look like if (How large would it be, and what shape?) you could draw a picture of it. Of what type material would you say it was made? What color or colors was it? Approximately what was the size as compared to some common object like a baseball, basketball, or silver dollar?
