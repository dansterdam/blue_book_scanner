STREAMLINE WINDS RANGE, WETOH, TOUCHDOWN
Case 156, Adelaide, Australia, June 18, 1955 - Reported by the editor, but let's face it, something's wrong. It was a special report, deemed too private, by the AUIS Research Section. I'm afraid we're not at liberty to reveal more about their identity and character of the football. The report reads: a follow-up showed little doubt that the anomalous weather - defined as streamline winds of a 1,000 yards radius at 200-300 ft altitude - actually occurred. This was observed at 5:28 p.m. on June 18 in the southern suburbs of Fletcher's Park at 5:28 p.m. on June 18, when the winds were estimated at 15-20 knots and lasted from 2-3 minutes.
Several witnesses described this "phenomenon", which involved a large dark object traversing rapidly and silently in the streamline pattern, and their unanimous testimony seems quite certain. Authorities have ruled out normal causes. Investigation over the weekend disclosed that a large "shape" resembling a ball or ovoid hovered at about 200 ft altitude just prior to the "touchdown" of the winds. Radar stations were alerted (but the object was not detected). The winds then subsided as quickly as they had appeared.
There is little doubt that some anomalistic aerial event took place over the Adelaide area on June 18. The report also stated that the object moved across the sky in a streamline pattern, suggesting a possible connection with the winds. A small amount of debris present, however, it was possibly not significant enough to warrant extensive inquiry. The investigators conceded that the exact nature of the event remains speculative. They stated that more data would be required to determine exactly what occurred on that day over Adelaide.
