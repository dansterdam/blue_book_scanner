AF FORM 7 - PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 3-D, 4502d AISS, 3-0-958-1-30, PART I, PAGE 15

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
a. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the object was probably the planets Venus for the following reasons:
a. Using the process of elimination, the object was no doubt not the planet Venus.
b. T. A. Mannis and L.G. Dorman tend to support the possibility that the object could have been a glob of limited extent, but this also support their opinion that such a theory would be very difficult to agree with in view of symptoms more probable.
c. Bright objects of the type (morning star) Venus in the sky over the base that day could certainly not be cognizant of or notable in measures to the degree the witnesses stated the object to be - impossible.
d. The object was observed by one (1) observer for four (4) hours. These numbers could be meaningless or gross distortions due to the intense interest presumably experienced by the witness. The object was seen in the West, which is direction from which Venus would be arising.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
a. It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was definitely hypothetical in nature. The following details in support of the above:
a. The planet Venus was located at the same position as the UFO sighting body in the sky.
b. The long duration of the sighting.
c. Failure of airborne radar as well as three (3) ground radar sets to pick up the object.
d. The attempted air intercept by Captain Solena, Venus was suspected, but the poor direction of the object made it impossible to maintain visual contact and take the object was the approximate size of Venus.
