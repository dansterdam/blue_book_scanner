(The statement enclosed to this letter follows:)

(1) At 1130 hours 29 March 52, I was flying a T-C-6 aircraft approximately due north at an altitude of approximately 13,000 feet. I was cruising at an indicated airspeed of approximately 200 mph. Suddenly I observed an unidentified object, stationary, at approximately 6000 feet. The object remained stationary and I flew past it. It then disappeared. The object was silver in color and about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The object had no apparent propulsion system. It remained absolutely stationary during the entire period of observation which was approximately 15-20 seconds, after which the object disappeared. I could not determine any air movement or distortion of the air around the object. The weather was very good. I do not remember any clouds that day.
