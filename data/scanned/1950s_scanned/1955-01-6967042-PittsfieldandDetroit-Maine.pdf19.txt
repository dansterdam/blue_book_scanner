Oregonians Sight
Eerie Blue Light

LA GRANDE, Ore., Jan. 28 -
(AP)- A glowing blue light is the
latest thing being spotted in the
sky over the Blue Mountains
along the Washington-Oregon
border.

Two state police troopers,
Erikon and Barnes, and farmer
Thompson reported that they saw
a blue light over the highway near
Meacham, Ore., last week.

"It dimmed his lights," Thompson said. "There was no sound. It seemed to be coming
toward him on the highway. It
flicked a beam of blue light that
passed over his car and when it
moved upward the beam also raised
with a humming sound.

A week later, Robert Hackus, 
another state policeman, reported
he had encountered the same phenomenon. He looked up and saw overhead what appeared to be a blue
light from which a humming sound
seemed to come.
