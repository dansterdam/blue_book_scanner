MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE LIAISON
SUBJECT: McClellan Subcommittee Statement Concerning Air Force Handling of UFO Reports

1. Investigators for the McClellan Subcommittee (the Senate Committee on Investigating Government Operations) recently held informal discussions (January 1958) with us concerning the advisability of conducting public hearings on the Air Force's handling of UFO reports. The thrust of the subcommittee's concern was the alleged withholding of information on this subject. I am sure we convinced them that this was not the case, as they have since indicated there is no need for hearings on this subject.

In view of these findings, based upon their preliminary informal investigation, this office would like to assure the McClellan Subcommittee that the Air Force's position on unidentified flying objects and its policy of not withholding information on this subject from the public is proper and definite. The statement spelled out that the Air Force has a definite public information plan in effect concerning unidentified flying objects.

2. Request SAFLL review the possibility and/or feasibility of obtaining such a statement from the McClellan Subcommittee.

ARNO H. LUEHMAN
Director of Information Services
