There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document containing text.

The text in the document is as follows:

Please excuse the poor writing, as I have a rather difficult script to decipher. The caller indicated that these lights or whatever were almost directly overhead in a southeast direction. He said they were about 30 feet in size, oval shaped and were greenish-white in color. He stated they remained stationary for about 5 minutes, then moved slowly to the southwest and disappeared from view. He said they gave off a bright light and did not blink. There were 3 or 4 objects observed. He seems to be a reliable observer and is somewhat knowledgeable about aviation. I do not recommend any extensive investigation, as I believe this to be a case of misidentification of some known object, possibly an aircraft or satellites. However, should you wish to do some discreet checking, please feel free to contact me.
