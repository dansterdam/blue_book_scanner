The color slide referred to as a UFO could most probably be the normal configuration of one of two conditions reported from time to time. The possibility of this color balance is such that it seems to favor the probability of a glint or reflection. The edge that shows slightly blurred tends to confirm this view. To further exploit this photography it will be necessary to take out 18 the frame and use a macro lens window and try to obtain the original Kodak color balance.

No Change.
