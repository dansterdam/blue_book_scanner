10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One white object, "larger than the morning star", was observed for a 
period of more than an hour to drift slowly from the East to the Southeast.
Part of the time, object was observed by means of binoculars, but 
could not be positively identified as a balloon.
11. COMMENTS
Due to the correlations of conditions, wind, time and proximity,(to weather balloon releas-
ing point) this sighting was resolved as possibly weather balloon with no further investi-
gation.
