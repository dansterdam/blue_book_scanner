Shamokin,
Pa., Mrs. ______ reported seeing two unidentified flying
objects at approximately 2000Z, on on 6 September, the
other on 8 September 1952.

At least twenty miles W.N.W. two objects appeared to be the same
or if in a hovering cluster, are described This is cigar-shaped
with the "base" or "tail" of the "cigar" about as observable
was observed for only a few seconds sometime between 2000 and
2100Z at a point East of her position. It was reported to
have moved in a straight line toward the South and disappeared.

The second object sighted at 1605Z on 9 September was ob-
served for two or three minutes. It also appeared in the East
and moved hurriedly South, but reversed its course after
traveling "four or five miles" and returned the same
path toward the East and then "west up" and disappeared.
Lairman claimed the speed of the object was "very fast", but
her description of the distance it traveled indicates either
that its speed was slower than she thought or that the time of
the observation was shorter than she believed.

The weather at the time of both observations was clear.

These observations were verified by Mrs. _____ and _____
who were originally enlisted in the identification of both
objects.

The technique is, initially to give the QCM the most reliable
operations must be impossible to determine the exact nature
of these objects, but joint interest and astrophysical phenomena
remain strong possibilities.
