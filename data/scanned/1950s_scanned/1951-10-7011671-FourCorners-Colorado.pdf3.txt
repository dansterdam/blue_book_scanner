The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

ON 30 OCTOBER 1951 WHILE IN THE COMPANY OF . . . COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO . . . OBSERVED IN THE VICINITY OF . . . CONCERNING A UFO SIGHTING ON THAT DATE.

AT ABOUT 1230 I FIRST OBSERVED, AND CALLED . . . ATTENTION TO AN OBJECT IN THE SKY TRAVELING IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER. IT WAS MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

IT APPEARED AS A WHITE AND LUMINOUS OBJECT SHAPED LIKE AN ELLIPSE OR METEOR AND WAS SURROUNDED BY A BLUE GLOW. IT DISAPPEARED AS SUDDENLY AS IT APPEARED.

WHAT BOTH REMARKED ON WAS ITS BRILLIANCE AND THE FACT THAT IT SHOWED NO TRAIL OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF ANY CHARACTERISTICS OTHER THAN THOSE OF A PECULIAR ODD SHAPED WHITE LUMINOUS OBJECT.
