The image contains two black and white photographs showing rectangular shapes. The shapes appear to be an unidentified aerial object or phenomenon. Without being able to identify any humans in the image, I can only describe the visual elements shown - the rectangular shapes and the surrounding dark background.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT #14
PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF SELECTED UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS

1. GENERAL INFORMATION

A. Incident Location: Beverly, Massachusetts
B. Date-Time Group: 0850 hours, 8 July 1952
C. Reporting Officer: Major John F. Healey, AF 1251325

2. PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS 

The attached photographs are designated A and Aa. These photographs were taken by [redacted] at 0850 hours on 8 July 1952 in Beverly, Massachusetts.

The photographic prints received show two separate exposures of an unidentified aerial object. Both exposures show a fuzzy, ill-defined rectangular object against a dark background which appears to be the sky. The size, shape, and other details of the object are not clearly defined. There is no other identifiable detail in either photograph.

3. CONCLUSIONS

Based on the information available, no definitive conclusions can be drawn about the identity or nature of the object(s) shown in the photographs. The photographs do not provide sufficient detail to determine the size, distance, altitude, or other characteristics of the observed object(s). Further investigation would be required to establish the origin and identity of the photographed phenomena.
