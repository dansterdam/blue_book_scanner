III. INFORMATION:
1. SOURCE described a peculiar experience in his home when, on a previous occasion object apparently appeared in the southwest at approximately 13/02/52 through a window.

2. The palm of the hand of the object could be compared to a searchlight and its brilliance was of such intensity that it would be hard to estimate as the bald object appeared to be traveling at 9,000 m.p.h.
3. SOURCE described objects as being solid with an appearance similar to that of a model airplane fuselage - SOURCE further stated that unless this country or some other country is far advanced in aircraft design, he believes it would be difficult to fabricate such an object.
4. SOURCE described the sky as being dark with a few scattered stars and the sound of a whining sounding varying in pitch as not distinctive - the object did not seem to be larger than a man's hand when viewed from SOURCE's position, was not in motion and there was no smoke or vapor trail discernible.
