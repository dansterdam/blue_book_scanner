The image does not contain any photographs, but rather two drawings or diagrams. The first diagram shows the "SEA LEVEL" with a scale from 500 feet to 2500 feet. The second diagram shows a "5000 FOOT ELEVATION" landscape.

LOSS OF AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE DURING HOT WEATHER
Do you realize that Kansas City Airport with an elevation of 744 feet above sea level can have an effective elevation of 5,500 feet under certain conditions?
Do you realize that Adams Airport at 3,575 feet above sea level, can be above the normal operating altitude of your aircraft during hot, hazy, and humid weather?
The rarified air at high altitude results in a reduction of engine power, and becomes a factor, not only in performance, but in the safety of your flights. A typical light plane that will cruise at 130 mph at sea level may only be able to make 90 mph at 10,000 feet. This plane might be able to clear a 2,000 foot obstacle at sea level, but it certainly will not clear a 4,000 foot obstacle at 10,000 feet. Remember: Any decrease in engine performance (due to high temperature) greatly increases the takeoff and landing distance required.
