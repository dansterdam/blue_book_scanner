DIVISION: Directorate of Operations, Office of Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations 

ABSTRACT: A sighting of an object near Wake Island on 10 February 1958 occurred at 2300Z. The object was observed visually and on radar and was described as revolving at high speed and emitting a bright, blinking light. The object was tracked for over 30 minutes and was estimated to be at an altitude of 40,000-50,000 feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 600-800 knots. After the preliminary analysis, other sightings which occurred before and after this incident are described in detail. The report includes a technical analysis of the radar and visual sightings, as well as a discussion of the possibility of this being a known object or phenomenon. The report concludes that the sighting remains unexplained and that the object observed does not fit the characteristics of any known aircraft or phenomena.
