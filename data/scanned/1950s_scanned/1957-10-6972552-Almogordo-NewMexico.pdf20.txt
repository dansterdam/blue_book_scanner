1. Attached as Inclosure 1 is an envelope containing a 35 mm slide and 1/2 sheet of paper concerning the analysis of this slide. Inclosure 3 is an 8 x 10 black and white enlargement of the color slide.
2. We at Holloman do not consider this to be a UFO but rather a cloud that was lighted by the sun in an unusual fashion. Personal contact with the witnesses indicated that they were unusually biased about UFO's and could not accept the scientific evaluation of their cloud.
3. After your review and analysis please forward this correspondence to ASTIA.
FOR THE COMMANDER:
DWIGHT N. HILLIS
Major, USAF
UFO Officer
