Out was facing North. The object arched downwards and seemed to proceed jerkily to a point where I thought it was a comet but as it got closer I could see it was a light - an indefinite shape but not cigar or saucer shape, just an irregular light that increased and diminished like a pulsation. At first I thought it might be a plane but the light wasn't steady and it wasn't going straight. It seemed like a bright object in the air, unusually bright and unusual in movement.
33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Not reported until now.
