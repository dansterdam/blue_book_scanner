The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text found in the document:

At 2130 hours I went out to observation for a while. was sitllng down, looking up at the stars. They all appeared to be in their normal positions. A bright light appeared in a southeast portion of the sky. It appeared to be a small, round object and seemed to be moving slowly. I watched it for several minutes and it seemed to be drifting in a southerly direction. As it disappeared I could still trace the object by the light, as it did not appear to be as bright as the stars. It disappeared below my line of vision. I could not determine the size or speed of the object and it did not appear to be flashing or have any other distinguishing characteristics.
