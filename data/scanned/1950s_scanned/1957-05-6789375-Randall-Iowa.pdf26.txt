No Case (Information Only)                                                (CSI)
                                           21 April 1957
                                           Flanders, L. I., N.Y.

April 21, 1957. On Easter night 23 blue-green oval objects were seen by a number of
residents of Flanders, Long Island (at the eastern end of Suffolk County.) They
glided silently over at half-minute intervals (for similarities, see the Nov. 16 report from New Rochelle) and one witness, Michael Pace of 869 Flanders Road, estimated their altitude at 1000 feet and their speed at 200 to 300 mph. Lt.Col. Frederick Pileoty, executive officer at the Suffolk County Air Force Base, said the Air Force is investigating. "I have no idea what these objects could be," he said. "We had nothing but routine patrols in the air." -- Long Island Daily Press, April 22, 1957.
