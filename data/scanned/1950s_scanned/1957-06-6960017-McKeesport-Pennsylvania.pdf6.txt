11. Captain Paul E. Niedermohr, Assistant Base Operations Officer: I received the report of this sighting at 1530 EST on 27 June 1957, and proceeded to contact the various other departments. I interviewed Mrs. ----- on 25 June 1957 and received the attached statement. I also interviewed Mrs. ----- who had been sent to me by Mrs. ------. She believed that there was a natural explanation for the sighting. She did not wish to make a formal statement or to be involved in anyway. She did concur with the statement made by Mrs.------. Mrs. ------ impressed me as being a reliable observer although her interpretations of her observations might be open to doubt. She related her sighting to flying saucers she had seen in a science-fiction movie and said they were exactly alike.

           I then contacted the Ground Observer Corps but there was no record of a sighting by any of their members. Contact with Air Traffic Control revealed that the Greater Pittsburgh Control Tower had a report of Unidentified Flying Objects in the McKeesport area at about 2000 EST. Mr. ------, Airways Operations Supervisor, who was in the control tower at the time stated that the only unusual blip on his radar scope turned out to be an inbound B-47. He believed that this might have been the cause of some of the confusion. Upon contacting Silverstone, I received the report that they had investigated the report of the Greater Pittsburgh control tower and had vectored Vanguard Target and Vanguard II to the scene. The pilots of these aircraft reported that the lights from the steel mills in McKeesport area could have been responsible for the reports. S/Sgt Jerry Holshyne stated that he had worked the radar scope that night and had been unable to find anything unusual that night account for the reports. Contact with the Weather Bureau revealed that no weather balloons had been realised in the area at the times in question. This was reported by Mr. Robert Fulton, Observer at Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Weather Bureau.
