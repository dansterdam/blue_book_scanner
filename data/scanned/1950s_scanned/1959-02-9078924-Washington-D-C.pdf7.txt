Dear Sir,

Enclosed is a photograph which I took while on a visit to the U.S. in early February. 
It was taken at about 9 P.M. on 4/12/59. At the time I took the picture that was no light visible (Capt. of Pentagon) as I thought it may be. I cannot furnish you with anything I saw, as I have been instructed not to mention the details of this photograph.
Nearly sixteen months elapsed from the time of the taking of the original copy prints. I did not notice the enlargements before I would have sent a copy of the photograph.
Yours sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
