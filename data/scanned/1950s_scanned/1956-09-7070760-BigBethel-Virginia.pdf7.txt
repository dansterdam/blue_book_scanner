1. On Sunday night, 9 September 1956, at 2035 (EST) an object was observed in the sky near Langley Air Force Base, Hampton, Va. The object appeared to be round or cigar-shaped and was said to have a bright light emanating from its upper part. Observations and tracking of the object continued until 2055 at which time it disappeared.

2. When the object was first seen, it was red in color and seemed to be about the size of a small star. As it was watched, its color gradually changed from red to orange and finally to white. The size of the object also appeared to increase to about twice its original size, and then to decrease again until it disappeared from view.

3. The object appeared to move in an east-west direction, or toward the observer, and then to the northeast. It moved at various speeds, at one time slowing down to a near stationary position, and at another time accelerating to a very high rate of speed. The nearest distance at which it was observed was two (2) miles.

4. The object appeared to the observers to be transparent or translucent, and had a definite shape, described as being circular or elliptical. Observers reported that the light or glow within the object appeared to fluctuate in intensity and that there seemed to be a dark or shadowy area in the center of the object.

5. The path of flight was of gradual deceleration from the height of one mile distant, at which point it disappeared, heading in a generally westerly direction.
