Rantoul, Illinois
12 July 1952

At 2100 hours I was on duty as officer of operations for a week and 
sitting down, looking up at the stars, when all of a sudden a bright light appeared in a southeastern position of the sky. It appeared to go in a westerly direction at a great speed. I can't say if it disappeared or the light went out. I came into operations and informed the A.C. of the incident, and also checked with the tower and they had not seen it. In my opinion I can't say what it might have been except a comet because the tail it had behind the object, and also the color of it, which was sort of orange around the outer surface and white in the center.
