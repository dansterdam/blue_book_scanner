166TH FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON
143D FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR GROUP
LOCKBOURNE AIR FORCE BASE
COLUMBUS 17, OHIO

27 December 1951

STATEMENT ON SIGHTING
OF
UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT 

At approximately 1630 hours on 22 December 1951 I was flying locally at 15,000 feet. I observed an object which appeared to be an aircraft without a tail, travelling or rolling. Position of the object was about five (5) miles west of Columbus, Ohio heading east at an altitude of at least 20,000 feet. I was piloting an F-84C type aircraft in the opposite direction.

Chances of seeing the object were good as the day was clear and the sun was shining on the object. The three pilots stated that they were not in that area and at that altitude. The object was about three (3) miles east of my position and was rolling or tumbling at a high rate of roll.  I observed ten or more rolls in a period of one (1) minute when I lost it.

When I first sighted it it started a turn in an attempt to intercept the object but as I started to turn, the object was lost in the sun. Further search failed to bring the object in sight.

The speed appeared to be about that of a jet fighter. It did not gain or lose altitude. When last seen it was heading in an east-south easterly direction.
