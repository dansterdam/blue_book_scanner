The flight took off at 2 p.m. At 3:43 they were expected to call in, but the message received at that time was anything but a routine one: "This is an emergency, it is said in part, and even with radio distortion there was something quite unusual in the flight". We can't be sure where we are... We don't know which way we went, the captain explained. We cannot be sure of our position... We can't be sure where we are... We don't know... We cannot be sure of our position... Where are we?... We don't know".

The ocean doesn't look as it should... The sun was traveling in the western horizon, and it was incredible... only a visual observation. For the next forty-five minutes Apparently none of the five had any idea of their position. The over-head conversations showed increasing desperation, which way are we going, where are we?... It seems we are lost... Things that no other plane has ever encountered... This in itself was a most unusual set, and showed a desperately grave emergency of the flight. It said: "We are not certain where we are... Must be about 225 miles northeast of where we were". The message broke off at that point.

Immediately thereafter, a Martin flying boat with full rescue equipment and a crew of five arrived on the scene. Neither this plane nor the original five Avenger bombers were ever heard from again, nor was any distress signal ever received from them. The message received the day of the flight, by mid-afternoon of the next day, many ships and over 300 planes had joined the desperate hunt for rescue, or dooms. The Navy's information of the incident, in which a total of 27 lives were lost, unable to come up with any explanation of what happened...".
