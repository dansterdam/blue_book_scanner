Major General James H. Walsh 
Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear General Walsh,

I promised to send you the report on the sightings in Long Island Sound which occurred during your last and very welcome visit to this Center. The delay in doing this is due to the fact that your visit mentioned "Buffalo", which might have been inferred the latter and that I thought I remembered hearing "Buffalo". In this connection, I must bring information that can find no sighting in mind and which did involve the United States Navy and "Martha's Vineyard".

This Center received three separate reports of the incident with a "Blimp Evaluation" request from the Office of Naval Intelligence the first in three years.

A careful study, based on the data available (some which was inconsistently collated), indicates that the objects sighted were in the area of a radar reflector of the "corner type". A detailed evaluation with supporting material was sent to the Navy on 16 January 1958.
