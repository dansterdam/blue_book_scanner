UNCLASSIFIED

Goose AFB, Labrador
15 December 1952

I. Description of Incident

Visual contact was made by two aircraft, a T-33 and an F-94, of an unidentified aerial object after being vectored to the target by GCA. The object had no definite shape, was bright red and white and was seen from 2315Z to 2310Z. Airborne visual contact was established as the F-94 entered the intercept area. No engine or jet exhaust was visible. The F-94 chased the object at an indicated airspeed of 375 knots but could not overtake it.

Weather was clear with visibility of 30 miles, winds at 10,000 ft. (altitude of the observing aircraft) was from 270° at 25 knots. The F-94 was on a heading of 270° while on its intercept run.

II. Discussion of Incident

Two C-54's from Goose AFB were in the area at the approximate time of sight-. One of these aircraft was observed by the F-94, the others was not. However, the unidentified object could not be the unobserved C-54 due to the speed factor. The F-94, at 375 knots, could have overtaken a C-54. There may have been a balloon launch at 2100Z from Goose AFB at Weather Service but here again there is a conflict because the object was sighted at 2315Z, two hours after launch. An astronomical explanation does not ring true since it is improbable that stars and meteors can be recorded by ground radar or airborne radar. Therefore, a plausible explanation for this sighting seems to be impossible.

III. Conclusion

Unknown.
