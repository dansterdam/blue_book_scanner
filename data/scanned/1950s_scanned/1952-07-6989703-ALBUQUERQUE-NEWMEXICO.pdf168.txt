The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document describing some kind of unexplained aerial phenomenon.

Clean circle revealed. There are several round markings or spots on the page, which the text describes as "clean circles revealed". 

As soon as I saw it I knew it was something out of the ordinary. It was a strange sight, somewhat difficult to describe accurately. The image was of a craft or object in the sky, apparently emitting a light or luminescence. The sight was only momentary, though, and faded quickly. It was not possible to evaluate its size, distance, or exact nature in the brief time it was visible.

The sighting has puzzled me, and I am unable to arrive at a satisfactory explanation for what I witnessed. The thing that impressed me most was the suddenness and brevity of the event. This suggests to me that it was not a normal aircraft, and I am at a loss to account for its appearance and disappearance. I hope further study and investigation of similar sightings may eventually lead to an understanding of this phenomenon.
