The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a report dated 8 July 1958 regarding an "Unidentified Object" sighting.

The text in the document states:

8 July 1958. subj.: (U) Unidentified Object Photograph, SPECIAL FILE COPY
1. Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio - The Inspector General, USAF, The Director of Special Investigations, Headquarter, USAF, and Commanding General, Air Force Base, Ohio
2. This review of subject photographs and attendant report has been made by this Center.
3. A review by a scientist and a professional astronomer who spent many years with the Harvard Observatory astronomers states: "This negative has examined over 25,000 photographic plates and has noted many such spots."
4. Our investigators disclose that from official observatories side glass saucers which were observed did not exceed on that specific size (22.00 - 24.00) as alleged by source. No reports were received of the moon.
5. The fact that sources, by his own admission, states that this was the first time he attempted astrophotography that he is unemployed, and that he saw fit to submit this photograph to LD magazine (apparently only after his confidence had been sufficiently aroused) provides a clue to the real motive behind the matter.
6. INSTRUCTIONS: Insofar as the original 3-1/4 by 4-1/4 photographs and related material be returned to the owner, it is therefore recommended that they be enlarged as in the original 8 by 10 suggestive of the enlargements to be therefore for return to the owner.
