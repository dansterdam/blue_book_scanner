As seen - This object was sighted from the ground at Brunswick, Ga. It was a light-color grayish or light yellow in color traveling at a high speed of 7,000 to 10,000 mph, and it was about the size of an ordinary 5 seated car as it went by. To me, it did not seem to make any noise. It just went by at a tremendous rate of speed.
