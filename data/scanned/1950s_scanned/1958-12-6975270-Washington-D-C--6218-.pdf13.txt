UNKNOWN AERIAL OBJECTS OBSERVED OVER WASHINGTON, D. C. AREA
6 DECEMBER 1958

On 6 December 1958, a number of unidentified flying objects were observed over the Washington, D. C. area. The sightings were made by several reliable witnesses, including a number of Air Force personnel. The objects were tracked on radar and observed visually.

The radar returns showed that the objects were able to perform maneuvers that indicated they were under intelligent control. The objects were observed to accelerate rapidly, make sharp turns, and hover in a manner that could not be easily explained by conventional aircraft. 

Several of the witnesses described the objects as circular in shape and emitting a bright glow. The objects were estimated to be between 20-30 feet in diameter.

This incident was thoroughly investigated by Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for the study of unidentified flying objects. The case remains classified as "unresolved" due to the lack of a conclusive explanation for the observed phenomena.
