On Friday night the 24th of 
Oct. there was similar performance in Stayton & Mill City, Oregon
Police Chiefs at Stayton 
Mill City See 'Sky Light'

Stayton Police Chief, Everette Norflett, Sgt. Ronald Prey and another Stayton officer were watching the sky while on a routine patrol at 7:30 PM while they were on a routine police patrol. 

It looked like a bright star moving across the sky. Norflett said, "It watched for flying saucers ever since they were mentioned and I never saw anything like this before."

The object was reported to have been a light "star" color gradually changing to a reddish color and emerging like a searchlight. It was watched for some time hovering over Mill City.

At the same time, Mill City Chief of Police, Clarence Meader, reported seeing an object moving East from where he was watching. Both of Mill City.

I am not saying what it was, Meader said, reporting that it was a clear bright blue point of light. The object was seen later in the evening from a point west of Mill City. This time it was moving West, Meader said.

Although there were jet planes reported in the area Friday night, both men said they were familiar with jets, and that the object was something else.
