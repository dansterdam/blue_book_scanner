some times over which the objects were observed. there were no
distinguishing landmarks with which to determine relative distance
of the objects observed. Mr. [REDACTED] could not estimate the speed
of the objects, but was "very much impressed" by their rapidity of
movement. lights were noticed to vary in size. they appeared
larger than the average normal lights seen in the sky. the lights
identified as "c-r2" attached appeared momentarily after its appearance and seemed to the
witness to travel in an irregular manner. the "c-r2" then disappeared and finally disappeared together with r-r. there was no
feeling or apparent movement away from mr. [REDACTED] at the time the
lights disappeared. the manner of disappearance was the same sensation one experiences when an electric light is switched off.
just before the lights disappeared, mr. [REDACTED] strained to hear any
noise resembling the "put put" of an outboard motor, but col [REDACTED]
could not hear the noise himself.
