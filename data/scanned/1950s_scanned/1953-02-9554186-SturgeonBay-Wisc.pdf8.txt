The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a series of questions and answer fields.

Where were you located when you saw the object?
Inside a building

What were you doing at the time you saw the object, and how did you happen to notice it? 
I was walking from the business into the building when I happened to look up and saw the object. It appeared to be hovering motionless in the sky, which caught my attention.

The rest of the text on the document appears to be a questionnaire with various multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions related to the sighting, such as the observer's location, the object's movement, and estimates of the object's angular size and elevation.
