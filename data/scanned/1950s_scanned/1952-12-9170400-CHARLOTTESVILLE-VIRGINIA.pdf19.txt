Charlottesville, Virginia

The Air Force has been advised by a number of Virginia that on 15 November 1952, you and two other people observed an unusual type of aircraft over Charlottesville, Virginia. Based on this information, and a subsequent message which was dated 18 November 1952, it is concluded that the object observed was not necessarily an explainable observation, and therefore it is requested that the enclosed data sheet be completed and returned.

The names of the other observers were not given in the wire, consequently, I will be very much interested in having you submit the names and addresses of the other observers, if any, so that the necessary follow-up can be made.

Any information you desire to give to the Air Force will be held in strict confidence.

Yours very truly,

1. Lt. A.T. Toeh 1-0 Jerome (2)
