IV. NARRATIVE OF OBSERVATION BY SGT FARRIS.

1. Personal Data.
a. Name: FARRIS, Nancy G.
b. Rank: Sgt.
c. Serial Number: RA 17248038
d. Occupation: Security Policeman, 7725th Missile Battalion, Derwood, Md.

On 29 Sep 58, at approx 0330 hrs, Sgt Farris was on duty as a security policeman on the evening shift at the 7725th Missile Battalion, Derwood, Md. After standing at the orderly room check, he stepped outside the building at 0345 hrs, and while facing northwest, heard a strange noise. Upon looking up, he saw an oval-shaped object directly overhead, which appeared to be giving off a very bright light. 

After the object had started to move in a northeasterly direction, Sgt Farris attempted to notify his supervisor, but was unable to make contact due to the light being turned off on the field telephone.  The smaller pieces seemed to give off light as soon as they were able to break away from the main object. As the smaller pieces disappeared, the main object remained stationary for a few minutes, then moved off rapidly toward the northeast. 

The sky was clear at the time of sighting. It was still dark on the ground, but becoming daylight. The object had a distinct pulsating light which appeared to be some distance away. Sgt Farris was excited and anxious trying to observe the object. After it had passed, he estimated the object to be at an altitude of approximately 2000 to 3000 feet. Sgt Farris concluded that the object must have struck the ground, as the pulsating light he saw appeared to have disappeared.
