NO CASE INFORMATION GIVEN: "Kennard World El.—Lying Saucers"
SUMMARY: 1950 Denver, Colorado
A saucer incident that might have become a classic occurred in Denver at 10 A.M. on a summer's day in 1950. A man was sitting on the shady porch of his house, reading, when he glanced up from his book and saw a formation of perhaps a dozen spherical objects, shining iridescently, traveling toward the distant mountains. As he watched, these in the front of the procession seemed to vanish and then reappear, as if they were traveling at fantastic speed, covering the thirty or so miles to the mountains in a matter of five or six seconds. Too stunned to take action, he was still numb from shock when he heard a faint "Hello," and looked up—to realize that the little girl across the street was blowing soap bubbles. If the man had rushed up when he first saw the objects and had rushed into the house to telephone the nearest saucer club, he might never have found out that the "spaceship" were only bubbles [sic].
