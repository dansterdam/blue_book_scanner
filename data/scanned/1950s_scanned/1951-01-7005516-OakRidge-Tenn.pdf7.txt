ROUTING AND REPORTING
TO     MCIAXX-la
FROM    MCIAXX
DATE 16 FEB 1951 COMMENT NO. 1

1. It is suggested that substantially the following to be used in replying to the attached letter, since as the report on the radar detections is concerned:

1. It is considered highly probable that the radar target detected three times by the airborne radar set on 21 January was a ground target and was identified. 

2. The peculiar phenomena of having the target first appear at an altitude show the target being picked up, and then losing it due to abnormal refraction of the radar electromagnetic waves. The atmospheric radar conditions discussed in paragraph 3 below are considered to be the cause of this effect as the target disappeared from the airborne radar set.

3. A check with the local UP base weather office indicates that the Knoxville weather station reported the following temperature data for 21 January 1951:

Altitude
0 to 2000 ft
2000 to 8000 ft 
8000 to 9000 ft
9000 to 11000 ft
Above 11000 ft

Temperature Conditions
No change
Six degree increase
Normal increase in temp/increased altitude
Three degree increase
Abnormal increase in temp/increased altitude

The normal atmospheric temperature conditions is that temperature decreases with increase in altitude. But on that day it appears that two inversion layers existed, one above the interceptor and one below, due to the abnormal atmospheric conditions. The complete and accurate effects of temperature inversion are not thoroughly known but it is considered that this detection of a ground target to appear to be airborne, first above and then below the interceptor.
