The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a handwritten document. I will proceed with acting as an OCR system and producing the text found in the document.

The text in the document is as follows:

"They called it Unidentified. It was about the size of a basketball and looked like a bright light. The witness who called me reported that the object as it passed through the sky, suddenly increased in speed, and then levelled off at a high altitude. The witness felt that the object was under intelligent control and that it appeared to be descending. However, at a certain point, it suddenly increased in speed and left the area at a tremendous speed, climbing out of sight. The witness reported that the object was sighted for about 10 minutes and was observed through 10x50 binoculars. The witness indicated that the object moved through the sky in a straight line with no sounds and no visible means of propulsion. The witness was able to describe the object in detail and said it was definitely not a meteorite, an aircraft, or any known object. The witness has had considerable experience observing this type of phenomena and feels that the object was definitely some kind of unidentified flying object. More information on something like this would be appreciated.

As you realize and have said, many of these cases are very difficult to explain and we must be open minded about the possibility that they represent something new and unexplained. Serious consideration should be given to this case and any further information or investigation that it may warrant."
