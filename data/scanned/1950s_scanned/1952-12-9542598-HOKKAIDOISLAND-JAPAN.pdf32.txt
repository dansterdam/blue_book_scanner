STATEMENT

On 23 December 1952, while serving at KC at Chitose Air Force Base, I was briefed on the contents of this report. Prior to going to the Ground Observer Corps Cadre meeting, I was informed that unusual sightings had been reported in the Chitose area on the previous night, 22 December 1952. It was reported that several objects had been tracked on radar and visually observed by Tower personnel. The objects were described as light in color, spherical in shape, and traveling at a very high rate of speed. According to the report, the objects were described as emitting a pulsating light and changing colors from white to orange. Crews of night flying aircraft reported seeing these objects and were able to confirm the tower's observation. The objects were tracked on radar for approximately 30 minutes and simultaneously observed visually. They appeared to travel both laterally and vertically at speeds estimated between 1500 and 2000 mph. A search was made for the objects but none were found. The objects did not appear to travel either horizontally or vertically. It could not be determined if the objects were solid, reflected, or emitted their own light. The subject is still under investigation.

Time: 1930 to 2000; 22 December 1952.
