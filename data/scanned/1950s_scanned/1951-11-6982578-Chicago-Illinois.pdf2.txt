The image appears to be a photograph of a nighttime urban landscape. The image is mostly dark, with a bright light or object visible in the sky. The buildings and city lights can be seen in the background. This seems to be the only photograph present in the document.

SIGHTING OF A STRANGE AERIAL OBJECT
OVER CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
ON 6 NOVEMBER 1951

At approximately 2200 hours on 6 November 1951, several witnesses observed a strange aerial object in the sky over Chicago, Illinois.

The object was described as a bright light, much brighter than the surrounding stars, hovering in the sky. It was observed for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

Numerous reports of this sighting were received by the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was responsible for investigating unidentified flying object (UFO) reports. Unfortunately, the exact details of the investigation and the ultimate conclusion regarding this sighting are not included in the available documentation.

This report is part of the historical records of Project Blue Book, which was the United States Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects from 1947 to 1969.
