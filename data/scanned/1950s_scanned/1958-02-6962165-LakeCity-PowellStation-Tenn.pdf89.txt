The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with text describing the original intent of the collection of short reports, the current status of the collection, and details about the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory program that launched satellites in 1958.

The text reads as follows:

Preface

The original intent of this collection of short reports was the presentation of preliminary data to the U.S. International Geophysical Year Committee for the Optional Satellite Geophysical Observing Program of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. The first artificial earth satellite launched by the United States on January 31, 1958.

At the present time, however, three more objects have been successfully launched into satellite orbits from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The collection has therefore been expanded to include information and results of data analyzed on these new objects, in addition to the original satellite data, as well as projections of the principal machine computations in use.

Since we are endeavoring to make these satellite data available as rapidly as possible to all interested participants in the International Geophysical Year, we have of necessity included information of an extremely preliminary nature.
