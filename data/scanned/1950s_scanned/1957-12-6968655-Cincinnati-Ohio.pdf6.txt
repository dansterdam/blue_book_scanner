"The car arrangement - apparatus looked like a 'pilot light' in its beam, i.e. two car-size apparati side by side, with a dome or knob on the top of each. The 'dome' was glowing with a pale blue-white light, not very bright. The ground below and around the 'craft' was lit up, the light being reflected off the ground, like a 'pilot light'. 

Size - 250 ft. to 300 ft. diameter, 100 ft. height. Moved in and back of my eye sight - it was a cloudy night, and I could not observe it too long or steadily. 

And I looked out both windows on each side. It stayed in view for only a short time - maybe a half minute. As it moved away, it seemed to settle down lower to the ground, remaining in view as it went on out in the distance and behind some trees.

I raced my car to get a better look, but lost sight of it. I did get a good look at it, however, and I am sure the details I have given are as accurate as I could determine at the time from my observations.
