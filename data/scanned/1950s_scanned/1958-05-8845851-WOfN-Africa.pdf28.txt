2:30 in the afternoon. We started hunting, and I happened to look up and saw on top of this mountain a strange object. It looked to be about 40 feet long, more or less in the shape of a hot dog bun. It had ports around each side—I'd say half a dozen on each side. And there was fire coming out of these portioles. It would swing kinda like a pendulum, trying to get in under the timber. At times you could see both sides of it. BARKER: Did it appear to be stable, shaped? HANK MOLLOHAN: That's right, similar to a cigar. BARKER: Most people, when they see this particular type (and as they see them have been close), they usually call them "flying saucers." What do you think would you tell them about how you saw it move about? H.G. MOLLOHAN: When my son called me—there was a whole army of them, I'd say five or six hundred feet in the air.
