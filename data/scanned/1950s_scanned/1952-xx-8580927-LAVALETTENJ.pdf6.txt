There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the image is as follows:

NOTE: When the objects were first seen, they resembled night-time weather-balloons (or spherical-like carrier balloons). However, their reddish color and circular course were not at all like such a balloon. Their motion gave the definite impression of directed control, but the complete silence of the objects and their apparent rapid climbing to very high altitudes did not resemble (to the observers) any known plane or dirigibles.
