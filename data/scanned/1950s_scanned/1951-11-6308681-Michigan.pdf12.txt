the altitude (i.e., apparent low), it is apparent that the object must have been a comparatively great distance from all the observers. The fact that the observers were able to observe certain details over considerable distances indicates that the object must have been plainly visible to them during the observation.

The related flight path of the object was probably 3,000 to 4,000 miles per hour over the Windsor-Detroit area, Canada. It would probably be possible to determine the exact location if a collection of the reports over a period of several minutes could be obtained.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

It is concluded that the object observed in certain Michigan on 24 November 1951 was a large, meteor-like object but probably meteor or a satellite.
