Interview with Harold Moore, Jr.

On 19 October 1959, [redacted] was observed an unidentified flying object while driving in U.S.S. on 25 May 1950, and offered to furnish photographs of unidentified flying object at that time.

The object was in the company of [redacted] at the time of sighting, located 350 yards in their attention to it. The object appeared silvery in color with a black dome in the center. It was in silence and made no sound of firing by jet or rocket. The object surrounded by a luminous glow which made it appear larger than it actually was. It hovered over the grass around the object, and although it was about dusk, the surroundings of the object were clearly visible. The object was observed for about a minute and then gradually climbed vertically upwards at a terrific speed. There was no contraction or diminution in size during its ascent, and it disappeared from sight.

[Redacted] seemed that [redacted] was attempting to coordinate the details given by [redacted] and which identified to these eyewitnesses by an officer superior. He stated that the passage of the object was witnessed by several people, but it is doubtful that any other photographs were obtained. It was described as to those objects, in 1 instance as a "solid disc-shaped object" and in another instance as "a single light as large as a star". Its size was estimated at 150 yards. This explanation seems quite reasonable. Most of the objects described in this manner have turned out to be conventional phenomena. It is necessary to evaluate the incident as being completely fabricated or the witnesses merely imagined or exaggerated what they saw. This material appears to be necessary for them to prepare a pat story and then appear more impressive.
