SUBJECT: (U) UFO PROGRAM
TO: Commander
USAFE, Hq, General Howe 
Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

1. In accordance with the provisions of AFR 200-2 dated 5 February 1958, Subjects Unidentified Flying Objects, this Center is charged with scientifically and technically analyzing and evaluating all reports of UFO's. Additionally we are allowed to make such primary and supplementary field investigations as are necessary to establish the facts from which an adequate analysis and evaluation can be made.

2. Certain shortcomings in investigative endeavors during the past year have made it necessary to establish a group of some 18-20 specially trained and equipped investigators from personnel resources presently available to ATIC. These people will be held in ready reserve and moved into the field on fairly short notice to assist in, or conduct, investigation of those sightings of particular public or scientific interest.

3. Due to the difficulty in rapidly reaching certain USAF facilities by commercial means, and stringent limitations which have been imposed on TDY travel funds this year, I find it necessary to seek out those other possible means of transport which would offer some possibility in support of the UFO investigative program.
