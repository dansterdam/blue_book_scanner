While a blob-shaped spot appears on a photograph, this image was not yet fully developed. The spot was observed until after the photograph was taken, when this blob became visible. Source discerned that the big double vent window of the law building is in the exact center of the blob. When the window is looked at closely, it reflects the sun at the exact spot where the unexplained spot was standing when he took the picture.
