The shared image does not appear to contain a photograph. It seems to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document that describes various observations and theories about unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Extracted text from the document:

The second observation that the UFOs were material objects. Nearly every one of the descriptions is in direct conflict with this idea. The material of construction, for example, if performed by solid objects, should have produced a shock wave that would have blown vegetation to Norfolk. Newport News, and points west. Only one observation even suggests that the unknown had a material surface, which would indicate a solid body. The witnesses, specically qualified this statement, however, by adding that though the object appeared to be a solid body, it did not become clearly visible. Thus the three-dimensional structure was not actually observed, but only inferred. The night was dark, the UFOs were glowing like hot coals, and were apparently some strange light. Even if the disks had been solid objects, an observer could actually have seen only a circular-shaped light that gradually narrowed to a very thin ellipse; if he believed the object to be solid, he might infer the presence of other surfaces. But a silhouette is hard to ect thick and an unrifled bottom surface, even if they had been present, would not have been detectable.
Of the other observations, all are inconsistent with the theory that the UFOs were material in nature. All, however, are completely consistent with the theory that the disks were immaterial images made of light.
