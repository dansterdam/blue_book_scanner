Dear Sir:

On Mon. morning, Sept. 29th at approx 5:45 A.M., as I was walking toward my barn I saw a large blue light in the sky moving at a high rate of speed from east to west.

It appeared to be a mile or so distant and possibly 500 ft. high.  As I watched it seemed to divide again with two lights leading, the other two following. They did not change direction, but continued on their course at the same speed. It remained visible for several minutes. There was no vapor trail and no sound.

The whole sighting did not last over four seconds.

That same afternoon I read the enclosed piece in the Erie paper.

As I told the incident to some of the fellows at the shop where I work and one of them (an old-time police officer) advised me to write to you people. This account.  I am white, male, 58 years old - I work at a small shop as a tool maker.

If you should wish to contact me I am usually home evenings. No one has ever mentioned this to me before.

Sincerely yours,
(Signature)
