24 June 1953

Description
On 24 June 1953 one unidentified flying object was sighted by two Eastern Airlines flights and one American Airlines flight approaching New London, Connecticut. The object appeared to burst into flames as it broke into two pieces, soon afterwards extinguishing itself and dropping into the ocean.

Discussion
This incident was solved very easily. Supplementary information received by Project Blue Book on 26 June 1953 stated "Objects sighted by pilots at approximately 2130E 24 June 1953. Two jet aircraft out of Groton Point, R.I. had a mid-air collision at 2130E 24 June 1953. Aircraft fell in flames 15 miles west of Groton Point." After interrogation of pilots, it was concluded that the flight did observe the above.

Conclusion
Was aircraft.
