11. Reporting Officer's Comments:
Investigation reveals that whatever approach contact involved, contact was not with friendly aircraft, as there is no record of any friendlies in the area at the time. (No explanation is available for the 8,000 feet target reported approaching these objects.
(Fighter Air Division) "HARDWOOD" then contacted Fighter
23 contact, was flying in the opposite direction, how
ard and level, was flying at the same speed and level, but indicated they did not see the target, according to their radar. It is, therefore, to appear, approximately two miles apart, on any radar scope, it is considered possible that the target that subject had observed could have been avoided from the immediate radar contacts.
MINOR separation of the targets as experianced in a similar observation 20 October 1950 which was not reported at that time. The targets which approached each other to check time approached and departed on headings of 270" and 090 degrees, indicating a direct pass from opposite directions. This occurred in less than a minute, and they then returned to separate into 2 separate targets very close together, with no deviation from the formation.
