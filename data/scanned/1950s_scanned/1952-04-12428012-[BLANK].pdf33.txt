I'm safe in saying that I understand informally that the project
has been completed, that a report will be published soon, and that
it will probably in inconclusive. I may well be wrong, but I'm
afraid the green fireball phenomena is going to remain, for the
time being at least, a mystery.

Now to get back to our analysis methods, as another example
of how we attack the problem I'd like to show you another chart.

SLIDE NO. 13

This slide shows the frequency of sightings from 1947 through
1951. You will see that there is some regularity in the peaks. The
large peak in 1947 followed the first sightings, by Mr. Arnold,
mentioned before.

So far, we are unable to explain an apparent seasonal increase
in sightings, which you will see occurs in the spring, in the
middle summer, and along about December of each year.
