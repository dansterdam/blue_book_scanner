9 October 1951

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Your letter of October 14th concerning your theory of "satellite-controlled individuals" was referred to this Division by Headquarters, United States Air Force. Your theory was carefully considered, but I am sorry to say that it does not appear to warrant further investigation or substantive discussion.

Your theory is too generally stated, lacking many specifics needed to evaluate it. Past experiences have shown that generalizations in cases of this kind usually lead nowhere. There have been many similar theories advanced from time to time, but none have been substantiated.

While I cannot agree with your theory, I want to express my appreciation for your interest in this subject. Persons showing this kind of interest are always welcome, as the Air Force is anxious to learn all it can about any strange aerial phenomena. However, your theory as presented does not appear to have sufficient basis to justify a detailed investigation.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM M. COLEMAN, JR.
Deputy Chief
Intelligence Division
Directorate of Operations
