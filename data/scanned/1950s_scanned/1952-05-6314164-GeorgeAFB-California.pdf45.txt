This is a great big step in the right direction for the Air Force.  I am a great believer in the capability of our intelligence service and the technical personnel to gather the facts and then to evaluate them objectively.  We must, however, be very careful not to overlook any pertinent data and not to let preconceived notions or the clamor of publicity influence our analysis.  A scientific attitude has never before been more necessary.  Our responsibility is not alone to the Air Force, but to the public as well.  We must explain our findings in a way that will assure the public that we are facing the problem realistically and objectively.  I feel sure that such an approach will lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon and much more rapid progress toward an eventual solution.  To achieve this we must have the cooperation of every organization, official or private, which is investigating the so-called "flying saucers". All too often in the past, the various groups have worked at cross-purposes.  Now we must pull together in a united effort, for the sake of the Air Force and the public as a whole.  I feel that the public is entitled to know the results of our investigations, as they are citizens of the United States and owners of the Air Force, and in no small measure, owners of the technical resources being utilized.  They have a right to be assured that their interests are being safeguarded and that their tax money is being spent wisely and efficiently.  If we can gain the confidence of the public, we will have gone a long way toward solving the problem.  Time and again in the past year, the public has been disturbed by rumors of startling developments and strange sightings.  They are entitled to the facts.
