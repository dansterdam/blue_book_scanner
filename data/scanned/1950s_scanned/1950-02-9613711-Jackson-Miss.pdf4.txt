Jackson Woman Vows She Sees 'Fantastic' Saucers
The report describes how two "flying saucers" were observed by Mrs. Ed Morgan, a prominent woman in Jackson, Mississippi, who claimed to see strange aerial objects during the daytime. The objects were described as moving in a straight line and keeping the same distance, with a vapor trail behind them. The report also mentions that the objects gave off a steady light, but the sound was not like that of a jet aircraft.
