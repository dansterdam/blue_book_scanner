There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing handwritten text.

Transcribed text from the document:

Dear Mr. ____, we do not know if the report and these details are connected with the case or not. And since it is 3 years old the details. We believe for this interview there is no report at the last station as large as regards. Today see if we can get any and try to piece together what there is. Of course, under the circumstances there is very little to go on.

The text appears to be a handwritten report or notes related to a UFO incident investigation.
