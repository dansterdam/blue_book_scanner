REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
DATE: September 6, 1959
LOCATION: Wallingford, Kentucky
OBSERVER: Private First Class Gene Snyder, U.S. Army

On the evening of September 6, 1959, at approximately 8:15 PM, Private First Class Gene Snyder, U.S. Army, was on routine patrol near the town of Wallingford, Kentucky. While crossing an open field, he noticed a bright light in the sky approximately 1/2 mile to the northwest. The light appeared to be hovering and pulsating. 

Snyder stopped and observed the light for several minutes. It then began to slowly move in a northwesterly direction. As it moved, the light appeared to increase in size and brightness. 

Snyder continued to observe the object until it disappeared from view behind some trees. He immediately reported the incident to his commanding officer.

This report was filed as part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects.
