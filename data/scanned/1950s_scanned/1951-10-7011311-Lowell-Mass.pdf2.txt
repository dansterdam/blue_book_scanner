TO WHOM IT CONCERNS:

ON OCTOBER 14, 1951 IN LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS, MARILYN JOAN QUINLAN AND MYSELF JUDY DWYER WHILE OUTSIDE PLAYING, WERE ATTRACTED BY A GLITTERING OBJECT. CALLING MY FATHER LORING D. DWYER, BUT WHEN HE CAME OUT THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARED. WE WERE GREATLY DISCOURAGED. WHEN MY FATHER COULDN'T LOCATE THEM, I HAD READ IN A MAGAZINE, OPEN ROAD, ABOUT FLYING SAUCERS AND THAT MADE ME BELIEVE WHAT WE SAW. AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INFORMATION LEADING TO THE TWO OBJECTS WHICH WE SAW ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY.

SINCERELY YOURS,
