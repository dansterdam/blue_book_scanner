Text extracted from the document:

Dear Mr.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center agrees that your sighting of 17 April 1958 was a fireball.

On the evening of 17 April 1958, witnesses observed the sighting of a cylindrical object exceeding the speed of sound and traveling in a northerly direction. The object appeared to be emitting sparks and exhibited a glowing red or orange color. It was observed for several minutes and gradually disappeared to the north.

Based on the information provided, this was undoubtedly the reentry of a space vehicle or missile, possibly a meteorite. This object has been completely investigated by the Air Technical Intelligence Center, and they have concluded that this was not an Unidentified Flying Object.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
