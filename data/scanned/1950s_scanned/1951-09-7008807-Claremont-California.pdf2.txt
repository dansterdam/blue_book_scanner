The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this image, only a map or diagram. The map shows a "WARNING AREA" with various geographic features and labels, including "SAN CLEMENT IS'D" and a "WARNING AREA" marked on the map.

As an OCR system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

WARNING
AREA
RESTRICTED
UNCONTROLLED UNMANNED

KEEP VISUAL LOOKOUT
AND AVOID COLLISION
MAINTAIN VISUAL
CONTACT AT ALL TIMES
