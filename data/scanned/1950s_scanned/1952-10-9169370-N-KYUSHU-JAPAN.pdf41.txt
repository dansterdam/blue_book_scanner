AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Objects on 27 October 1952, by Captain I. M. Coy and Lt. L. W. McClure
(This report supplements narrative by 2nd Lt Eugene Baldwin)
Confirm yellow was airborne on a Combat Air Patrol at 1740t.
2nd Lt Eugene Baldwin and one enlisted crewman
Friendly was making practice firing runs on an unidentified aircraft
in the area at 1730t - 1755 t and 1955 - 1957 t and 1957 - 2015 t
That, after, and intercept friendly was instructed to investigate
unidentified targets originally assigned to ADTAC Air Forces Radar, 330 - 53' N and 136 - 40' E, at 20,000 feet called to CGI by a D-119.
When controller ground controlled friendly to a point north of ASHIYA a
bright light was noticed by the flight. The light was observed to friendly
turn into an object and then disappear. The object reappeared to friendly
and was observed to approximately 22,000 feet from 19,000 feet and was then
positive that the object was not their own aircraft.
Friendly then took up a heading of 2100 and object no longer appeared to be
following friendly. Friendly was descending and climbing but object did not
appear again. A master caution light in the cockpit of the F-119 came on
and 5 minutes later it went off as Friendly approached TATSUNA Air Force
Base, 130 - 25' N and 130 - 57' E. The light came on again and the
information was reported to Confirm Green who took over the chase.

The foregoing was a true and complete narrative of the flight of Confirm
Green from 1745 to 1956t on 27 October 1952.
