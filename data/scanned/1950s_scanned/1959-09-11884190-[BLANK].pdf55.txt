II. Method of Operation

As mentioned in operating the UFO program has been generally the same since its inception in 1952. Although it is only in which agencies of the Air Force have performed this function, it is considered that too many people have access to these records and no centralization of activities is done. The program as presented at this time, 29 SEP 1959, is as follows:

1. Reporting
Reports of alleged sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena are reported to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, either by military or by private citizens.

2. Investigation
The initial investigations are conducted by the air base or station personnel or others reporting the sightings. In the more unusual or complex cases, these investigations are conducted by the 1127th USAF Special Activities Squadron, specially designated by the ATIC.

3. Monitoring
Monitoring the processing, analysis, and maintaining the records is the responsibility of the ATIC.

4. The release of all current information relating to UFOs, which is in the responsibility of the Secretary of the Air Force.

B. The Program Today.

Today one of the major aims in the conduct of this program is to eliminate the curiosity which has been aroused in the public mind, which tends to inflame public interest and to distort objective analysis. It is not the space to educate the public to the existence of UFOs, but rather to educate them to the realization that each object sighted is not necessarily evidence of an interplanetary origin. Such aims as to educate the public to evaluate each UFO sighting not essential, and the Air Force does not consider such a program necessary. The panel is composed of experts in the following areas:
