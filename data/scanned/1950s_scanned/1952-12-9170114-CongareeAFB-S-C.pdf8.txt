Congaree Air Force Base, South Carolina
4 December 1952

I. Description of Incident:
One unidentified object was sighted by radar at Congaree AFB at 0342 EST on 3/20/52. The object was sighted 100 miles NE of the radar site, traveling at an estimated speed of 6,000 mph which contrasted 5 minutes. The weather at the time consisted of low stratus clouds, no precipitation, and winds of 5 mph.
All observers were airmen graduates of operators school with between two to five years experience and considered excellent and reliable sources.

II. Discussion of Incident:
Several past radar sightings of this type have been received by ATIC and evaluated as probable interceptions or mistaken identity. This incident may fall into this category eventually in that the excessive speed of 6,000 mph plus the object's coherence to the radar beam's sweep indicate that interference may have been present. However, not enough information has yet been gathered on local weather, temperature, and moisture conditions, so this incident will be carried as unknown until such information arrives.

III. Conclusion:
Unknown
