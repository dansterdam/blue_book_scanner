The document contains three simple drawings that are part of the data entry related to a UFO sighting report. Each drawing appears to represent different aspects of the UFO sighting:

1. The first drawing depicts a triangle with a dotted line expanding from one apex. 
2. The second drawing is also of a triangle with an arc above it, possibly indicating movement or a trajectory.
3. The third drawing is a half-circle or dome shape with a straight line cutting through horizontally at the middle and a small segment marked "45".
