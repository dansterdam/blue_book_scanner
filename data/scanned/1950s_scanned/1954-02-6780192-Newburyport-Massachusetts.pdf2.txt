The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report or document, likely from Project Blue Book, discussing a sighting of what sounds like a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon near Newburyport, Massachusetts on April 28, 1954.

Andover, Mass

To whom it may concern:

On Sunday, April 28 - 54 we were in the Newburyport area when I heard a droning sound overhead. As I looked up I saw a strange white disc-shaped object, and it was slowly moving in a southerly direction. It had no apparent protrusions and was traveling in a straight line at a fairly high rate of speed. The object was silver in color and seemed to have no discernible means of propulsion. It was between 2,000 - 3,000 feet in altitude.
