Text from the document:

30 June 1953
UNCLASSIFIED
Ramore, Ontario, Canada
Description
At approximately 2345 EDST on 30 June 1953 an unidentified flying object was observed by several citizens at Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The object was sighted by the pilot and radar operator of the 93 Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The first person to observe this object was an airman who came out of the maintenance room to inspect the power unit which caused a minor breakdown of the search radar set-up. He observed two circular objects somewhat smaller than the moon hovering 40 to 50 feet above the ground. The airman called another airman and the two of them observed the object got hysterical and called the Charge of Quarters. At least seven witnesses observed the object at the Domestic Area now the object and two of them reported that the object was distinct and separate from another object which was oval shaped. It was described as moving from the north to southeast and then fading back to the north. No great speed was attributed to the object by any of the witnesses who said they saw movement. It was reported that the object had no visible means of propulsion and that there was no similarity to any known flying object.
Discussion
The sighting was made a few minutes after the scheduled time for the moon rise. The shape of the moon that night was similar to the description of the object; however, any explanation as that or the moon reflecting off the clouds is impossible. There is a probability that the object*was the moon reflecting off the clouds.
Conclusion
Possibly astronomical.
