Summary of these replies is included in Exhibit I of this report. A new questionnaire, the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet", has been designed, in which several questions were omitted, some were revised, and others added. As an example, it was found that many observers were unable to reply to the question which asked for an estimation of the "real" size of the object. This question was restated in the form of an "apparent" size.

A sample of the "U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet" is given as Exhibit II of this report. Form A is for specific data, and Form B is for a short verbal summary expressed in the observer's own words.

Multiple-choice questions, completion questions, and drawings are used throughout the final questionnaire so as to get as accurate a description as possible. The multiple-choice question is well adapted for use in largescale statistical studies.

The second criterion used in preparing the questionnaire is most difficult to achieve. As far as possible, questions were worded to provide a check on the consistency and competence of the observer.

The best check of consistency would be to have the observer answer the questionnaire twice with an interval of time separating the two replies. Since this is not practical, it was decided that the next best way would be to have the observer fill in an objective multiple-choice section and, in addition, write out a summary description in a summary data sheet. Any obvious discrepancies between information given in this description and that given in the questionnaire would make the observer's replies questionable.

An evaluation of the observer's personality traits and mental competence is likewise difficult to achieve in such a questionnaire. In addition
