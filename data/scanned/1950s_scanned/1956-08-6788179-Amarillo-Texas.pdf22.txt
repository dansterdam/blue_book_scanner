There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from an old document, specifically a letter from the University of Michigan Engineering Research Institute addressed to the Department of the Air Force, Director of Intelligence.

The text of the letter is as follows:

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE

TELEPHONE 2-4747 	ADDRESS REPLY TO:

13 December 1957

Department of the Air Force
Director of Intelligence
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a clipping from our local newspaper regarding the appearance of radiation vapor recently seen in Amarillo, Texas. The writer who made this photograph feels that in view of the many object sightings and further since the photograph is a clear and sharp one, it should be given a thorough analysis. He feels that this photograph may be of assistance to the Air Force in this investigation and further to prevent some time in pursuing a false lead.

Sincerely yours,

Joseph J. Mosley
University Research Security Officer
