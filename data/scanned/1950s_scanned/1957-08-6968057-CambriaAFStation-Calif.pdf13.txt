Excerpt from the text:

except for some abrasions and some dried red mud in the hollow. One end appears to be broken surface, dark blue-gray in color...Mr. thought it is in the beam of his searchlights, and thought it was a bluish "hazy" or shine to it, but it does not indicate too certain that this was unnatural. It had a peculiar, smokey odor... plunge from the sky, presumably a meteorite, they called the Patterson Case and resumed the searching operations and were still in the air when the Tolowa Drive-In theater, a few miles to the west on Route 101, where he saw the blue fireball fall in the ocean...on Monday, September 16th, Mr. is called to the base to identify the stone, were it from its origin a meteorite...It would appear that this is an error that they may make - time after time, witnesses or a fireball may wear on the memory and daring may be recalled as something else when it is actually what they saw originally.
