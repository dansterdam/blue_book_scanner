AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT UNCLASSIFIED

FROM: (AGENCY) 8th Intelligence Section

TO: Commanding General, Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Incident at Key West, Florida, 25 March 1953

A final "Top Secret" security clearance dated 25 March 1953, given to the Commanding Officer, U.S. Naval Air Station, Key West, Florida, was in connection with the interrogation of the pilot and observation of the incident. The interrogation lasted approximately two and one-half hours during which time the pilot submitted a written statement of the incident.

The pilot stated that the object was observed in the sky above him at approximately 4,000 feet for a period of ten to twelve minutes. The object was described as appearing to be metallic in nature, round in shape, and was estimated to be approximately 50-60 feet in diameter. The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and at one point came to a complete stop and then accelerated rapidly, making an abrupt change in direction of flight. The pilot believed the object was not an aircraft or any known type of missile.

No unusual meteorological conditions were noted during this period. There were thunderstorms in the area and it was raining, but the object was observed clearly through breaks in the clouds at 22,000 feet and below broken clouds at 10,000 feet.

No physical evidence of the sighting was found. No flights were conducted in the area close to the time of the sighting.
