Dear Sir:

It was been called to my attention by (REDACTED), chief
(REDACTED), Bismark, North Dakota, that you wished a description
of the sighting of an unknown object or objects which were visible to
the unaided eye on the night of August 5, and the morning of August 6,
1953.

The local air-raid filter center had sighted two objects on the
evening of August 5th. One appeared due west of the city of Bismark and
the other in the northwest.

My first knowledge and sighting of these objects were at approx
imataly 12:05 A.M., August 6th. As near as I could tell the one in the west
appeared to be directly due west; and the other approximately 50 to 70 de
gress north and west of due north as estimated at the KFYR transmittor
location, which is approximately 13 miles east of Bismark.

As to the description of these objects all that I can say is that
they appeared much brighter than most of the stars and at times appeared to 
take on a rather dull bluish tint.

They appeared to move in the heavens, but at a rather slow rate 
and unless a person braced his head against some stationary object to 
eliminate head movement it would be hard to tell that they were moving.

The one in the west eventually disappeared below the horizon and 
the one in the north-west gradually seemed to blend in with the rest of the
stars until it was no longer visible. The time of the last sighting of both
objects was about 1:30 A.M.

I hope I have in some measure helped in your research.

Very truly yours,
/s/(REDACTED)
