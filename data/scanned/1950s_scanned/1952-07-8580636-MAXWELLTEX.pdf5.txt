The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document titled "MEMO FOR THE RECORD" dated 9 July 1968, discussing a UFO observation on 22 July 1952. The text states that the flight characteristics and duration of the observed object do not agree with those of a meteor, and that there is insufficient information available for a proper analysis. The document is signed by an individual whose name begins with "H.C.L."

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
9 July 1968

Sub j: UFO Observation of 22 July 1952

I agree with Dr Hynek that the flight characteristics and duration as given certainly don't agree with those of a meteor. Possibly the evaluator had information that has since been lost. There is insufficient information now available for an analysis. To change the evaluation at this time, however, would cause an unwarranted amount of work in changing our records.
