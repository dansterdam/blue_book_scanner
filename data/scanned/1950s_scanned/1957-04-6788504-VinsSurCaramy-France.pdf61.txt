"LITTLE MEN" AGAIN IN FRANCE
May 10, 1957: At Beaucourt-sur-Ancre (Somme), France, six people reported a UFO landing and several occupants. According to Reuters, INS, and Lille, France-AFP dispatches, a 29-year-old Hungarian refugee, was bicycling home shortly after 10:15 p.m., when he was suddenly "dazzled by a strange projectable" approaching him in the sky. Two men in a threatening manner were seen. They carried a brilliant light, which projected a beam on his bicycle. He did on his bicycle, to the site of the landing, and there saw four little men on the ground". They examined the light and were "examining his bicycle" together with an "unidentified companion" whom they introduced as "a hundred meters away on the road". According to the press accounts, three or four little men dressed in gray running about (a hundred meters) illuminated by the light of an object which rose vertically and at high speed. According to the press accounts, a large black "plaques" were found at the site of the landing. The press dismissed the story lightly, reporting that the witnesses had "really seen the daughter (according to INS, she had) of a neighboring farmer (the mayor), again according to INS) carrying a lantern with a lane of red glass in kit: this was mistaken as the "saucer"; the press said she had seen nothing unusual.
