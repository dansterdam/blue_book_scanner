Pfrom the station in Zone 4 and in as close as 36 miles in Zone 4. Lt. 
_advised that on Friday, 3 March 1950, at approximately 23:5 
hours, after he had left a stag party in the Officer*s Club and having 
had only one beer during the course of the evening, he had observed a 
yellowish light in the sky . . 
cler from the Officers* Club in the direction of the PX on Selfridge 
Air Force Base. He blanked his catâ€™ down and observed the licht, its 
size and brifliancy,undarminad but described to be the approximate 
color and size of an electric light within a house showing through 'a
normal size window at a distance of about 50 to 75 feet on a dark 
night. The light was descending vertically over the Base and at 
first appeared to be a flare but, due to the color of the light, it 
was realized it could not have been a flare. He then stopped his 
car and observed the light further. The light then proceeded westward 
holding the same azimuth for approximately 10 to 15 miles . The light 
then went southward approximately the same distance, stopping and 
returning northward from the center line of sight the same distance 
giving the north-south movement approximately 80 to 100 miles. This 
occurred within four (A) minutes of time.
