The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, likely an old UFO report.

May, Hackett

Capt. Charleston - with long experience on jet interceptors and the F - 86A and F - 94C. She states that the visual and radar reports are very similar to those received on many occasions when the object being tracked was a malfunction of the radar itself and proved to be an imaginary target. May, Hackett, SF Officer attached to the CAAB concurs on these conclusions.
