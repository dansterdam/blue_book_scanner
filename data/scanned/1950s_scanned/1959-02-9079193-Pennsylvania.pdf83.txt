UFO INVESTIGATOR JUL-AUG 1960

CHAPTER II - The William Killian Case. 
The piloting of Captain Peter Killian, American Airlines, in March 1953, and the resulting official investigation of this "sighting" as a "UFO" phenomenon, was a classic case of intelligent reporting. Captain Killian, a senior pilot, and observer, reported sighting a strange aerial object while flying over the eastern United States. This case has been a landmark in the investigation of UFO reports made by competent observers.
