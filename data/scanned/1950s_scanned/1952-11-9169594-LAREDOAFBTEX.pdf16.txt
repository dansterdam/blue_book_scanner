1. Statement by [REDACTED]

On Nov 22, 1952, I was on duty at the Control Tower at Laredo AFB, Texas. At approximately 1240 hours when I saw an object appear which was very high and seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to be approximately four (4) thousand feet high. I cannot estimate its dimensions but it seemed to be quite large. When it first appeared it was very dim and difficult to see, but as it came nearer it became more distinct. It seemed to be cylindrical in shape and appeared to have a bright glow around it. It remained in sight for approximately five (5) to seven (7) minutes and when it started to move away, it rapidly disappeared from sight.

On November 22, 1952, a member of the 3552-2 ACS Detachment, Laredo AFB, Texas, was on duty at the Control Tower at Laredo AFB. At approximately 1240 hours, he sighted an object which he was unable to identify. The object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 4,000 feet. It was difficult to determine the exact size of the object, but it appeared to be quite large. The object was a dark color and seemed to have a glow around it. It remained in sight for approximately 5 to 7 minutes before rapidly disappearing.
