Dear Sirs: 

The Air Technical Intelligence Center is in receipt of a bulletin on an UFO sighting described in your letter of 14 October 1952 in the York, Pennsylvania area. Our own report concerning this sighting indicates a few differences in the particulars. However, the following items may be of interest:

1. The object is described as having a brilliant, slightly bluish-white light which was observed on four occasions, each lasting from 10 to 15 minutes.
2. The object was first sighted at about 8:00 PM on 6 October 1952 southwest of York, Pennsylvania.
3. The object was observed to move in various erratic manners, hovering, accelerating rapidly and maintaining constant altitude. It would appear and disappear at will.
4. All the observers agreed that the object looked like a "lens-shaped" craft with a brilliant white light in front and a similar trail at the rear. 
5. Additionally, and at approximately the same time, an unidentified flying object was observed over Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which was described as appearing to be larger than the object seen over York.
6. The report indicates that the object seen at Harrisburg may have been the same object seen over York, due to the proximity of the two locations.
It seems probable that the object seen at Harrisburg, Pennsylvannia, and the one described in your letter are the same, inasmuch as the descriptions and behavior are similar. However, in the attached report, the object seen over York appears to be definitely the one described in your letter.
Your report of astronomical activity lends us to believe that the first group of observers really saw the brilliant meteor or fireball reported in your statement for 14 October.
