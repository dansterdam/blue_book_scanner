SUBJECT: (Uncl) Radar Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object 17 March 1953
TO: ATTAE-5 FROM: ATTAE-2 DATE: 20 Mar 53 COMMENT NO. 2
Ref: Project No. 1053/12, 6S264/page 523
1. It is not possible to give a firm opinion as to the nature of the unidentified target. However, the slow speed and large visual radar size of the target suggested it was not a normal aircraft. Additional weather information - temperature gradient - would be of value in determining the possibility of low-level temperature clouds.
2. It is unfortunate that an interception was not attempted on this target as it was detected for forty-five minutes and moved slowly.
