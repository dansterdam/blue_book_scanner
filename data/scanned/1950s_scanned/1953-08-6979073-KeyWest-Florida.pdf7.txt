Dear Capt. Harding:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just gotten around to looking over the large batch of accumulated reports. I must say that compared with Black Hawk, none of these accumulated incidents in interest. I'm afraid that none of these is sufficiently interesting to make a writeup profitable.

On the interesting case, the very similar sightings of 24 July and 1 August near Elmendorf, Alaska would appear to warrant more thought.

The 28 July report APS Texas also holds possible interest from the standpoint of maneuvers and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by civilians of Harlingen, Texas.

It is too bad there is no more information on Decatur, Ala. These cases cover about four separate days. There is possibly pay dirt in these.

Finally, the Idid Siliman sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably require more information on the background.

As for the remaining 30 or so, there is so little information concerning those which is not purely speculative that there is no percentage whatever in considering them seriously.

Your staff has indicated that nothing further would be available if I visit the Air Force Institute of Technology. Personally, I feel certain that if this case can be explained, others would follow suit. Concurring in the recent Black Hawk case, the investigation proceeded slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence. Since the observations covered several hours and daylight was both visual and radar, it is important, in my estimation, that we continue to pursue this matter diligently.
