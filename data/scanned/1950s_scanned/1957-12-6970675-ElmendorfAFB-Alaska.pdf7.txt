MYSTERY SKY OBJECT
This is in reference to the sighting of an "illuminated object" which
occurred over Chatham, Ontario, Canada, Dec.
11, 1957. This object was sighted at about
8:30 p.m. by a number of witnesses.
Witnesses could give no explanation
of the strange sight, but said
the phenomena was "much brighter
and lower than any star", and
it was visible from about 7 p.m.,
by Mrs. Robert Moore of RR 2, near
Blenheim. She said it drew at a
downward angle and continued in a
westward direction.
"At first I thought it was a star
but it was a hundred times brighter 
than the biggest star of a football and
it was quite low in the sky."
District radar units reported
heights as low as 35,000 to 40,000 feet.
Richard Walden and John McPherson of Ridgetown
were sent to the scene and both
saw the object.
Walden said he saw the object in
sight for over 10 minutes.
"It was far too bright for a meteor
or star."
Telephone lines into CRP headquarters in Chatham were jammed
with calls from persons who sighted
the object and demanded into
from an RCAF entry in Peterbor
