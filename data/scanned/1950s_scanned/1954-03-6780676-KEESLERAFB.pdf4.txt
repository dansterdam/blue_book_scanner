At approximately 10:30C 7 March 1954 we took off in a C-45 type aircraft to try to find an unidentified object which had been sighted over Wiggins, Miss. We flew around the Wiggins area for about 30 minutes without sighting anything unusual when the Control Tower in Brookley Alabama called, telling us there was an unidentified object over Mobile Alabama. We proceeded to Mobile flying at 10,000 feet. About 10 miles west of Mobile the object was sighted at about 30,000 feet. We flew to a point under the object and started to circle. The object was observed for two hours and series. During this time it was observed that the object was drifting in an easterly direction at approximately 20 miles per hour. The object was very high, probably about 50,000 feet. We had to look up at an angle of about 80 degrees while observing it. The object was white and appeared to be translucent. It appeared to be a ball, and could have been made of rubber or plastic. There was a white streamer hanging from the bottom of the object which appeared to be about 1/4 of the object's diameter long. I took about 5 pictures of the object with my camera.
