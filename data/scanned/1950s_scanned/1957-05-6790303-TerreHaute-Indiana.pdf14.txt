CIGAR OVER MOUNT VERNON

May 7, 1957: Arthur Guillen had just left his home in Mount Vernon, New York, on his way to work. The time was about 8:10 a.m. Glancing up he saw in the southern sky a large white cigar-shaped object moving quite rapidly. The object seemed to be about the diameter of the moon. As he stood and watched, he saw the object make "funny motions" as it moved upward and forward by about one-quarter its own length. He was quite certain about this motion, since he had the moon above the object and the planet Jupiter behind towards its point of reference. He watched the object for about five minutes, and then it disappeared behind willow trees. When he had passed them, he found that the object was no longer in view. Arriving at work, Mr. Guillen immediately told what he had seen to CSI member Frank Bordes, who advised the Research Section of the incident.

It was on this night that the "mystery jet(s)" buzzed Manhattan. A careful check of the CDC records at the Manhattan and Brooklyn posts failed to disclose any reports of "unknowns" over the city on that night. So far as we know, there is no connection between the two incidents.
