STATEMENT

At approximately 2245 EDT on the night of August 13, I went to the barrage to dispatch a back of cigarettes. As I left the barrage, I noticed in the sky to the northeast a bright light which appeared to be quite large and which was slowly moving from the northeast to the southwest at a fairly high rate of speed. I watched this light for about 10 to 15 minutes until it disappeared from sight. After observing the light, I immediately reported it to my superior officer, and I was requested to call operations for a check and location so that it could be investigated further. I could not report its exact location due to the fact that it was a considerable distance away and had moved from the point where I first observed it.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 13th day of August 1953.
