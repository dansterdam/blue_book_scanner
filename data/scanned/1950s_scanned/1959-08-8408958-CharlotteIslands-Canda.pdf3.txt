STATEMENT

"At point "Seirra" I heard a report over UHF interplane of a sighting of aircraft at 0800 Z. I then switched my set to 20,000 yard range and picked up an unidentified return at 12,300 yards. During that time I also had very good returns of the aircraft in our formation, the farthest of which was NO.-3 which was 4,000 yards range.

This unidentified target stayed with us approximately 30 minutes and was 30° below our aircraft.

The coordinates of this sighting are 50:15 - 130:39.
The unidentified object finally broke right and disappeared from my scope at 18,000 yards and 60° azimuth."
