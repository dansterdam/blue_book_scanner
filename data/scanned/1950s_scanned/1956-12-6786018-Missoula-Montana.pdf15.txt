Mr. stated that lava fragments and rocks lying on the earth's surface would be especially common in the area about Harlow, Montana and that the discovery of such fragments on the site in question could not necessarily have any relation to unusual alluvial actions having transported such fragments in a northeasterly direction from the apparent impact site. Mr. played specimens of lava rock which range in color from brown through black-gray, on lighters from approximately 1/8 to 3/8 inches thick. He further explained that the above holes or cavities have been produced by when the lava had been in a molten state and that the dimensions of the holes were regulated by the pressure in the molten state. Mr. stated that the specific gravity or density of such lava is obviously less than 3.5 and that an average specific gravity of
0.70 would be characteristic of this type of rock. Mr. explained that extreme pressure has been exerted upon and within molten lava.
