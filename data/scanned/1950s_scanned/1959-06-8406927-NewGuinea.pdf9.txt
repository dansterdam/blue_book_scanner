RAAF Statement on GH Sightings
Representative -: of GH, Australia, has forwarded a copy of a letter from Squadron Leader X, RAAF, to the Directorate of Air Force Intelligence in London, concerning information to the G. Sightings (APRU Division). The letter of 22 February "Dear Sir: Thank you for your letter of the 5th January containing information about the sighting (APRU)..."
The report concludes that the phenomena observed are still under investigation, and copies of the findings have been submitted to proper authorities. As requested in our letter of 28th November, the matter is still under investigation.
Reports are not releasable to the public. However, although it is not permissible to reach positive conclusions, we do not believe that the phenomena observed by the Governmentowned the early were strange space vehicles. An analysis of bearings and angles above the horizon does suggest that there was a definite pattern of movement linked to the relative positions of the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. Light refraction, the changing position of the planets relative to the horizon, and the possibility that unusual atmospheric conditions could give the impression of rise and rapid movements (Signed): Yours the faithful officer Directorate of Air Force Intelligence.
