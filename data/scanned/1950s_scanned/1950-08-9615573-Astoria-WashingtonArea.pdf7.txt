Dear Miss Walker:

Here is my reply to your letter of 27 June 1950 regarding an unusual sighting observed by you and others in the Tacoma area and other parts of Washington on the 30th of August 1950.

Our records indeed indicate that there was a UFO reported from Washington State, and at precisely this time on 30 August 1950. Our records of investigation and analysis indicate the following:

a. The object was a solid, metallic phenomenon, as is it not unusual for such unexplainable metallic craft to be observed.
b. The object was an extremely high speed and altitude, more commonly known as a Fireball. These objects are quite common in our atmosphere.
c. The identity of the object was confirmed by the independent observation of private individuals.

A point of explanation is in order here, as we generally do not have more definitive information on these types of phenomena. Objects in the earth's upper atmosphere can, but do not always, produce a large, glowing image intact as a large, flowing mass until they disintegrate at lower levels. These bodies soon appear very often during meteoric showers. Records indicate that the majority of people have an encounter with one, and an encounter with one can indeed be a startling experience.
