AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO.: 
DATE INFORMATION ACQUIRED: 6 October 1959
DATE REPORT SUBMITTED: 
SUBJECT: ALLEGED SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
LOCATION: REPUBLIC OF KOREA
DATE/TIME GROUP: 1/0125Z 

SUMMARY: On 1 October 1959, between 0100 and 0130 hours, local time, a single observer claimed to have sighted several unidentified flying objects over the southern portion of the Republic of Korea. The objects were described as bright, luminous, pulsating lights maneuvering in a random fashion at high altitudes. The observer stated the objects appeared to be larger than average aircraft and were traveling at a high rate of speed.

EVALUATION: The report is considered to be inconclusive since it is based on the observation of a single witness and there are no confirming reports. The objects described are consistent with the appearance of natural phenomena such as stars or planets under certain atmospheric conditions. No further investigation is deemed warranted.
