UFO SIGHTING - DAYTON AREA, 6 MARCH 1958

1. Majority of reports state object small, round, slightly larger in size than 500 to 1000 feet. (See winds above for those altitudes at that time and place, 6 to 8 knots).

2. A. General time of sighting 6:30 to 6:50 A.M.  
   B. Checked with U.S. Weather Service, Mr. Halsey. Phones DW 8-4529. Stated winds substantially as above. Determined a little error. Check 6:30 to 6:45 A.M.

3. A report of a very reliable source follows:
   Source: M/Sgt Hurley, 6th Weather Grp. AP. Phone 3-6311
   Sighting Brief: Observed sometime between 6:00 to 6:15A.M. Moved slowly. Size in 7 minutes was 6 to 3 2. Shape and color: small, round, slight tinge of red. (Stated that this was the disappearance to early March rays) and about 1/2 elevation.

4. Astro check: Astro computer, tables, etc. reveal no astro body in that direction responsible. Could have been washed out by the dawn at 6:15.

5. Conclusions: The appearance, characteristics and movement of the object are typical of a balloon. The checks above confirm that the object was without doubt a balloon, resolved just a few minutes before reported by the general public.
