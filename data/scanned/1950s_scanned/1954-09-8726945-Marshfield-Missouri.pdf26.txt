The image does not contain any photographs, only a handwritten diagram and text.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the objects or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length? 
(Circle One): 
a. Silver dollar 
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter 
f. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): 
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material all would you make it, and what shape would it be, and what size would it be, and how would it compare in appearance with the object which you saw?

Not being able to associate this object with any common object, I would describe it as some type of unique craft or machine with an irregular shape that would be difficult to construct. Without more information about its specific characteristics, I would be hesitant to speculate further on the details of its design or materials.
