1. The color transparency contained in this report has been examined, and it is the opinion of the specialists with this branch that it does not contain a physical object, as you have indicated.

2. It is suggested that the transparency be turned over to the Photo Lab, AFOTN-ho, with a request that an enlargement with this greatest magnification possible be made. In this type of an enlargement, the transparent edges of the object should prove it to be a cloud formation.
