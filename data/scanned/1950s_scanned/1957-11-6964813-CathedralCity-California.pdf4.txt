AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Dr. A. 1306TH AISS

STATEMENT:
From a south-westerly direction, a group of objects traveling at high speed and at a high altitude was observed. The objects were round in shape, about the size of a half dollar when held at arm's length. There were about 4 or 5 objects and they seemed to be traveling in formation. The objects were a whitish color and all agreed it was not something natural.

The next morning we tried to find the objects again, looking through a telescope, but were unable to locate them. The observers stated that they were certain of what they saw.
