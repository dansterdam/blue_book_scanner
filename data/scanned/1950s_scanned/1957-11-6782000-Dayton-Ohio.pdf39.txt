that had been so healthy when shown at dog shows...she died full of cancer. Or the bitch that whirled a little of our monstrosity. Thank God I was present of UFO, and I had learned these fool cancer full correct if I was not, they would have been killed right after night. somehow an unknown was here. I guess injury like a story heard from another man who had been burned by these things is no proof. either is no photograph to show the old of wanting 2 red lighits that worked all night. And people like us approched to see what had happened to him. I admit I am surprised to have him saying me to send you data for I did not know he was assisting your department. Of course I know him only slightly. For he has been liked with my rechnical to use my story for public relenies. I would feel like a testmonial for God only know what, and yet perhaps I am wrong for hind instance could actually be married, I surely would not have remained out to look. 

Sincerely,
