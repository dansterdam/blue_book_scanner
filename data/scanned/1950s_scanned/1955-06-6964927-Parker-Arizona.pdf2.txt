SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object
REFERENCE: AF Form 112, ATCC-4-92, 10 June 1955

1. On 6 June 1955, at approximately 11:00 PM, a circular, brightly lighted object was observed in the sky northwest of Parker, Arizona. The object was described as being approximately 25-30 feet in diameter and emitting a bluish-white light that illuminated the surrounding desert area to a considerable degree. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes before it disappeared to the southwest.

2. The observer, Mr. Wallace A. Watts, stated that he was driving his automobile on Arizona State Highway 95 approximately 10 miles northwest of Parker when he noticed the object. He stopped his car and watched the object for several minutes before it disappeared. Mr. Watts described the object as descending to an estimated altitude of 500 feet above the desert floor before accelerating rapidly and disappearing to the southwest.

3. An investigation of this incident was conducted by personnel from the 4706th AISS at Luke AFB, Arizona. The investigation failed to reveal any conclusive evidence as to the nature or origin of the unidentified aerial object. No further information is available.
