The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document discussing observations of U.S. satellites made during a period in 1957-58. The text describes observations by "MOONWATCH teams" at various stations, and provides details about the cataloguing and tracking of the satellite positions. The text also notes that the satellite positions are given in terms of right ascension and declination, or in azimuth and altitude, with the measurements spanning 360 degrees.

the u.s. satellites were made during a period in which many 
of the 230 stations were engaged in observing 1957/58 as well.

two moonwatch teams reported unique observing expert- 
ences at albuquerque station 103 on march 13 1958 at about 1950z: 
and 1958c in that order.

the catalogue lists the observations by object, and
in chronological order. the key to moonwatch station code
numbers gives the geographical coordinates of the stations
listed.

it will be noted that the position of the satellites
is given either in right ascension and declination or in
azimuth and altitude. Azimuth is measured clockwise from 
north through 360Â°. the catalogue and key to station code
numbers follow:
