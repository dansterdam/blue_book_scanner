              subjt Report of Unidentified
              Flying Object photographed by Miss__
              Street, Bostonia, California, on 19 October 1956 or 2 November 1956

      10. Miss                         Xas stated that she wishes to retain possession
of the negative on which the unidentified flying object appears and
requests that it be returned to her at the earliest practicable
date.

      11. On 10 June 1957, the                             interviewed at his
church by S/A GRIFFIN, advised that his daughter had, in fact,
taken a photograph of the moon on which appeared an object that
he would term "a flying saucer". The                          stated it is his
firm belief that his daughter has a genuine picture even though the
object looks like an inverted chandelier. The Ram                     9
escorted S/A GRIFFIN through the church and through his home next
door in search of a chandelier or any other object resembling that
on the negative in question. No such object was observed. This
9               3 advised that he has conversed with his neighbors on
this matter and has located no one with knowledge of such an occurrence. He stated that neither he, or anyone he knows has observed
a flying saucer or any other unidentified flying object previously.

received and no action was taken as a result of this report by this
