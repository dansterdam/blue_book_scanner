THE REPORT SOMEONE WHO CALLED HIMSELF SAMUEL P. JONES
SINCE ABOUT 1927. AT THAT TIME CLAIMED TO HAVE A REVOLUTIONARY ENGINE WHICH
WOULD PERMIT INCREDIBLE A/C PERFORMANCE BUT
NO ONE MFANING THE PRESS WOULD BELIEVE
HIM. SPRINGER CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN AT LATER
DATE A MODEL SAUCER BUILT BY ___ IN IDAHO
FOR UTILIZING HIS ENGINE. THEN HE LOST
TOUCH WITH SPRINGER EXCEPT FOR OCCASIONAL LETTER.
STARTED HEARING FROM HIM AGAIN IN '47 WHEN
HE TOLD HIM HE HAD BEGUN FLLIGHT TESTING
HIS SAUCERS. SPRINGER CLAIMS HE WOULD
NOTIFY HIM PRIOR TO EACH SERIES OF FLIGHT
TESTS THEREAFTER AND THAT THEY COINCIDED
WITH REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS IN PRESS. FINALLY
INFORMED HIM RECENTLY THAT HE WAS GOING
TO MAKE THE RIGHT PEOPLE TAKE NOTE OF HIS
SAUCERS BY FLYING THEM OVER WASH DC BALTIMORE
AND _____ AIRSPEED VA THIS LETTER WAS FOLLOWED VERY
SHORTLY ABOUT 2 OR 3 WEEKS BY FIRST INCIDENT
AT WASH HALL AND THE LETTER INDICATES 1 5 *
STATES THAT WE CAN USE HIS LETTER IN ANY WAY
THAT WE CARE. UNFORTUNATELY HE DID NOT INCLUDE
HIS ADDRESS WHICH MAY WELL INDICATE A HOAX.
HOWEVER I FEEL THAT THE LETTER HAS A DEFINITE
UNDERTONE OF SINCERITY AND AM
THEREFORE SUBMITTING IT TO OSI WITH A REQUEST
THAT AN INVESTIGATON BE MADE
TO DETERMINE THE RELIABILITY OF SPRINGER,
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE INFO OBTAINABLE
ON THE ACTIVITIES OF \_ _ _ _ _ _ \ IT THERE IS
SUCH A PERSON. I ASSUME THAT OSI WILL TURN
THE CASE OVER TO THE INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
