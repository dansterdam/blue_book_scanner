MR. F. J. RUEGG

USAF
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

REFERRING TO MY REPORT AND LETTER OF 25 JULY 1959:

IN YOUR ANSWER OF 5 JANUARY, 1950, RECEIVED TODAY, YOU SAY THAT THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT REPORTED. A SEARCH OF YOUR FILES SHOWS THAT IT WAS NOT RECORDED. IN FACT, THERE HAS BEEN NO MENTION OF IT UNTIL THIS LETTER WHICH I AM SENDING TO YOU AT THIS TIME.

IF YOU DESIRE THE NEGATIVE FOR EXAMINATION, I WOULD BE WILLING TO SEND IT TO YOU. HOWEVER, I DO NOT WANT TO RISK LOSING IT AND THE OTHER ATTACHED NEGATIVES.  

I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE OFFICIAL CONCLUSION IN THE CASE INVOLVING AND IDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS SEEN OVER AND NEAR O'HARE AFB, ILLINOIS ON 25 MARCH, 1957.

THANK YOU.

SINCERELY YOURS,
[REDACTED]
