At 6:00 P.M. on 19 February 1958, Mr. ___ was clearing brush on his father's farm which is located 18 miles southwest of Marshall, Missouri. At this time, he noticed a moving light in the sky to the southeast of his location, travelling at an angle of about 30 degrees and was visible for about two seconds.

The object was silver in color, bullet shaped and estimated to be 20 feet long, 4 to 5 feet in diameter, trailing red flame and grey smoke. 

The smoke dissipated rapidly, leaving no contrail. Mr. ___ at first sighting, thought it was a meteor but as it came closer it resembled an airplane without wings. Suddenly there was a puff of white smoke and a piece of the object became detached. After the puff of smoke, the object fell straight down and did not appear to oscillate or tumble.

Mr. ___ immediately ran to his car, which was parked 1/2 mile away, and drove to the area in which he believed it to land, but was unable to locate anything. He contacted the neighbors in the area but none of them saw anything.  

At 7:30 P.M. the same day, he contacted State Trooper Roberts and Mr. ___, who came to the area and reported what he had seen. The three of them immediately toured the area in question in the police car until darkness prevented further search.

Trooper Roberts and Mr. ___ contacted several persons who knew Mr. ___ and inquired as to his character. They all considered him to be reliable and of good character.
