SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
PANAMA CANAL ZONE
OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF INTELLIGENCE
DURING the period 9 through 13 March, three unexplainable radar sightings were made in the Canal Zone area. According to a top secret report, "During this period, three radar scopes showed unexplained objects at various times. All radar returns were strong and easily discernible from normal aircraft returns." The returns were tracked and recorded by air traffic controllers, who stated that the objects were unidentifiable and bore no resemblance to any known aircraft.
Various sightings and reports of the objects were made by tower operators and pilots flying commercial flights over the area. A commercial flight voluntarily investigated two of the targets and confirmed their existence. No explanation for the targets has been determined.

AT 10:12R on 19 March, search radar reported unidentified aircraft entering the immediate area of BALBOA with its flight observed for several minutes. The aircraft was described as a twin or multi-engine type and exhibited high speed. The aircraft left the immediate area but was observed and tracked for some distance before it disappeared from radar scope.
