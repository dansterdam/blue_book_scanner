THIS LATTER IS RIGHT

This is how I saw better
allieght blinked on for
couple seconds, then
not see the underside.

I watched 4 of this funny
looking birds for about 5
minutes. They flew like no
bird I've ever seen before
circled tower like hung
curtains and very slow.
It did no flapping of wings
lightly only glided one winy
for the circle. It took note
on register and clock that saw.
They silent and did not seem
to aware of me watching with
binoculars.
They sure looked like it was
small human being inside a
Mechanic that was no features
on. Face also covered and
black, no military looking, they
was to far.

This bird was about the same length
as a pigeon, no visible horns, no
"sillytail", it had white belly and back
wind with no flapping of wings, only
wind which for balance (what it looked
like) and turning. No visible wing
feathers and glew was faint for being
real birds against the wind.
