The shared image does not appear to contain any photographs. It seems to be a page from an "UNCLASSIFIED AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" form. The text on the form states "DOWNGRADED AT 2 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS" and there are some redacted or censored sections of the form, but no visible photographs.

Transcribing the text visible in the image:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
 
DOWNGRADED AT 2 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
