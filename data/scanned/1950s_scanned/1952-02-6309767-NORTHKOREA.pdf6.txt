Mr. C.F. Zimmerman, ATIA
Reference C-4446 FOR CO DRAK JAPTO-23B
dated 26 February 1952, re sighting of objects on night of 24 February 1952. Based on performance deduced from the reported information, object appears to be a subsonic surface-to-air guided missile, possibly of the German Schmetterling type. Current estimates credit the Soviets with the capability of having an operational surface-to-air guided missile of this type now, although until this time there has been no intelligence on which to credit the Soviets with more than a capability of having some complete information of this sighting will be made upon receipt of complete information from FTAC.
