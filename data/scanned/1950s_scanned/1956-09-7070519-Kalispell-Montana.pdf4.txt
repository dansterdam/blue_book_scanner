II. RELIABILITY: Source is male, was at one time in an automobile accident, but did not sustain any major injuries. He was completely coherent and gave the information rationally. His description did not coincide with anything he believed to have been known at the time.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF PHENOMENON: Source was at his home, with his wife, looking out the window when he observed the object. This was approximately at 6:05 P.M. Sept. 26, 1956. The object was in sight for approximately 3 to 4 minutes. The object was round or oval in shape, hovering, and was a dull, metallic color. It appeared to be twice as large as a full moon above the horizon. There was no sound, but many beams of light were visible, seemingly "shooting in and out". These beams of light were approximately 25 to 30 feet in length, and changed color from white to green to amber. On several occasions, the object appeared to "spark up" very brightly. It then would gradually dim again. There was no trail or vapor associated with the object.

Though it had appeared to be hovering, the object finally ascended at a terrific speed, "like a bullet going straight up into the sky". There seemed to be no sound. The object was then lost to sight, the ascent appearing to be possibly 3 or 4 miles.
