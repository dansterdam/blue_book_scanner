Yorkhead State Police received a call from a Mr. Wallingford, Ky., 12 Sept. 59, at 0230 EST, on that date. He reported that he looked outside and saw a large, round object hovering at a low altitude. He said it looked like a plastic balloon, about the size of a Goodyear blimp, except it had a reddish light on top and bottom and it seemed to have a slight rocking motion. He said it remained in that position for about 15-20 minutes, then moved away at a high rate of speed. No sound but it left a blue ring of smoke which remained for 15 minutes. No reported damage. When object moved, a bluish flame observed. Yorkhead State Police investigated and reported it to Indianapolis ARTC.
