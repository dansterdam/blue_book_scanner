AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
COUNTRY: JAPAN
IT 1R-U/AG-10
ID NO. 1414305
DATE OF INFORMATION: 5 MAY 1950
DATE OF REPORT: 27 APRIL 1950
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object
SUMMARY: On 27 April 1950 at 1330 hours an unidentified aerial object was observed over Camp Haugen at 25,000 ft. A pilot who was scheduled to fly observer for the element was unable to take off due to mechanical failure. The object appeared to be traveling at 550-600 mph and was observed for 10-15 minutes before it disappeared.
1. The T-33 aircraft was at 25,000 ft. orbiting to the left, indicating 323 mph. The unidentified aerial object was observed at the same altitude approaching from the east. When it reached a position ten (10) miles west of the aircraft, the pilot was able to obtain a good visual on the object. The pilot states that the aerial object was first sighted at 1445 and was observed for 10-15 minutes before it disappeared from sight. The object appeared quite large in size and the pilot could not positively identify it as a 7th Fighter Bomber Squadron aircraft by the color or the aircraft's markings. The object appeared to be travelling a great deal faster than his own aircraft.
2. There was no evidence of exhaust and there appeared to be no apparent means of propulsion. The object seemed to be gliding and it was observed against clear sky. The object seemed to be flying at 275 to 300 mph.
3. The pilot could not believe what he had witnessed and was convinced that he was not seeing his element leader. The pilot's up-wind was erratic and there was no other indication which would indicate the pilot was hallucinating.
4. The pilot appeared to be conservative in his statements and preferred to "think out" the matter rather than give any impression resolved, was that whatever the object was, it impressed him as not being of this world.
