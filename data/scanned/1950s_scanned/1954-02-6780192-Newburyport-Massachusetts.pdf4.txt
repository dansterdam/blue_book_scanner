Text from the document:

To whom it may concern:

While walking thru the Newburyport High School yard in Newburyport, Mass. I observed an object at a considerable height, this object appeared circular in shape and seemed to be glowing. This object was moving in a straight line, the a zig zag manner, the a straight line. It disappeared from sight after the lapse of approximately 15 seconds. This object is in a position to be seen from 82* south of east and at an angle of 15 degrees with the horizon. The object was observed to move from east to west, approximately due south. I watched the object for the entire period of time while it was visible.

Andover, Mass.
