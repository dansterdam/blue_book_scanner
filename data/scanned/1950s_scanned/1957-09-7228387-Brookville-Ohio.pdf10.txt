The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. 

The text from the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

[The first sketch shows a curved line representing the skyline, with instructions to mark points A and B to indicate the height of the object above the horizon when it was first and last seen.]

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

[The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with instructions to mark points A and B to indicate the position of the object when it was first and last seen.]
