(NEAR EDWARDS A.F.B.) REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT (S)
MUROC AREA - 1954-11-6960613

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION:
1. Submitted herewith is a summary of information obtained from the source indicated below regarding unidentified aerial objects observed in the Muroc, California area in November 1954.
2. The source, a reliable employee of the U.S. Air Force, stated that on 6 November 1954, at approximately 1600 hours, he and several other U.S. Air Force personnel observed a bright, shiny, disc-shaped object maneuvering rapidly at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet above the Muroc Air Force Base area. The object was observed for approximately 5 to 10 minutes as it traveled in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to have a metallic surface and was estimated to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter. No trails, exhaust, or other visible means of propulsion were seen.
3. The source further stated that, after the object had traveled a distance of approximately 15 miles, it appeared to accelerate to even greater speed and climbed out of sight in a steep angle. He emphasized that the performance of the object was far in advance of any known type of aircraft. The source impressed the investigating officer as being completely reliable and his report is considered to be an accurate account of the incident.
