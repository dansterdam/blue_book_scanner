CHAPTER III

The Orbit and Variable Acceleration of Satellite 1958 Alpha

1. The Orbital Parameters
There is no need at present to alter significantly the orbital elements of Satellite 1958 Alpha as published in the Harvard Announcement Card 14&4. It should be noted that the value of Ks is empirical and is derived from it using the theoretical ratio.

2. The Variable Acceleration
During launching, the final stages of 1958 Alpha were given a spin about the body axis. This spin has been expected to stabilize the body axis parallel to the velocity of the rocket at burnout. 

However, such an orientation was soon discovered to be incorrect with consequential data on the variable acceleration. As Lundin of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency informed the writer, the original accelerometer measurements of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, indicate this period is consistent with the suggestion that a slight dissipation of energy and near-conservation of angular momentum very rapidly followed upon the initial buildup. This period is considered to be about the axis of rotation. The rocket now rotates about this axis of greatest moment of inertia, its angular momentum having been essentially unaltered.
