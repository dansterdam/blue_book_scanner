U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)

IT WAS 5:15 PM, DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME, OCT. 15TH, 1956, NEAR NEWBURGH, NEW YORK.

SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS OBSERVED A VERY BRIGHT OBJECT ABOUT THE SIZE OF A CAR, HOVERING ABOUT 2000 FT. ABOVE GROUND, 
WHICH SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND OUT OF SIGHT IN ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE SPEED.

IT WAS A PURE WHITE LIGHT, SEEMINGLY LARGER THAN A STAR, WHICH APPEARED TO BE OVAL IN SHAPE AND HAD NO EXHAUST OR FLAME. 

THE WITNESS, WHO WAS IN A PARKED CAR, STATED HE WAS WATCHING TELEVISION IN HIS CAR WHEN HE NOTICED THE OBJECT THROUGH 
THE WINDSHIELD. HE CALLED HIS WIFE TO LOOK AND THEY BOTH WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

THE WITNESS SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE, AND THAT IT WAS UNLIKE ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.
