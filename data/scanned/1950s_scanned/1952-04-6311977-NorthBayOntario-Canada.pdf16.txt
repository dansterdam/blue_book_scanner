RCAF Personnel
See Flying Discs
Near North Bay
North Bay, April 16. â€” In the wake of persistent reports in the Nipissing area during the past few days that unidentified objects were to be seen in the sky here today cleared two RCAF officers who had observed the phenomena. 
The air force said that although there was no official RCAF view, there was no reason to doubt their activities.
Fit. Sgt. R.C.C. McRae, said that last Saturday he and Cpl. D.F.H. Lilly, members of the No. 6 Repair Depot, RCAF, North Bay Air Station, to the west observed the objects. They had reported 15 of the disk-shaped objects hovering for some time and then suddenly shoot straight up at a terrific speed.
"They seemed to be aluminum in color, but because of their speed, and the distance at which it had come, and at which we were observing them, we could not determine their exact size,' said McRae.
"They appeared at first as small spots high in the sky and then increased in size as they approached us at a fairly high rate of speed. For a few minutes they hovered and then suddenly shot straight up at a speed I would estimate to be about 1,000 miles per hour. There was no sound.
"We watched the objects with keen interest for several minutes and they were easily visible to the naked eye." 
McRae said that the objects traveled at a high rate of speed and displayed no outward sign of propulsion. "There was no sound," he said.
Expansion, I don't know what it is"
McRae said reports have been sent to the proper RCAF authorities.
