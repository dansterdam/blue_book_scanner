"UNCLASSIFIED
15 May 1952

I, Mrs. [redacted], Albuquerque, New Mexico, do hereby wish to make the following statement:

On the 15th of May 1952, at about 1900, I was in my front yard watching two jet type airplanes flying over Kirtland Air Force Base. Suddenly, I noticed that the airplanes had an object they appeared to be chasing. I called my husband, who was in the house at that time, to come out, as I saw something that did not look like an airplane. The object was traveling at a terrific rate of speed, approximately 10,000 feet, and had no tail and seemed to be a circular shaped. The object was a reddish in color and was about the size of a B-29 at 25,000 feet. The object appeared at times to flip over and disappear. My husband and I watched this object for about ten (10) or fifteen (15) minutes. Shortly thereafter, another object appeared in the same vicinity. It was about the size of a B-29 and had a solid appearance. This object remained in the same position for about twenty (20) minutes. It appeared to just hover in the same spot. When my husband saw this second object, he called the Controller of the 602nd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Kirtland Air Force Base. However, the officer on duty reported that the object did not appear on the scope. This second object disappeared in the northeasterly direction.

                                                       Mrs. [redacted]
                                                       Albuquerque, New Mexico

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 13th day of May 1952.
