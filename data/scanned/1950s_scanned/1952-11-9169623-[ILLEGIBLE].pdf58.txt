USMC, Res. Air Force to accompany 8 mm film of unidentified aerial objects, taken near Landrum, S.C., Nov. 16, 1952.

Dear Bob:
As I promised to write you about the flying saucers we saw a couple of weeks ago, I am finally getting around to it. As you know, we were returning to the Eastover, S.C. area when this happened. It was about 6:15 p.m. when I happened to look out and saw what appeared at first to be a plane. However, the more I watched it, the more I became convinced that it was not a plane, but some kind of flying saucer. (I took some pictures.) I immediately called the Lincoln Army Airbase and told them what I had seen. They said they would send a crew out to investigate.

When I first observed them they were strung across the western horizon in this fashion:

They did, however, show definite north to south movement. At times they hovered in one spot, then suddenly darted off, only to return to the same general area. The movement was quite erratic and so fast at times as to be almost unbelievable. Some times the objects would suddenly speed up and some times they would absolutely stop and hang motionless for a few seconds.
