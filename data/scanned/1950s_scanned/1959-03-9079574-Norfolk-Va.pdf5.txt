To whom this may concern:
I am enclosing a letter from my friend Mrs. ****** and one from her son who were with me when the object in question was sighted in our locality. It is this letter I would like to establish a few pertinent facts about myself because I realize such a report could be taken lightly. It is my sincere wish that our observations of this object will be believed to be a true one. I am old enough to have lived in Norfolk for over 30 years and for many years near the vicinity of the Naval Air Base. I am familiar with the planes and jets that are stationed there. For nearly four years I have lived at my present address which is near the Little Creek Amphibious Base and the Norfolk municipal Airport. I am familiar with all the searchlights and aircraft landing lights in this area. I have never seen any such object or light in our locality before this.
Also, I would like to make it quite clear that my eyes are trained for color, lines and proportions as well as perspective as these are subjects I teach daily under the Art Institute in Norfolk. I have also taught in the public school system and the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences.
After seeing this phenomenon it was so impressed on my mind as to its proportions, color and distance that I went to my studio the following morning and made a large pastel picture of it in full color. Those who saw it said it was frightening. 
I have been very active in the Art circles in this city for 10 years and feel that my knowledge of Art has been invaluable to me during this experience.
Sincerely hoping that you will give our report and letters your immediate attention and cooperation, I remain.

Norfolk, Va.
