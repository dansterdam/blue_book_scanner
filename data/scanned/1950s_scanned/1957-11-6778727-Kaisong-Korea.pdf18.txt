Half Paper., Ralph E. - Sgt.- RE 4 50H 146, DMZ Company, Inc., Cavalry Div 1-10. 

Was on patrol main highway Dobo On 6 September at about 0200 - A. M. Standing on road on patrol just talking. Suddenly a bright light came from about 200 yards south. This light was stationary on road on patrol just talking. Actually it seemed to be standing still, making no motion. A white light streak about 10-12 inches long and 1/2 inch wide was seen by all of us. This light streak was traveling very fast from south to north and looked like a streak of white light. This light streak appeared to be traveling at an angle of from about 30 to 45 degrees from the horizontal. As it passed over us we ducked down because we thought it might hit us. PFC Hobbs and Prive Ware discussed the nature of getting considerable light. They still were unable to determine the cause. I waited about 2 minutes then the light changed slow to go back, repeating the same motion, this time from north to south.
