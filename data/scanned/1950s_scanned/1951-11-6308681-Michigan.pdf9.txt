ROUTING AND RECORD SHEET

MATERIEL COMMAND

Reference is made to a Project Grudge incident in southern Michigan on 21 November 1951, in which an unidentified object was sighted in widely separated locations.

In an attempt to obtain a more complete coverage of other possible sightings, it is proposed that additional matter be considered as possibly being related to (52) unidentified airborne objects.

Since this entails correspondence with newspapers about a subject that could possibly cause some inquiry from the newspapers, it is requested that handling of the letters and contents be considered upon.

The PIO of AMC will also be requested to concur on this proposal.
