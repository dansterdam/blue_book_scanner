SATSUMA, ALABAMA

On 17 August 1953 at 20:55 local time, I was standing near a highway. With my brother, we were looking for a little object in the sky. We saw a bright object in the sky. It was traveling parallel to the highway. It appeared to be a saucer-shaped object. The object seemed to be a brilliant white light. It was moving slowly and in a straight line. There was no sound associated with the object. It flew in a straight and level flight with the direction of the lighting being very sharp. I did not hear or see any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.
