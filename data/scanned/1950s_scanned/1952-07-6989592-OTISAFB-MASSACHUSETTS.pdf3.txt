Reference Emil 2:

After considerable detailed conversation with the pilot making the sighting the base weather officer was conferred with.

It is the opinion of the undersigned, the base (Otis AFB) weather officers, and (only) the reporting pilot, that the object sighted and reported as unidentified was a weather pilot balloon.

Further, it is the opinion of all three that the object (resolved as a pilot balloon) was most likely released from Westover AFB, Mass.

Because of this conclusion no further report was made on the object.
