The image does not contain any photograph, but rather an "AERONAUTICAL CHART SUPPLY" document with detailed information about civil chart supply, aeronautical chart requirements, and correction instructions. As an OCR system, I will now provide the full text found in the document:

AERONAUTICAL CHART SUPPLY

To insure that the airman has the latest information available, C-& W. World Aeronautical Charts are revised at six-month periods and the Alaskan World Aeronautical Charts are revised at twelve-month periods. The time for the next scheduled revision periods are shown on the faces of the respective aeronautical information.

CIVIL CHART SUPPLY

Authorized agents for the sale of aeronautical charts have been appointed at certain airports and principal cities through out the United States. The charts may also be obtained from the Director, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington 25, D. C.

1. Aeronautical charts, maps and publications distributed by the USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service are listed in the current edition of the USAF "Listing of Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications."
2. Requisitioning. 
a. Outside Continental United States: Requisitions are submitted through the supply channels designated by the Department of the Air Force.
(1) The user supply facilities are to submit requisitions for replenishment of stocks of aeronautical charts and maps prescribed by USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service.
b. Within Continental United States: Requisitions from USAF activities within Continental United States are to be submitted to the Commanding General, Air Materiel Command, Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, or as otherwise directed.
c. Requirements for special purpose maps and charts, other than those prescribed by USAF Aeronautical Chart and Information Service, are to bear the signature approval by endorsement of the Base or Station Operations Officer. Quantities of charts and maps requested are to be such as to ensure that stocks on hand at all times are not in excess.
3. Requirements for Special Purpose Maps and Charts.
a. Maps and charts for specialized purposes, and also those maps and charts published by other government agencies, which are not listed in the principal types of aeronautical charts in the current edition of the USAF "Listing of Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications," will be requisitioned from the appropriate agency as identified in regulations as to name or number, scale, projection and publisher.
b. Information regarding such procurement of certain aeronautical charts and maps may be obtained from the Director, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington 25, D. C.
4. Obsolete Charts.
Aeronautical charts rendered obsolete for air by a new edition, when not practicable to convert for con formity with new edition, are to be salvaged if feasible, or destroyed. Disposition by salvage or destruction is to be made in accordance with provisions of AFR 200-5.

CORRECTION INSTRUCTIONS

1. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is making every effort to furnish the user with accurate charts. The user will materially assist in this effort by promptly reporting corrections or amendments, omissions, deficiencies, relief and cultural features (roads, canals, power lines, etc.) on the face of the chart, on an overlay of the area, or under "Remarks" below. In reporting corrections, state whether in manuscript or printed notation.
a. Fold charts along regular fold lines, but with back out.
b. Make an extra fold along dotted line and staple at points as marked.
