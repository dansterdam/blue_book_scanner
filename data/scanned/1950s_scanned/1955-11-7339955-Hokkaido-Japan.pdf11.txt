AND WAS SOON WITH THE AID OF HIS RAY - THERE WERE NO CLOUD CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND ABOVE NEVER FOG MENTIONED CARE WAS TAKEN TO CLIMB AND THE VISIBILITY WAS EXCELLENT GOOD. THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED CAN BE LOCATED ON SOME OF SOME CHM ALTITUDE AT APPROXIMATELY 35,000 FEET AND ON HEADING OF APPROXIMATELY 290 DEGREES. IT APPEARED TO BE A CIRCULAR OR SPHERICAL OBJECT OF A SIZE THAT IN AN EARLY STAGE OF THE OBSERVATION THOUGHT THAT POSSIBILITY BY PUTTING MY HAND IN ORDER TO OBSCURE IT THAT THIS TWO SPECTRA CIRCLES WERE OBTAINED WITH THE HAND: I NEXT THOUGHT THAT THE GLOW MAY BE COMING FROM SOME SORT OF AN AIRCRAFT ON FIRE BUT THIS WAS ELIMINATED BY HAVING OBSERVATION OF THE AIRCRAFT CLOSE BY: THIS POSSIBILITY WAS ELIMINATED BY TURNING INTO THE DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT AND A HEADING OF SIX DEGREES WAS ESTABLISHED TO PLACE THE LIGHT DIRECTLY OUT IN FRONT OF ME. A FEW MINUTES HAD ELAPSED AND A SHARP TURN TO THE LEFT WAS EXECUTED; FOLLOWING THIS THERE WAS A REMARKABLE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT WITHIN TWO MINUTES, HAVING TRAVELED A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO MINUTES HAD ELAPSED SHORTLY AFTER THE TURN.

FAST CRM I.E. IN LESS THAN THIRTY SECONDS, MY LOCATION WAS WD 8585 AND THE ALTITUDE WAS APPROXIMATELY 35,000 FEET. DIMENSIONS OF MY OBSERVATION WERE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO APPRXIMIATE THE SIZE OF THE GLOW CRM SHOULD BEAR COLOR WAS EXCENTRIC WHILE BEING OF APPROXIMATE TWENTY MILES THIS WOULD MAKE THE DIAMETER OF THE SPHERE TO BE APPROXIMATELY THREE STATUTE MILES. THIS WOULD EXCEED EVEN THE LARGEST KNOWN DIAMETER OF THE GLOW THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE OBSERVATION THE CRM WAS A DEEP RED WITH AN ORANGE TINT. IT APPEARED THAT THE BRIGHTEST AND LONGEST DURATION OF THE LIGHT REACHED JUST PRIOR TO THE SHARP TURN. AN ELONGATED DARK OBJECT APPEARED HORIZONTALLY TO THE LEFT AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPHERE. THIS CLOSELY RESEMBLED A CLOUD FORMATION AND BLOCKED OUT APPROXIMATELY ONE-FIFTH OF THE SPHERE. I WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE IN ANY WAY WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF THIS INFORMATION COULD BE. AT THE TIME OF INCIDENT THE MOON WAS AT 151 DEGREES ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH - SINCE THIS WAS A SIGHTING OF SUCH STRANGE AND UNUSUAL PHENOMENA THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL RECORD OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS IN THIS AREA. UNQUOTE REQUEST ABOVE - EVALUATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
