There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report on optical phenomena. 

The text output is as follows:

OPTICAL PHENOMENA

GENERAL
This can cover a multitude of things.
Optical phenomena which have been reported as UFO's run from reflections on clouds and layers of ice crystals (sundogs) to the many types of mirages. No one set of optical phenomena can be set down as representation for the whole class.

There is no limit to the speed of optical phenomena. Reflections can travel from incredible speed, as in the case of a search-beacon or high clouds to start-hazy.

1. Shape: Generally round but can be elliptical or linear.
2. Size: Variable to large, luminous, etc.
3. Color: Generally yellow.  
4. Speed: Stationary to fantastic.
5. Formation: Any.
6. Trail: None.
7. Sound: None.
8. Course: Any.
9. Time in sight: Any.
10. Lighting conditions: Day and night.
11. Other: One of the standard types is the "sundogs". In this a large luminous halo is seen around the sun with one to four images of the sun placed along the halo circle at intervals of 90 degrees. Another report often has to do with a bright planet or even the moon shining through a light over-cast. Mirage reflections are said to come frequently when temperature inversions exist in the atmosphere.
