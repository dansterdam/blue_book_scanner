whether ATC would have had knowledge of high altitude operations performed by SAC. That again, 1948 figures are considered very promising by the RCAF, which you refer to as "Air Traffic Control."

The Aeronautical and United Air Line pilots, upon sighting the unknown objects, acted in accordance with standing ATC and/or Air Force operations to "report all sightings" and/or if there were any planes in the area. The knowledge of ATC landing operations also checked with ATC upon landing in Detroit, and he, too, received a negative reply. Their inquiries mainly were for the purpose of eliminating identical sightings, and if there were no planes in the air, their responsibility was investigated. The investigating UFOs, apparently did not even bother to check with ATC, and that prior to releasing their enormous publicity campaign, they did not interview Captain Killian in order to receive the passengers' or the ground observers' account of the sightings. Assuming there were operations being performed secretly, what damage could have resulted there. ATC could easily have replied that a secret mission was being conducted by the Air Force. Such an explanation would have dispelled all doubt in the public's mind. However the intelligence has openly placed Air Traffic Control in a compromising position.
