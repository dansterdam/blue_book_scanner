MEMORANDUM REPORT to Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

We were off the coast of Newfoundland about 2 hours on Flight 125 from Iceland on the 9th February 1951, when I went forward to find out if the pilots or crew would like any coffee, soup, or etc. When I entered the cockpit, the co-pilot, commander, and co-pilot called my attention to a light at about 2 o'clock and slightly lower than us. It looked like an ellipse of the moon and white in color. The light was about three-quarters of the total eclipse of the moon and seemed to be stationary. The distance this light seemed to be was at least 520 knots if not more. The distance the light seemed to be was very close to that time Mr. JONES came forward and I went aft with the passengers.
