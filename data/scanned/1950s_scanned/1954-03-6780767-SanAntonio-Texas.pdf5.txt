SAUCER MARGINALIA...A REVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT SIGHTINGS COLLECTED BY CRIFO
March 9, 1954, 3:57 A.M. Sighter: John H. Stewart of Cincinnati, Ohio. Object: Pilot's license; 6500 hours military flying.
While driving north on Paddock Road under a dark, moonless sky, Stewart observed a bright, steady light. It was moving slowly in a straight line and suddenly a reddish-orange light appeared beneath it which seemed to pulsate or "throb." The pulsating light disappeared after about seven or eight minutes over Cincinnati's General Electric plant.
Stewart said the object was at about 1,000 feet altitude, much like a large star in appearance, though the pulsating reddish-orange light beneath it made the object quite distinctive. He watched it for some time, estimating the sighting to have lasted nearly seven or eight minutes. Stewart estimated the speed of the object to have been "very slow," almost stationary, and said it appeared to be climbing slowly, almost vertically, as it moved away.
