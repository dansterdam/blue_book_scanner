AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det 2, 6004th AISS, APO 970 22-85 PAGE 4 of 4

With the F-94 following up to and passing 10,000 foot altitude until look-on was broken, a description of object: The radar set was on long range and therefore it was not possible to get any closer estimates of the size of the object. The object was like a point of light and therefore it was not possible to make any measurements of it. The object was never closer than 5000 yards and at long range the pip usually merging into the screen in a night target making the object difficult to lock on. 

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER: 
From the information obtained it would appear that the two objects might have a relationship to each other, although no pips or echoes of either could be obtained. The point of disappearance at the same time for both seems to indicate some sort of common movement. This sighting appears to substantiate earlier intelligence information concerning the radar tracking of unidentified flying objects in our general sector of operations.
