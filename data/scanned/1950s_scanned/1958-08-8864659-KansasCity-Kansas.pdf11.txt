U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

The handwritten text on the document reads:

"On about the 14th of July, 1958 a teletype message was received from the Kansas City, Kansas police department advising they had received several calls from citizens reporting a very large round luminous object hovering over the city. When an officer investigated, the object had disappeared. Later that same day, another teletype message was received from the same source advising that the object had reappeared and was observed by several other officers who judged its size to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. It was described as being brightly illuminated, round, and aluminum in color. As the officers approached the object, it began to ascend vertically at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. No other details were given in the messages. No photographs or sketches that could be used as evidence were obtained."
