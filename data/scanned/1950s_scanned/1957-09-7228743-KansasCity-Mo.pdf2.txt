Venus, Saturn Now Seen
Although the giant planet Saturn is becoming increasingly prominent in the evening 
sky, it is still retiring early from view. September will have a total eclipse of the 
sun, which will also attract much attention.

By JAMES STOKLEY

The planet Saturn, which is gradually becoming more prominent in the evening sky at 
this time of year, will be nearing the point of its greatest brilliancy late in September.

Saturn, known as the ringed planet because it is surrounded by a remarkable system of 
rings, is now readily visible in the evening sky. It is the most distant of the major 
planets which can be seen with the unaided eye, and at its brightest it ranks with the 
first magnitude stars.

At present, Saturn is rising in the east a few hours after sunset. It will be high in the 
southern sky during the middle of the night, and will set in the west shortly before 
sunrise.

The rings of Saturn, which give the planet its distinctive appearance, are now tilted 
some 26 degrees toward the earth. This angle will increase to 27 degrees by the 
time of Saturn's greatest brilliancy in late September.

September's Brightest Star

The planet Venus, which is now the morning star, will become the evening star in 
September, when it will be in its brightest phase of the year. At that time, it will be 
so brilliant that it will cast distinct shadows, and will be visible even in the daytime. 
This is true at the time of a new moon; at other times the moon's light will make 
Venus less conspicuous.

There are several other bright objects in the evening sky at this time, among them 
Jupiter and Arcturus. But the most brilliant of all will be Venus, shining with a steady 
light that can be easily recognized even by the casual observer.
