The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with a series of questions and instructions related to describing an unidentified object.

Text extracted from the document:

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or other which would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

I have no object probably the object could have looked like a light or the surrounding glow.
