On April 27, 1954, several PAA pilots saw and photographed similar objects over this area. (See the article "Flying Saucers" Comprise" by L. V. Stringfield, in FATE Magazine, May, 1955, p.39.)
And on March 25, 1957 - not three weeks after the report covered in this RP - a commercial pilot, Capt. H. G. Berkowitz, making a routine flight from New York to Miami, had a sighting and filed a report on the incident. 
(Note on sources: Besides the data secured directly from four of the witnesses, additional information on the March 9, 1952 sighting was gleaned from the Times-.3/29/11 & AP 3/28) from the files of journal-American, 3/3 (INS); and the same wire accounts. Our thanks go also to Bill Nash of PAA and Chris Panteges of Riddle Airlines for their valuable assistance.)
