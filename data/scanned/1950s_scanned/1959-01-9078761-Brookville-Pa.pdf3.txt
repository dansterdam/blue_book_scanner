BALL OF FIRE ZIPS ACROSS INDIANA SKY

A bright, flaming object described as a "ball of fire" was observed in the Indiana sky about 8:15 p.m. yesterday, Wednesday, according to reports received here from Danville, an observer town in the control tower at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

Officials at Bunker Air Force Base said some of their personnel also observed the object, making it unlikely that the sighting was merely a mirage. Further, they said, its speed was such that it appeared to be travelling at 2,000 to 3,000 miles per hour.
