Mr. John Weitz
24-A Remington Rd.
Washington, D.C.

Dear Congressman Weitz,

On July 24, 1955, a civilian aircraft reported that it had seen an unidentified flying object near Kings Landing, California. It appears that you were informed that I have given some detailed information regarding this sighting to the Air Force.

However, in this correspondence, I shall refer only to the similarity of X" to similar reports that you have certainly received. On July 24, 1955, near Knights Landing, California, a private aircraft "X" was being flown at about 5000 feet when the pilot and two passengers observed a strange aircraft "X" which approached rather rapidly and then took a position off the starboard wing of the private aircraft at a distance of about 3000 feet. The pilot estimated the speed of the strange aircraft "X" to be between 500-800 mph. The strange aircraft appeared to be disc-shaped and about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. After observing the strange aircraft "X" for several minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The pilot and two passengers were extremely concerned about this incident and felt that they had encountered a genuine unidentified flying object.

I have forwarded all the details of this sighting to the Air Force and understand that they are thoroughly investigating this matter. I shall be pleased to provide you with any additional information that may be available.

Sincerely yours,
