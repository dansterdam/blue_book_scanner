The text in the document reads as follows:

"The space man related that as a sonic advertisement, showing some strange daring all sorts of stunts to be minselling new cars. Between the lines of fright on the beach, I sensed the space man by the way pointed the stick. He also said "see to it to be the first to carry" that the space man laughed like am eight year old said over and over it. He also said it was the first time that the strange thing happened to him before. I told him that the contents of attention wouldn't allow this to be possible. Strangely he told many things which I will gladly relate to you as you cannot write me, or in writing to [Redacted].

Montain View Farm, Massachusetts is the sole destination of our meeting. The fact that we hadn't discussed the necessity if you would it should be must be that way. The space men trusted with of us to keep secrets in it will take courage to write this letter to you Mr. [Redacted] as I hope yours will wipe away the matter lightly.

I am sincerely yours,
[Redacted]"
