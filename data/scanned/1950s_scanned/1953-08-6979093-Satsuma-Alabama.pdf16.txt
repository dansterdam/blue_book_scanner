July 31, 1953, at approximately 2000-2030 hours local time, Mr. Edward C. Ruppelt, former Chief of the Project BLUE BOOK, was on his way home from work. As he neared his home, he noticed the flying objects. He estimated the objects were about 30-40 feet in diameter and were metallic in appearance. The objects were flying in a circular pattern and then suddenly changed direction. The objects were observed for about 2-3 minutes. The objects were fairly high in the sky and were moving at a fairly high rate of speed. The objects were described as discs and were shiny in appearance. They were associated with a glow and did not resemble any known aircraft. The weather was clear, and visibility was good. The object was located to the northwest of Dayton, Ohio, traveling in a general southwest direction at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet.
On 2 August 1953 at 2230 hours local time, another sighting was reported from Satsuma, Alabama. The witness reported seeing a reddish orange colored light which seemed to come from a flying object at a high altitude. The object made an abrupt change in course, and the witness then lost sight of the object.
On 3 August 1953 at 1530-1710 hours local time, Mr. William Rhodes was sighted by a female witness. The witness reported seeing a metallic object which changed color from white to bright orange and then to a reddish color as it changed altitude and direction. The object appeared to be spinning and then remained stationary. It was observed for about 15-20 minutes.
