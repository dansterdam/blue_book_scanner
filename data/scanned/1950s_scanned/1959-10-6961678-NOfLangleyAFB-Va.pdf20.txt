Intelligence Officer 
Langley Air Force Base 
Virginia 

Dear Sir:

On October 19, 1959, we received your letter in subject "Air Intelligence Information Concerning an Aerial Sighting" and were requested to continue an official Air Force investigation of the sighting.

As of October 30, we had neither received any further information from you nor had we any other reports of this sighting to work on. It is therefore assumed that this matter has been concluded and no further investigation is required.

If, however, you desire that we continue our investigation of this sighting, please advise us and we will be glad to do so.

Sincerely yours,
