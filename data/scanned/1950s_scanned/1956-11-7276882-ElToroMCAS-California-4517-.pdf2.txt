REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS

1. At approximately 1920 hours on 7 November 1956, the ELTORO MC AS radar van operator reported to the tower that he had picked up several unidentified targets on his radar scope. These targets were flying at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet and at a speed of approximately 600 mph. The radar operator reported that the targets were being picked up on several scopes and that the scope presentations were typical of those received on airborne radar contacts.

2. The tower operators confirmed the radar reports and observed the scope presentations. They reported that the targets were traveling at high speed and exhibited radical changes in direction. The targets were observed for approximately 15 minutes.

3. Aircraft from ELTORO MC AS were scrambled to investigate the targets, but they were unable to make visual contact. The radar contact was lost after approximately 15 minutes.

4. This incident was reported to the 4517th AISS at ELTORO MC AS and a full investigation was initiated.
