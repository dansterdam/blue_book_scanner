The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left shows a person standing on a road with buildings and trees in the background. The smaller sketch on the right shows a silhouette of a person standing on a hillside with a horizon line in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon line. Then, draw a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
