On the evening of Sunday, Dec 14, 1958 I was taking photos of my family - - a night shot. About 8:55 p.m. as I was finishing exposing a frame, my attention was attracted to a bright light in the sky. I stopped taking pictures and watched the object. It appeared to be stationary at first, then began moving very slowly to the north. I called my wife and we both watched it for about a minute. It then picked up speed and took off at a very fast rate of speed, disappearing from sight. The object gave off a bright light, slightly reddish in color. It appeared round or oval in shape and about the size of a dinner plate at arm's length. There was no sound coming from the object. The night was clear and the stars were visible. The object moved without making any noise and seemed to move under its own power. I have had some experience taking night photos and this was definitely not any type of aircraft or known object I have ever seen before.
