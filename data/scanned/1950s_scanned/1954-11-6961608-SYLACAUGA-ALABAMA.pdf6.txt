AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: UNEXPLAINED INCIDENT AT SYLACAUGA, ALABAMA ON 30 NOV 54. 

LOCATION:  SYLACAUGA, ALABAMA

DATE/TIME: 30 NOVEMBER 1954, 1457 CST

SUMMARY: At approximately 1457 CST, 30 NOVEMBER 1954, a woman was struck on the left shoulder by a metallic object while working in her garden. The object is described as a dark gray metallic fragment approximately 8 to 10 inches long, 4 to 5 inches wide, and 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick. After striking the woman, the object was observed to skip across a road and come to rest about 40 feet from the point of impact. The woman was not seriously injured.

Examination of the object by the Anniston Ordnance Depot revealed that it was composed of a meteoric material weighing 8 pounds and 9 ounces. The outer surface was partially fused and the edges were sharp and jagged. The object contained several imbedded mineral and carbonaceous inclusions. 

The area over which the object traveled was thoroughly searched and no other fragments were found. The trajectory of the object indicated it entered the atmosphere at a shallow angle and impacted the ground at a point approximately 100 yards from the woman. Accurate astronomical data was obtained and a 180 degree parabolic curve was plotted from the point of impact to a point 6 miles distant which indicated an entry into the earth's atmosphere at an altitude of approximately 50 miles.
