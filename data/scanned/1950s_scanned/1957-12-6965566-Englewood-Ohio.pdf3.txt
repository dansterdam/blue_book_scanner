the file with Mr. and Mrs. — was quite surprised and happy when they were told about the contents of the original file in connection with the UFO incident in Englewood, Ohio, from the Air Force base. This file will soon be returned to the owners.

Mr. — is to be commended for his handling of this entire matter. His cooperation and interest in getting more information on this sighting were most helpful. The quality of the file is excellent and the photography was well done on a most difficult subject.
