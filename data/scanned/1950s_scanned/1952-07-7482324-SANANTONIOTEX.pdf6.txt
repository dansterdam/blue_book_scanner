STATEMENT

At approximately 0315 hours, Central Standard Time, 15 July 1952, I was in my garden conversing with my neighbor. This object, when I observed it, appeared to be the same size as the dome of the transit tower. The object at first gave the impression of being a conventional aircraft, being round in shape and I didn't give much immediate thought as I continued my conversation with him.

Presently a jet aircraft flew over and I began looking for the jet plane. While looking for the jet plane I noticed that the object had risen to a position in the heavens to a point where it was difficult to determine whether the object had flown higher or had remained in a fixed position. I decided at this time to call another neighbor, Mrs. ------ to see the object. We watched it until it had traveled to a point of disappearance. At this time I entered the house to inform my daughter of the sighting. My daughter observed the object through eight-power binoculars and noticed that the object moved East a very short distance then remained motionless until it was almost at mid-night at which time it hovered for approximately twenty minutes, neither moving nor performing maneuvers.

The object then seemed to be no longer visible even with the binoculars.

The object appeared to be of metallic construction and emitted a light even with the binoculars.
