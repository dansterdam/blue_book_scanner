UFO SIGHTING, BOERNE, TEXAS
6 NOV 1957

I looked down the street in the dawn (lawn?) and I saw something that caught my eyes. I looked up and it was in between the chicken house and the tree in the picture. It wasn't very high, just up in the sky. It was sort of just hanging there like a balloon, only it wasn't moving at all. It was just light itself and it didn't move or anything. Then I ran in and I was hollering for Mother and everything. She was in the kitchen. Then I told her what I saw and I said "what is that?" Then she said she didn't know, but the kids were with her, and so I told her it wasn't nothing to be afraid of, but the kids were coming in with her, and she made a whole lot of noise. I took an old tin can and went to the kitchen to tell her, but she told me to go back and look again and it wasn't there.
Oh, it was shaped like an egg or something like that - I know that for sure. The object was about 200 feet away and it wasn't moving, that's all I can tell you about it. I don't know what it was.
I don't think it was anything to the house where I was living room to Mrs. Jamison's. The house hadn't moved and there the tree was. The tree was over it so it was pretty close to the house, I guess. That's the thing that was going in and out the dog out was yellow, no. It wasn't a yellowish - it was sort of an orange red color, something like my shirt. I mean, see like a Halloween skirt.
It was just there. The dog didn't bark or anything. It just in the room. I was just there and I thought it was supposed to be and I thought it was just a short thing. I started hollering for Mother and so it was there for about a minute and then it disappeared and I still didn't know what it was.
