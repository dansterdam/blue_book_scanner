fleeting glimpse I had of the top side, there possibly was a protruding something removable.
the coming toward me of a submarine. The speed with which things were happening and the
acceleration of lighting at this time of day make such an observation of little value.
after controlling the object 1659 at seconds, same as before, both transversely and pacing,
and at seconds 24 it had become completely invisible.
There was no sign of smoke or vapor emanating from the object, nor was there any sound,
but this could not be strictly determined because of the noise of oncoming traffic while
observation was in progress.

CONCLUSION:
For what they may be worth, the following conclusions are submitted:
1. The object was saucer-like in shape, appeared silver or white and illuminated from within.
2. Its speed was far in excess of anything seen here of a conventional nature and other 
characteristics of the object tend to bear out this high speed appearance.
3. The length of the sighting, from first to last glimpse, was from 11-12 and 31-32 seconds,
which was too short for any meaningful study unless the object was considerably smaller than
it appeared.
This factor indicates that the witness's estimate of its size may have been in error.
4. The fact that the object did not deviate on air for any distance or guidance indicates
that it was almost certainly controlled by an intelligence.
5. There are certain technical facts, in the witness's observation, that the fullness of the
description would tend to discount the probability of an hallucinatory experience.

In summary, this report contains some substantial information, but is admittedly inconclusive
as to a final determination of the nature or identity of the object observed.
