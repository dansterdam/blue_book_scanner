Upper Air winds during the day were from the southwest at quadrant, opposite to the movement of this object. Two pilots were noted observing this object, describing it as stationary for a long period, then making a very rapid maneuver. The object appeared to them to be moving in the direction of this object, but no one could state positively the direction or altitude of the object.

The estimated size of the object, the distance away and its estimated speed, as shown on this questionnaire, are all based on estimates considered to be the minimum altitude the object could have had. Calculated by its apparent size, the object could have been as much higher than 2,000 feet as 3,000 feet, and they did not see it pass the horizon. The sighting lasted only 5 minutes and then the object made a very rapid maneuver and they did not see it again. The apparent size of the object was small and the estimated altitude to be above 600 mph toward the southwest.
