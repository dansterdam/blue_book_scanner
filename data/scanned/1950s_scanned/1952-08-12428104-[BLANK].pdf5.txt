incident took place in Shreveport, Louisiana, in July 1947. The papers played the story big, and it was a two-day sensation. Mr. H------, of Shreveport, decided that he would stop by a used-car lot on his way home from work and try to find a bargain car. As he stood looking over the prospects he heard a loud whirring and looking up saw a bright, silvery disc, which appeared to him to be spitting fire and smoke. It dropped, with a crash, in the street. He rushed over, retrieved the object, then contacted Barksdale AFB.

The thing was crudely made and so obviously a hoax that Barksdale personnel were able to thank Mr. H------ and assure him that it was the work of a practical joker. The next day a very red-faced gentleman admitted that he was the maker of the saucer. He was employed by an electrical firm whose building was next door to the used-car lot. The saucer-maker had planned the episode as a joke to be played on his boss. He had launched the thing from the roof of the building and, true to plan, it had actually landed near his employer's car. The pay-off was that his boss paid no attention to it, but Mr. H------ did and the joke had misfired.
