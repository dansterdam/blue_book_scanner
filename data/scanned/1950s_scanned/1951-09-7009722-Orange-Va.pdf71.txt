Mystery Objects
Unusual lights and objects sighted in the sky have been reported from various parts of the country in recent days. Here are some of the latest reports:

Orange, Va. - Mrs. Sam Patteson, wife of a Rapiden merchant, reported that she and members of her family observed a strange object in the sky for about 10 minutes on the evening of Sept. 7. She said the object appeared to be circular in shape and gave off an intense white light which illuminated the entire countryside below. The object moved slowly at first, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view, she said.

Mrs. Patteson said her family was "very much frightened" by the strange sight. She added that when the object first appeared it was flying at a high altitude, but as it neared their home it dropped to an altitude of about 1,000 feet.

Other persons in the Orange area also reported seeing the strange light, according to Mrs. Patteson. 

Similar reports have come from other sections of Virginia and neighboring states in recent weeks. Air Force officials have said they are investigating the various sightings.
