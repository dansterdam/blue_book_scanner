The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document listing various government agencies and civilian organizations that the US Air Force utilizes for its Project Blue Book investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

B. Government Agencies
1. U.S. Weather Bureau
2. Civil Aeronautics Authority  
3. Atomic Energy Commission

C. Civilian Agencies
1. Scheduled Airlines
2. Public and Private Observatories (including Departments of Astronomy at Universities and Colleges)
3. American Astronomical Society
4. American Physical Society
5. Optical Society of America

To fully utilize consistence of all these agencies it is extremely desirable that the Air Force assure them that it is making efforts to identify these objects by collection in their analysis of technical information.

In the past, it has been desirable for ATIC to shield its scientists from identification with this Project in order that they might have the confidence of their professional associates. This is especially true of private organizations and ATIC plans to send out letters to them soliciting their help.
