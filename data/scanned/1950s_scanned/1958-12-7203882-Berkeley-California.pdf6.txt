The sighting and described event that gave rise to this submission occurred spontaneously and unexpectedly from the witness's own vantage point. The objects sighted and observed were a physical reality, clearly seen and described, and therefore constitute an actual happening rather than a figment of the imagination or wishful thinking.

As indicated in the report, three unidentified objects were observed in the sky for a period of approximately 30 to 45 seconds. The objects appeared to be guided or controlled and exhibited maneuverability beyond the performance capabilities of any known conventional aircraft. They were completely silent and appeared to be disc-shaped. Based on the distance from the witness and other factors, the diameter of each object was estimated to be approximately 50 to 60 feet.

The objects were observed to accelerate at a very high rate of speed and to abruptly change direction of flight, discounting the possibility of these being conventional aircraft, balloons, or other known phenomena. There was no observable trail or exhaust from the objects, and they appeared metallic in nature.

The witness, who is a trained observer with no known history of emotional instability or imaginative tendencies, is considered a credible and reliable source. An investigation was conducted, and the report was submitted to the Air Force authorities handling such matters.
