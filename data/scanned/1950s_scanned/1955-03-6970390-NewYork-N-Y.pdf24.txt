NARRATIVE: 
AT APPROXIMATELY 2030Z ON 26 MARCH 1955, LT. RICHARD L. GROMER WAS DRIVING HOME FROM MITCHEL AFB, N.Y. WHEN HE OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SOUTHEASTERN SKY APPROXIMATELY 30 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. LT. GROMER STOPPED HIS CAR AND OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 SECONDS. HE DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS A BRIGHT YELLOWISH-WHITE LIGHT, LARGER THAN A STAR AND WITHOUT APPRECIABLE CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS DURING THE OBSERVATION.
AFTER 20 SECONDS, THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW, APPARENTLY MOVING OUT OF SIGHT RATHER THAN BLINKING OUT. LT. GROMER CONTINUED HIS DRIVE HOME AND REPORTED HIS OBSERVATION TO THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICE AT MITCHEL AFB UPON ARRIVAL.
WEATHER: CLEAR SKIES, VISIBILITY 15 MILES.
EVALUATOR'S COMMENTS:
THIS REPORT IS CONSIDERED CREDIBLE, AS THE OBSERVER IS A TRAINED OBSERVER OF AIRCRAFT AND ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA. THE OBJECT DISPLAYED CHARACTERISTICS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE REPORTED FOR UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, SUCH AS HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARANCE FROM VIEW WITHOUT DIMINISHING IN BRIGHTNESS. THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE FAVORABLE FOR VISUAL OBSERVATION. THEREFORE, THIS REPORT IS EVALUATED AS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
