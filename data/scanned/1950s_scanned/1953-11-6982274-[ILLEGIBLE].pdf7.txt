VIRGINIA FIREBALL OF 1953 NOVEMBER 3
RADAR NO. 2252

As per RAGLAND and C. S. CARVIN

This date, November 3, 1953 (FST), a report on visual observations of a brilliantly luminous object was made by several persons in or near Richmond, Va. It appeared suddenly at an estimated altitude of about 30,000 feet and was observed for about 6 to 7 seconds. It was seen from several different locations by observers in different general directions, and one witness from another location (D. F. Wood at Arlington) also reported observing it. Owing to the violent and rapid motion, and the brief duration, range of the object, the observations could not be correlated to determine very accurate data.
Some of the more definite data gathered is as follows:

Time of observation			--	6:12 1/2 p.m. EST
Distance 				--	113*
Bearing 				--	A = 278° 45', e = 36° 35' at 110 km
Projected length of path		--	1-2 km
Altitude of first sighting		--	ca 30,000 ft
Zenith angle (elevation)		--	54°, h = 9°
Radiant correction parabolic		--	d=156°, h=6°

On this same date at 6:18 p.m. EST, a visual observation from a slightly different direction was made at Arlington, Va. by D. F. Wood. This observation could not be coincident with the previous observation from Richmond, and may be added as a separate incident in our records.
