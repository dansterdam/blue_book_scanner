5 February 1959

Dear Mr. _____,

Your report of an unidentified flying object and a negative received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center on 23 January 1959.

The negative and receipt are returned herewith.

The report contained insufficient data to arrive at a valid evaluation. It also contained a serious contradiction which precludes definitive analysis and/or evaluation of this sighting.

You state in the report that you did not see the object until the film had been developed. The exposure for this film was only one-fifteenth of a second, yet you say the object was visible. This difference in time interval renders this sighting valueless.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
