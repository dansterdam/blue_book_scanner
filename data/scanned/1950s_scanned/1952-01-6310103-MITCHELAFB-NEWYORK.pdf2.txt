it appeared to be going cross-wind. He deduced this since he knew which way he had taken off from Mitchel. (The Navy has some c/c based at Mitchel.)

The pilot could not add any great amount of detail to his original report except that:

a. He was positive that while he was north of the airfield that he could still see the object.
 
b. At one time, between 2 and 3 (positions of the a/c) on the chart in the Form 112, he had to break-off the TE to keep the object from going out of sight under the wing.

c. He was not sure of his ground track. He readily admitted that he was concentrating on the object and could only give an approximate track.

d. He did not see the object at Position "6", he established that track by lining his a/c up with the point of land. He was in the line of sight of the object when he last saw it.

e. The size of the object did not change to any great extent meaning that the pilot was always about the same distance from the object.

f. The object did not gradually fade away in the distance, it just disappeared.
