35. When did you report to some official that you had seen the object?
Dec. 23, 1954 Sgt. Smith

36. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? A dear friend 

36.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object?
(Circle One) Yes No

36.2 Please list their names and addresses. Redacted

37. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this? 
(Circle One) No

37.1 If you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?
Approx. 6 months earlier in same general area, hovering low over trees, silent, maneuvered rapidly and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared.

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
These objects are probably mechanical in nature, either remote controlled or possibly piloted by some intelligence. My only explanation is that they are of extraterrestrial origin and their activities may be connected to some scientific research or activity on the part of others, perhaps based on advanced technology far beyond our own.
