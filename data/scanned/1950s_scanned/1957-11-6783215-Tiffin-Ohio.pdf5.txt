The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet with handwritten text describing a "Convincing falling object".

The text of the document is as follows:

Convincing falling effect - mild in color - seen for 30 seconds, while descending south, erratic movment, zigzagging at end. Returned to earth, no cloud or object visible. That indicates that significant paramedical effect noted and reported in this earlier, by varying observers, may be on that be taken only as commutated with their observerances.
