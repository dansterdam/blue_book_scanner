HOW I HAVE KEPT QUIET ABOUT IT ALL THIS TIME, BUT WE MUST WRITE AND TELL YOU ABOUT IT: THE SIGNED

The report discusses editorials from a New Orleans newspaper on 17 October 1950 concerning sightings of "foo fighters". It mentions the Air Force's hesitation to call these sightings "Unidentified Flying Objects" and a desire to avoid speculation about the nature of the sightings. The report indicates that no action is being contemplated by the headquarters at this time.

The document is stamped "UNCLASSIFIED" and includes a handwritten signature at the bottom.
