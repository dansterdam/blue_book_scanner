Major Lawrence J. Tacker,

Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker,

Thank you for your letter of July 24th, which provided me with further information on the U.F.O. investigation.

I would appreciate it if you would send us any available information concerning the sighting of the U.F.O. which was reported in the release of July 19, 1959 as being sighted over Louisville, Kentucky, both cases of which were submitted to ATIC.

Can you tell me if any of the still or motion-picture film obtained for these sightings has been forwarded to ATIC for analysis? Also, would you kindly advise me if any photographs taken by Mr. John Coyne for these sightings have been received at ATIC.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
