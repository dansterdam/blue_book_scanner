I would state that at about 9:38 pm on 3 August 1952 while I was in the front of my house on Port Street in front of a picture window adjusting the vacuum cleaner, I suddenly observed a bright light coming from a southerly direction. All of a sudden the "flying saucer" appeared from the horizon. It appeared that it was spinning clockwise causing a continuous blinking-white sparks from a white circle about two feet wide. I was looking at it from about a quarter of a mile, the same distance as the moon. As I waved to get my wife's attention, the object, higher than the moon, began to move faster than the moon. I did not want to get out the car and lose it or miss some of it. I was so stunned that I couldn't get the car anyhow. The sky was hazy in that section of the sky which prevented any further detection; there was a full moon. The object traveled at a very high rate of speed in a southerly direction. I could still see the object. It took every precaution to make sure that I wasn't seeing things. The object appeared to be about 2 yards in diameter and I could still see the object. There was a trail of a sparks from an emery wheel, spinning very fast. As an emery wheel the sparks came off in one spot, but this object had sparks all around it. The object did not leave any trail behind. Within the circle of the object there was a glow. The object disappeared so fast that I couldn't tell if there was anything like it before. The object I saw was traveling about 100 MPH.
