GIST OF REPORT: Newspaper and published articles concerning UFO's are, in most cases, only of general interest to ATIC. They are not used as a basis for originating case citations, they merely augment information that has been previously received.

For ATIC purposes, the clipping itself or a brief summary of UFO articles which appear to be significant will suffice.
