MARS NEAR AND BRIGHT
The red planet Mars will come closest to the earth in November. This will be its closest approach until 1971. It is in the constellation of Aquarius and will be visible throughout the night.

The planet Mars is now over 150 million miles from the earth. On Nov. 16 it will be only about 35 million miles away, its closest to the earth since 1941. It is in the constellation of Aquarius, and will be visible throughout the night, rising soon after sunset.

According to the accompanying map, Mars will shine very brightly in the southwest during the early evening hours, and will reach its highest point in the sky around midnight. It will appear much brighter than any of the stars, and will be easily visible to the naked eye.

The best time to observe Mars during this period will be on Nov. 16 and 17. This is when the planet will be closest to the earth and will appear largest through a telescope. After this date, Mars will gradually become more distant and less bright.

The map also shows the positions and relative brightness of various stars in the night sky. Symbols are used to indicate the order of brightness of the stars, with the brightest stars marked with the letter "A".
