"'Flying Saucer' Sightings Still Get Air Force Study
By Ralph Chapman
The Air Force is continuing to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects according to information received from the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency...
In the above newspaper article the Air Force attempts to confirm their explanations by discrediting the individuals that report the sightings. They are well acquainted with rules for controlling airline pilots from drinking before flights..."'

HOW ROUTINE IS ROUTINE?
"Basically, the sightings of UFO's by the general public have become routine to the extent that the investigators don't even bother to check most of them. They consider such sightings unimportant. As far as is known, none of these people were at any time suspected by ATIC. The allegation made by the Air Force spokesman about the unsubstantial non-military opportunists who are "making a good thing of it" and who insist that interplanetary travel is possible, is completely unfounded."
