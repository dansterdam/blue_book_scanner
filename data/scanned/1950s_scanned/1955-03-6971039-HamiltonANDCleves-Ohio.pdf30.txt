The image contains three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon line. The second sketch shows a road or path with buildings and trees on the sides. The third sketch shows a triangular or wedge-shaped object in the sky.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Then place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
