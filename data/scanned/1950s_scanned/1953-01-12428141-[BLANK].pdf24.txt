PROJECT BLUE BOOK BRIEFING FOR AIR DEFENSE COMMAND

This briefing has been prepared specially for Air Defense Command units. 

Its purpose is to present all aspects of Project Blue Book so ADC personnel will have a better understanding of the goals of the project, be able to more accurately evaluate reports of unidentified flying objects, and increase the quality of those reports.

We don't take "flying saucers" too seriously either, but we do take the problem of Unidentified Flying Objects seriously. The definition of an Unidentified Flying Object is any airborne object that by performance, aerodynamic characteristics or unusual features does not conform to any presently known type of aircraft or missile, or which cannot be identified as a known object or phenomenon.

The mission of the Air Defense Command is such that you are in a position to be recipients of the best reports of Unidentified Flying Objects. For that reason this briefing is being presented today. Three main points will be covered in this briefing:

a. The general aspects of Project Blue Book to clear up any misconceptions that anyone may have.
