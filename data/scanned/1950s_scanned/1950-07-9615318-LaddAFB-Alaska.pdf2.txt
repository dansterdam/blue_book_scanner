ON 22 July 1950, at 1710 hours (Alaska time) an unidentified object was sighted over Ladd Air Force Base, Fairbanks, Alaska. The object was described as bright white in color, a circular shape and quite large.

- Object was viewed laterally from gun positions at an angle of from 50 to 70 degrees.
- Object was red in color with two (2) white dots underneath which seemed to revolve around it. It was round in shape, about three (3) feet in diameter and of unknown configuration.
- Object moved from East to West at an unknown rate of speed. It appeared to be moving in a straight line and steadily descending.
- Any exhaust emitted from the object evaporated very rapidly. The two (2) white dots appeared to be approximately vertical dimensions above and beneath the main body of the object. The white dots appeared to go through motions suggestive of antennae or irregular surface protuberances.
- After about 20 minutes, the object had been almost stationary for approximately twenty (20) minutes, it disappeared in a diagonal direction.
The following persons on active duty with United States Armed Forces at Ladd Air Force Base observed the object: Ist Lt. USA, USAF and several unidentified soldiers of a battery fire control crew.
