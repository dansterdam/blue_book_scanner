Pleasant Hill, Calif. 
October 9, 1958

Oakland Airport
Oakland, California

Gentlemen:

I would like to call to your attention an object of interest which was noted in the sky at 9:20 P.M. and to have received are other reports about it.

The object itself appeared as a hazy bar of light, perhaps a description better than in the middle, correct to some degree of brilliance. 

The object appeared in the west, passed rapidly across the sky to 20 to 40 degrees south of the zenith, executing a couple turns, and vanished into the northeast. At that time, an airplane headed southwest from the direction of Oakland to Travis. 

For a few seconds, both plane and object were visible to me, and the change was such that I hastened to the Oakland Airport, that they have seen it.

The duration of the object's appearance could hardly have exceeded 15 seconds. From the rapidity with which its size and brightness changed, as it moved, it seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. It moved much too fast to be heard until the appearance of the above-mentioned plane.

The size of the object, its hazy, steady light, its ability to execute sharp turns and lack of luminous train clearly indicate it was not a meteor, several of which I also saw last night.

I would much appreciate any information you can give me on the nature and sightings of this object. I realize your department may not handle such matters, but would appreciate your bringing this letter to the attention of the proper authorities.

Yours very truly,
[Signature]
