POLICE SPOT SAUCER
Los Angeles, Calif. 1 December 1959 - While on regular patrol, Officer W. H. Chesnover of the Fontana Police Department observed a large, round object which was hovering and emitting a periodic flashing light from the area of Almond Grove, Fontana, California, at 9:32 p.m.

Officer Chesnover watched the object for approximately 20 minutes, during which time it performed several maneuvers, including a rapid ascent, a descent, and hovering at various altitudes. The object appeared to be illuminated and was observed to be approximately 30 feet in diameter. It finally disappeared in the distance.

A few minutes after Officer Chesnover lost sight of the object, two other officers of the Fontana Police Department, Officers A. E. Duran and J. E. Daniels, also observed the object for a short period of time before it disappeared. Officer Chesnover reported the incident to his superiors and was instructed to submit a written report on the matter. The report was forwarded to the United States Air Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for further investigation.
