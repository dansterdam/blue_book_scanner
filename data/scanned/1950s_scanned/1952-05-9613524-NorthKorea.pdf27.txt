AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM  111-23-52
APRIL OFFICE, D/F REAR
12. Extracted from USAF "Interim" #717, dtd 0520/z, 13 June 1952:
Enemy balloons: Recently several reports have been received concerning the sighting of enemy balloons at various locations, a typical observation being that a balloon was observed at an altitude estimated between 1,000 ft. and 10,000 feet. Additional observations were made on 10 May and on 1, 6, and 7 June between the hours of 2102/t and 2100/t. In each case the balloon was reported as being egg-shaped, with a basket and a flag. In one case it was reported to have moved vertically, but the operator reported that he could not traverse fast enough to keep on target. This object was observed for about 1 hours by a trained Air Technical Intelligence specialist and an ordnance technical intelligence specialist. (Command Letter 26 June) and saw a balloon being raised and lowered on a cable. This might account for some of the previous sightings but definite conclusions have not been reached. The purpose of raising and lowering the balloons could not be accounted for by a free balloon caught in a horizontal draft in the mountainous areas of that sector. The purpose of raising and lowering a balloon so near the front lines is not apparent, but could possibly be a method of communication.
