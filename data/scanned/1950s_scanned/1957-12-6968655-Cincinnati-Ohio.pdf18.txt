Dear Mr. [Redacted],

We are in receipt of a piece of colored-motion picture approximately relating to an incident which occurred in your area. This picture was made available to us through a recent telephone conversation with Mr. Hiett of this Center.

We feel that you will agree that with any investigation or study, no analysis can be performed on such material without certain specific data are required such as location, date, description, circumstances, witnesses, movement and other factual information regarding the object and the circumstances under which your photographed it.

It would be appreciated if you would accomplish the attached official UFO questionnaire, in as much detail as possible, and return it to this center to permit us to proceed with a study of the incident. 

For purposes of examination, it is desirable that the complete reel be considered, inasmuch as it is difficult to determine the frames of value. We would appreciate the balance of the film. If this is not possible, a brief statement as to the circumstances to assist in determining the reason the object appeared in only four frames, as this represents only one-fourth of a second in time, normally a period in which it would almost impossible to raise the camera, find the object, center it and take an exposure, particularly against a night sky.

Your cooperation and reporting of this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
NICHOLAS POST
Assistant Deputy
