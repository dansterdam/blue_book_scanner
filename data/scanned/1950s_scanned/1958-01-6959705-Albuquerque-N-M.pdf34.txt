Constellations Shine
By JAMES STOKLEY
a writer specializing in astronomy
With new constellations shining in the evening sky, this is a good time to become familiar with the night skies. Many of the stars and constellations that will be prominent in the months to come are now visible.
One of the most interesting stars to watch at this time is Sirius, the dog star, which is the brightest star in the sky. It is easy to find, low in the southeast. About 15 degrees above Sirius and to the right is Orion, the hunter, which is unmistakable with its three stars in a row forming the hunter's belt.
To the right of Orion is Taurus, the bull, with the bright star Aldebaran marking the bull's eye. Farther up and to the right are the Pleiades, sometimes called the seven sisters, a beautiful little cluster of stars.
Mercury Rises Early
On Jan. 15 Mercury, which is the closest planet to the sun, will be at its greatest eastern elongation. This means it will be farthest from the sun in the evening sky, and therefore easiest to see. The best time to look for it will probably be about 5:30 p.m. EST, just above the southwest horizon.
The planet will appear as a fairly bright starlike object not far from the sun. After that date it will come closer to the sun again and be lost in the sun's glare.
The next astronomical events can be seen with the naked eye, or with binoculars or a telescope. These are the eclipses of the sun and moon.

Total Eclipse of the Sun
The total eclipse of the sun on Feb. 25 will be visible throughout most of North America, with the moon completely covering the sun for more than two minutes. This will be the last total eclipse of the sun visible in the United States until 1963.
