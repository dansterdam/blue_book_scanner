The image does not contain any photographs or images. It is a scanned page from a document that appears to be a report or memorandum related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

desire to embarrass the Air Force. A number of these private organizations have written directly to President Eisenhower, to General White, to the Secretary of Defense and to important members of the Legislative Branch of Congress, requesting or demanding hearings, briefings, or discussions with UFO project officials.

20. We have written detailed letters to Senator Knowland, Senator Byrd, Senator Case, and Representative Hoey, Representative Henderson, Telatopia, to name a few, regarding aspects of the UFO program, which have been brought to their attention by so-called "UFO specialists."

21. Although these UFO organizations include sincere, well-meaning members, our experience in discussions with sponsors of such organizations has shown that any Air Force explanations or statements are either totally unacceptable or are met, at the least, with calculated skepticism. Our explanations and statements are either misinterpreted, misquoted, exaggerated or used out of context, all to the detriment of the Air Force in general, and the ACS/I in particular. I think we would be more impressed by all this were it not so unprofitable.

22. A few words are necessary, I think, on the extent and character of the public participation in the UFO program. The subject has seized the public imagination and has been surrounded by considerable sensationalism and speculation.
