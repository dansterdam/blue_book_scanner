The object seen appeared to be cigar-shaped and luminous. It was slightly hazy or blurred in appearance. The object was first observed at approximately 10:30 PM, 6 May 1952, and was observed for approximately 30 minutes. It was at an estimated altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet and appeared to be traveling in a southeasterly direction.
