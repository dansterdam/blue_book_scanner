8 September 1959

Dear Mr.

This is in regard to your letter of 4 September concerning UFO sightings in the Chicago area.

As stated in my previous letter, neither of the sightings you refer to (Elmwood Park, Illinois and O'Hare Air Force Base) were reported to the Air Technical Intelligence Center. Since neither of these sightings were reported to ATIC, they must have been positively identified as familiar objects by the Commander of O'Hare Air Force Base when they were reported to that installation. This is in accordance with paragraph 9 of AFR 200-2.

In this case, it is not essential that the report be presented to ATIC. Suggest you contact the O'Hare Information Office with respect to these two sightings.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER Major, USAF
