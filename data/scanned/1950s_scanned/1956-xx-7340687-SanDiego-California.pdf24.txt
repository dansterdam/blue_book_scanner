IT HAD SWUNG AROUND- WAS DRAWING ABREAST ' PACING THEM AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YARDS* SOME DISTANCE AHEAD OF THE MONSTER IT CLEAVED.
ITS SHEER BULK WAS AMAZING! ITS DIAMETER WAS THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE CONSTELLATION SHAPE PATTERN LIT AT THE CENTER.
AS IT SLOWLY SWUNG AROUND AND UP THEY GOT A GOOD LOOK AT IT, THE GLOW ALONG THE RIM WAS BLURRED AND UNEVEN-WHETHER IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES OR SURFACE ACTIVITY THEY COULD NOT TELL ' BUT THE GLOW WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SHOW THE DISC'S CURVING SURFACE AND SUBTLE METALLIC REFLECTIONS. MATCHING SPEED AND DIRECTION AS THEY WERE BEING OBSERVED, FIGHTING AN IMPULSE TO DIVE AWAY, HE HELD TO A STRAIGHT COURSE. UPWARDS IT QUICKLY ACCELERATED AND WAS LOST AGAINST THE STARS.

"YOU SHOW ANY OTHER TRAFFIC IS OUT HERE"? HE ASKED THE TOWER. "BAND-SCANNING ON THIS SCOPE WAS NEGATIVE," YOU'D ANSWERED HIM - "BUT WE COULDN'T GET AN ANSWER."
"IT WAS NO AIRCRAFT," SAID GRIMLY - "IT WAS SOME OTHER INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FROM A HIGHER AUTHORITY. THE MAJORITY OPINION EMERGED, THE FLYING DISC WAS BETWEEN 350 AND 500 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND APPROXIMATELY NO INTERFERENCE WITH INSTRUMENTS OBSERVED. INSTRMENTS WERE OBSERVED AND RADIO IS NOT OPERATING DURING THIS BRIEF PERIOD, BETWEEN THE KNOWN START POINT AND TO THE REPORT, 2 MINUTES FROM ACCELERATION TO DISAPPEARANCE.
IT HAD ACCELERATED ABOVE THIS SPEED ON DEPARTURE. THECOMMAND HAD BLARED ON THE DISCOVERY OF LUMINOUS RINGS, SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD MOST WERE WATCHING THE HUGE DISC APPROACH AND DID NOT SEE THE RINGS. THEY APPARENTLY TOO WERE FLYING DISC IN A SECOND GROUP, AS SOME SUGGESTED, THEY APPARENTLY HAD RACED OFF WHILE THE OTHER ONE WAS CHECKING ON THE MILITARY COMMANDER BENEATH.
