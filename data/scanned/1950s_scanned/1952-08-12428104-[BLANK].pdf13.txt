The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page of text from an old UFO report document.

layer, especially if its power to divert light is increased by dust, may  
see below him the displaced image of the sun, the moon, or even a brightly
lighted cloud. The image may be distorted by waves in the inversion, and  
a whole formation of objects may then appear to be in rapid motion.  

Reflection and refraction theories as natural explanation of UAO  
reports are questioned by authorities like Dr. Ronald Ives, the Cornell  
geophysicist, who is an outstanding authority on mirages. Dr. Ives points  
out that the reflectivity of temperature disparities in the air is so  
slight that it reduces the intensity of the light source to a negligible  
degree -- far less bright than the brilliantly luminous objects that have  
been so frequently seen.  

Most UAOs can be explained with some degree of certitude. Dr. Menzel  
or someone else may have the answer to all, some, or none of the unexplained  
15%.
