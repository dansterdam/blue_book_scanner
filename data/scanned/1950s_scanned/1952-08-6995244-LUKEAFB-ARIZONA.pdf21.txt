2. The following report was made by Captain CLAUDE W. McELWAIN of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Sandia Base, New Mexico:
"At approximately 19:30 MST on 3 August 1952 while car riding with my family, my son and I, we saw, noticed a brilliant glow in the sky. It was the first time of its occurrence that I observed it through the binoculars. (I make an observation to this effect through the binoculars - noted) The object appeared oval shaped with an appendage, it seemed to be going out of sight, then in sight, it was all lit up. By comparison and without any evidence of known factors, the object looked about like an illumination of about 200 yards, when it disappeared I did not observe any sound."
This object was observed from approximately 19:30 MST to 19:40 MST on 3 August 1952. Other witnesses present were Mr. and Mrs. JACKSON who live on the corner of Chaver and Northeast Avenue, Albuquerque, New Mexico, a Security Guard at Sandia Base, and a number of children.
Captain McELWAIN furnished sketches as to his observation of the object, and his location which are being attached as an inclosure to this report.
