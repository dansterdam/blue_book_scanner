The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and an object above the horizon. The second sketch shows a road with buildings on either side. The third sketch shows a landscape with a curved horizon.

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. The point where you first saw it is marked "B", and the point where it disappeared is marked "C".

In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
