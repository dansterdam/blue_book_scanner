Comments of the Preparing Officers:
a. This sighting was probably caused by one of the aircraft flying in the area during the time of the sighting, for the following reasons:
(1) A B-47 aircraft, (Narrows 31), was observed over the area during the approximately 2 1/2 minutes that the sighting lasted. Also, other aircraft in the area were flying local, i.e., over the reporting area, as is common practice for SAC aircraft to check wing lights. This would account for the object's sudden disappearance and reappearance as observed by the source.
b. Judgement of time by Mr. Dewis object was observed (30) to forty-five (45) seconds. During this time he observed the first flash from the corner of his eye, looked in the direction of the second flash, and up-on looking in that direction observed the object. He stated that he saw the path of the flashes, and she saw approximately four (4) of these flashes.
c. The unidentified object was not the Sputnik carrier, because it was seen (15) minutes later. The neighbors stated to the interviewer that they had seen the Sputnik earlier before the sighting.
