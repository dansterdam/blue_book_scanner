There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a typed document with text that discusses the Department of Defense's position on unidentified flying objects, dated 6 October 1958.

For your convenience, I have transcribed the text from the document:

"For your information, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on the subject of unidentified flying objects, dated 6 October 1958.

This fact sheet clearly outlines the Air Force position with respect to unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,"
