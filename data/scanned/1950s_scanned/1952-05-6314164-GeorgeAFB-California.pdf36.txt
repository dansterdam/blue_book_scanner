Dear Sir,

This is to notify you of a report in regard to an observation of an unidentified flying object, which occurred on May 29th, 1952 near George AFB in California.

The event was reported by two reliable observers. They both stated that they observed a bright red-orange object in the sky for more than fifteen minutes, which moved silently at high speeds. The object would disappear and then reappear, exhibiting rapid changes in direction and altitude.

Both observers are considered reliable, and neither could provide an explanation for what they observed. They felt it was important to report the incident, as they were unable to identify the nature of the object.

Normally, I would not have reported this incident, but in view of the reliability of the observers and the unusual nature of the observation, I felt it should be brought to your attention.

If you require any additional information, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
