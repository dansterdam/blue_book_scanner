There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report or document. I will now proceed to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the text in the document and provide the output:

The objects sighted are and an after-recovery. Said
objects are increasing, in height, at the end of the cottonical
descent.

The so-called "semi-static" brilliance of the objects.

The objects turned on edge and back flat again.
The objects assumed various eccentric maneuvers, however
understandable in the beginning, not understood later. They
made no apparent noise.

No other scientific or military personnel were witnesses, only
pilot, copilot and bombardier-navigator. Glare had the crew
blinded initially, too bright to determine shape and size. Shapes
varied, but could not determine exactly what they were.

The fact that the objects were observed between our aircraft
and the moon implies, if it had been a celestial source, is U.S.S.R.'s
capability to have this eccentricity, size and brilliance of performance, from a technical standpoint which we do not presently
possess. Therefore, if it is a celestial source, it would have
disclosed the fact of our previous lack of knowledge of this type
of performance. It is questionable whether any earthly device
could have exhibited the tactics and performance manifested.
