AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
HQ 6th Air Div, Int Office ZP-108-53
1. "About 1900 hrs, 4 August 1952, radar operators at Macdill AFB, Florida, reported 4 unidentified targets were detected on radar for approximately 45 minutes. The targets were flying at an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet, in a westerly direction at approximately 700 mph. The targets were detected 25 miles southwest of Macdill AFB and disappeared from the radar screen 30 miles west of Macdill AFB. No aircraft were scrambled to investigate the targets, and no visual observations were reported."
2. "1319 hrs was time of sighting; duration was about fifteen (15) minutes."
3. "Observation was from the ground, visual."
4. "Observers were located on the east side of the Macdill AFB Headquarters Building, and at hill latitude approximately 1000 feet south west of the Headquarters Building. The observers reported the objects were oval-shaped, moving in a straight line at a very high rate of speed, and at a uniform altitude away from the observers."
5. "The observers were mostly young Unexperienced airmen; however three non-commissioned officers and two civilians appeared to be involved."
6. "Weather was hot, humid, clear, and surface winds 5-10 mph."
7. "No meteorological phenomena known of to cause this."
8. "No photographs or comments were obtained as the radar set was inoperative."
9. "Narrative - A total of about twenty airmen and civilians saw the objects, which were observed and tracked on radar. The object was elongated and apparently triangular in shape. Additional details provided are as follows: The objects were traveling in a straight line in a westerly direction at a tremendous rate of speed. The objects were reported to be much larger than any known aircraft. The objects were tracked by radar for approximately 45 minutes, and two felt that they saw three to four objects as the objects first came into view. The entrance as well as the exit of the objects were not observed."
10. "One Airman claimed the object was egg-shaped, all others reported the objects to be oval-shaped. It is believed that the egg-shape reported was due to the high speed of the objects, and the inability to obtain a clear visual sighting."
11. "Since the motion of the observers and the balance could not be ascertained, it is believed that a lateral displacement or movement by the observers may have taken place."
