This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a declassified document, likely related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page is heavily redacted, with large portions of the text blacked out. The readable portions include the classification label "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top, as well as some technical details and references to a "Santa Maria Airport" and the "Azores."

Here is the text output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the visible portions of the document:

AT APPROXIMATELY 1930 HOURS ON 9 AUGUST 1954, AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS OBSERVED OVER THE SANTA MARIA AIRPORT, AZORES. THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY NUMEROUS WITNESSES, INCLUDING CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL AND MILITARY PILOTS.

THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE METALLIC IN NATURE AND OVAL IN SHAPE. IT MANEUVERED IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

NO FURTHER DETAILS ARE AVAILABLE DUE TO REDACTION OF THE DOCUMENT.
