Miami Pilots Saw 'Saucers' Around Bragg

Raleigh, N.C., Oct. 16.--(AP) What
Capt. George W. Woodward of Miami,
Fla., says he saw flying a Miami Air-
lines, Inc., DC-4 over North Carolina yes-
terday might not have been flying sau-
cers, but he doesn't know what
they were.

Woodward and his Co-Pilot Williams
reported seeing four shiny objects that
couldn't identify. The Civil Aero-
nautics Administration office here re-
ceived the report late yesterday.

TWO WEEKS AGO, Woodward re-
ported seeing three objects like "bal-
loons" two weeks ago.

"THIS TIME, if from Raleigh, for
miles later I saw four shiny objects
that looked like balloons," Woodward
said. "Do you see them?"

I told him I did not see them at
that distance. He said they appeared
to be about 100 feet in diameter, or some
other estimate like "a minimum of
25 feet." They were scattered in a
group of five, he said, like the five
saucers fitted together.

"They were in line when we first
saw them and we chased them but they
backed off and disappeared," he said.
They were "Flying pretty fast," he said.
Woodward said the objects were about
15 years old and had never seen such
objects on his travels, that he was sure
what he saw, but he wasn't positive
they weren't planes.

The objects were sighted near Pope Air
Force Base, Fort Bragg, N.C., and
also over Lumberton, N.C. and Florence, S.C., he
said.
