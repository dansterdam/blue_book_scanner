AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DET. 2, 4602D AISS
I. SOURCES: 
a) Miss -----
b) Miss -----
Address: a) -----, Shelby, Iowa 
b) -----, Shelby, Iowa
Age: a) 15
b) 15
Occupation: a) Student
b) Student
Education: a) 1st year high school
b) 1st year high school
Qualifications: CIC observers (approximately 3 months)

II. RELIABILITY. Ratings: Both statements agreed on by both sources as to the investigators. Miss ------ and Miss ------ told identical stories of what they had observed. Their accounts were given the closest scrutiny by the investigator; but there appears to be no reason to doubt their veracity. The cumulative impression points to a high degree of reliability.

III. SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: All objects were spherical in shape and were observed visually and through binoculars. There were no changes in characteristics when observed under differing conditions. There were no sounds associated with the objects. The objects appeared to be a metallic, shiny, gray color.

The first object seen had a slightly wavering motion and moved from SSW to NE. It disappeared in the west. After 15-20 minutes, 5 other similar spherical objects appeared to drop from a parachute-like formation. The parachute fell slowly, and the 5 objects separated and went in different directions at high speed. One and one half hours later, 5 other objects were observed having the same general direction and speed as the first 5.

Although altitude cannot be determined accurately, the movement and behavior indicates they were at a high altitude. All objects disappeared in the sky very abruptly. No trail or exhaust was observed. No wind, lightning, or atmospheric disturbances were noted. All objects' appearance and actions were well documented and agree on by both observers.
