Report on Hopkinsville Finished, Must Still be Printed: The long-awaited "Hopkinsville Landing Report," by CSI members Isabel Davis and Arthur Lewish, has not been completed in final form. Copies containing the final conclusions may be as much as six months away. The authors consider genuine UFO encounters on the occasion to have been the most protracted and most extraordinary ever recorded. The witnesses have presented their results in detail, including maps, diagrams, photographs, and drawings of the little men. As soon as the report, 30 pages long as it now stands, will be made available to members after final revisions have been made, and a photo-offset edition has been printed.
