Dear Sir:

Referring to your letter of July 24th. The sighting identification claim which was on July 11th, 1952. My first letter was written on July 29th, 1952. The letter sending me the questionnaire was dated August 20th, 1952, and the questionnaire was returned a few days later.

The location was at a lake (Cook Island Lake) about several miles north and a little west of Kamloops, British Columbia. 

I have a fishing cabin on this lake and go there every year. It is interesting to me to watch the weather and see what's going on. I saw something and still haven't the slightest idea what it was.

Yours sincerely,
