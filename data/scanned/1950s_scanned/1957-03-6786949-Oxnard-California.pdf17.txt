STATEMENT

On 23 Mar 1957, I got up to go to bed. Answered my phone which rang and I decided to go to the bathroom. On the way, in the kitchen, I looked out the window and noticed a bright light in the sky, about the same brightness as the planet Venus. It seemed to be hovering or standing still. The light was a circular object and flickered. I called Oxnard Air Base at Camarillo, California's suggestion. Capt. Lindsley's suggestion: "Carol, I watched the object through field glasses from my home. It seemed to be hovering about 15 miles west of Oxnard. I observed it for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, from 4:50 a.m. to 6:05 a.m. on the morning of 23 Mar 1957." I called you to report the incident.
