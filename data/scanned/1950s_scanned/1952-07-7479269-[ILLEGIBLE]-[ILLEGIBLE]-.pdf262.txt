OFFICE OF THE BASE OPERATIONS OFFICER
REPORT OF UNKNOWN FLYING OBJECT

ADIC 23 July 1952
SUBJECT: Report of Unknown Body Flying over Lake Charles Air Force Base.

TO: Commanding Officer  
5064th AIR DIVISION
Lake Charles Air Force Base
Lake Charles, Louisiana

ATTN: Intelligence Officer

About 2330 central standard time, a weather observer, experienced with civilian and military aircraft, spotted an object traveling at an excessive rate of speed, estimated at 5,000 feet. The object was traveling from South to North over the Air Force Base. In our opinion, no conventional aircraft would be capable of such speeds (5,000 feet per second). The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 seconds and seemed to hang and disappear completely. No sound was heard.
