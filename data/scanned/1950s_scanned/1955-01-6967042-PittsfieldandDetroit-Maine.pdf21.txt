INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS
   THE OBJECTS REPORTED WERE DESCRIBED AS ROUND, ORANGE COLORED AND APPROXIMATELY 25-30 FEET IN DIAMETER. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TWO SEPARATE SIGHTINGS WERE VERY SIMILAR, INDICATING THAT THE OBSERVERS MAY HAVE SEEN THE SAME OBJECTS. 
THE OBJECTS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE TRAVELING AT 100-150 KNOTS AT AN ALTITUDE OF 500-600 FEET. THIS TYPE OF PERFORMANCE IS BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT.
