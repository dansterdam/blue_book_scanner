I. BRIEF HISTORY OF PROJECT BLUEBOOK
A. GENERAL
1. In the fall of 1947 the United States Air Force took official notice of reports from the public indicating that the problem might be related to the Air Force responsibility for the air defense of the United States. 
2. On December 30, 1947 the Air Force directed its Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, to establish a project to collect and evaluate all available facts concerning "flying saucer" sightings.
3. On December 27, 1949, after 375 reported sightings had been investigated, the Air Force announced the findings of the "flying saucer" project.
4. The evidence at that time indicated that the majority of the reported unidentified flying objects could be accounted for as misinterpretations of various conventional objects and did not form of hyderia, meteorological phenomena, light aberrations, or hoaxes.
5. There remained, however, a number of unexplained sightings, and the Air Force has continued its investigation to identify and analyze aerial phenomena that could possibly be a menace to the United States.
6. To date, the Air Force has undertaken to investigate and analyze about 10,000 reports dealing with these phenomena. As before, most of the reports were identified and disposed of as familiar aircraft, astronomical objects, and other known natural occurrences or man-made objects.
7. The unidentified reports, however, which are in the order of approximately 10 percent of the total, cannot be definitely associated with these familiar things.
