The image contains two sketches depicting parts of an unidentified flying object (UFO) as described in the document. The first sketch shows a side view of what is labeled "Tail Cone" and resembles the tail part of an aircraft. The second sketch is below the first one and also illustrates the "Tail Cone" of the object, appearing to have a more detailed shape.

1. In accordance with AFI 200-5, 29 April 1952, the following report is submitted.

a. While on combat air patrol an unidentified brilliant white light was sighted off the coast of New Jersey at approximately 2045 Eastern Standard Time on 12 October 1952. Aircraft was approximately twenty-five (25) miles North of Atlantic City at the time and the light was sighted at approximately 2 o'clock high. Object was at first believed to be a star but this was discounted as the object appeared too readily brilliant at times, and the observation was soon made that the object was far more brilliant. At this point, the CC station was queried and asked if they had contact or anything in that area. The controller reported that he had a faint contact and vectored the aircraft on a heading of 080 degrees which was within 2 or 3 degrees of a course which would have taken the aircraft straight for the unknown object. The aircraft was at an indicated altitude of 20,000 feet and the object was located approximately 20 to 30 degrees above the aircraft at a reported distance of several miles. While flying toward the light at an indicated air speed of 250 knots, the bright object appeared to move gradually to the right and also gain in altitude to a position of approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the observers. Both observers at this time thought that the object could possibly have been an aircraft's navigation distance with its landing lights on. However, after flying toward the object for about 10 minutes, both observers agree that the object appeared as circular to egg shaped with what appeared to be a mid-wing with approximately 30 to 40 degrees dihedral. Directly below and as a part of the white light section there appeared a tail or cone shaped section of the same brilliant circular light which was longer or bell shaped, sometimes appearing short and then longer. Sketches by the two observers are shown below.

2nd Lt James W. Wallace, Radar Observers

The object when described was likened to an F-86 aircraft standing on its nose except that while the fuselage of an F-86 is long and slim the object was oblong or egg shaped. The complete object as pictured above glowed with the same bright white light. The object appeared to remain in the same general area and there was no indication of contrails, sound or maneuvers with the exception of a gradual change in position in both elevation and azimuth, as described above. Observers could note no exhaust or propulsion methods as the entire object glowed with a brilliant white light. Observers suggested that the tail of the white light which projected below the cylindrical portion, which varied in size, couldn't have been exhaust since it was of the same color as the rest of the object. Had it been an exhaust flame the color would have differed. The CC station finally lost contact with the object.
