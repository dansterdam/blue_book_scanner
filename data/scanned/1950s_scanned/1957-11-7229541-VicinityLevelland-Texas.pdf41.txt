Commander
4500th Air Intelligence Service Squadron
2021 Air Force Base, Colorado
This letter is to express the appreciation we at AFCIN-4X36 
on the performance of 1/Lt Norman I. Dahl, whose investigation and report on the "Levelland, Texas" incident is the subject of this communication. His work air investigating service 
squadron 202 has been of the highest caliber and continues to enhance the reputation of the air force intelligence service.
2. The summary of 1/Lt Dahl's marked the beginning of active interest by this office in the "Levelland, Texas" incident. His investigative work has been thoroughly evaluated and documented - this memoranda reek would never have been initiated had his fine work not been done.
3. It is extremely difficult to ascertain those individuals who are capable of making significant contributions in the field of intelligence. Lt Dahl's work in this case is the same here.
4. It is my desire that you extend to 1/Lt Dahl and other personnel involved in your command, our sincere appreciation for their efforts and loyal support.
