Angel Hair 
Tested in Lab

"What was it?", the people ask, "Where did it come from?" The angels are still trying to decide if it was a "calling card", left from one of their visits. Chemistry Dept. at the Burlington, North Carolina Municipal Airport reported that tests showed a strange substance, resembling spider web, contained no harmful chemicals. "It appears to be made of silicon", said Dr. Carl R. Hart. "Apparently it fell from the sky. We have found no evidence of any conventional origin." The finding was reported to the U.S. Air Force on October 29, 1955.
