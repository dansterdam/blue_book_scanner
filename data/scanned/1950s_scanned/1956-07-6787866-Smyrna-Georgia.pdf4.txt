WHEREAS REPORT HAS BEEN MADE ON A FLYING OBJECT OBSERVED NEAR SMYRNA, GEORGIA, ON THE EVENING OF 15 JUNE 1956, AND A SUFFICIENT DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT AND ITS BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THIS OFFICE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE CASE BE CLASSIFIED AS UNIDENTIFIED.
THE WITNESSES DESCRIBE THE OBJECT AS OVAL IN SHAPE AND APPROXIMATELY 60 TO 80 FEET IN LENGTH. IT APPEARED TO BE ILLUMINATED FROM WITHIN AND SEEMED TO EXHIBIT SOME SORT OF PULSATING OR FLASHING EFFECT. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE A RAPID UPWARD CLIMB AND THEN LEVEL OFF AT AN ALTITUDE ESTIMATED TO BE 1,000 FEET OR MORE. AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THE OBJECT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED.
ALTHOUGH SEVERAL FACTORS COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED, SUCH AS THE TRUE SIZE, SPEED AND ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT, IT IS FELT THAT THE REPORT CONTAINS SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO WARRANT CLASSIFICATION AS UNIDENTIFIED IN VIEW OF THE INABILITY TO EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA IN CONVENTIONAL TERMS. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS CASE BE CLOSED.
