Apr. 25-El Monte, Calif.- R. M. Orose., of Covine,, described 
a half-priee-shaped object which emitted no sound and was "a bril-
liant white". The UFO, first observed at 8:30 p.m. "appeared to 
be hovering about 1,000 feet above" him. "It had no riding lights,"
he said, "and that fact dismissed my first thought that it was a 
plane," Mr. Cross added the object finally made an arc and headed
eastward. (El Monte Herald, 4/27)
