The image does not contain any photograph. This appears to be a handwritten report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text of the document is as follows:

THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED (FADED OUT)
WAS VISIBLY FRIGHTENED 
BY THE OBJECT AS BEING NO MORE THAN A
MILE AWAY AND APPROXIMATELY 30-40 FEET IN
DIAMETER. MY ESTIMATE IS THAT THE OBJECT WAS IN
SIGHT FOR LESS THAN 3 MINUTES. HOWEVER, IF THIS
COULD BE AN ILLUSION, I WOULD SAY THAT OWING
TO THE APPARENT SUDDENESS OF THE DISAPPEARANCE 
OF THE OBJECT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS WHOLE
INCIDENT COULD BE AN HALLUCINATION. FOR THIS TO BE
AN HALLUCINATION I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW TWO TO THREE
SECONDS AND IT WAS DISAPPEARING.

AT THE DISTANCE I HAVE ESTIMATED FOR THE OBJECT TO APPEAR OF
SUCH ACTIVITY OF SUCH IT WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50 MILES HIGH.
