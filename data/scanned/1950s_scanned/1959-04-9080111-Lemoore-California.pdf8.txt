23 May 1959

Dear ___,

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 7 May 1959 concerning your recently observed unidentified flying object.

The United States Air Force is charged with the responsibility of investigating and studying all causes of unidentified flying objects, with the intention of informing the public, through the media of the press, all we learn in this regard.

To date the Air Force has, in our investigation of many cases, uncovered no positive evidence of the existence of vehicles of unknown origin flying through our atmosphere. Even though many sightings remain unexplained, we have found no evidence that unidentified flying objects constitute any threat to the security of the country. Other than the remote possibility of a hoax or mistaken identity, etc.

For your information, I am including the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on this subject. They may have some information in this report which will assist you. They may also indicate that this office, which is the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for all investigations of unidentified aerial phenomena, has forwarded their evaluation to you.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
