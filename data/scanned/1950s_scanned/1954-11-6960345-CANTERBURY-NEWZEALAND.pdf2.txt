Dear Sir,
1954 - U.F.O. report. I have been asked to provide you with a report on the description of a UFO sighting reported to us on November 6th, 1954.

On the date mentioned above, a watching and waiting operation was conducted in the Christchurch area by members of the R.N.Z.A.F. under the direction of the A.I.D. Headquarters.
During this watch, a sighting of an unidentified flying object was reported between the hours of 2030 and 2150 local time.

The object was first observed at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet while moving at high velocity (20,000 - 30,000 feet per second) on a roughly northerly heading. It was observed to slow down and come to a complete stop before accelerating rapidly in a vertical climb and disappearing from sight. The object was described as being circular in shape, emitting a white light, and no exhaust or propulsion system was observed.

It is pointed out that in all probability, this sighting falls into the category of unidentified phenomena, and can be added to the ever increasing list of such incidents worldwide.

Some value can be placed on this information as it appears to give an accurate description of the object observed. Other than this, this office can provide no further information or comment.

Yours faithfully,
G.W. King
