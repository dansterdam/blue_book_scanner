The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved skyline with a bright object above it, and the instructions ask the reader to imagine that they are at the point shown and to indicate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when they first saw it, and then to show how high it was when they last saw it.

The second sketch contains two larger drawings. The left one shows a landscape with a person standing in the foreground, and the instructions ask the reader to place an "A" at the position where the object was when they first saw it, and a "B" at its position when they last saw it. The right sketch is a smaller example showing how to complete the larger sketch.

Transcribing the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
