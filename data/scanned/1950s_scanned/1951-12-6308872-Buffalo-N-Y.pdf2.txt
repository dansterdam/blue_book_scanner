1. Under provisions of AFR Letter 200-2, 11 April 1951, the following is a narrative report by this unit on interviews with Captain USAF...

2. On 6 December 1951 at approximately 1920 hours, Captain USAF, pilot, was flying at an altitude of approximately four (4) miles southwest of the Niagara Falls Municipal Airport, Buffalo, New York, when he sighted an unconventional-type airborne object.

3. This object was larger, white, extremely brilliant (in comparison to the 20-30 military aircraft in the area which were first lighted) and appeared much larger than its perimeter area, was a blue-white brilliance and the outer edge outlined in a fiery, tapered cone and after the cone there appeared some pulsating, red-orange exhaust flame. The exhaust appeared to be short duration.

4. After sighting the object for approximately 15 seconds, it slowed down and started to climb in a steep sharp angle and appeared to have a blinking light on the top. He could not be sure whether this was a light or an external blinking light bulb. At the extreme altitude to which the object climbed, it appeared as a brilliant, glowing, circular light of about 1/4 to 1/2 the size of a dime at arm's length. It was self-luminous, had no perceptible wings or stabilizers, and made no sound associated with it.

5. The AACS station in this area reported nothing in its log to indicate the presence of the object at the time of the sighting. A check was made at the time control tower, but they had no information on this object, nor do they have anything indicated in their tower log.
