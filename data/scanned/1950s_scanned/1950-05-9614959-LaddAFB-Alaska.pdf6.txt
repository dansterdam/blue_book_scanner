Can I obtain this picture, also could you give me information as to what this is classified as.
Capt. Ezey also said my report in this case appeared to be classified as restricted.
The tower operator saw him also for some four or five minutes and became quite excited over this. He said he could hardly write down what he was seeing fast enough. The flight leader of the F86 flight also saw the object. He described it as a bright round light, larger than the full moon, and moving across the sky from East to West at a very high rate of speed, apparently 80-90 mph or more. When viewed through binoculars it appeared to be a wingless aircraft, round in shape, and dark in color. The light seemed to be only on the bottom of this craft. This observer said that the object appeared and disappeared time and again as if going behind scattered cloud coverage. He said it was definitely not any known type of aircraft. The control tower operator and the flight leader both made immediate reports to higher headquarters and arranged for me to visit Ladd AFB on the following day, to gain further information from them.
