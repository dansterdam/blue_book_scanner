ON 29 AUGUST 1952, I WAS INFORMED THAT CAPTAIN WILLIAM R. ADAMS . . . WAS INTERVIEWED AND APPARENTLY, CAPTAIN ADAMS WAS INTERVIEWED AND APPARENTLY, CAPTAIN ADAMS STATED THAT ON 20 JULY 1952, HE OBSERVED TWO ILLUMINATED OBJECTS THAT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FIVE (5) INCH DIME AT ARM'S LENGTH OVER SLAGLE LAKE (30-003) (CIRCLE SANDERS CREEK, 3/2:200) ON THE EVENING OF 19 AUGUST 1952 WHEN THEY SIGHTED TWO UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS. INITIAL SIGHTINGS WERE AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 HOURS . . . IT IS INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 15 MINUTES AND WERE INITIALLY SEEN TO BE ABOUT TWO LIGHTS WHICH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 140 DEGREES AZIMUTH AND 60 DEGREES VERTICAL FROM THE OBSERVER'S POSITION. THEY WERE THEN OBSERVED TO MAKE TWO OR THREE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL MANEUVERS THAT WOULD INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR BEING GUIDED. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 10 (10) MINUTES, THE OBJECTS BEGAN TO SLOWLY MOVE AWAY AND WERE LAST SEEN AT APPROXIMATELY 2 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. THE ORIGINAL WRITE-UP INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FIVE (5) INCH DIME AT ARM'S LENGTH AND THAT THEY APPEARED AS IF THEY WERE ILLUMINATED. IT IS INDICATED THAT ATTACHED SKETCHES SHOW THAT THE OBJECTS APPEARED AS ROUNDED OR DISC-SHAPED. ON INDICATED THAT IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT THE OBJECTS WERE METALLIC AND PROBABLY BETWEEN TEN (10) TO FIFTEEN (15) FEET IN DIAMETER. THE ORIGINAL WRITE-UP INDICATES THAT THE OBJECTS WERE IN THE POSITIONS INDICATED ON ATTACHED SKETCHES, AND EACH OBJECT SEEMED TO EMIT RED AND GREEN COLORED LIGHTS. THE ORIGINAL WRITE-UP INDICATES THAT THE OBJECTS MOVED AWAY AND CHANGED DIRECTION AS IF THEY WERE A PART OF THE SITE WHOLE. THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR AND DARK, THERE WAS NO MOON. COMPARISON WAS MADE OVER A LONG WATCH THAT HAD BEEN BORROWED, WHICH MEASURED 2 HOURS. THERE WERE STILL SOME DOUBTS, HOWEVER, ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE OBSERVER.
