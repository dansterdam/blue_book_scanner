A60In-4 AIR 46024 ABBE (ADC), 25 Apr 57, SUBJ: UFOB Guidance Mater
1st Ind 4244/Capt G.T. Gregory/wtn/69216
AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
2 MAY 1957
1. This Center is currently in process of preparing subject guidance material requested, and should be forthcoming within two weeks of this date.
2. The known difficulty in attempting to provide guidance on such phenomena as UFOBs and this Center's desire to present, in a simple manner, the numerous clues, hints, leads and deductions as to identifiable objects and they occur in evaluating and explaining UFO sightings, dictates that the matter be given careful consideration and preparation.
3. Additional research and data is required on all the possible explanations and data sources (photographic, astronomical bodies, meteors, unusual atmospheric phenomena, etc.) that can produce under certain conditions, objects that could be mistaken for UFOB. While the reason is obvious to those involved in the technical analysis, the reason for these particular procedures may be focused on a study planet.
4. It is suggested that the numerical guidance items under each subject item of an appendix, be followed with a brief, informal description or explanation. Appropriate and meaningful guidance use of these objects will require a design concept with this view in mind, and may be used as deemed necessary to your particular requirements.
