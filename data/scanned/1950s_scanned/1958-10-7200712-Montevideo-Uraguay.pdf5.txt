"ACCION" - October 15, 1958

A Luminous Object over Montevideo at 10:25?

We have some concentration themes: did a flying saucer go over Montevideo this morning at 10:25? Was it an optical illusion? Or was it the observer brilliant enough to be seen in the "Pioneer" from the Americas - a UFO that climbed 127,000 kilometers and is supposed to have fallen somewhere.

Any of these possibilities can be the true one to explain the strange phenomenon seen by a multitude of witnesses on Independence Square and especially in Matriz Square.

An unusual series of fire, followed by a sort of opaque whitish ball of fire, occurred and several inhabitants that call or wake up were interrupted. Returning to itself, the square returned several times.

It can be anything, but what is denied is the fact that a photographer from Accion are willing to photograph the object and they cannot describe the same. One thing they all agree on is that it was not the duty of details. On one thing they all agree, we could not determine the altitude, neither the dimensions, nor the color, nor any other detail.

Some even traveled in a straight line, not in circles, and the same applies for a place of the witnesses.

The Meteorological Service of Uruguay (where we sent for confirmation on the navy) says it could have been a jet plane or a satellite? In the same of the turbine are high altitudes (40,000 m.) and the clouds that seemed to form a kind of white wake that puzzled the people in the "Matriz" Square.

We want to point out the fact that some jet planes did fly over Montevideo in one of their routine flying operations.
