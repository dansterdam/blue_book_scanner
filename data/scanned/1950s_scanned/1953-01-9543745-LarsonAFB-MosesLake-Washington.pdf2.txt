Larson Air Force Base, Washington
5 January 1953

I. Description of Incident:
As 1515 Z over sixty varied military and civilian sources observed one green, disc-shaped object. The object appeared to be stationary for fifteen minutes during which time the object moved in a southeasterly direction while bobbing vertically and gaining in altitude. There was no sound. An 1545Z aircraft was scrambled but a thirty minute search of the area revealed nothing conclusive.

II. Discussion of Incident:
A check of adjacent radar sites revealed no unusual returns or activity in the area. The winds were generally from S30r W at 12,000 ft. Thus the object would appear to move against the wind since it must have been below 12,000 ft. There was no sir traffic reported in the area.

III. Conclusion:
Unknown.
