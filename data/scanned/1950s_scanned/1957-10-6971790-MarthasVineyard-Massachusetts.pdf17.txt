Letter to General Walsh did 14 Feb 58
3. This report contained the following significant points:
a. No report of anything unusual in the air at that time was received from any of some 34 aircraft known to be near the area of the sightings at that time.
b. No report of UFOs from radar units which scan the area 24 hours a day.
c. Information from Cambridge Air Force Research Center discloses that are used for tests of specially launched radar-reflecting balloons.
The fact that, from a position over the ocean, by a former CIA staff officer, a jet pilot, and "trained" military observers, a jet-propelled, "metallic-appearing" objected which was observed under the particular circumstances outlined is of interest. There are no recent reports concerning flights of such objects in this area. (Enclosure: a letter from General Lewis to General Partridge, copy of which is inclosed.)
The object was described, by the various reports, as varying from "cylindrical to round and [with] protuberances of some sort."
4. I hope this will give you the information you needed.
Sincerely,
