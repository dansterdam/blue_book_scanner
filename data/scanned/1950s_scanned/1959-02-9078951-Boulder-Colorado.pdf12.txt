This image does not contain any photographs, only a typed letter. As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

Dear Dr. Menzel:

I am very sorry to hear it will be so long before your letter will get to your attention. There has been some confusion, and I forgot to take the negatives, and I also took it over to the University Station and I asked that it be sent. However, there is a complication: it turns out that the camera lens is not in focus and the image is not too clear. So the prints, although I brought them to the Department and asked them to be developed, say there is a lot of double-take in the machine with which they made the prints. Also there are some lines through the prints, and may not be clear. So I am enclosing the photo of the peak and your letter, and I hope you can make them out.

As you may know did your appearance on the above "Today" program on March 15th so. Unfortunately, our TV set was out of order and we missed it. 

As regards the next-to-the-blackest print for your use, I hope it will be suitable for your normal use.

Yours truly,
