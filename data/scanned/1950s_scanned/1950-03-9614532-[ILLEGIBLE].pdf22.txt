The image contains a photograph depicting a "flying disk" or "flying saucer" that is hovering above the Baldwin Hills. The text below the image describes the object as an "Odd Kite, With String Control, Designed by Former Jet Test Pilot as Aerial Target". The image shows that the object has a curved, elliptical shape and is attached to strings being held by two men. The text mentions that this was a model designed by a former jet test pilot, and that some people may have mistaken it for a genuine UFO sighting.

Here is the text from the document, which appears to be an article from the Los Angeles Times newspaper:

Flying Saucer Whirls Above Baldwin Hills

It's an Odd Kite, With String Control, Designed by Former Jet Test Pilot as Aerial Target

A flying saucer whirled over the Baldwin Hills yesterday - but it had strings on it! 

Designed originally as an aerial target for gunnery practice, Wolford, former jet test pilot, thinks some of "flying disk" reports from householders may have been prompted by observing the targets.

The cardboard saucers are red, about 18 inches in diameter, with curved yellow wings that rotate. Powered by a small engine, and with the disc attached to long control strings, the objects are maneuvered by their operator on the ground.

In fact one of his first models was almost shot down by a National Guard plane when it was mistaken for a real aircraft. 

And so when someone found it in an open field and reported "I've seen a flying saucer," Wolford thinks he had to explain that it was just one of his demonstration pieces.
