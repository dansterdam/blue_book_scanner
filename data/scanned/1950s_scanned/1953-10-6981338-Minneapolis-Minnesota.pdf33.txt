On 13 Oct. 1953 at 19:30 white object was observed in the sky. Estimate about 25,000 to 30,000 ft. The object flashed at the speed of approaching jet. No sound. Object drifted silently through the sky, maneuvered with ease, sped up and disappeared from view. After the initial period of the flight had gone well into the vertical phase of the craft, it made a sharp turn and dashed horizontally at tremendous speed. Astonished at this complete change in directional control of the object. The time of the observation was approximately two minutes. After the initial observing period, the object appeared to come into the vertical phase of the maneuver, traveling with no noticeable sound and then dashed off to the horizon at much greater speed than any existing aircraft I have observed with the naked eye. This was quite an experience and I believe the object to be a sighting of an unidentified flying object.
