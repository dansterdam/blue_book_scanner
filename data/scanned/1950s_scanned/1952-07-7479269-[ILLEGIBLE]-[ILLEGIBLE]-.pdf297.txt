There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

A RECORD VISUAL AND RADAR OBSERVATION WAS MADE AT 1030 BY MR. MIED

SIXTY OTHER INDIVIDUALS. VISUAL OBSERVATION WAS MADE WITH A 16" POWER TELESCOPE. MR. MIED ESTIMATED THE SPEED TO BE AT LEAST 1200 MILES PER HOUR AND COULD NOT DETERMINE THE ALTITUDE.

IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE OBJECTS WERE PROPELLED AND THAT THEY WERE MANEUVERING RAPIDLY. LIGHT FLASHES WERE OBSERVED SEVERAL TIMES BY ALL OBJECTS. THESE OBSERVATIONS PASSED OVER EVERY FIVE TO EIGHT MINUTES AND APPEARED TO MANEUVER AND THEN DISPERSE. THE NUMBER OF GROUPS WAS NOT DETERMINED. THE OBSERVATIONS WERE CONTINUING AT 1728 HOURS.

C-2 FIRST ARMY DID NOT HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF MR. MIED'S BACKGROUND, BUT DUE TO HIS BEING A RADAR INSTRUCTOR HE FELT THAT A C-2 EVALUATION WAS WARRANTED. THE SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE OBJECTS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED AND THE OBSERVER DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY WERE WINGED OR NOT. MR. MIED OBSERVED SIMILAR OBJECTS LAST FALL, BUT WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE ANY DETAILS AT THAT TIME. HE STATED THAT SOMEONE FROM WASHINGTON HAD TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THESE OBSERVATIONS. NO OTHER INSTALLATIONS RECOGNIZE THESE OBJECTS AND C-2 FIRST ARMY HAS CONCUCTED NO REPORT. FURTHER INFORMATION WILL BE FORWARDED WHEN RECEIVED.
