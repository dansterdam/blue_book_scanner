MONDAY, MAY 28, 1956  V-29
Not Martians,
King-Size Bulbs
If you are bright lights moving
and June 26, don't start looking
for Martians. The lights are
caused by an earth-type search-
jet plane on a photographic as-
signment center's aerial reconnais-
sance laboratory.
The laboratory and the Air Re-
search and Development Com-
mand are flying jet planes nightly in the southern Ohio, Ken-
tucky and western Pennsylvania
area. If the weather is clear, the
light is from high intensity pro-
jectors are being mounted on the
planes to illuminate the night
photofloods.

IT'S A PLANE,
EXPERTS SAY
MIDDLETOWN, May 28â€”It
experts at the Wright Air De-
velopment center here to-
day said a "flying saucer" was
sighted here last Monday night.
The "saucer-shaped" object was a
jet plane being used in night aerial photogra-
phy, WADC spokesmen said.
They said the plane, equipped
with many high-intensity lig lights,
probably would continue flying
through mid-June.
