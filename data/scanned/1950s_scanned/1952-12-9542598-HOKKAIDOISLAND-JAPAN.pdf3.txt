AF FORM 112--PART II 
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

[The text from the document is as follows:]

275th Fighter Bomber Wing

5. In all cases except the reported ground sighting, the object was observed at altitudes between 5,000 and 80,000 feet. This indicates either a high performance aircraft, or some extraordinary object. 

6. The USAF advances the following comment which could provide a possible explanation:

"The planet Venus is at maximum elongation at this time of year, appearing like a high-performance aircraft. The observations where planets assume approximately the same relative position have in the past been mistaken for aircraft when observed under certain conditions."  

AS 29 MARCH 1952, VENUS WAS LOCATED AT 12,000/1300. BETWEEN 1900/2300 AND 1100/2400, ITS HEIGHT ABOVE THE HORIZON WAS BETWEEN 19 AND 28 DEGREES. THIS WOULD EXPLAIN ANY NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN POSITION AND ALTITUDE OF THE OBSERVED OBJECTS.
