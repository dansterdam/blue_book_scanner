SCOPE—AND SPECIAL ATTACHMENTS ARE PROVIDED for telescope eyepieces to enable one to make solar observations without danger. Also, when a telescope is pointed to the sun, its image may be projected on a sheet of white paper placed a little distance in back of the eyepiece.

With aids such as these, amateur astronomers all over the country may be busy watching the sun on the evening of May 5 to see Mercury crossing it.

Transit’s Time Schedule

In New York the planet will start to enter the disk of the sun at 6:56 p.m.,EST, just as the sun is about to set. St. Louis will see the beginning of the transit at 5:56 p.m., CST, and at 6:06 CST the planet will be fully in front of the sun. Astronomers around San Francisco will be watching the transit of the planet on the sun’s 
disk between 3:57 and 4:47 p.m., PST. At about 5:14 PST Mercury will be nearest 
the sun’s center. At 6:19, in the Bay area, 
the planet will start across the sun’s edge
again, and at 6:27 PST the transit will be over.
 
Mercury will be moving from east toward the west so its passage across the sun will be downwards. The whole transit will occur toward the right-hand edge of the sun or between two and three if you think of the sun as a clockface. 

During this century there are 14 transits of Mercury, four of which are grazing contacts—entering but not leaving. The last transit occurred Nov. 11, 1953, but the last full transit at this time of year was on May 7, 1937; the next will occur Nov. 7, 1960, and the next May transit on the eighth in 1970.

Only Venus and Mercury can undergo transits, since they are the only planets nearer the sun than the earth.

Transits of Venus are far more rare, and there is none in the 20th century. The last happened on Dec. 6, 1882, and the next will occur on June 8, 2004. 

Since Venus is considerably larger than Mercury, as well as nearer to the earth, of the two the transit it can be seen in front of the sun without the aid of a telescope.

With smoked glass or other suitable protection for looking directly at the sun, 
Venus can be seen as a dark, round spot, moving slowly across the bright solar disk.
On May 13 there will be a total lunar eclipse, as the moon passes through the earth’s shadow. It will be visible generally in Europe, Asia, Africa and over the Atlantic Ocean but will end 6:10 p.m. EST, before moonrise in the eastern U.S. and Canada.

However, the moon will remain partly in the earth’s shadow until 7:17 p.m., and by then it will have risen for some points along the Atlantic Coast.

People at these locations may notice, just after the moon appears, a curious shading of its upper edge, where it has not yet emerged into full sunlight.
