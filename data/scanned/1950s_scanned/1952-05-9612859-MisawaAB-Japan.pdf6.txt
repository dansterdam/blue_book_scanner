TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
AT 2200 HOURS ON 8 MAY 1952 WE WERE FLYING NORTH ALONG THE COAST LINE ABOUT A MILE SOUTH OF MISAWA AIR BASE. THE PILOTS CALLED MY ATTENTION TO A SIGHTING WHICH WAS ON THE SURFACE OUT AT THE ONE O'CLOCK POSITION. I WAS WATCHING THIS, TRYING TO SEE IF IT HAD ANY CODE SEQUENCE WHEN I SAW THIS STREAK OF BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE AIR AND AT OUR ALTITUDE (7000 FT), WHICH WAS OUT AT THE SAME BEARING AND CLOSING (I ESTIMATE) 6 DEGREES. IT WAS MOVING IN A PATH OF A CIRCLE, SLIGHTLY TOWARD US, MOVING IN AN EASTERLY TO A WESTWARDLY DIRECTION. WHEN FIRST SIGHTED IT HAD A BRIGHT GREEN COLOR WHICH CHANGED TO YELLOW THEN TO AN ORANGE COLOR, AND DIED OUT OF SIGHT. AS THOUGH IT HAD DISINTEGRATED IN A PULSATING FASHION. IT JUST STOPPED, GOT VERY BRIGHT AND DIED OUT. ITS COLOR SEEMED TO LINGER RATHER THAN HAVE A TAIL LIKE A SHOOTING STAR. IT WAS FAST MOVING, BRIGHT AND OF SHORT DURATION. AS FOR ITS DURATION WHICH I COULD HARDLY ESTIMATE, IT DID LAST LONG ENOUGH THOUGH FOR ME TO SAY LOOK. LOOK. LOOK. TO THE PILOT OVER OUR LIVE INTERPHONE AND FOR HIM TO ANSWER. I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING I COULD RECOGNIZE AS A SOLID MASS, ONLY AS LIGHT.
