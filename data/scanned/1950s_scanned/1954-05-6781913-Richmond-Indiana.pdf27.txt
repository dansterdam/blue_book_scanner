The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on an old document. As an OCR system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

Nearly starboard by S of Signia (Tarcesa 42 - 7831995). Approximately 1 minute later an object came into view from the west and seemed to hover and move erratically for a time. It then increased speed and went out of sight. It seemed to be maneuverable and had a steady light. I thought at the time it might be a meteor or some unusual astronomical phenomenon, but in view of the recent reported sightings and the apparent maneuverability I feel it should be reported as a possible unidentified flying object.
