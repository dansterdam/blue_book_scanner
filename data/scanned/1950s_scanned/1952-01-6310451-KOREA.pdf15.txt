which because of combat fatigue, conditions of sightings, weather factors, etc., were assumed to be objects unattached to anything else. Such a report would appear reasonable in view of the fact that an object of this type would naturally become a center of interest, so to speak, and would tend to cause the observers to concentrate on its details rather than to look for anything else in conjunction with it.

Thus far they have requested additional specific information from FEAF and pending the receipt of the reply to the request they cannot go on record with a firm evaluation. As soon as ATIC can furnish additional details this information will be made known through routine intelligence channels.
