CHESTERTOWN, MARYLAND
INCIDENT

24 May 1957

(Sighting by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (US Army))

Newspaper accounts of flying saucers in the vicinity of Chestertown Maryland were given sudden significance when a high-level member of the Department of Defense, Mr. ██████████ and his family observed a series of strange, weird-appearing lighted objects floating in the dark moonless sky, over the Chesapeake Bay, on the night of 24 May 1957 from the grounds of his home near Chestertown, Maryland.

Upon reporting the sightings to the Air Force, an investigation was immediately undertaken, Mr. ██████████ was interviewed in the Pentagon, and a thorough check made of the area in question, with detailed testimony from the other members of the ██████ family and other witnesses to the sightings.

An analysis of weather conditions at the time of the sighting ruled out meteorological-created phenomena. Radar units records disclosed nothing unusual in the sky at that time. A check with air activities, both military and civil shed little light. The area was photographed for clues.

While interviewing fishermen near a wharf, suddenly a clue was found. A fisherman remembered the time and date of the event, because a brush fire occurred nearby when the phenomena was taking place.

Further investigations, as a result, disclosed that the source of the phenomena was from the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, which are located Northwest across the bay.
