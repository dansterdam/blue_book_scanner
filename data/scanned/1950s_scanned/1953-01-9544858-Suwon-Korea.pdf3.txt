15 JANUARY 1953

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT

On 9 January 1953, at approximately 5:00 P.M., two observers, one a Korean civilian and one a United States Air Force pilot, sighted an unidentified aerial object approximately 6 miles south of Suwon, Korea.

The object was first observed at an altitude of approximately 25,000 feet and was traveling in a southerly direction at an estimated speed of 350-400 knots. The object was described as circular in shape, about 20-30 feet in diameter, and appeared to be metallic in color.

As the object approached the observers, it suddenly turned and climbed at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view. The total time of observation was approximately 2 minutes.

Attempts to locate the object on radar were unsuccessful.

REMARKS: This report appears to be a valid sighting of an unidentified aerial object. The description and performance characteristics of the object are consistent with previous reports of similar phenomena.

CONCLUSION: The origin and nature of the observed aerial object remains undetermined.
