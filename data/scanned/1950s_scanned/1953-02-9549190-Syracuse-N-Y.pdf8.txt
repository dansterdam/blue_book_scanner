The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon line, and instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on the curved line to indicate the observed position of the object. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with a curved horizon line, and a smaller inset sketch representing how to complete the larger sketch.

Text found in the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. This is a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
