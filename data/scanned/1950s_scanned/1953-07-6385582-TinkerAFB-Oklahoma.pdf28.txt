The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line, with instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to indicate how high the object was when last seen. The second sketch shows a larger scene, with a person in the foreground and buildings/landscape in the background. There is also a smaller inset sketch in the top right corner.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will extract all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
