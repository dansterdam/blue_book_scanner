No positive conclusion can be made by the reporting officers as to what the observers may have seen. In the opinion of the officers investigating this incident, there is a possibility that the light sighted could possibly be related to the described course of the light seen by the observers. The aircraft had a red rotating beacon underneath and should be considered in the observer's account.
