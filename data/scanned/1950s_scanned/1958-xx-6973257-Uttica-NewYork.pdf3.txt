A clear, cold night we watched the light came our allyy road
near our old home, Richard and I about 4 miles to the right I
saw a light which I at first thought to be that of a train
which would be heading north on the tracks which cross the
country road about half a mile ahead of me. As I walked along
I suddenly realized at could not be on a train. It continued
to me at a steady pace, and coming toward straight
me. at about 100 feet altitude. It seemed larger as it approached
and appeared to be of the size of a medium one,
it out.
