CASE 713 (CONTINUED - PAGE 2)
Something unusual in the air, reports come in about 9:00 pm. The object was first sighted at 8:35 pm oo January 6, 1953, the reporting being notified by the CAA Radar at the Meacham Field, Fort Worth, Texas, that they had received numerous calls of an unidentified object sighting in the Dallas, Texas, area.
Civilian flying control officers on duty contacted Lovr Field Traffic Control Tower at Dallas for verification of the sighting. Civilian at Love Field Tower said that the object could be seen from their tower and that the controller had notified all air division command.
Soon after the initial call, Major Barks, Texas, called and stated that he had observed a mysterious object at 0339 hours 6 January with his own eyes. He said the object appeared to be at an altitude of 35,000 feet.
A radar unit at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, reported that they had picked up a target by radar at about 9:00 pm 6 January. The target was heading S from a point 35 miles E of Paris, Texas. The target was traveling at an estimated air speed of 600 knots and at an altitude of 7,500 feet. The time of the initial radar contact was 9:05 pm. Radar contacts were made in that area which could be attributed to the unusual target observed by the civilian at Paris.
The direction of the radar targets, West, and the direction of the object seen by the civilian, South, do not concur and, therefore, are evidently 2 different objects. The radar contacts is believed to have been an aircraft heading for Paris AFB, Texas.
It is believed that one of the objects seen was the upper air research balloon launched at Sypos, Texas, and the radar pickup was jet aircraft in the area.
