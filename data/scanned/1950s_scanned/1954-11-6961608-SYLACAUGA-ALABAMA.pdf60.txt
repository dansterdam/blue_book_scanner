LT., ATIC, SUBJ: (U) UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT RECOVERED AT SYLACAUGA, ALABAMA

The record demonstrates all the earth's atmosphere actually hit the earth's surface and these are called "meteorites". Velocity of a meteor plays an important part on whether or not it hits the earth. At the time a meteor hits the earth's atmosphere - 100 miles high, say - its velocity will range between 6 miles per second and 46 miles per second. Since the earth's motion around the sun gives it a velocity of 18 miles per second, the average velocity of a meteorite is 26 miles per second, one therefore finds velocities between 26-40 and 26-18 miles per second.

The speed of the Alabama meteorite can be estimated only if one knows the exact direction from which it came and the time of day it fell. The evidence seems to indicate, however, that the Alabama meteorite was a member of the Andromid shower, occurred between November 8th and December 7th. During some from the north, but the exact direction depends on the time of day they are seen. Ordinarily their speed is 20 miles per second, but this figure may be augmented by "cosmic velocity" - the debris of Biela's comet which disappeared after 1852. Fragments from this comet have fallen, sometimes perhaps being a stone weighing 260 pounds which fell in Alsace, November 16, 1492, between 11 and 12 A.M.

Arrangements have been made for the meteorite to be returned directly to its owner from the Smithsonian Institute.
