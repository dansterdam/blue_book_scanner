Three pilots - all saw Plymouth aerial objects fly in formation - Were apparently electrical powered and soundless
Three pilots reported seeing a number of strange aerial objects over the Plymouth area on Tuesday, May 25. They said the objects were oval and were seen flying in formation at a high speed. The pilots were Capt. C.F. Behncke, Mr. H. Kingsmill and Mr. W. Naylor, all of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.
According to the report, the pilots said the objects appeared to be electrically powered and were completely silent. They noticed them suddenly appearing and then disappearing again. They were unable to say whether or not the objects were moving. They were oval and looked like shiny mirrors.
"We flew at 7,000 feet and the objects appeared to be at a much higher altitude," said Capt. Behncke. "They seemed much smaller than normal aircraft, but could have been some distance away. They gave the impression of being in a single line formation."
The pilots said the objects were visible for about a minute and a quarter. They were apparently operating under perfect physical condition and have been aerial reconnaissance for some years.
