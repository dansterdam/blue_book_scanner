Dear [REDACTED],

I'm (Thursday) sending you some data that definitely was Sputnik No. 1, fall Jan 2nd at 7:50 locally. We located it about 5 miles west of Dallas and we were able to view it from 10 or 15 front second of arc around the sky at that time. It was moving at from 8 to 10 degrees per second. This observation confirms my belief in what we saw earlier creating this sighting. I am familiar with tracking satellites and I do not believe this was anything other than the satellite. This information is to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass.

They said they had observed data that they would compare with this. 

My two nephews and myself are life-long residents of Dallas residents and we are quite positive about finding this satellite. I know that finding the satellite intact by visual sighting would be of immense value to the scientific world. We found this satellite and there are no holes in our statement. If the government wanted to keep it a secret for awhile, maybe the use have been looking for this or not and we don't want the report discussed.

We are 42 years old and have seen come cases, meteors, falling stars, and they all have positive characteristics this was the satellite advice.

Yours Sincerely 
[REDACTED]
Dallas, Texas
