AT LOWRY AF BASE, DENVER, COLORADO

1.  This is a joint investigation of Special Agent FREDERICK K. UNGERER and the writer. 

2. The investigation was predicated upon telephonic report by 1st Lt. ARTHUR S. WEBB, 161st Student Officers' Squadron, 19 January 1950, who advised that while flying in the vicinity of Denver during the evening of 18 January 1950 he observed a flame move across the sky at a high rate of speed.

3.  WEBB was interviewed and stated substantially as follows: WEBB was flying in a B-25 MITCHELL bomber, approximately 15 miles southeast of Denver, when he observed an unusual spectacle. He saw a brilliant object, estimated from 200 degrees at a high rate of speed without apparent change in altitude or course. WEBB estimated the distance to the object from the bomber as 2-300 degrees, and the speed was only slightly less than the aircraft in which WEBB was flying, i.e., approximately 200 miles per hour. The object appeared as a brilliant white reddish color with more red in the rear. It was observed for approximately 8-10 seconds and then faded out. The altitude of the plane was estimated as 5000 feet and the object was unable to see any running lights, silhouette or other features. WEBB noted the time of the observation as 6:55 p.m.

4. 1st Lt. DOUGLAS R. DRYSDALE, AD 755395, 3416th Student Officers' Squadron, who was flying in the same general area as WEBB but stated that he did not observe the flame at the same time as WEBB but added that it looked just like a shooting star. The time of the observation was 1905 and he estimated the flame to be at an altitude of 30,000 feet rather than the 5000 feet estimated by WEBB.

5. WEBB and DRYSDALE both say their aircraft heading as 190 degrees and they were at 5,000 feet altitude and noted unusual radio noises at the time they made the observations. Both stated that they could not account for the cause of the observed phenomena.

6. Captain H. F. DANIEL, AD 559076, Hq & Hq Squadron, 3415th Technical Training Wing, and 1st Lt. ROBERT D. ROMBERG, 1636LA were flying a C-47 aircraft in the vicinity of Denver on the evening of 18 January 1950. DANIEL and ROMBERG were interviewed and both stated that they had observed a bright light moving through the sky and that it was somewhat larger than the ordinary stars but smaller than Venus seen at the same time. They further stated that the light disappeared as suddenly as they had first observed it. DANIEL and ROMBERG watched the flame fade out at the time of the observation. Both pilots stated that they could not account for the cause of the flight observed.
