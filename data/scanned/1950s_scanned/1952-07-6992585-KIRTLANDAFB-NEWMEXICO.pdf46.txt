The image contains a photograph at the bottom which appears to be very faint and seems to show hand-drawn arrows or symbols, oriented in various directions, with the letter "W" next to one of the arrows. There's also a handwritten annotation "0725 E" near the bottom right corner of the photograph. The quality is poor and the image is indistinct, making it difficult to determine what is depicted beyond these symbols.
