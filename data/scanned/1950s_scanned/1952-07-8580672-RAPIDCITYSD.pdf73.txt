The tree was very well sheltered on all sides and for its full height. The overstory is 70 to 90 feet pine with an occasional Sassfras and oak. A heavy understory stand (dogwood, hickory and maple) ringed the trees. In fact a green hickory crown was more or less interlaced with the crown of this dead tree as it started to fall. A green maple crown was about 10 feet away in the direction the tree fell. The crowns of the tree were not braced or cabled and simply started to lean and twist as the tree fell into the depression in the ground. It fell at an angle and it was possible to see the full scar on the ground. 

The wooded tract is fenced and ungrazed. There was no evidence of animal activity within reach of the tree. No undergrowth discernaged anyone approaching within reach of the tree.

The tree had evidently fallen very recently, perhaps within a week or two. Limb vegetation was freshly pressed down under the bold. There was no chewed or "snapping" limbs to found under trees which have been dead for a longer time.

Examination of other trees within the vicinity showed only one recent breakage. This was a dead B-I/2 inches in diameter which had broken off a live Sassfras tree standing about 16 feet to the east. This tree chose to choose 15 inches in diameter at its broken stem 7-1/2 feet above the ground. At about 42 feet above the ground, a four-foot broken section which appeared formerly to fit the broken end above determined.

I trust this summarizes our findings and discussions had on the site.
