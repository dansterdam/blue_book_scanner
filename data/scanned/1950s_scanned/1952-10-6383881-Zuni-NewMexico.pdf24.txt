11 Oct. 52 Sighting. Zuni, New Mexico 

It is fair to estimate that it was approximately 6:30 p.m. at the sighting time. 

The object was cylindrical in shape and was quite bright or luminous. It was about 5 or 6 times the size of the first star seen, and seemed to have a slight alternating motion up and down. The distance to the object could not be determined, but it was definitely in the northeast portion of the sky.

The object seems to present the most plausible sighting in the present time and is that seen by experienced observers under rather good conditions. There is no indication whatsoever of any misinterpretation of the observed phenomena and, therefore, it would seem most probable that this is a real sighting of some highly unusual aerial object.
