Perhaps there is some thing or some interest that may be of military value in one day and if it is a military secret I suggest that this material be properly handled or classified for that purpose. There is some thing here that appears unusual and perhaps worthy of some investigation, although I do not act on for the benefit of any person or organization, I stand to want to serve the public good and expect nothing in return. I am trying to serve the purpose of the Air Force to the best of my ability as a civilian having had experience of over 18 years in the 9/6/52 - 38307/1 and in what I believe to be regular investigations that have not been too thorough in the past and I would guess that there are a number of cases that have not been as completely checked as this one appears to have been. Whatever the seriousness or importance of this sighting, I have no doubt that there is some thing here that should receive more attention than it has in the past. I mentioned "unusual" and a "complete" investigation, - perhaps this is not the outstanding case of its type, but from the details given, it would appear to be a strange report that should not be dismissed as "insufficient evidence" as has been done in the past on similar sightings.
