1. In accordance with the references (a) and (b), the following report is submitted:

DANLGARD on 22 January 1956, to effect coverage in accordance with reference (a) apparently reliable, had sighted an unidentified flying object on 21 January 1956 at 0920. The ship was at position 29-40N, 67-20W, or approximately 200 miles southeast of Bermuda, on true course 260°, when the sighting occurred. The object was sighted to the northeast at an altitude of 29000 feet, and its color was blue. The object was observed for about 1 minute, during which time it moved in a northerly direction. The size and color of the object indicated that its size was at least 15 miles. The wind was off the port bow at 6 knots. There was no place for collection in the area.

2. When first sighted, the object was at a 260° azimuth at a position angle of 60°. It was thought to be a "falling star" when observed at first. When observed through binoculars, it appeared to be a brightly illumined circular object, rotating and oscillating about a center. After conferring to assure continued visual observation, the object then made an abrupt change of direction and accelerated to an azimuth of 200° and disappeared about 3 seconds later at an azimuth of 342° (ship's head true). The object appeared to be round and a bright light color like a star. Its appearance did not change during the observation. The object's eccentric motion, however, was unlike that of any known astronomical object, and its long "trail" was clearly seen. This "trail" trailing the object was a pulsating light, about five times the length of the body of the object, which still appeared to be round and a star-like light color.

3. The observer hesitated to estimate the distance to the object, but said that if he had to guess he would say that it was 20 miles distant.
