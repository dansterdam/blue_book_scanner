ALTITUDE OF UFO AND CONDITION OF WEATHER:
This UFO sighted on 23 January 1959 reportedly appeared at an estimated 20,000 feet; visibility unlimited, with no wind or clouds.
The object was observed for a period of approximately 10 to 15 minutes by three witnesses. It appeared to them as a brightly lighted object emitting a glowing red-orange exhaust. Its motion was described as erratic, zigzagging back and forth, and at times it appeared to move away from each other. It must be stating their experience was vividly impressed upon their minds.
The witness who was sitting on his knees, was calmly watching the object when he heard a crackling sound like static electricity. He glanced up to see the object gently coming down and then suddenly stopped. It then glided slowly back up, emitting a pale bluish-white light intermittently. The object appeared to be quite large, but then glanced as to see the entire craft gently coming down and then it quickly disappeared.
At this point, the witness became excited, and did inquire to the other observers if they had also seen the object. They replied in the affirmative. The object fired a ball of fire, only to hear the hissing of metal striking metal. At the same time, there was a discharge of light which appeared to continue in time, so extensive. Two of the witnesses had an object hovering over their position near the ground. This hovering took approximately 4 to 5 minutes, and when the object departed, it left a slight reddish glow.
