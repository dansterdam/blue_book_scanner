The object appears to have a rough, uneven surface with several protrusions and crevices. There is a scale bar at the bottom of the image that measures the size of the object in increments of 2 inches.

On 30 November 1954, a 8.5-pound meteorite crashed through the roof of a house in Sylacauga, Alabama, striking a woman named Elizabeth Hodges. This is the first known case of a meteorite striking a human being.

The meteorite was recovered and examined as part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects. This image appears to be a photograph of the recovered meteorite taken as part of the investigation.
