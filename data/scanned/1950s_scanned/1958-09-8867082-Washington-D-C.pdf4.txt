It had been only 10 minutes for the observation on the 2nd floor balcony of my then home overnight in mid to late September, 1958 (a week). I read later, when there had been a flurry of reports of UFO objects sighted, a number of times I had glanced at a cluster of stars in the southwestern sky; finally, for no particular reason, my glance came on one of them, and to my amazement it seemed to unsteadily lurch and then move to the west northwest for about 7 or 8 seconds, continue across the sky in an apparently N.W. or northerly direction. Some increase in the light, however, gave an unscintillating coruscation (probably a poor word) and I jumped to my feet to watch it pass. It came up fast through the night like a small lamp and passed swiftly and silently almost directly overhead, at the height, I thought, of a commercial plane. I tried to discover some outline of the object, some smaller lights along the sides of the glow, all to no avail, and the light disappeared in the northwest.

At the time, I thought it must have been some airforce "secret device" or a plane so high in the stratosphere that I could not catch the sound of its engines but I suppose it was some natural phenomena, perhaps specially that the Russians put up in secret, I do not know. In any event, and there were no reports or timetables in the paper of its passing. It was extraordinary but I have you any idea of what it was precisely that I saw?
