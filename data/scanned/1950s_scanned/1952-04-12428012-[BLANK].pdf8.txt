To depart now from the missile field and discuss aircraft, let us consider the unconventional aircraft configurations. A great deal of interest has been shown by many designers in low aspect-ration all-wing configurations as a means of obtaining compact, low-drag aircraft. The elimination of fuselage and tail surfaces in such designs would decrease the total surface area exposed to the airstream and thus lower the parasite drag. And the low aspect-ration normally associated with an all-wing design makes it feasible to design an efficient light-weight structure.

Work in all wing configurations has been carried on by various designers in the United State since the early 1930's. of all of these designs, the most interesting in probably the Zimmerman wing aircraft which was proposed by Chance-Vought in 1939.

The aircraft was to have a span of 23.3 feet and was to employ a Zimmerman wing (see NACA report TN No. 539). The aircraft was to be powered with two P &W engines of 1350 H.P. each which were mounted at the wing tips. The take-off distances of this aircraft were very low,
