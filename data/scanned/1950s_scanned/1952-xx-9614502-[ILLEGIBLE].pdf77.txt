EXHIBIT - VASES OF BRASS WITH SMALL ROLLERS
These vases were grooved on the outside end the grooves were made of brass with small rollers on the vanes which fitted into the grooves. The vanes were free and could be rotated on their own, but there was no evidence of a power source to spin the vanes. The vanes were three in number and were spaced uniformly around the circumference of the vases.
There was no sign of any electrical wiring at the hub of the vanes. I noted two holes on the outside of the side of the vases. These were such six-cylinder exposed type mounts, similar to what is used to mount a six-cylinder body on an airplane. There were four such mounts, one at each corner of the body near the upper strut area. The body had an aluminium saucer-shaped appearance on the lower side and was approximately thirty inches in diameter. This body had an overall height of about thirteen inches.
There were none visible the top part of the body protruded about 6 feet above the ground. The bottom part of the body projected about 6 feet above the ground. The projectile shaped dome above was partially obscured in a frame. The object was spherical in shape and tilted at a slight angle on opposite side of its axis.
On this ring on what appeared to be the front. I then noticed that one of the rings was broken and appeared to be unattached to the body on one side. It appeared to be highly excited and vibrated for the other ring was not moving.
I noticed that they had light blue uniforms and were dark boots, with no insignia on their uniforms. As they approached I in no direction retreated some distance began on the hill.
Glanced through the vanes strike away into the body proper and also immediately the object started to rise rapidly disappearing into the night. I notice that it traveled at a much higher rate disappearing quickly.
While I was standing underneath the object I noticed an odor which imparted me as an underwriter might call "paraffin". This odor was much to sharper and stronger than one which I have constantly smelled.
I did not notice that the three vanes left an imprint in the sand where the ground and found part of a stamp watch wears, but when inspected later in the day I could find no evidence have ever seen.
REMARKS:
This was directly to the south on a distant hill from where I was standing but when I looked for it later on it was gone. I then passed off the distance for the size of the object must have been about 200 grams.
I regret that I did not think to get my camera out of the car so that I could have taken some photographs.
I have great difficulty in the hearing in my left ear is impaired.
I believe that I could make an almost exact model of this object and plan to do this as soon as I can find time and settie down.
I CERTIFY THIS TO BE FACTS RECORDED AS I ALLEGED A FIRST-HAND WITNESS TO ALL DETAILS
