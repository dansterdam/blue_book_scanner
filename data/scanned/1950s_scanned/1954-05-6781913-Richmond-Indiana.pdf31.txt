The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on what appears to be an old document or report. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can output the text found in the document:

My observation for approximately 30 minutes indicated that the object(s) appeared to travel in a zigzag pattern, maintaining an irregular but approximately constant speed. At one point the object(s) seemed to pause or hover momentarily, then resumed its zigzag course. The object(s) appeared to be several miles distant and at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. The sky was clear and the object(s) was (were) easily visible to the naked eye. I did not hear any sound associated with the object(s). My 165 mm camera was not available, so no photographs were taken.
