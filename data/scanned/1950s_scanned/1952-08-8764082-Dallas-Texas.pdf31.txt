He had picked up several rumors and passed those rumors on to Capt Garney and Capt Ralph Sanger. These rumors would be at the West Palm Beach or the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office. He stated that a woman that lived in West Palm Beach had stated that she knew ??? and that he was very probably a mental case.
6. Capt Ruppelt and Capt Garney then went to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office. They interviewed a woman who had stated that she had heard some rumors about a flying saucer, but actually had never run them down herself. He also stated that he was possibly not too reliable in the fact that he was a young woman of questionable reputation.
6. The officers next talked to a Mr. G. B. Bowen another deputy at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Bowen stated that he had investigated this case and had contacted some agency in Washington, possibly the F.B.I. and had received the report of the fact that he had never interviewed the individual in the case. He said that he did not personally know anything about the case, but said that he was called upon by the sheriff's office as a consultant. He also stated that he knew nothing and that he trusted the individual's evidence and would believe anything he said. (Comments: this is a usual thing for sheriff's office to do, other individuals that they call upon to assist in the case as a consulting witness).
7. The next person to be contacted was a Mr. ?????, a part-owner of ????? Hardware Store, where Lt Olsson, Capt Garney and a Sgt Ralph Sanger of Capt Garney's office contacted Mr. ????.
