The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

On the morning of 27 July, 1959, Police Detective M- - - - L - - - - was patrolling her route when she noticed a bright object hovering in the sky. The object was described as being circular in shape, about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and emitting a brilliant light. The object hovered for several minutes, moving slowly, before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. The witness stated that she had never seen anything like it before and was quite shaken by the experience. W.P. reported this incident to investigate the sighting. The report indicates that it was investigated but provides no further details on the findings or conclusions. The report suggests that it was an unusual and unexplained aerial phenomenon.
