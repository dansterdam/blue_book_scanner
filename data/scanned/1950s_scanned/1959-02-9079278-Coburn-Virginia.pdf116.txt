Transcribed text from the document:

(3) Attended a weekly meeting at the college, held by the Clinch Valley College Astronomy Club. Most of the boys stayed home studying for final examinations; therefore, very little was accomplished. However, we did get a description of a sighting made by Mr. [REDACTED] (see TAB 2).
(1) Drove to Norton, Va. to contact [REDACTED]. He had the picture taken of one of the objects. Also contacted Mr. [REDACTED] for his description of an object sighted by him (see TAB F).
(2) Drove to the Clinch Valley College to contact other members of the astronomical club who had witnessed the objects. Contacted Mr. [REDACTED] and Mr. [REDACTED] (see TAB D).
(3) Contacted [REDACTED], a young boy approximately 10-11 years old, concerning an object he had observed (see TAB E).
(4) Drove back to Coeburn and contacted Mr and Mrs. [REDACTED]. The date of their observation was uncertain (see TAB H).
(5) Drove out toward Clintwood, Va. to Caney Ridge where several strange lights were observed by [REDACTED]. We were with the [REDACTED] and another couple. Reportedly, the lights suddenly showed up. While we were there a bright white flash was observed. One investigator said it was a car, but one of the women claimed it was above the mountain. The investigator pointed out that the mountain in question was fairly hard to distinguish from the dark sky, but she still insisted the light was above the mountain. The investigator was sure he had momentarily caught a glimpse of a red tail light at the same time the white light appeared. He suggested they keep watch to the left of the original sighting, and after about two hours, the lights disappeared.
