OPTICAL PHENOMENA

GENERAL

This can cover a multitude of things.

Optical phenomena which have been reported as UFOBs run from reflections on clouds and layers of ice crystals (sundogs) to the many types of mirages.  No one set of optical phenomena can be set down as representation for the whole class.

   There is no limit to the speed of optical phenomena.  Reflections can travel from incredible speed, as in the case of a search-beacon on high clouds to stationary.

1. Shape: Generally round but can be elliptical or linear.
2. Size: Starlike to large luminous glow.
3.  Color: Generally yellow
4.  Speed: Stationary to fantastic.
5.  Formation: Any.
6.  Trail: None.
7.  Sound: None.
8.  Course:  Any.
9.  Time in Sight: Any.
10.  Lighting Conditions: Day and night.
11.  Other: One of the standard types is the "sundog".  In this a large luminous halo is seen around the sun   with one to four images of the sun placed along the halo circle at intervals of 90 degrees.  Another report often has to do with a bright planet or even the moon shining through a light overcast.  Mirages reflections are said to occur frequently when temperature inversions exists in the atmosphere.
