The image appears to contain two sketches related to the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The larger sketch on the left shows a curved line indicating the path of the object as it appeared above the horizon, with a figure on the ground observing it. The smaller sketch on the right shows a more detailed view of the object's appearance, with a burst-like shape. The text instructs the reader to refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
