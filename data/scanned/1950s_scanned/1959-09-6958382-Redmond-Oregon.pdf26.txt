Redmond, Oregon Sighting - 24 Sept 1959

1. Major Friend, by telephone, contacted Mr Laverne Wertz, FAA,
Redmond, Oregon, Mr Robert Dickerson, policeman, Redmond, Oregon and
Major Creasman, 827th ACWRON, Keno, Oregon. Mr Wertz stated that the
object which was seen at 1200Z (0400 local) was brought to his attention
by officer Dickerson. Wertz and Dickerson both described the object as
an extremely bright light in the northeastern sky, and very low on the
horizon. The object appeared stationary, except for apparent erratic 
motion around its principal points. The object was observed for more 
than one hour. Mr Wertz reported the object to ARTC at Seattle, who in
turn contacted the 827th ACWRON for identification. Interceptors were
scrambled from Seattle and surveyed the area under the control of the
827th. A civilian tri-pacer equipped with a geiger counter was scrambled
from Redmond. The results of all intercept attempts were unsuccessful.

2. Major Creasman, 827th ACWRON informed Major Friend that a similar
object has been observed several times since the 24th of September by
the station’s observers. It is believed at the station that either a 
gap-filler antenna or the terrain is responsible for the returns.

3. On the night of 24 September, Seattle ARTC asked the 827th if they
had a target in the vicinity of Redmond. The operator observing the
returns on the scope answered in the affirmative. It is believed that
this unconfrimed and idle answer was responsible for the FAA report
which stated that the visually observed UFO had radar confirmation by
the GCI site.

4. At the time of the sighting the star Regulus and the planet Venus
are both in the direction of the sighting and just below the horizon.
It is the ATIC opinion that refractions of these objects were probably 
responsible for the visual sighting. The description by the witnesses 
and the fact that the object appeared generally stationary adds credence 
to this conclusion.

5. Col Tacker, SAFOI-3d, informed of ATIC action by telephone 14 June
1960. Col Shoop also briefed this date.

6. The following aircraft were scrambled for intercept and/or search
of this target:
