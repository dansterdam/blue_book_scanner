STATEMENT

I, Victor Mailer, Aircraft Communications Operator residing at King Salmon, Alaska, make the following statement:

On 7 February 1952 at approximately 2207I, I received a call from the control tower operator at King Salmon CAA Control Center. I was in my quarters at the time and was instructed to go to the control tower immediately.

Upon arrival at the tower, I observed the light for about 1-2 minutes. The light appeared to be approximately 15-20 miles south of King Salmon, Alaska. It was a bright, steady, white light, and there was no definite movement to indicate it was an aircraft. The light seemed to be just hovering in one place. There was no definite movement to indicate it was an aircraft. The light seemed to be just hovering in one place.

After observing the light for about 1-2 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight in about 5-10 seconds. The direction of flight was toward the south. At the time I observed this light, there were no aircraft in the area that I was aware of. The light was observed to be at an approximate altitude of 15,000 feet. The entire observation lasted about 1-2 minutes.

The above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
