6. The US Weather Bureau in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (Geogr GJPL 0316) reported that the only balloons which they release are ceiling balloons measuring 15"-20" and 24"-30" in diameter which do not carry radar equipment. They are released at 0600 EST, 1000 EST, 1600 EST and 2000 EST at intervals of one hour.

7. A check with the US Weather Bureau at Greater Pittsburgh Airport (Geogr GJLC 0227) revealed that radiosonde balloons had been released from this station on 23 September at the following times: 0600 EST, 1000 EST, 1600 EST, and 2200 EST. The forecaster on duty felt that under normal conditions one of these balloons would one of the time have attained a sufficient altitude for it to have burst. If this had been the case with respect to the balloon launched at 0600 EST, it may feasibly have drifted in the higher velocity wind currents that are common above 35,000 ft, reaching the vicinity of the incident at the approximate time the UFO was observed.

The following data was recorded on the balloon released at 0600 EST:
Altitude (ft) Wind Direction Wind Velocity (knots)
6,000 250 14
8,000 250 19
10,000 270 26
14,000 270 22
20,000 270 26
25,000 280 40
30,000 290 52
35,000 300 62
45,000 310 59
50,000 320 70

8. A check with Air Traffic Control at Friendship Field (Geogr GJJF 2313), Pennsylvania on 23 September.

9. Air Traffic Control at Philadelphia International Airport advising that no confirmation on the USAF sighting.

10. The Weather Station at Ft. Meade, Maryland (Geogr GJRK 1607) was called by telephone but had nothing to offer in the way of confirmation on the USAF sighting.

11. Operations at the 647th AC&W Sq in Manassas, Virginia (Geogr GJNR 2307) was also contacted but had no information to relate which might serve to confirm the sighting of a USAF near West Chester, Pennsylvania on 23 September 1955.
