 2.  On 27 Jun 56, at approximately 1642, Capt J. M. Long, AD 7946675, Base Operations, Clinton County AFB, Ohio, telephoned an account of a UFO. Capt Long obtained his information from Sergeant Baker of the Ohio Highway Patrol. Sergeant Baker in turn obtained the original report from a 66 year old man and his two sons.
 3.  The man and his sons were the ones who stated they actually saw the UFO. Capt Long did not talk to them directly but addressed but believed that Sgt Baker had them. The information which Sgt Long contained is the technical information sheet.
 4.  At the time of the sighting, there were a number of other observers in the vicinity, but those sightings were not ascertained in detail. The weather was excellent, with a fifteen mile per hour wind from the vest. Visibility was at least 15 miles at the time of the reported sighting.
