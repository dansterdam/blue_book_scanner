Explorer III Died
Quietly, Perhaps

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 29-
(UPI) â€” American satellite Ex-
plorer III apparently died on or
short of schedule with no re-
ported fireworks, experts at
Smithsonian Astrophysical Ob-
servatory said today.

A top official said there had
been no confirmed sighting of
Explorer III since 10:30 p.m. Fri-
day at Memphis, Tenn., where
the artificial moon appeared on
schedule. Astrophysicists here
and at other agencies had pre-
dicted Explorer III would burn up
in the earth's atmosphere by to-
night.

Smithsonian authorities dis-
counted reported sightings since
Friday night in Connecticut, Ar-
izona and over the Atlantic ocean,
saying old, worn, Explorer III would
have passed over the southern
half of the United States at vary-
ing times last night.
