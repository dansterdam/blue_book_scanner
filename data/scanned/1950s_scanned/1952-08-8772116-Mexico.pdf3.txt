AIR REPORT PHOTO DATA REPORT 2-8000PS MARCH 1950 REPORT OF INVESTIGATION 1. This investigator was called to investigate a report of a flying object observed by an unidentified observer near Azadnomis, Mexico on August 8, 1952.  The object was first observed at approximately 1800 hours local time on that date and was observed by the informant for approximately 10 minutes.  The informant reported that the object was circular in shape, emitted a bright white light, and appeared to change colors according to the informant.  The object was reported to have made no noise and was observed to maneuver in the sky in an unusual manner. The informant reported that during the observation the object appeared to increase in size and then decrease in size before finally disappearing from sight. 2.  This investigator interviewed the informant and obtained a complete description of the observed object and the circumstances surrounding the observation.  The informant's report appears to be reliable and truthful.  Since no further evidence or information is available and no physical evidence was recovered, this case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.  The informant's report is attached as an enclosure to this report.
