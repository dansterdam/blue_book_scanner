The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically an Air Intelligence Information Report dated 1 June 1952.

The text of the report is as follows:

STATEMENT:

On the morning of 31 May 1952 I was standing guard duty when I heard a jet in the North. It had a pulsating sound, like it was idling. I couldn't see anything at first but in a few seconds a small light appeared at about 3500 feet. I thought a helicopter was hovering there with a light on one side and had turned that side to me. The light began growing at a very rapid rate and started getting larger. As it got larger it took on a glow. It stopped getting larger at about 2600 feet altitude and it took the form of a disc.

The center was duller in color in respect with the rim which was much brighter.

The object started moving to the East. It seemed to me to be moving with short jerky movements. It moved a ways and changed direction. The change seemed to be instantaneous. It started moving West but not as far as the point from where it had first started moving to the East. Again its direction changed and again the change appeared to be instantaneous. It started heading East again. It was climbing at an angle of approximately 25 degrees. It traveled East for a while and started climbing into the haze at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. It kept climbing until I could no longer see it, or rather it just faded out.
