RE: INCIDENT DEC. 9, 1952 DALLAS, TEXAS.

On the above date, I was in Dallas, Texas, on business. At about 2:30 P.M. I was stopped at a traffic light in the 2300 block of Main St. when I was attracted by a strange object in the sky. At first I thought it was an aircraft, but as I watched it, I realized it was not an aircraft of any type I had ever seen before. 
The object was round, or disc shaped, and appeared to be revolving or spinning. It was of a bright silvery color and seemed to be reflecting the sunlight. It was at an altitude of approximately 1000 to 1500 feet and was traveling in a northeasterly direction.
As I watched, the object suddenly accelerated at a terrific rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. It did not leave a vapor trail or any other indication of its passing.
I immediately reported what I had seen to the Dallas Police Department. A report was taken, but I have not been able to ascertain if it was forwarded to your headquarters.

I am convinced that what I saw was not an aircraft of any type, nor was it a weather balloon, a reflection, or any other known object. I am positive it was a strange and unidentified flying object.

I would appreciate your acknowledgement of this report and any further information you can provide regarding this incident.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
