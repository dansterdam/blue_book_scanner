Relative to radar sightings:
(1) No radars operating on ground.
(2) Observations of range, speed, altitude, and size of target.
(3) Did target execute any maneuver? If so, what angle (1359Â°), etc., and what radius of turn? If radius of turn is not discernible, how long did target remain steady in their course?
(c) Note particularly any segregation or distant targets into several.
(e) If airborne, was object sighted.
(a) Were there any radar indications or extra notes on radio circuits?
(b) Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.

General:
(1) Relative sequences of local weather conditions.
(2) Wind data, report.
(3) Local flight schedules of commercial, private and military aircraft flying in vicinity at the time. (Check Canadian activity if close to that border).
(4) Possible influence of known sources of radar in vicinity, such as long base line systems, Navy, Air Force, Army weather units, research organizations or any other.
(5) If object contacted earth, obtain soil samples within and without perimeter, and any chemical or radioactivity deposit for possible later examination.
(6) If object came sufficiently near other aircraft or known objects check surfaces with Geiger counters for possible radioactivity. Take comparisons with similar unaffected objects.
(7) Obtain photographs (or original negatives) where available; if not, secure sketches or.
