HURON COUNTY'S ELECTRIC BLUE MAN

IT IS REPORTED AS HAVING GLOWED A BRILLIANT BLUE, BEING OBSERVED FROM COUNTRY ROADS AND BANKS, AND HAS BEEN SEEN ON AT LEAST TEN OCCASIONS. 

IT GLOWED IN A GLOWING BLUISH LIGHT ON 3 OR 4 COUNTRY ROADS AND BANKED IN FRONT OF HIS CAR.

IT IS REPORTED SEEING IT THREE TIMES NEAR ELKTON AND ONCE NEAR UNIONVILLE.

HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO WITNESS THE PHENOMENON AT THESE TIMES. 

HIS PACE SUIT WAS MADE UP OF A REDDISH-BROWN OVER WHICH A BUBBLE PLASTIC SPACE SUIT

APPARENTLY HE WAS DANCING. HE TOLD HIS DAUGHTER TO GET OUT OF THE CAR BECAUSE IT WOULD BURN HIS DAUGHTER UP, BUT SHE DISCOUNTED IT. HIS ACTIVITY SEEMED FRANTIC.

IF THIS IS A TRUE CASE, IT SEEMS TO BE OF SOME INTEREST BECAUSE OF THE REPORTED GLOWING BLUISH LIGHT AND THE MAN'S REPORTED DANCE-LIKE MOVEMENTS. PERHAPS SOME NATURAL PHENOMENON AT WORK HERE?
