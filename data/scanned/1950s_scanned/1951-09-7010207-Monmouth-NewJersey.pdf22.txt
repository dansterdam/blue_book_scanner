32,000 YDS AT THE EXTREMELY UNUSUAL ELEVATION
ABOVE OF 13,500 MILS. (ALT APPROXIMATELY
53,000 FT)
3. ON 11 SEPTEMBER 1951, 1050 HOURS,
2 SCR 584 SERIAL NOS. 317 AND 313 PICKED
UP THE SAME TGT NE OF FORT MONMOUTH AT AN
ELEVATION ANGLE OF 350 TO 300 MILS AT A RANGE
OF APPR 30,000
YARDS. (APPRX ALT 31,000 FT) THE SETS TRACK
AUTOMATICALLY IN AZIMUTH AND ELEVATION AND WITH
AIDED RANGE TRACKING ARE CAPABLE OF TRACKING TGTS UP TO
A SPEED OF 700 MPH. IN THIS CASE HOWEVER
BOTH SETS FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK THE TGT
IN RANGE DUR TO ITS SPEED AND THE OPERATORS
HAD TO RESORT TO MANUAL RANGE TRACKING IN ORDER
TO HOLD THE TGT. THE TGT WAS TRACKED IN THIS MANNER
TO THE MAXIMUM TRACKING RANGE OF 32,000
YARDS. THE OPERATORS JUDGED THE TGT TO BE
MOVING AT A SPEED SEVERAL HUNDRED
MILES PER HOUR HIGHER THAN THE MAXIMUM AIDED
TRACKING ABILITY OF THE RADAR SETS. THIS TGT
PROVIDED AN EXTREMELY STRONG ECHO AT TIMES EVEN
THOUGH IT WAS AT MAXIMUM RANGE, HOWEVER THE ECHO
SIGNAL OCCASIONALLY FELL OFF TO A LEVEL
BELOW NORMAL RETURN. THESE CHANGES
COINCIDED WITH MANEUVERS OF THE TGT.
4. ON 14 SEPTEMBER 1951 ABOUT 130 A TGT
WAS PICKED UP ON A SCR 584 RADAR SET
SERIAL NO 313 THAT DISPLAYED UNUSUAL
MANEUVERABILITY. THE TGT WAS APPROXIMATELY
OVER NAVESINK NJ AS INDICATED BY ITS
10,000 YARD RANGE, 6000 FT ALT AND DUR N
AZIMUTH. THE TGT REMAINED PRACTICALLY STATIONARY
