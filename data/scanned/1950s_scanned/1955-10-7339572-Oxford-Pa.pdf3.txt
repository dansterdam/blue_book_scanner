AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FLIGHT 3-H, 4662D AISS
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the UFOB sighting reported by the observer was probably a midraneous or unusual type weather balloon. The apparent sise of the UFOB from the observer's description and memory sketch seems to indicate the possibility of a radiosonde. The directions and speed of the winds aloft seems to extend the possibility of a radiosonde to the general vicinity of Wayne, Pennsylvania on 3 October 1955. It is felt that the UFOB was not observed by any other observers suggests that it was an isolated incident, probably a friendly object.
COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER: Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by a radiosonde type weather balloon.
