"SAUCER TIN"

We have no intention of giving the whole story of the molten "tin" that fell in Campbell Bragdon, on December 3, 1954, because, apparently, some readers are probably familiar with the main facts already. (If not, see Siness's Bulletin, 1/5 and 1/7 AFJRO Bulletins, July 1957.) But we should mention that this sample was carefully brought to New York by Siness, was disappointed everyone, because they dared to be composed of tin and lead. Their appearance, in fact, to be identical as besides which hardly suggests any extraterrestrial origin. However, this proves nothing certainly which should not be met all with some grains of salt, besides the fact that a sizable meteorite, similar in many respects, fell in Texas.! (The sample in the possession of Dr. Charles Maney is of similarly hazy certainty - it is still not really certain, and it will remain uncertain until someone examines in getting more information from Dr. Virginia Macel of Campinas, the chemist who examined it.) The action is still not justified in saying that this sample metal was of non-earthly origin.
