FROM AFCIN-4E1 DATE 3 Apr 58 COMMENT NO.1
AFCIN-4Bla/V. D. Bryant/jc
72131/Bldg 263/P D41

1. All three "targets" i.e., all three "sightings" appear similar in nature.
The very short time observed, and lack of any other confirming data prevent any positive analysis. The fact that the speeds reported were extremely high is an indication that the blips were widely spread out on the scope, and may very well have been separate "blips" not due to the same "target."

2. The "interference" from the other radar (which was recognized as such) would have appeared as "rabbit tracks" on the scope - being a number of dots, or tracks, usually curved or spiralling. These were not the targets referred to in the reports.

3. It is the opinion (which cannot be proven) that the targets observed were not "real" targets, but were examples of the myriads of unexplained paintings on a radar scope.
