1. With reference to your questions of letter dated 29, Dec. 1952, the following information is submitted:

2. a. The T-33 aircraft piloted by Dept. W. D. Bridges and 1st Lt. D. Johnson first passed the objects on their flight band and apparently saw the objects.

b. The objects were estimated to be slightly larger than the T-33 aircraft and were very bright, almost white in color.

c. The 755th ACGW Squadron had both radar and radio contact with the T-33, 755th ACGW Squadron reported it could paint the T-33 clear on radar, but could not paint the objects.

d. The four bright lights always remained the same distance, but did turn from a southeast heading to a west heading.

e. On talking with the 755th ACGW Squadron this morning, they stated that they tried to contact the objects for nearly 5 minutes, with negative results after the T-33 broke contact.
