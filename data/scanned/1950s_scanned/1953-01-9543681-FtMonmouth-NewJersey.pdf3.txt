AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1/c BATT 8 Stewart APT. Newburgh NY 1-7-53 PAGE 2

C-2. As approximately 1300 hours on 6 January 1953, Andrew J. REID, Chief Agent, Counterintelligence Corps, Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, reported to the OSI that approximately 1155 hours on 6 January 1953, he observed a silver, cigar-shaped object, approximately 40-50 feet in length, at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet, traveling in a south-easterly direction at an estimated speed of approximately 300-325 knots. He stated that the object was observed to be silent and made no change in direction until it passed out of sight. He further stated that the object was quite brilliant in color, with a metal-like appearance.

2. As approximately 1600 hours on 6 January 1953, Agent MARSHALL interviewed Sgt. REID, who reiterated the above information and stated that at approximately 1135 hours on 6 January 1953, he observed a silver, cigar-shaped object approximately 40-50 feet in length, at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet, traveling in a south-easterly direction at an estimated speed of approximately 300-325 knots. Sgt. REID stated that the object was observed to be silent and made no change in direction until it passed out of sight. He further stated that the object was quite brilliant in color, with a metal-like appearance.

3. Also stated that his sighting in the meteorological section concluded that the object was approximately 40-50 feet in length and was approximately 15,000 feet in altitude and that this coincided with Sgt. REID's observation. It was determined that the object was approximately over Avon, New Jersey, at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet.

4. It was believed that this object could not have been a weather balloon, as the wind conditions at the time this incident occurred, the weather was clear with excellent visibility.
