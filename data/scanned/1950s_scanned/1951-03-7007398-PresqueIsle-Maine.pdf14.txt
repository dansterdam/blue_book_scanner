Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects

The following Bell Personnel reported the sighting of unidentified flying objects on March 14, 1951:

The above personnel are located at the Bell Hartford-Stratfield plant, G.E., following the completion of a Captive Flight mission.

No photograph was made of the first sighting, which occurred at approximately 1500 hours while following the flight path of the B-50, which at that time was flying at a heading of approximately 15,000 feet NSL east and slightly south of the base. At the first sighting the objects appeared to the people on the ground to be a flock of birds at a considerable distance. However, in a minute or so the bodies became quite clear and were called to the attention of several and the whole phenomenon enveloped the attention of its staff. At the time his sighting was verified by two men. 

The motion of the bodies (estimated at between 14 and 20 in number) appeared to be of a swirling nature, not unlike a flock of towering geese or a handful of leaves in an updraft. The bodies appeared to be white, however, the general impression was gained that the bodies were white.

Several minutes after the first sighting the writer and others were apprised of the phenomenon. At this time the B-50 had turned to the left on a reciprocal heading and was approximately east of the plant at a high altitude. The bodies continued to curl and in this fashion swirled east of the plant area.
