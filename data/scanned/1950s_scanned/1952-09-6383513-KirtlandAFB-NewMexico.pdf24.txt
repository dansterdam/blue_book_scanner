DATE OF INCIDENT: 1 October 1952 
TIME: 23 September 1952, 2358 hours

SUMMARY: At approximately 2358 hours on 23 September 1952, while camping on the north shore of Gander Lake, Newfoundland, Major E.C. Cawtrell, USAF, observed a very bright white light, moving over the lake in a north-south direction at high speed. The light was estimated to be moving at a speed of not over 100 mph. As the light approached, it appeared to slow down and then seem to stop in mid-air at an altitude of 2000 feet above the low range of hills. The light then began to descend, disappeared briefly and then reappeared at a higher altitude of approximately 3000 feet. It then began to ascend gradually and was sighted as descending at approximately 500 feet per minute. The light disappeared after descending to approximately 1500 feet. The total observed time was between 5 and 10 minutes. The weather at the time was CAVU. There were several other people in the camp who observed this object.
