The image contains a diagram that appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The diagram shows the path of an object or objects, with a curved line and a compass rose indicating the direction of travel. There is also a sketch that appears to show the motion of the object or objects during the course of the sighting.

37. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object(s) appeared when you first saw them. Place a "B" on the same line to show how high the object(s) appeared when they were closest to you (directly overhead). Place a "C" on the line to show how high the object(s) appeared just before they disappeared from view.

38. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE at first, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how many were observed, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
