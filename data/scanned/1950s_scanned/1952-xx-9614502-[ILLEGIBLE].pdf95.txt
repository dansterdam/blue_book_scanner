25 July 1952, Osceola, Wisconsin
Reports on photos marked Inclosure "Point #1" are considered to be from sighting of object on 25 July 1952 in the vicinity of Osceola, Wisconsin. Indications are that this interference radar is located in a direct line with the object sighted, and could have caused an interference to the radar set in this location. The data obtained from the radar site indicate the distance to the object and course of the object.
Whether data would be useful in determining if some distant (200 plus or minus) miles must have caused the interference. The data recorded are:
a. Temperature vs height
b. Moisture vs height
c. Cloud conditions.
