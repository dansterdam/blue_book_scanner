JERSEY UFO SIGHTING

Two people who live near each other in Highland Park, New Jersey, say they saw a bright flying object in the sky over New York which they describe as a "glowing saucer shaped object" about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. They watched it for several minutes as it hovered over Newark Airport and the Trenton Filter Center. A man by the name of Maurice D. Chestnut of New York reported the object but it has not yet been seen in New York City. However, it got as close as Levittown, L.I. for the people have been unable to determine just what it was. A Brown University professor of astronomy who was consulted expressed the opinion that this was simply another case of a weather balloon disturbance (known to be in Providence, Rhode Island).
