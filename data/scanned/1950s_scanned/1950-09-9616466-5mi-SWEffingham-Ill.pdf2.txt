REFERENCE CSAF ITEM 9 TT 7-13-A, 21
ON 20 OCT 50, UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED AT APPROX 2045 CST, 5 MILES SW EFFINGHAM. ILL. ACCORDING TO INCIDENT REPORT MADE OUT, A CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE WITH A LOCAL CITIZEN THAT CLAIMED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT MECHANIC FOR 8 YEARS, WHO STATED THE FOLLOWING:
1. A AGC-PERSONNEL WERE ATTRACTED BY A BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY. THIS AGC-PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY STATED THAT THIS IS NOT AN AIRCRAFT.
2. THIS OBJECT GREW IN SIZE AND BECAME QUITE BRIGHT. IT APPEARED TO BE 3 MILES IN DIAMETER.
3. THIS OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR 10 MINUTES AND APPEARED TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY 4 SMALLER OBJECTS.
4. UPON THEIR ARRIVAL OF THE INCIDENT REPORT, THE INCIDENT HAD PASSED AND NO TRACE OF IT COULD BE FOUND EVEN THOUGH THEY SEARCHED.
"THE REPORTS STATE THAT THE INCIDENT APPEARED TO BE REVIEWED BY AMC."
IN ANALYZING THE INCIDENT TOGETHER WITH ANALYSIS REPORTED BY AMC, THE FOLLOWING IS POINTED OUT:
AT FIRST, THEY DID NOT CONSIDER CAUSALISTS, SUCH AS A METEOR OR OTHER HEAVENLY BODY, AS THEY CONSIDERED THEM DEFINITELY NOT CONSTITUTING CLASSIC CLASSICAL CELESTIAL VEHICLE FLIGHT.
SINCE THIS COMMAND HAS HAD SEVERAL INCIDENTS COINCIDING WITH YEARS ON WHICH THEY WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ANY CONFIRMATION DETAILS TO THIS INCIDENT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT NATURE OF THE OBSERVATION, ALTHOUGH REPORTS FROM RELIABLE SOURCES INDICATE THE OBSERVATION.
THE POSSIBILITY OF HOAX OR DISTORTION OF ACTUAL SIGHTSEEING OF CELESTIAL PHENOMENA CANNOT BE EXCLUDED AT THIS TIME. FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT IS BEING EFFECTED.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
