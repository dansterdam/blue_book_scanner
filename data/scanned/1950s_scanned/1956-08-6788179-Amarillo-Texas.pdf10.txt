In reply to request, the following answers are given to questions stated in par 7.b. Basic DF: 

a. Question 1. Object cannot be identified from photograph.
Cause of the apparent "trail" is unknown. (UNCL)

b. Question 2. No calculations of length of "trail" were made because of lack of reference points. Description of photograph of "trail" is clarified, i.e., size of satsuma grapefruit at arms length, at 10 feet, a definite distance. (UNCL)

c. Question 3. The original negative should be obtained for physical inspection and controlled density printing. Additional prints may reveal details not shown on the single print. (UNCL)

d. Camera information (focal length, shutter setting, negative size) should be obtained. Duration of the exposure should be known in order to determine if "trail" is the result of an object in motion or a definite trail. (UNCL)
