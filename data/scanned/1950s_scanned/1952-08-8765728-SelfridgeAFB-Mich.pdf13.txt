This CONTACT was observed and identified as a F-94 JET AIRCRAFT piloted by 1st LT M. G. DIAZ and LT G. W. STRONG. Both pilots aboard the F-94 were able to clearly observe a large BRIGHT LIGHT AND AIR SPEED GREATLY EXCEEDING THEIR SPEEDS AS MEASURED ON THE COCKPIT INSTRUMENTS. THE AIR SPEED OF THIS LIGHT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE IN EXCESS OF 1500 KNOTS. THE OBJECT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO VISUALLY TRACK AND APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE.
