CASE NO. 9079278-COBURN-VIRGINIA

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

1. On 9 February 1959, this office received a report of an unidentified flying object which was reported by Mrs. Ira Coburn, residing at Route 1, Manassas, Virginia.

2. The following is a summary of Mrs. Coburn's report:

On the evening of 8 February 1959, at approximately 6:45 p.m., EST, Mrs. Coburn observed a lighted object in the sky while driving home from work. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. She described the object as round in shape, with a bright red light in the center, and a halo-like white light around the edges. The object moved in a northerly direction at a moderate rate of speed and then appeared to hover. As she continued driving, the object disappeared from view.

3. This office has investigated this report and finds no evidence to substantiate the claim that an unidentified flying object was observed. The investigation revealed that the object Mrs. Coburn observed was most likely an aircraft with its running lights on. No further action is deemed necessary.
