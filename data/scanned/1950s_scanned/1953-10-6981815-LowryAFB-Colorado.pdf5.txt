Transcription of the text in the document:

DETAILS (cont'd):

as a special report of the office of special Investigation, United States Air Force, and have a bearing on unexolained aerial phenomena under investigation by that office. The details follow:

The appearently very bright object was first sighted at about 1p45 hours, 29 October 1953. at Lowry AFB in Colorado. The object appeared to have been traveling in a northeast direction and was observed for about 5-7 minutes before disappearing from view. The object was described as brilliant in nature, about the size of a basketball, and traveling at a high rate of speed. As the object passed over the observers, it appeared to give off light beams and was trailing what appeared to be a light beam or smoke trail. The light seemed to vary in brilliance making the object appear to expand and contract. The object was observed to make a slight change in direction during its flight. No sound whatever was heard during the sighting.

I further state that I have read this entire statement, initialed all the pages and corrections, and affirmed that the same is correct and true as written.
