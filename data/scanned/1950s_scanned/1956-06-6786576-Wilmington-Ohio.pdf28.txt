The image does not contain any photographs, but rather contains several sketches or illustrations. The first sketch depicts a curved line with a point labeled "A" and another point labeled "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second set of sketches shows a larger view of the object's position when the observer first saw it, with a smaller inset sketch showing a close-up example of how to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
