This is one piece of evidence, the best I have ever seen to date, that no matter how much ridicule or so-called explanations are put forth will ever weaken or destroy the fact that some "space vehicle" was present that night.

Gentlemen, I urge you to study, evaluate, and consider the contents of this letter with open and unbiased minds.

Sincerely yours,

An alert U. S. citizen.
