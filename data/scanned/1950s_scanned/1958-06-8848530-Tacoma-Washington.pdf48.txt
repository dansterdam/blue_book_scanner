HEADQUARTERS
4602ND AIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
BOW AIR FORCE BASE, MAINE

12 February 59

Mr. [redacted]
Belfast, Maine

Dear [redacted]:

I am writing in reply to your query concerning your photographs. 
Shortly after your initial sighting, I sent a qualified officer to investigate the situation. His mission was to gather the photographs that you said and assist in their analysis.

Past records have shown that sightings such as you have made are usually attributed to natural phenomena. Even so, the Air Intelligence Service makes great pains to study all available information and photographs of unidentified objects. As you know, however, we have not received your photographs from the Intelligence people. Upon receipt, however, they will be forwarded to your residence.

Sincerely,

BOYD B. WHITE
Colonel, USAF
Commander
