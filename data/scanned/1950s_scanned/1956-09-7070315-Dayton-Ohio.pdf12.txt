OTTERBEIN COLLEGE
WESTERVILLE, OHIO
SEPT 8 1956

Gary J. Garriges, last night saw unusual thing in sky. It appeared first as distant star, rapidly becoming very much larger and brighter. It seemed to be emitting a reddish-orange light. It appeared to be heading toward him then suddenly disappeared. He was unable to determine its exact shape or size. However he is convinced that it was not a conventional aircraft, star, meteor, or any other known object. I have known Mr. Garriges for some time and consider him a reliable witness. I am unable to offer any explanation for what he saw.
