COMMENTS OF INVESTIGATING OFFICERS:
1. I have interviewed the 3 witnesses mentioned in the above report. All 
reports, in my opinion, can be considered reliable. If the report from Lake Wacca-
maw is true, the path followed by the object checks with all of the observations
of the witnesses. This would place the object running south east to north west 
15 miles above Lake Waccamaw as a point approximately 10 miles south of Fayetteville. 
Fayetteville. The witness at the point East of Hillsborough reported the object 
to have a flat degeneracy, whereas the other two said that it was definitely round.
