The image does not contain any photographs. It consists of two sketches that provide instructions for visualizing and describing the appearance of a UFO sighting.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The text below the second sketch provides additional context, stating that the sketch is supposed to show a view that is "similar to what you saw" and to "complete the larger sketch" based on the smaller sketch example.
