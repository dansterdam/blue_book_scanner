The image does not contain any photographs. It is a page from a document that discusses the analysis of a "x-ray photographed" sample by the "Corrosion Division". The text describes the characteristics of the sample, including that it was a "sacrificial electrode" and the normal construction for such electrodes. The text also mentions that the electrodes are typically made from pure zinc, magnesium-base, or aluminum-base alloys.

Tulsa, Oklahoma 
January 17-18, 1952

An x-ray negative was made of the suspect parts. This shows a small metal tube or capsule, probably a battery-operated device. The center of this object is bright. There is a material plate within the end of the tube opposite the brightened and corroded area. Attached to this material are two wires which come through the end of the tube.

Inspection of the x-ray photographed by the "Corrosion Division" indicated that the sample was probably a sacrificial electrode used for prevention of corrosion of pipe lines buried in soil. The tube and electrical connections to the plug are the normal method of construction for such an electrode.

Such electrodes are customarily made from pure zinc, magnesium-base, or aluminum-base alloys. Spectrographic examination of the object indicates it to be of a magnesium-base alloy.
