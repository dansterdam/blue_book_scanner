IR DT-UFOB-2-59		FROM   AFOIH-LBI

Attached report (DT-UFOB-2-59) is principally concerned with visual sightings. Examination of this report indicates that the sightings reported by one F-102 pilot appear to be more like interference than an actual sighting. Apparently the pilot did not obtain the precise details necessary to identify the object. It is suggested that this report be evaluated on the basis of the visual sightings rather than the reported physical evidence.
