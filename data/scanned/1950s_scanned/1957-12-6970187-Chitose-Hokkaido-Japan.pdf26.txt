STATEMENT
16 December 1957
Lt. Wright, and I saw the object at about the same time, approximately 1750R, 12 December 1957. It was very easy to see without the aid of binoculars and was about three (3) times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. At first I looked at it with the naked eye and upon looking through the binoculars it appeared to be round with a very brilliant glow around it. It seemed to be closer than any star in the sky and upon placing the binoculars in a stationary position it was observed moving in a northerly direction and tracking approximately North 10Â° East. I observed it for about ten (10) minutes and intermittently lost sight of it due to the intermittent lighting at approximately intensity until it began to fade about the last fifteen minutes. It appeared to be round and white in color.
