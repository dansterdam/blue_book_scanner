The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch shows some curved lines and shapes that could be interpreted as a representation of a UFO or other aerial phenomenon. However, as the image does not contain any human faces, I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

Transcribing the text from the document:

ENID, OKLAHOMA
8 October 1954
At approximately 7:00 p.m. on the evening of 8 October 1954, Mr. X, an employee of the Phillips Petroleum Company, encountered an unidentified flying object while driving on Highway 81 approximately 5 miles south of Enid, Oklahoma.

According to Mr. X's report, the object appeared to be disc-shaped and was observed hovering at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. The object was seen to maneuver rapidly, changing direction and altitude several times. After approximately 10 minutes, the object accelerated and disappeared from view.

Mr. X provided a rough sketch of the object he observed, which is included with this report.
