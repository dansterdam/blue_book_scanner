AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

RESTRICTED UNCLASSIFIED

Randall C. Smith and five witnesses
Meteorite or strange and unusual natural phenomena?
10 May 1953
1. Lt. C. Smith was 29 minutes airborne in a C-45 aircraft and observed a strange light, which he first thought to be a meteorite, but which upon closer observation proved to be a "stationary self-luminous object" of various colors.

2. This object passed in the near vicinity of the aircraft and was observed to be a definite structured object rather than a natural phenomena. It was observed to have a distinct spherical shape. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes.

3. Captain Smith considered this object to be a flying disc or unusual aircraft. The object did not show any normal aircraft characteristics such as wings, tail surfaces, or exhaust.

4. Due to the nature of this observation and the credibility of the observer, it is felt that this report warrants further investigation. It is recommended that this report be given a degree of significance.
