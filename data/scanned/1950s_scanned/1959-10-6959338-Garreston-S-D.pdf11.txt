The handwritten text states the following:

"The saucer shaped object was observed by two witnesses ...  The object was described as being approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and about 12-15 feet in depth. It had what appeared to be a row of windows around the middle. The object hovered in one position for approximately 5 minutes before moving slowly to the right and disappearing over the horizon.  The witnesses were unable to determine the exact color of the object but it appeared to have a metallic or aluminum type finish. No noise was heard from the object. The object was observed at an approximate altitude of 1000-2000 feet and at a distance of 1/2 mile from the witnesses. On the night of the observation the sky was clear with no clouds and a full moon."
