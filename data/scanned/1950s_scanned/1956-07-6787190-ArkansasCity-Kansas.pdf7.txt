10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING                 11. COMMENTS

One (1) object, like a star, appearing like a large light bulb, orange with green points,
estimated to be at an altitude of 5 to 6,000 feet. First seen at an azimuth of 80 degrees.

Due to the distance between the location of the observer and the nearest ATSS-
field unit this sighting will not be investigated. A limited investigation 
by this headquarters revealed that winds-
aloft in the area of the sighting at the
time of the sighting corresponded exactly 
to the course of the object. It is the 
opinion of this headquarters that this 
sighting was probably generated by 
a ballon from Dodge City, Kansas, or 
possibly a balloon from Wichita.
