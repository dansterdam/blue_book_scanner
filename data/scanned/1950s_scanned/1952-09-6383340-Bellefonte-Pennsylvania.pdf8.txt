AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
CLASSIFICATION: Unidentified flying objects (saucer type
AREA ASSISTANCE: Centralia Air Force Station, Pa.
DATE-TIME GROUP: 14 September 1952
SUBJECT: Unidentified flying object sighting reported by Captain, Civil Air Patrol Cessna.
(SUMMARY: Senior observer pilot reports visual observation of unusual object. Unusual appearance and behavior. Duration 3 minutes.)
DETAILS: 
On 14 September 1952, Captain ... of the Civil Air Patrol Cessna reported sighting an unidentified flying object while on a routine training flight over the Susquehanna River area near Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.
Captain ... reported seeing an unidentified flying object, elliptical in shape, which appeared to be hovering over the Susquehanna River below him. As he approached to investigate, the object suddenly accelerated and attained a high rate of speed, estimating it to be around 1,000 mph, as it streaked out of sight towards the southwest. 
The object was described as being approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, with a bright metallic surface which reflected sunlight. No trail or exhaust was observed. The object appeared to give off a pulsating or flashing light. As it accelerated, the object seemed to change shape slightly, becoming more elliptical.
Both observers maintained that the sound came from the direction of the object. However, they reported that he did not notice anything unusual at that time. The length of the observation was timed at three minutes.
Weather at the time was clear, with visibility ranging from 20 to 30 miles. Winds were from the west at 15-20 knots.
