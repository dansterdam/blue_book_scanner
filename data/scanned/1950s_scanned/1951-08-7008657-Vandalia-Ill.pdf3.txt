Strange Object in Sky M 
Baffles Local Airmen tr

It wasn't a conventional type airplane! But whatever it was, it puzzled Sgt. 
Warren C. Hagmann, pilot, and SAC Sgt. Albon Reece, observer, as they spotted it soaring through the air Monday night.
The object, which Sgt. Hagmann said was "blinding intensity" when I first noticed it over the southwestern corner of Vandalia, had paled by the time it disappeared into the distant haze, the Leader reported.
"I had just taxied out onto the runway preparatory to take off," Sgt. Hagmann explained, "when I noticed the light. It was between 8 and 8:30 p.m. I called over to Sgt. Reece, who was on the ground, and we both watched it."
Sgt. Hagmann said the light was first noticed almost directly over the home of Albert Drozdic, and to Paul Reese and asked them to take a look.
The lighted object disappeared into the west and we decided to continue with my flight plans," William Hagmann said.
"Shortly after I had taken off, I noticed the light again, approaching my plane. It came up about half way, then suddenly veered off and disappeared." Hagmann said he made two more passes, seeing the light twice before heading toward Greenville. "I followed it out over the country and it made a circle and came back toward Vandalia. I saw it over the country for about 30,000 feet and it was just a speck then."
"It was all very spooky," the Vandalia airman continued. "The light was on the tail of it, and there was a small red light on the top. Probably some kind of craft from Scott Field making a test."
The lighted object which appeared to have a 10 to 12 inch lens, was also seen by Dwight Kerr in St. Elmo the same evening.
