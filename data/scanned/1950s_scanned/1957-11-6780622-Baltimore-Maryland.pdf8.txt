The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a report from the United States Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects. The document is a letter dated November 10, 1958, from Lawrence J. Tacker, the Executive Officer of the Public Information Division of the Office of Information Services, to a redacted recipient in Baltimore, Maryland.

The text in the document is as follows:

10 November 1958

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your thorough search of Air Force Project Blue Book files fails to disclose further evidence that the object reported on 1 December 1957 was a conventional object in the Baltimore area.

Further, our files indicate there were no other sightings reported from other sources in the Baltimore area on that date.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
