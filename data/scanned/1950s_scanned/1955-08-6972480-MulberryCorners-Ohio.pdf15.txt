The image contains a sketch of what appears to be a classic flying saucer-type UFO. The UFO is depicted with a domed top and a flatter bottom, having a protruding section with a door slid open, where a kind of platform can be seen. The craft is drawn over a textured surface, which might suggest grass or ground, with trees or vegetation in the background. There is an estimate of size provided as "30' ESTIMATED." Additionally, there is some text written on the sides:

- On the top left, partially cut off by the image edge, it reads "MULBERRY CORNERS SCHOOL." On the top right, it says "ROTATING BEACON TREES LINE."
- On the right of the craft, there is a note that says, "THERE WAS A GREEN LIGHT FROM EDGE. I SAW A YELLOW LIGHT INSIDE."

Below the UFO, additional notes read:
- "TRACING MADE FROM
  ORIGINAL DRAWING
  HE QUOTES "
- "A DOOR SLID OPEN HAD SOME KIND
  OF A PLATFORM COME OUT."

This is a transcription of all the visible text included in the sketch.
