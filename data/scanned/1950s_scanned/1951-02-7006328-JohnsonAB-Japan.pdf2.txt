REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT

SUMMARY: (Give details of sighting or other report. Give approximate time, location, description, direction of movement, etc.)

1. At approximately 1715/I, 1 February 1951, an F-82 aircraft of the 339th Fighter Squadron, Misawa Air Base, Japan (39-12N - 141-20E) took off to fly a routine alert.

2. As the aircraft was climbing to an altitude of 6000', an unidentified object at an altitude of 6000' was observed. This object was moving at a speed much greater than the F-82 and was traveling in a straight line through a series of turns (3) or four (4) 360 degree turns in the space of approximately one minute. The object was silvery in color and circular in shape, approximately the size of a C-47 airplane. After the turns had been completed, the object was at an altitude of 3000' and disappeared 1302/I. After the aircraft leveled off, the pilot reported the object to the operations officer.

3. Weather at time of sighting was clear with no moon. Surface winds were 30° at 22 knots. At 6000' winds were 220° at 40 knots and at 14,000' winds were 230° at 45 knots.

4. The Meteorological Section of the 543rd AAA Gun Battalion, which is located at Johnson Air Base, 22 miles NW of Tokyo, reported 10 minutes prior to the object's appearance at 1302/I that weather conditions were normal with no unusual phenomena.

5. The pilot and radar observer stated that they had observed another aircraft which was approaching Johnson Air Base prior to sighting the object. At no time were they able to establish positive identification on the object.
