1. PURPOSE: The publication is designed for the use of Ground Observer Corps personnel and is published to familiarize observers with common phenomena which are sometimes misinterpreted as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's).

2. DEFINITIONS:
a. Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) - Relates to any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.
b. Familiar Objects - Include balloons, astronomical bodies, birds, etc.

3. OBJECTIVE: Due to the prolonged observation of the sky during both daylight and night time hours, familiar objects such as meteors, aircraft, balloons, astronomical bodies, searchlights, birds, etc., will be frequently observed by GOC personnel. Due to atmospheric conditions (temperature inversions, dust, clouds, etc.), reflections, sound (or absence of sound), size, and speed, these familiar objects may sometimes be misinterpreted as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's).
