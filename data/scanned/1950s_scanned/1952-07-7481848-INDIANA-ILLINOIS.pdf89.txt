Request 8 (Illinois) 
In a halo of many colors - 
Surrounded by a mist
Illuminated - somewhat - it
glowed and pulsed as it moved slowly in the sky

It moved along a curved path
Occasionally it would stop and hover still for a few seconds, then resume its slow paced movements.
On occasions it would blaze up brightly and dimly as if controlled by some outside force. 
At times it appear to distort into strange and unusual shapes, then revert back to its normal shape.
The object appeared intelligently controlled and was observed for almost 45 minutes before disappearing from sight.
