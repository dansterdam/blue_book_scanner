SUMMARY: (Based on the observed and reported reactions of other persons, not personal observations) During the conduct of mission IC-52, the pilot-observer of a T-33 aircraft was alerted to the presence of an unidentified flying object. This object was first observed traveling at a speed greatly in excess of that of the T-33 aircraft. The object maneuvered in a manner which indicated controlled flight and remained in the area for a period of approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from the radar scope in a position reciprocal to the T-33 aircraft and remained visible.

Inasmuch as no aircraft or other object was in a position to produce a shadow on the radar scope, it is the belief of the observer that this was an electronic phenomenon reflecting such an image. No further investigation was considered.
