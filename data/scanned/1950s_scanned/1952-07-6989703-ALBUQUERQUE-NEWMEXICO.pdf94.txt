The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document that is partially redacted. The text that can be seen states "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom of the page, and mentions "the University of California" and that the document is "CLOSED".

Text contained in the document:
