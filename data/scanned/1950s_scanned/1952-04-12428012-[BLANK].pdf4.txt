The German V-2, a "ballistic" or bullet-like missile as contrasted to the aircraft-configuration type, was a much larger weapon. Its range also, however, was short, being about one hundred sixty five nautical miles.

In the United States, work on guided missiles has been going on with ever-increasing rapidity. The near-operational state of the MATADOR is probably well known to you all. This, a winged, non-ballistic missile, is given a range of five hundred nautical miles. Others of generally similar type, such as the SNARK and the NAVAHO, are projected for development between 1954 and 1958, and will have greatly increased ranges up to five thousand five hundred miles. 

Also, in the U.S. program are rocket-powered ballistic missiles of the same general type as the V-2 but with much greater range. It is estimated that with continuing development effort we will have by 1960 a multi-stage ballistic missile capable of carrying a mass destruction warhead five thousand five hundred nautical miles.

Guided missile work is also going on in other countries, of course. The Soviets are known to have shown great interest in the German V-1
