CSAF ITEM 7 /RESTRICTED/ 
FROM AFOIN-V-TC
FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND ACTION.

AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED 
NEAR ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA, AT 1805 EDT, 15 
AUG 51, BY LT COL M.D. WILLIS, USN, AND
HIS WIFE. THIS OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS A 
"FROSTY SILVERY" OVAL-SHAPED 
OBJECT OF APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN LENGTH 
TRAVELLING AT HIGH SPEED AT 2,000 - 4,000 FEET. 
LT COL WILLIS REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO THE COMMAND 
POST AT THE PENTAGON.

IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THE OBSERVATION WAS A
REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS FROM AN AIRCRAFT
FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF 6,000 FEET TO 15,000 
FEET AND A SPEED OF 150 MILES PER HOUR TO 
425 MILES PER HOUR, DEPENDING UPON THE
DISTANCE THE OBJECT FROM THE OBSERVER.

THE REPORTED "APPARENT ALTITUDE OF 2,000 FEET - 
4,000 FEET" IS JUDGED TO BE INCORRECT, 
CONSIDERING THE OTHER OBSERVATIONS MADE BY
LT COL M.D. WILLIS. THIS INTERVIEW WAS
CONDUCTED BY LT COL M.D. WILLIS. AFOIN-V/TC.
