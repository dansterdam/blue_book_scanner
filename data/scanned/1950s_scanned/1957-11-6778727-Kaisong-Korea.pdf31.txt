I was on the road about 1:15 A.M. on a bright, clear night. I saw a bright light up ahead of me. At first I thought it was a car, but as I got closer, I could see it was not. The light was 50 to 75 feet across and about 30 feet off the ground, hovering above the road. As I approached it, the light appeared to be rotating counterclockwise and moving very slowly from east to west. The light was so bright that I had to shade my eyes in order to see it clearly. It seemed to be traveling from west to northeast because my trail was coming from southeast. As it moved, it would occasionally disappear, then reappear a short distance away. This happened several times, as though it were going in and out of clouds, although the sky was clear. It gave off a very bright light for perhaps 5 or 6 seconds, then it would dim to a dull glow and almost disappear, then brighten up again. This cycle was repeated several times while I watched it. The light did not appear to be attached to anything, and I could not hear any sound from it. It was at about the same level the entire time I watched it, and seemed to be hovering. After I had watched it for about 5 minutes, it suddenly shot up into the sky at a tremendous speed and disappeared.
