IFO form continued

Went through the country around outside the city it remained in sight for about 7 or 8 minutes and then it seemed obscured by buildings. As it went along it seemed to give off a glow. It appeared to me as a single solid lighted object as big as Jupiter.

What could it be. I have never seen anything like it before. It moved in a straight line without any erratic course changes. I have considered meteors, satellites, balloons, and all the known type of lights, but his does not seem to fit any of them.

The time was about 10:30 PM. The weather was clear and calm, no wind. There were a few scattered clouds around but never near the object. It moved about the speed of an airliner or jet. 

From your description and what I know of these incidents, I must say that this is a most interesting sighting. Unfortunately there is no photograph to support the report. But there are many reliable witnesses who have reported similar types of phenomena. Most of these cases remain unidentified and unexplained according to our present knowledge.

I hope you will be able to obtain further information on this sighting. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist in this investigation.

Sincerely yours,
George Gorman
