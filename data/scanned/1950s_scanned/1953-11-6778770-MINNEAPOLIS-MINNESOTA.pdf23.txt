UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
SUMMARY: An unidentified object was reported observed over Minneapolis, MN at approximately 6:06 PM, 30 November 1953. The object was described as round, white, and luminous, and was observed for about 20 minutes. It appeared to change color from white to yellow to green. Two (2) air force officers viewed the object. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of 3000 to 4000 feet. The object appeared to be the size of a basketball held at arm's length. No sound was heard. The object moved slowly in a straight line. The object disappeared from sight to the north.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: The reliability of the sources can be considered as good. Two of the sources are trained air force officers who have over seen reported any similar objects. All sources reported the object to be round, white and luminous, changing color from white to yellow to green. The object moved slowly in a straight line, was visible for about 20 minutes, and then disappeared from sight to the north. No other objects were reported in the vicinity. No further investigation appears warranted at this time.
