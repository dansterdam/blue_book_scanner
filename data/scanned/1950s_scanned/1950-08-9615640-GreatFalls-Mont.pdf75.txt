AFOIN-3
to Mr. A. M. Roshon, Santa Monica, California (Met)
Concerning your letter of 25 August 1950 regarding the case of how low this percentage may become. However, we wish to reiterate some of the conclusions of all these studies with regard to the phenomena:

1. There is a total lack of evidence that the phenomena observed are interplanetary or celestial in origin.
2. There is a total lack of evidence that they are interplanetary vehicles.
3. There is a total lack of evidence that they represent technological developments outside the range of present day scientific knowledge.
4. There is a total lack of evidence that they constitute any threat to the security of our country.

We must apologize for the delay in replying to your letter; unfortunately, we did not receive it until the 26th of April.

Sincerely,

HAROLD E. WATSON
Brigadier General, USAF
Commander
