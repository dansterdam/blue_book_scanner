Dear Sirs:

On October 23, 1959, I talked by telephone to a member of Langley's Group Operations, regarding an alleged sighting of a UFO which had been reported by observers at the Base on October 22, 1959. This individual contacted me and asked for the information which I had obtained about this sighting. 

In a telephone conversation on October 30, a Maj. S. G. Gull, of your office, could not inform me as to what subsequent action had been taken regarding this sighting. He indicated that he did not receive a copy of the Daily report of October 21, and assumed that no further action would be taken.

If no further investigative action on this case is contemplated by the Air Force authorities concerned, will you please tell me the reason for this decision?

Yours sincerely,
