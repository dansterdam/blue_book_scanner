SUBJECT: (U) Request for UFO Information

TO: (U) U.S.A.F. 4602D Air Intelligence Service Squadron (ADC) 
Box 712, 33rd Air Division  
Colorado Springs, Colorado

1. Attached herewith is a copy of USAF Technical Information Sheet containing data relating to a reported sighting.

2. In accordance with provisions of AFR 200-2, it is requested that the 4602D AISS consider a preliminary investigation of the alleged sightings, and the results made known to this headquarters.

3. Although there are no certain elements in the report to substantiate the existence of an interplanetary vehicle, the opinion of the Center that USAF UFO records indicate that some form of unidentified aerial activity was indeed present.

Mr. *** has claimed that he frequently sees the vehicle described in his report, although original sighting was over one year ago.

b. This sighting has been given prominence by the Aerial Research Center, a private UFO research organization, which seems to find this UFO in abundance.

c. Past experience has indicated organizations of this type often tend to the belief that the observation of the phenomenon was more significant than appears to be substantiated.

4. With reference to the evaluation of the observed UFO, a continuing assessment of the investigation should include the determination, if any, of "bomber-jet parallels" which tests were conducted in the vicinity of the sighted object.
