The result was not what we expected to be pulsating with a strange, irregular dimness and brilliant core blinding us five minutes, trying to figure out what we were seeing. Then the spaceship began to get smaller, simply assuming a size without moving. Smaller and smaller it became and in another five minutes it suddenly contracted into a planet. I believe it was Jupiter in the eastern sky.

When we studied what we were watching we began to try to figure out the evidence by which we determined the thing through id-field-glasses, and our best guess was that some of the planets of the solar system and their constant disturbance and temperature change caused by the passage of the jet was to blame for the strange aberration we had just witnessed. And we wondered if refraction of the golden light could cause the reds, greens, and blues. Since neither of us were in any form, we figured our observations were about as substantial as our feeble scientific understanding would.

It would seem a strange thing for most people may see flying saucers and be pro- but in their incomplete observations. Had a person with a supernatual takenantoafgoodlook, jumped in his car, and raced off at high speed, he would steadfastly have believed he had seen a flying saucer which was evidently observing the earth's preparatory to an attack from outer space.
