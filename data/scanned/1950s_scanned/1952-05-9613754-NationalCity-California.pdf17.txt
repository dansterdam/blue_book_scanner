The minute I noticed something my Arg - 3 caught my eye. I saw an object fast from left to right low in the sky. It appeared to me to be an unidentified flying object as I was unable to identify it. It first appeared as a pinpoint of light trailing a long white light or stream behind it. As it moved across my field of vision, it appeared to be an elongated oval object. It moved at a tremendous rate of speed and seemed to accelerate as it went from left to right. I watched it until it disappeared over the horizon. Its speed was unnatural and very fast. It was not an aircraft, satellite, or meteor as I am familiar with these objects in the sky. The light or stream behind it was also unlike anything I have ever seen. I have gone over the incident in my mind many times and I can find no explanation for what I saw. I was extremely impressed by the tremendous rate of speed and the unnatural movement of the object. I have no doubt that I saw an unidentified flying object. The incident occurred at approximately 10:15 p.m. on the evening of May 8, 1952 in National City, California. I am a reliable and rational observer, and have had some experience in observing objects in the sky, having served for several years in the Air Force. I have no reason to falsify or exaggerate this report, and I would be willing to cooperate fully in any investigation of this incident. The object was observed for approximately 30 to 45 seconds as it traversed my field of vision.
