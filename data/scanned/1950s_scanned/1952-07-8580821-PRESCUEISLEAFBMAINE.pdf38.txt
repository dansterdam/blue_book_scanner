STATEMENT

At 12:10 a.m. 7 July 1952, I reported to Sgt. Janes T. Cade, USAF, Prescue Isle, Maine.

We were coming from Monroe 1950, coming down the road. As we neared the car, we saw a bright light in the sky coming towards us at a fast speed. It was red and orange in color and was shaped like a football. As it came closer, it seemed to slow down and it suddenly stopped in mid-air. It then dimmed down and then got bright again. It seemed to be about 1/2 mile away from us, and about 1,000 feet up. We watched it for about 3 or 4 minutes. Then it suddenly dimmed down and disappeared.
