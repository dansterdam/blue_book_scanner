South East Florida - Miami

APL 200-14. 29 April 1952, FLIGHT-T

The object was first sighted to the south of Miami, Florida, about 5:25 p.m. EST, visible to the civilian observer for about 2 minutes. It was described as a fiery, luminous object or "flying light" which was observed for some time in the sky west of Miami as about 20-25 thousand feet high. The intervals during which time it was visible from the first sighting was about 30 seconds. What appeared to be a cloud formation was noted, and then the object was again visible for about 30 seconds. This performance was repeated several times. The object did not give off any trail or vapor smear, and apparently made no sound. The weather conditions were clear, and the object's position was easily observed against a background of clear sky. Throughout the observation, no evasive action was taken, and the object moved at a fairly steady rate, the speed of which was not estimated. The object was very bright and appeared to be about 2 or 3 times the size of a star. The civilian observer stated that he was familiar with aircraft and their performance, and that this object was definitely not an aircraft of any type known to him.

This office has no comment on the significance of the report other than that the object presents a very bright light or luminous object which was not readily identifiable as a conventional aircraft.
