The image on this page of the Project Blue Book document contains two sketches, but no photographs.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" at the highest point of the object as it appeared to you when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where you last saw it. This will show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it and where it was when you last saw it. 

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
