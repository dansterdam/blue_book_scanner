20 July 1958

Dear Mr. H:

A thorough search of the UFO files at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio failed to reveal the two cases you refer to in your letter of August 7th.

The closest we could come to the 1953 date you suggest is a sighting from a civilian aircraft over McKinney, Texas on 21 July 1953. The individual who made the observation was apparently a balloon. I hope that this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
