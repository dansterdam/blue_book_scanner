CASE NUMBER: 6978127
DATE: JULY 1953
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: ATLANTA, GEORGIA
DETAILS:
On the evening of July 2, 1953, several witnesses reported seeing a bright light in the sky over Atlanta, Georgia. The light was described as being oval in shape and moving erratically. Attempts were made to photograph the object, but the results were inconclusive.
The case was investigated by officers from the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book, a program established to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The investigation included interviews with the witnesses and an examination of the photographic evidence.
Despite the efforts of the investigators, the true nature of the object observed that evening remains unknown. The case was classified as "unidentified" and added to the Project Blue Book files.
