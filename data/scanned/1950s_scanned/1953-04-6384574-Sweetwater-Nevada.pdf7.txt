The document contains two sketches, not photographs. The first sketch depicts a bare, curved horizon line with an indication for where to mark "A" when the object was first seen and "B" where the object was last seen, but no actual markings are present in the sketch, and "N/A" is written to the right. The second sketch is larger and shows a street view with a person standing in the middle of the road, looking towards the horizon, also with a semi-circular border indicating the field of view. There is a smaller inset sketch in the top right corner of the second drawing showing how to mark "A" and "B" in the main sketch. Again, "N/A" is written to the right of the main sketch.

Here's the text from the document:
