UNCLASSIFED 
This is to certify that an unidentified flying object was sighted in company of
'25 at approximately 2020 hours, MST, 9 Jan 1953 at Hilger, Montana.  The object vas sighted by me and, to the best of my knowledge, it was a flying saucer.  I was piloting a Farrier Anderson's air borne utility, in line of custom, and when I could not identify the object through normal means or it could not be continued tracked, I reported it immediately to my home base in Great Falls, Montana.

The object was about 100 yards away, and it came at me, and when it was approximately 100 to 150 feet away from me, the object stoped, hovered motionless, and then took off again to the northeast.  When out of sight, I estimate that I saw the object when it was five miles away, and it came to within approximately ten seconds, therefore I estimate the speed at 5000 miles per hour.
