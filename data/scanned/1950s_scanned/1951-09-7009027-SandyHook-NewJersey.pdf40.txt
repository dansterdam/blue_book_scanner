STATEMENT

17 September 1951

Lt Rogers pointed out the object to me. I sighted the object and estimated it was at an altitude of approximately 120 degrees. I saw the object was round and silver in color. Lt Rogers confirmed a part of the object was in the city, turning to approximately 120 degrees. I saw the object was found and I lost sight of the object as it disappeared out to sea.
