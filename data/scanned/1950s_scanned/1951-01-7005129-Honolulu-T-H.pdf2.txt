1. SYNOPSIS: Unidentified aircraft sighted in P-38 over inhabited area of island of Oahu, T.H. at 1220 hours Hawaiian Standard Time (HST), 7 January 1951.

2. DETAILS: At 1215 hours on 7 January 1951, Lt. H. viewed an extremely bright and metallic appearing object in the sky, which was intermittently motionless and traveling at a high rate of speed. At approximately 1220 hours (HST) on 7 January 1951, I was sitting in my parked car at the Hickam Field Drive-In Theater, 1600 Moanalua Road, Honolulu, T.H., when a large, white, cigar-shaped object passed overhead at a very fast rate of speed, moving in a horizontal path from East to West. The object appeared suddenly, traveled a large mass of muddy-orange colored flame at its trailing edge, and disappeared over the ocean approximately four (4) miles from my position. The size of the object was estimated to be some 40-50 feet long, and the mass of flame trailing it was estimated to be about 25 feet in length. The speed of the object was extremely rapid, and it did not appear to make any sound. The mass of flame was moving at a very fast rate of speed in an east-to-west direction. I could not distinguish any form of solid body such as a fuselage, wing or tail surfaces. The mass of flame appeared to be the only part visible. The object appeared suddenly, traveled through three (3) clouds, and disappeared.
