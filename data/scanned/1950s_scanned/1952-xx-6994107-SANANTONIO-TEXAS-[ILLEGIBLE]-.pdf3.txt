The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

1. At approximately 1100 hours, 25 July 1952, the Flight Intelligence Office at Randolph Air Force Base was notified by phone that an unidentified object had been observed over the San Antonio area. The object was reported to be in sight for some minutes, and according to the witness, was flying at a high rate of speed and at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. The object was lost to sight and was not seen again. 

2. The interrogation revealed that an unusual light of very high intensity was seen by AIC Pratt who was on duty in the Randolph Central Tower during the night of 25 July 1952. The object described was a light of brilliant intensity, apparently some distance away, which appeared across to the southwest at an angle of about 40 to 50 degrees from the horizontal, remained stationary for several minutes, and then disappeared rapidly. It was observed to be a steady light, neither blinking nor pulsating, and was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. AIC Pratt was unable to determine its exact location or size, but stated that it seemed to be a considerable distance away. He was unable to observe any details of shape or structure, as the light was of such brilliant intensity that it obscured any such details. He was unable to observe any trail or exhaust, nor could he hear any sound associated with the object. He was unable to determine its exact time of appearance or disappearance, as he was absorbed in another task at the time. 

3. The object was first sighted at 0033, Central Standard Time, on 25 July 1952. It was observed for approximately 5 to 7 minutes. No sound was heard, and no trail or exhaust was visible. The object appeared to be motionless and at one point appeared to be slightly larger than a star. The pilot of the C-47, whose report was received earlier, stated that his sighting occurred about 30 minutes later than the sighting by AIC Pratt. The pilot's report stated that the object was of a brilliant white color, with a distinct reddish-orange glow around the perimeter. The pilot estimated the object's altitude to be approximately 30,000 feet, and stated that it appeared to be much larger than a star. The pilot further stated that the object remained stationary for some time, and then suddenly disappeared at a very high rate of speed.
