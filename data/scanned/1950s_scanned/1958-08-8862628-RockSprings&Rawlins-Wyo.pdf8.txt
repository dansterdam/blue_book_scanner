INF. ONLY ALAMOGARDO, NEW MEXICO 8 AUG 1956
FLYING SAUCERS' FORMED CLUSTER, OBSERVERS SAY
Alamogardo, N.M. (UPI) - A group of unidentified flying objects "clustered like a star" and hovered for more than an hour near there Friday night and then suddenly "broke apart and disappeared," witnesses said yesterday.
A spokesman for the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization said a total of nine persons had reported seeing the mysterious objects.
A check of nearby military bases, airports and the United States Weather Bureau disclosed that there were no jets or weather balloons aloft at or near the time of the sightings, between 10:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., filter center director L. J. Lorenzen said.
An employee of the Alamogardo school system, Isaac Carswell, told the filter center that he "couldn't believe what I was seeing. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself."
