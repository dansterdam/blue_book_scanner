Mrs. __ stated that the object was north of her position. In the words of Mrs. __ the object was "brilliant metallic, as aluminum or highly burnished metal that reflected the light, shape round, flat or disk-like, and appeared to turn slightly to the left or northwest and then turning the appearance changed and the light was no longer reflected by the object and it appeared smaller and dark gray in color, but no change in speed." The object left no definite trail; however, on the edge of the left side of the object a misty "halo" could be seen. The object flew a straight course and no noise could be heard. The total time of observation was about sixty (60) seconds.
