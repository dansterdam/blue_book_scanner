Dear Sir:
Reference is made to your letter (ATIC-ATT-A-5) dated June 19, 1953 relative to the wind aloft above St. Louis at approximately 0350 Z.
We find no record of special wind measurements from the St. Louis Weather Bureau station at 0350 Z on June 13, 1953. The regular observation at 0400 Z on June 13, 1953 showed that the wind at the surface was most likely calm or very light and variable. Any wind aloft at that time would have been too light to measure accurately by the equipment available at this station.
The regular 0400 Z wind observation on June 13, 1953 is as follows:
Altitude Direction Force
(Thous. Feet) (Degrees) (Knots)
1 130 10
2 110 10
3 120 10
4 150 10
5 160 8
6 0 0
7 50 10
8 60 12
9 330 20
10 330 25
11 330 28
12 330 25
13 330 20
14 280 35
15 270 35
16 270 34
Very truly yours,
