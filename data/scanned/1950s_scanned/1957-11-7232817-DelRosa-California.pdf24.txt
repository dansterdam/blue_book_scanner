COMPLAINANT
IN LAGP WAS INITIALLY DISPATCHED TO LEVELLAND, TEXAS TO INVESTIGATE. SIGNIFICANT TO POINT OUT THAT ALTHOUGH THIS ORGANIZATIONAL CONTINUOUSLY IMPLIES HAS NOT QUALIFIED TO INVESTIGATE, OR DO NOT RELEASE THEIR FINDINGS, IT HAS NOT MADE ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING ITS OWN FINDINGS OR CONCLUSIONS. DESIRABLE IF SUCH WOULD MADE ITS FINDINGS KNOWN FIRST, THEN USAF COULD QUERY HOW ANALYSIS PERFORMED AND CONCLUSIONS DERIVED. IN ALL PROBABILITY USAF WILL HAVE FIRST STATEMENTS SOON, THEN WILL MAKE THE USUAL CHARGES.
