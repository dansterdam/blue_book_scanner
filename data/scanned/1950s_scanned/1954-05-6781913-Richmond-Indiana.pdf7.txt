RICHMOND, INDIANA
24 MAY 1954

At 12:25 (EST) on 24 May 1954, an Air Force Major, flying a photographic mapping mission near Richmond, Indiana, observed and photographed what appeared to be a large, high-intensity light moving below his aircraft. The light traveled a distance of six miles over the ground at a speed twice that of the aircraft.

Intensive studies of the photographs were made. The studies indicated that the light was not a material object. Extensive investigations, exploring all possible clues and avenues of approach to the probable nature of the object were made.

The ground under both the path taken by the aircraft and the object were examined with a fine tooth comb. Photographs were made of the area for a study of ground characteristics or other clues. Aircraft flights, radar units and other operations were immediately checked carefully, with negative results.

The data was submitted to a panel of scientists and specialists, which included astronomers, meteorologists, and a physicist. It was concluded that the sighting was a very rare natural phenomenon caused by the reflection of the sun's rays upon an ice-crystal platelet formation.
