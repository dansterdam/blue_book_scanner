PART III - 25

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The opinion of the preparing officer is that, while the sighting was caused by stars (not strong enough to appear as the reported objects), the presence of the objects did cause an amount of confusion and could possibly be explained as an optical illusion during the sighting.
2. The presence of the very bright stars and the illumination of the objects near them could probably explain why the objects were thought to have appeared bigger, brighter, and closer than they actually were. It is possible that the intensity and size of the stars caused the illusion that they were closer objects.
3. It is difficult to explain the disappearance and reappearance of the objects, but the fact that they were not shown on the radarscope, and that no aircraft were mentioned as in the vicinity would probably rule out any known type of aircraft. An optical phenomenon could possibly explain the sighting.

COMMENTS OF THE APPROVING OFFICER:
Concurs with the report of the officer that this sighting was caused by stars. It is felt that the radar paints in no way were connected to the visual sighting. There is no evidence to substantiate the Approving Officer's conclusion.
