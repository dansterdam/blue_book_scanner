Memorandum for Record

On 21 Jan 53, Capt. E. J. Ruppelt conducted the 4/T of the 27th Air Division, 4707th Air Defense Wing. On this flight, the ground was noted as being free of the glints from the sun that had marked many of the sightings during the past week or so. He stated that the 27th Air had only one sighting during this period. Fighters were scrambled but no contact was made. A cross-check with the GCI showed a weather balloon.

He stated that all during the period of these reports, 28, 29, and 30 January, no unidentified radar tracks correlated with the UFO reports. He knew nothing of the Northern report except that a newspaper said that the GCI tower's Santa Monica had seen four or five UFOs on 1/17/53. He had no knowledge of the Marine indication.
