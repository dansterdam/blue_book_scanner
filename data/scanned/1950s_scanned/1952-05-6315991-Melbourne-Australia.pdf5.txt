REPORT ON UNUSUAL SIGHTINGS ON 8TH MAY, 1952

1. It is desired to advise that on 6th May, 1952, the Commander T. L. CAMPBELL (RAAF) jointly investigated newspaper reports of "unusual sightings" on 6th May, 1952.

2. The witness said he saw a bright light in the sky which appeared to be stationary, or circling very slowly, and after a while the light disappeared. He said it appeared to move away from him and the light seemed to go out. On another occasion he said he suddenly saw a bright light moving across the sky. He said it seemed to be moving very fast and disappeared behind clouds. He said the whole episode lasted from 5 to 10 minutes and he did not hear any sound.

3. When asked to describe the objects, he said "it looked like a luminous object, similar to a shooting star, but seemed much larger and brighter than a normal shooting star". The witness was emphatic that the object was unlike a meteor or shooting star. He said it was more like an aircraft with no apparent wings or tail, and trailed a long bright "exhaust" which appeared to flare up at times. The witness said "there was no doubt that it was a solid object and not just a light". The object appeared to hover for a while and then move off at high speed.

4. In reference to the first sighting, the witness stated "as the object moved away from me, the light seemed to go out and not merely disappear over the horizon". He added "I have been about 900 miles per hour and I know what a fast aircraft looks like, but this was completely different to anything I have ever seen before".
