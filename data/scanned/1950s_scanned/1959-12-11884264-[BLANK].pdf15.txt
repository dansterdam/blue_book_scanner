SUBJECT: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

1.  During December 1959, a study was conducted by AFCIN-LE, ATIC, recommending the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to the Air Research and Development Command. It was pointed out that 12 years experience with the UFO program had failed to reveal any threat to national security, and that any value from the program would be derived from exploitation of its scientific and technical aspects. After review of the program, ARDC declined the transfer indicating the data available was qualitative and therefore was of limited scientific value. It is the opinion of ATIC that the data available is limited qualitatively only because of the volume of UFO traffic required to be handled by this organization. If the cases which give indication of possessing scientific and/or technical value were to be exploited fully, it is believed that they would be of benefit to the USAF. It was further pointed out in the study, and by ADIC, that the great majority of these cases are valuable to the Air Force only as statistics and as they relate to the public relations aspects of the program. The Air Force must continue its responsibility for operation of this project; however, in view of the fact that this program, for the most part, deals with public relations it is suggested that it be transferred to SAFOI. SAFOI is presently responsible for the public relations portion of the program and this transfer would only entail expansion of the branch within SAFOI responsible for this function.
