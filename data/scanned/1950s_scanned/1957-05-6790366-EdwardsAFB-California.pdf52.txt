The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a cover sheet for a detailed analysis of a UFO sighting at Edwards Air Force Base on 2 May 1957. The text on the cover sheet provides an overview of the analysis, which includes:

a. Study of the observer's UFO questionnaire, the official UFO report from Edwards AFB, the geographical factors, and the elements of time, elevations, bearings and meteorological conditions pertaining to the sighting.
b. Analysis of the theodolite photographs submitted, with correlation to the known facts.
c. Evaluation of the sources (observers).
d. Analysis of UFO report and questionnaire data, which was accomplished by the observers but not received until 23 May 1957, some considerable time after the incident had occurred.
