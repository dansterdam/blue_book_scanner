This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically an item related to SECURITY INFORMATION regarding sightings of "SLIPS" (which I assume refers to some kind of unidentified aerial phenomena) on 29/30 November.

The text in the document is as follows:
