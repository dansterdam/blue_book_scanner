WASHINGTON. Dec. 13 (P) -- Maj. Charles E. Yeager, the Air Force test pilot who last month broke the sound barrier, said yesterday he reached a speed of 1,650 miles an hour in his X-1 rocket-powered aircraft.  
Physically, there is no sensation," Yeager said in a news conference in the Pentagon. "Actually, you wouldn't know you've broken the sound barrier unless you had an instrument."  
  
Pilot Tells  
Of Flight at  
1,600M.P.H.  
  
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 (AP) --  
Maj. Charles E. Yeager, who made the first flight to crack the sound barrier, said today he reached a top speed of 1,650 miles an hour in his X-1 rocket-powered plane.  
Yeager said the 35-29 seconds it takes the plane to climb to 50,000 feet is "a great experience."  
He fired off three of the four rockets in the plane on the record flight that was disclosed yesterday. Yeager said it climbed in sort of an arc, leveled off and then "went straight up and shot if off.'  
He retained his maximum speed for an instant before he shut off the power.  
Peering from the cockpit, he said: "My eyeballs sure got back when those rocket motors went off."  
The Air Force announced yesterday that Maj. Yeager has set a new speed record of 1,650 miles an hour, breaking the old record of 671 miles an hour set by an American test pilot last month.
