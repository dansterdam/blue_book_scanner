CO.LD EXISTE THE CITY PROPOUNDED BY A RECENT REPORT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED, and impossible to tell from stated write up whether sighting a natural phenomena or actually a UFO .
THEY DID REPORT ON THEIR INVESTIGATION, AND STATED THAT THE MILITARY OFFICER AND CIVILIAN OBSERVERS WHO MADE INITIAL REPORT WERE CONVINCED THAT WHAT THEY SAW WAS SOME FORM OF UNUSUAL AND UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL VEHICLE. HOWEVER, OFFICIAL CONCLUSION WAS THAT SIGHTING WAS PROBABLY DUE TO REFLECTION OR REFRACTION EFFECT IN ATMOSPHERE, POSSIBLY FROM A DISTANT PHENOMENON NOT RELATED TO ANY OBJECT IN IMMEDIATE AREA. FOR 2000 INCIDENTS AND MORE OF SIMILAR REPORTS RECEIVED, AND MOST CONCLUDED AS NATURAL CAUSES .
AT ANY RATE, THE EVIDENCE AND DETAILS IN THESE CASES ARE STILL CONSIDERED BY THEM TO BE INADEQUATE TO SUBSTANTIATE EXISTENCE OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, AND THAT VERY LITTLE, IF ANY, SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN STUDY OF THIS TYPE OF PHENOMENA. COULD BE THAT SUBSTANTIATION OF ICBM IS A LITTLE MORE ESTABLISHED IN THE FACTS RECEIVED.
