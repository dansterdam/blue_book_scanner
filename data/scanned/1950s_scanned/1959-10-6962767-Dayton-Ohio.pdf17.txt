The image does not contain a photograph, but rather sketches and illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line to indicate the trajectory of an object that was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows two larger sketches - the one on the left depicts a person standing on a road, while the one on the right shows a person silhouetted against a domed sky.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that the curved line is to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
