Unidentified Aircraft Sighting
12:00 hours 24 August, 1953

This is to confirm a verbal statement made by the Superintendent of Air Navigation to you on 24 August, 1953.

2. Mr. [REDACTED] reports as follows:
On 24 August, 1953, around 12:00 hours, he noticed a cloud building up in the vicinity of the Marine Base Workshops, Port Moresby. This cloud rapidly grew much larger, as though a southerly direction from Port Moresby, at a very great height.

3. Whilst this cloud, which grew in intensity for several minutes, was gradually diminishing in volume side as and assuming a much larger size, it appeared to take on the shape or possible form of some object, as it appeared slightly larger than the usual type of cloud formations. There was a very clearly defined vapour trail behind it until it finally disappeared with a rapid gain of altitude.

4. I had my movie camera with me and photographed the whole thing on the telephone lines. In an endeavour to ascertain what the object might have been, it appeared to me to be some type of very high speed aircraft.

As far as I know, Air Traffic Control knew of no aircraft movements in that area, and in any case, from the attitude of the object, it certainly could not have been a civil aircraft.

Weather conditions at the time were cloudless*.
