At 1900, OCT. 2 February 1953, I was in the CFC gunner's position of a B-26 type aircraft, number 9365, flying at an altitude of 25,000 feet. I was searching for fighter aircraft which were in the area. I saw a B-52 type aircraft at three (3) o'clock high.

As this aircraft passed, I noticed a silver object in its wake. I called on the interphone, "Does anyone see that silver object behind that B-52?"

I was answered by my right gunner saying, "Yes," which was one of us could identify the object. We both took gun camera pictures to confirm the sighting.

The object looked like a silver disk, first showing its circular side and then the flat side. It first appeared high at three (3) o'clock and was lost sight of four-thirty (4:30). I watched until it went out of sight.
