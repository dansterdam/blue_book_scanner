TEXT CONTENT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

19. ARE PERSONNEL FAMILIAR WITH THE EFFECTS CAUSED BY AN INTERFERING SIGNAL?
    [ ] YES [ ] NO

20. ARE PERSONNEL FAMILIAR WITH THE EFFECTS OF ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION (DUCTING EFFECTS) AS THEY
    PERTAIN TO THIS TYPE OF RADAR? [ ] YES [ ] NO 

21. HAS ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION (DUCTING EFFECTS) BEEN OBSERVED TO EXTEND THE RANGE OF THE
    GROUND CLUTTER OF THIS RADAR AT THIS SITE? [ ] YES [ ] NO

22. WAS ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION (DUCTING EFFECTS) EXTENDING THE RANGE OF THE GROUND CLUTTER AT
    THE TIME THE TARGET WAS OBSERVED? [ ] YES [ ] NO

23. HOW DID THE TARGET APPEAR IN SIZE AND SHAPE AS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT TARGETS?
    SAME SIZE AND SAME SPEED

24. PERFORMANCE OF TARGET:
    a. REMAINED CONSISTENT IN SIZE [ ] YES [ ] NO
    b. SPEED WAS CONSTANT [ ] YES [ ] NO 
    c. FOLLOWED CONSISTENT TRACK [ ] YES [ ] NO
    d. FUZZY COMPARED TO AIRCRAFT
       TARGET [ ] YES [ ] NO
    e. SAME AS AIRCRAFT TARGET [ ] YES [ ] NO

25. WERE OTHER TARGETS (KNOWN) OBSERVED IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME
    TIME? IF SO, DESCRIBE.

26. WHAT TYPE INDICATORS ("A" SCOPE, "B" SCOPE, ETC.) WERE USED TO FOLLOW THE TARGET?
    DESCRIBE THE SIGNAL:

27. WHAT WAS THE RADAR SCAN RATE? 3.3 R.P.M.

28. WHAT WAS THE FREQUENCY OF THE TRANSMITTER?
    UPPER BEAM 1.292 MEG. LOWER BEAM 1.259 MEG.

29. DID ANY OF THE OBSERVERS HAVE ANY OPINIONS AS TO THE NATURE OF THE TARGET?
    [ ] YES [ ] NO
    IF YES, GIVE THEIR NAMES AND OPINIONS BELOW.
    INITIAL OPINION OF OBSERVERS: COULD BE AIRCRAFT, POSSIBLY OF MEXICAN
    CIVILIAN, BUT NOT POSITIVE. ACCORDING TO THE CALIBRATION DATA, UNDER NORMAL
    CONDITIONS ALTITUDE OF AIRCRAFT WOULD BE BETWEEN 30,000 TO 40,000 FT.
