All of the witnesses are employed by the railroad and they have made us aware of the following observation "Why tell stories?" These inventions if they were only that would make us look bad in the eyes of our bosses. And also possibly jeopardize our individual job positions. 

An orange light in the fields.

Now we will continue on in a more pleasant mood and by this we refer to the fact that the next night some of the young people of the village were shooting firecrackers in the fields of Mr. Chatelain and we found amongst the fields some of these halfburned firecrackers by the fields but this was not another cause of confusion as the cause was understandable.

More interesting is the observation that was conducted the night of May 12 and May 11 by Mr.& Mrs._____ that live on the side of the Miraumont highway a little above the other witnesses. They had not spoken to the press and other officials. 

Their statement is as follows:
"On May 10,we did not see anything as we were asleep____ states.But the following evening I was awakened at approximately 3 in the morning (and at our age sleep is one of our weaknesses) at I passed by the window that passes through the room and is located in a South-West direction. I was attracted by a rather brilliant orange light that I perceived through the window. It was the same in diameter as the moon and the range of the glare reached the___ home that is to the left of the Cafeteria at approximately 80 meters. I woke my wife up and told her to come and observe this strange light. She did and then after a few seconds the light disappeared and did not relight so that we went back to bed.

Mrs._____ confirmed the testimony of her husband. At this timeo of the night it is rather strange that one should believe that it could have been a stray firecracker and no one else would have observed it! At the_____ farm we found out that no one had seen anything strange and that all told they had all slept straight through the entire night. This surpassed the time that the Laines had been aroused by the strange light.
