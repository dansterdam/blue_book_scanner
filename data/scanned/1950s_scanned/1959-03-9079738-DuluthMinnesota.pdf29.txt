USAF 715
This appears to be the south or southwest of the city, but I am not certain of the exact location. The object was estimated to be about 30 yards long, cigar-shaped, and was about 200 yards higher in altitude than the twin engine airplane that I saw. The object appeared to be moving at about 400 or 500 miles per hour, and I watched it for about 20 to 30 seconds. It disappeared into the distance at a high rate of speed.
This appears to be the description of the observed unidentified flying object. The document does not contain any other details or information beyond this textual description.
