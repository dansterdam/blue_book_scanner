Our view was obstructed beyond this point as the mountain ridge became higher.
5 shooting stars, these 5 were counted as a shooting star. It started behind the mountain ridge and came from the north. It made about 5 degrees of arc and was a brilliant white color. As it disappeared back to the northeast, there was a slight puff of smoke which lasted about 2 seconds. I saw 4 more objects following the path of the first one. They were not as brilliant nor as large as the first, but were a blue-white color. They came from the northeast at about the same angle as the first one and disappeared to the southwest. Space vehicles were seen at the time, speed was estimated at about 2000 miles per hour.
