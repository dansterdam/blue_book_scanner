The image does not contain any visible photographs or images. It appears to be a typed document containing text describing an incident related to a "RADAR MAINTENANCE, 727TH ACAW SQUADRON, FORD LAND, MISSOURI, APPROXIMATELY 21525 HOURS ZULU".

The text describes the dispatch of five airmen to a site where a patch of ground was found to be "literally pulverized" with "dirt agitated on surface" and "rocks, small in size, were disturbed in this spot". The document also mentions an object seen in the sky that appeared to be "death by something nearly following" but was undisturbed with no signs of burning, scouting, or breakage. The document concludes by describing the object as an "intelligent young man" who appears to have a "factual" story.
