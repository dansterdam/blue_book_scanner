MAY 8 1957

This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 6, 1957, reference number ACIR-971, dated May 6, 1957, requesting copies of the Civil Aeronautics Administration final report of investigation of incidents of unidentified flying objects reported and forwarded to the Civil Aeronautics Administration as incidents.

The first incident mentioned occurred on July 27, 1957, near Amarillo, Texas, and concerned a near collision between a United Airlines flight on route from Denver to Dallas and an unidentified object. It is assumed that this object was a U. S. Air Force RC-97 aircraft which was known to be operating in the area at the time.

The second incident mentioned occurred on July 17, 1957, near El Paso, Texas, and concerned American Airlines Flight No. 655, inbound from Phoenix, Arizona, and an unidentified object. The object was American Airlines Flight No. 566, which had previously departed from El Paso, Texas.

Since both incidents, referred to above, have been determined to involve other aircraft, it is apparent that the information contained will not afford your organization complete records. 

In accordance with your request, we are establishing a procedure whereby your organization will be informed of the results of all Civil Aeronautics Administration investigations involving unidentified flying objects and this administrative action will be continued.

Sincerely yours,
Original signed by
