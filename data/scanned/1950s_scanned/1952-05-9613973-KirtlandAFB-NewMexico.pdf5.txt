Lieutenant Colonel, United States Air Force,
do hereby make the following statement as a disinterested party.

On or about 1600 hours, 23 May 1952, my attention was called by Lieutenant [blacked out] to a strange object at 2600 Azimuth, this Station. This object appeared to me to be approximately one to two thousand feet above the terrain at a range of ten to twenty miles. It did not have any apparent motion other than random motion. I looked at it once through field glasses and it appeared to be silver in color, flat on the bottom, slightly rounded on the upper edge, but the highest portion of the rounded section was offset to the left.

Captain [blacked out] arrived at this time and the object was pointed out to him. I had called the Direction Center by this time and asked what action had been taken. I was informed that a fighter was now vectoring on 260.

Captain [blacked out], Lieutenant [blacked out] and I went to the Direction Center and observed the object from the Radar Maintenance room window. Mr. [blacked out] was by that time observing the object through a transit telescope. I directed that a line be run from the controller to the observers position which was done within the next two or three minutes. By that time, however, the object had drifted below the horizon and was not again observed by me.

I have on two previous occasions observed objects in the air which I subsequently decided were merely large pieces of paper. This time, however, I can not convince myself that this was either an airplane outbound, a paper object, or a balloon.
