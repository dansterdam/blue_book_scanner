COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

Information was obtained by investigators to establish the identity of the above object. Any conclusions at this level would be purely speculative.

D/I PJAF COMMENTS:

There have been many unidentified sightings reported from the G2 and DI grid areas, several of which have definitely been identified as balloons. Although a program was recently instituted by the Far East Command to investigate these sightings, no further investigation being made.
