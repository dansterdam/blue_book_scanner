19 April 1950

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge the large tape recordings you forwarded to the Air Force.

The unidentified flying object sighting reported to the Air Force on 7 February 1950 was evaluated as an experimental aircraft. This case has again been reviewed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center and in view of the fact that no new evidence has been submitted, the original evaluation remains unchanged.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
