5. Targets of the same nature as those observed on the 29th appeared on the 30th of November 1950 between the hours of about 1639 - 2255.

6. A permanent echoea, said to be a radiecated target, in the area of the unknown echoea were much more distinct during the period of observance of unknown targets.

7. Ground clutter extended on the radar echoea out to about 12 miles in the direction of Oak Ridge, and high mountains, 3 to 4 miles outside of the restricted area to the northeast were visible on the radar screen.

8. Unknown targets first appeared on the lower radar beam and as they passed southward they were picked up by the upper beam.

9. Wind was from the southwest during the period of the observation of unknown targets.

10. Targets were reported to be moving at a rate of 6 to 8 miles per hour. (It is the investigators' belief that the targets were so numerous that actual movement of the targets could be very hard to ascertain. Movement could be mistaken by the appearance of new signal echoea as the affected area spread.)

11. Targets beyond the so-called "blacked-out area" were detected during the period of reception of unknown target echoea.

12. Intercept aircraft were unable to intercept any of the unknown targets, neither did any of these targets appear on the airborne radar set.

The ground radar sets, an AN/CPS-1 early warning radar, operates at a frequency of about 3000 megacycles per record, and, like all microwave electronic equipment, provides an excellent source of interference for any unknown targets.
