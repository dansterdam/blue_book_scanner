The image appears to contain two sketches or illustrations, but no photographs. The first sketch depicts a curved skyline with an object above the horizon, and instructions to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows two larger sketches - one depicting a road scene with an object in the sky, and another smaller sketch showing a similar road scene with mountains in the background.
