The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

1. One bright, round, appearing, highly polished silver oval with a diameter of about 30 feet, first observed between two radio towers (WGN and WBKB) seven miles from observer. As the object disappeared to the southwest and then back north to the observer, the light continued brightly in the vertical direction. During the time the object passed overhead, the observer measured the object travelled to the southeast and then back north to the southwest, covering an arc of approximately 90 degrees in the vertical plane, the overall time of maneuver was about 2 to 3 minutes.
The object appeared to be much faster than any jet fighter. The observer could estimate the speed but could not state the exact speed of the object with certainty.
When the object slowed or stopped, a pulsating, or flashing light could be seen on the underside of the craft. The light was not connected to any motor or propulsion unit. The object was not accompanied by any sound. Observation time: 2 to 3 minutes
2. This object was observed on the 9 Jun 52 at approximately 11:00 PM. Length of observation - 2 to 3 minutes
3. S/Sgt Kastl, AF Tower Operator, Offutt AF Base, Neb. 
4. Estimate speed: Very fast, but could not estimate exact speed 
5. Estimate size: About 30 feet in diameter 
6. Position during observation: The object travelled in an arc of about 90 degrees in the vertical plane
7. The report stated that the object could not be identified by the observer as any known aircraft, weather phenomena, or astronomical object.
