Mr. William Russler
Chief, Records and Statistics Division
Directorate of Flight and Missile Safety Research
Norton Air Force Base, California

Dear Mr. Russler:

I refer to your letter dated 14 July 1960.

In addition to a copy of the accident report, I requested the cause of the crash. This request was ignored.

Concerning the "privileged" report, is it officially classified, or just kept out of public hands, by stamping it "For Official Use Only"?

Sincerely,
