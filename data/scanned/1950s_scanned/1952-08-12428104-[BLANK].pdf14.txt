OTHERS MIGHT BE SPACE SHIPS

CRAFT FROM OUT YONDER COULD BE DISCS, SPHERES, OR BIG V-2S WITH WINGS
It is just possible that some of the unidentified objects may be space ships from another planet. The idea of space travel is no longer the fantastic subject it was in the years before World War II. In the USAF's study of unidentified objects, space ships have been given serious consideration.

Although we do not know what a space ship from another planet will look like, we do know approximately what a space ship built on Earth will look like.

Willy Ley, the rocket expert, says the ship will look like a large rocket - 10 to 12 times its largest diameter. It will have short wings, placed far back. The wings will be either sharply swept back, or will have a delta configuration.
Such a ship will have an atomic power plant. Thrust for take-off will be provided by a chemical booster, to avoid making the take-off area radioactive, and the atomic power will be used shortly afterward.
However, a spaceship for travel through the Earth's atmosphere, the space of airplanes, or for travel through the space between planets, might have the shape of a sphere, or disc. For travel through the Earth's atmosphere, the shape would not be nearly as efficient as a thin disc. The sphere could have tremendous strength, but its aerodynamic characteristics would not match those of the disc.
In the vacuum of outer space, however, the shape of a space ship would not affect its space at all.
If the unidentified objects are space ships from outside the Earth's orbit, the strange behavior of some of them (hovering, flying in jerky orbits) could be easily explained.
