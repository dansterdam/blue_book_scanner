Dear Mr. ____

Your letter to Representative Alvin E. O'Konski dated 5 April 1953 has been referred to this Center. The Air Technical Intelligence Center would appreciate your filling out the inclosed questionnaire so that Project Blue Book will have more detailed information relating to the unidentified objects that you observed in September 1952. Also, we are sending you a press release that will give you considerable information regarding "Flying Saucers".

Your interest in reporting this matter and your public spirited desire to be of service are greatly appreciated by the Air Forces

Sincerely,
