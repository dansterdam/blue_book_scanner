the Alch Pose had sighted several or these CRUisers near
the Yerba Buenla ttescrvoir I saw these Thursclay ecening, Apeil 15,
at about 7;40 P.1.
As panding you a rough sketch of the discutsion
of these sightings and the light I saw (according to your letrer). The light
seemed to be a good way off, say 2 or 3 miles, and it was visible for
about 5 minutes. Now, since this picture is of pous own making, and
looks the uest, how come this picture is not the sane as the one I
and hope to be able to give you later. It gives us an idea
of what you see the light to be. from what you sn it had just come
out of a cloud on the Tight, and the picture is of your sketch. I wish
there is to be the vague and inconspicuous
What i've written you're welcome to save is to those it not,
is up to you to delete it. However, you chose to do'with it. As I say,
we there's a vemon chance a couple of blocks away and
it closer up. It this is all that suits it is what you've got'as there
nany surprises.

Hoping you are the same.
