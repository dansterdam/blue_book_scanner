The text in the document is as follows:

30 DEC 1959

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

On 24 September 1959, you inquired in behalf of Mr. [REDACTED] concerning his sighting of an unidentified flying object on 13 October 1959 in Terre Haute, Indiana.

The United States has no program of the study of the flying saucers. Sightings of unidentified flying objects are reported to the Air Force, and therefore, no official conclusions are reached as to their cause.

Your continued interest in Air Force activities is appreciated. It is a pleasure to be of further assistance to you.

Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]
Colonel, USAF
