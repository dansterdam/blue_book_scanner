10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Four (4) black objects, about the size of a 
pencil eraser at arms length, flying in a 
cluster, traveled a wide angle of observation
in the sky and disappeared to the east. A
"whooshing" sound accompanied this sighting
and initially attracted the observer's
attention to these objects.

11. COMMENTS
Due to the brevity of sighting and a
delay in the forwarding of this pre-
liminary report, no investigation was
authorised.
