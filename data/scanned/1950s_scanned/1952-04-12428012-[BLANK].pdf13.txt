The Lippisch delta wing designs are very similar in their 
basic aerodynamic aspects to those of the XF5U. Both the disc and 
the delta shape make for high structural rigidity and, consequently, 
very thin airfoil sections can be employed in these designs. 
Furthermore, tests have shown that wings with high sweepback plus 
low aspect ratio will give safer stalling characteristics. The 
delta wing plan form, of course, combines both the sweep angle and 
the low aspect ratio feature in one package. 

And now here are some illustrations. 

		SLIDE NO. 1 

This is the XF5U-1 referred to previously. 

		SLIDE NO. 2 

This is a table summarizing characteristics of the Horton 
designs. 

		SLIDE NO. 3 

This is the glider with the two-parabola plan form, referred 
to previously.
