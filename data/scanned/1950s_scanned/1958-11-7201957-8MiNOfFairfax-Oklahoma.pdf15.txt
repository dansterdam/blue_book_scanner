"From the Office 0.1' the
Lieutenant Colonel, A.C.
November 3, 1952

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object.
To: Commanding Officer,
Watson Laboratories, Red Bank,
New Jersey.

Dear Sir:

The following report of an unidentified flying object is submitted for your information.

On November 2, 1952 at approximately 12:50 A.M. we were north bound about 9 miles south of Fairfax, Oklahoma with myself driving. I first noticed the objects far west on the northern horizon directly over a small town known as Fairfax's corner. There were four bright orange colored lights which appeared to be in a fixed formation and were traveling at a high rate of speed. They appeared at first to be in a relatively straight line, but as they approached my position they seemed to be in more of a V-shaped formation. Their speed was tremendous and I would estimate that they covered the distance from the northern horizon to the eastern horizon in less than a minute. There was no sound whatsoever. The lights remained a constant brilliant orange color throughout the sighting. As the objects passed overhead I lost sight of them in the eastern sky.

I am writing this letter in the hope that perhaps you may have some explanation for these objects. I will be glad to furnish any additional information that may be required.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]"
