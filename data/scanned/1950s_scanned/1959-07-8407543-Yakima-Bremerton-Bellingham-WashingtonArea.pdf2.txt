Yakima Newspaper 27 Aug 59

The unidentified flying objects they saw in Yakima weren't secret devices or anything like that, sheriff. Seems like they are the same as those recently reported in various parts of the country - except that they didn't surprise Yakima, Maybe they've become accustomed to them!

The sightings were made by sheriff's deputies and police in the area, and they watched the strange lights for three hours, too, just like the witnesses at Bremerton and Bellingham. The lights didn't go just straight up and down but did strange maneuvers in the air. An analysis of the color and action of the lights may disclose more about their nature.
