I was with the B-47 for about 5 years and about 3 years as a special intelligence investigator and have seen many unusual things while in the Air Force, but never anything like this UFO. It was completely different from any type I have witnessed or heard described before. There were no doors or hatches visible and no protruding parts such as wings, propellors or anything else that the B-47 or ordinary aircraft might have. Its silent smooth flight and complete disappearance that the B-47 could not overtake lead me to believe that this UFO or whatever it was, might have been a secret aircraft that the Air Force or Defense Dept. was testing.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
DO: POLICE AT THE BASE (CALIFORNIA ROUTE 185) 
MONTH: FEBRUARY YEAR: 1955
