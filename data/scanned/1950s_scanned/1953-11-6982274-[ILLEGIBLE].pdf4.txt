At eight-forty-seven on the evening of the 6th of November I saw the bright lights again in the northwest sky. The lights were very bright, and maneuvered in a curious pattern for some twenty-five or thirty seconds. The lights were definitely not an aircraft, for they seemed to be stationary at times and then would move rapidly to another position. This time the flight pattern was somewhat different from the other night, the lights seemed to be moving up and down, as well as from side to side, in a very erratic manner. I watched the lights for some time, until about nine o'clock, when they seemed to disappear. 

About fifteen minutes later, at about nine-fifteen, I saw the lights again in the same general location in the northwest sky. The lights appeared to be extremely bright, much brighter than any other stars or planets in the sky at that time. The lights seemed to be pulsating, and would appear to surge in brightness and then diminish again. They also maneuvered in a very peculiar and erratic fashion, moving up, down, and from side to side, and seeming to vanish and reappear. I watched the lights until about nine-thirty, when they slowly seemed to fade from view. I have no explanation for what these lights might have been, they definitely did not appear to be any conventional aircraft. I am quite familiar with all types of aircraft, both military and civilian, and these lights bore no resemblance to any known type of aircraft. Nor did they appear to be reflections or mirages, as the lights were seen by several other witnesses in the area, and their observations tallied with mine. I can only conclude that I witnessed something quite extraordinary, which I am unable to identify or explain.
