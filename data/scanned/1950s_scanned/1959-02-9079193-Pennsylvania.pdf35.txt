DETROIT, Feb. 25 (AP) - A pilot of an American Airlines plane reported Wednesday that he saw nine "flying saucers" as he flew over Pennsylvania. The pilot, Capt. William T. Coleman, said he was en route from New York to Pittsburgh and had on board a co-pilot and co-pilot. 
 
Coleman said that for 13 minutes his plane was accompanied by the mysterious objects at about 8,000 feet altitude and the objects appeared to be shiny, metallic and saucer-shaped.

The pilot said members of the crew also saw the objects. Coleman said the objects flew in a parallel course with his plane at one point and appeared to be at a standstill. 

William H. Coleman told newsmen at Pittsburgh International Airport that "one would have to be crazy or a scrooge" not to believe him.
