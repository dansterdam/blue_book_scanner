1. Following is a summary covering the recent penetration of British air space by an aircraft not known to belong to a friendly country:
SUMMARY: An unidentified aircraft was sighted by RAF Fighter Command Control at 10,000 feet off Cromer, England (52°56'N - 01°18'E) at 1605, 14 August 1950. Height 15,000 to 20,000 feet, speed 500 knots. Two fighter aircraft of RAF Horsham St. Faith were scrambled to investigate, but by the time the Meteors had reached 38,500 feet, the object had disappeared. The appearance of separate trails suggested the object had split, as reported by the pilots. Investigation of this action is being pursued.
