Received from CO 1701st AW, Great Falls AFB, Montana (Rec. and Date Time Group Unknown)
Submitted in accordance with AFR No. 200-5, dated 20 April 1952, Subj: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOBS).
At approximately 2130 MST on 22 February 1953 an Unidentified Flying Object was observed northwest of Dodson, Montana (approximate coordinates 48°20'N - 108°30'W).
When first observed the object appeared as a motionless brilliant white light at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. It was estimated to be 2 to 7 miles away from the observers. The light then began a rapid, silent movement, turning in various directions and flashing on and off at intervals of several seconds. At one point the light was very bright and seemed to be gaining altitude. After remaining in the air for approximately 5 minutes, the white light changed to a red glow. No sound from the object was heard. Total time of observation about 7 minutes.
Weather conditions at the time of sighting was not given nor was any information as to known air-borne aircraft furnished.
