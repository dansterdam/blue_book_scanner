AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Laredo Air Force Base, Texas       ATRC IR-M-52       PAGE 2 of 3 PAGES

On 12 December 1952, a civilian pilot of an F-86D jet interceptor type aircraft was flying on a routine training mission from Laredo Air Force Base, Texas. The purpose of the mission was practicing "Airstarts" for the pilots returning to base. After completing the exercised, the pilot was returning to his base.

At approximately 1720, while waiting for permission from the tower to land, the pilot observed a rapidly moving bluish-white light in the southwestern sky. The pilot stated that the light appeared to be over the residential area, directly southwest of the base. As the object approached, the pilot could see that it was luminous and seemed to be moving at a very high rate of speed. The light appeared to be over the base for a matter of seconds only, and then shot away toward the southwest at a tremendous rate of speed. 

Lt Arnold received this information some time later. It Arnold had noticed the object, but when he attempted to locate it in the sky again, he was unable to do so. Lt Arnold circled the area in an attempt to locate the object, but was unsuccessful in his efforts.

There were only three aircraft airborne at the time, comprising the normal traffic pattern at the base. Lt Arnold questioned the pilots of these aircraft, but they had not observed the object.

In Arnold's opinion, the object was not a jet aircraft, nor could it have been a meteor, since its movements and speeds were not consistent with either of these. Lt Arnold stated that he was puzzled by the incident and could offer no explanation for the object's unusual characteristics or behavior.
