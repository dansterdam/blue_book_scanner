These objects passed right over my house. They maneuvered in such a peculiar manner that I was astounded at their speed. They seemed to contract and expand their size in a rapid manner. These objects maneuvered in a zig-zag manner and I compared their speed to a jet fighter. I estimated their speed to be about 2000 mph. The objects seemed to oscillate somewhat in their flight, making sharp angular turns at high speed. Occasionally the objects seemed to tumble or roll, giving the impression that they were under intelligent control. The only man-made objects I am familiar with that could perform in this manner are not yet operational as far as I know. Whatever these objects were, they were definitely not conventional aircraft. These things were fast, very fast, and seemed to defy the laws of physics as we know them. If I may speculate, I will say that I believe some type of advanced propulsion system was involved, possibly a new form of nuclear-powered propulsion or something radically different from current aerodynamic flight principles.
