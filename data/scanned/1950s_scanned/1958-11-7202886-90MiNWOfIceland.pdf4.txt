h. Description and course of object.
Pilot saw what he thought at first to be a falling meteorite, then realized that the object was more distant and larger than a meteor. He called the attention of the aircraft commander, the navigator and the weather observer (who also observed a previous sighting).

Angle of elevation was observed by the navigator to be 20° at an azimuth of 230° FROM North, tracking to 12° when it first appeared.

Angle of elevation was 20° at an azimuth of 120° when it disappeared.

The object rose from our right, quartering rear and made an arc across our flight path with a maximum elevation of 22°.

It disappeared to the left of our nose.

The aircraft commander checked his watch at 1725Z when he first sighted the object and 1727Z when it completely disappeared.
