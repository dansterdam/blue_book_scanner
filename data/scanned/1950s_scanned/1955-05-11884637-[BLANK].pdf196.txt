There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a document or report, potentially related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page includes instructions for the observer to sketch the object's position when it was first and last seen, draw a picture showing the motion of the object, and draw a picture showing the shape of the object and include an arrow indicating the direction it was moving.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed using optical character recognition (OCR):

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when
you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead

Horizon You Horizon

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an
"A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include
in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow
beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
