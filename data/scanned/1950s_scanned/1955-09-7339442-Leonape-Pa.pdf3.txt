AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (Agency)
Flight 3-H, 14602a AISS
COMMENTS OF Preparing Officer:
a. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the UFOB sighting reported by the observer at West Chester, Pennsylvania at 23/16302 Sep 55 was probably the result of a balloon within the balloon caught in a fluctuat-ing current of air.
b. The appearance of the UFOB from the observer's description and memory sketch seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a radiosondc weather balloon.
c. The wind data collected from the Greater Pittsburgh Airport seems to extend the possibility of there having been a radiosondc balloon in the vicinity of West Chester, Pennsylvania at the approximate time of the sighting, provided it was a function in the balloon which was released at 0300 EST.
d. The near coincidence in time that the Swarthmore balloon was re-leased does not change the conclusion which it encountered during its ascent does not preclude the possibility of it having drifted toward the vicinity of West Chester at that time.
2. The absence of sound associated with the object seems to negate the change of its having been a self-powered, simultaneously increasing the chance that it was probably a friendly object.
