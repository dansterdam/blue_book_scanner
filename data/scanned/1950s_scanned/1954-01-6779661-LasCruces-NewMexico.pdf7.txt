The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - NONE - COMPLETELY SILENT
b. Color - YELLOW WHITE, RADIATION CURVE, (SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION)

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and any specially obvious trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE OBJECT WAS A POINT SOURCE OF LIGHT NOT RESOLVABLE BY THE UNAIDED EYE INTO ANY PHYSICAL DIMENSION.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One):  a. Fuzzy or blurred
                b. Like a bright star
                c. Sharply outlined
                d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? ONLY ONE.
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
