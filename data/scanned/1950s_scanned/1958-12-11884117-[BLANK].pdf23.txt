(U) UFO Program

1. The attached study summarizes the UFO problem in ATIC as we see it. Recent developments in this program are well defined the scope of the operation seems to have grown by topsy 
rather than design. The fact that the USAF has the only governmentally sanctioned activity engaged in UFO analysis and evaluation brings us reports from all over the world - including some which seem to have to do with objects of public interest involved essentially places ATIC in a rather uncontrollable focal position.

2. For those reasons indicated above we must, I believe, lay on the certain short-comings of the program and request those actions necessary to make the USAF position a definable one. There are only a few things that we must determine: how much the taxpayers money should be spent on this program, or cause other action to be taken against questionable UFO organizations to reduce the scope of USAF activities.

3. The approval of program outlined in basic study is recommended.
