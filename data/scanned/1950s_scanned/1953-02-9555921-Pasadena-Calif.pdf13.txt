20. Draw a picture that will show the motion and the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, at "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand
(Circle One):
1. Head of a pin
2. Pea
3. Dime
4. Nickel
5. Half dollar
6. Silver dollar
7. Baseball
8. Grapefruit
9. Basketball
10. Other

22.1 (Circle One) of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22:
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it be? What improvements would you make which would explain what you saw in the sky when you observed it?

A large disc-shaped object of material like polished stainless steel, about 50 feet in diameter. Smooth round edges, no projections. Only a slight protrusion in center. Hazy, bluish-white illumination from whole surface. No openings, portholes, etc. Very fast, effortless flight compared to our present craft.
