PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

1. This report covers the period from July 1948 through December 1952. During this period 3,201 sightings were reported to Project Blue Book.

2. Of the 3,201 sightings, 1,198 were considered unidentified. This represents 37.4 percent of the total.

3. The remaining 2,003 sightings, or 62.6 percent, were identified as having natural explanations, such as astronomical bodies, aircraft, balloons, birds, etc.

4. The characteristics most frequently associated with the unidentified sightings were:
(a) Unexplained maneuvers, e.g., sudden starting, stopping, and 90 degree turns.
(b) Unexplained speed, e.g., up to several thousand miles per hour.
(c) Unexplained configuration or shape, e.g., circular, elliptical, etc.
(d) Unexplained color, e.g., bright red, green, blue, etc.
(e) Unexplained lights, e.g., steady, blinking, etc.

5. Many of the unidentified sightings were made by highly reliable observers, such as aircraft pilots, control tower operators, and other technical personnel. A few of the sightings were made by more than one reliable observer.

6. The report concludes that a significant percentage of the sightings remain unexplained, and that these cannot be satisfactorily explained on the basis of a statistical study alone. The report recommends that further studies be made of the problem.
