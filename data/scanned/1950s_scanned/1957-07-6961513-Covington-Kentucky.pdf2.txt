Following is an extract from SDO Lt. Louis D Rosenberg's report of 15 July 1957:

"2050 - Received call from Capt. McGladon (Base Info Service). He had received a call from Base Operations, who had received an original call. This call came from a witness who reported seeing a very bright light that was too high and too slow to be an airplane, moving NE-SW. His position 'Covington' and a flashing light was also observed."

(S) T.J. CONMAIR, JR.
Major, USAF
Adjutant

Clearly, this report indicates the receipt of a witness report of observing an unidentified bright light that was too high and slow to be an airplane, moving in a NE-SW direction. The location was Covington, and a flashing light was also observed.
