OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reported sighting of an unidentified flying object over Kadena Air Base, Okinawa on 7 October 1951.

SUMMARY: On the evening of 7 October 1951, an unidentified flying object was observed by personnel at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. The object was first detected on radar at approximately 2300 hours and was observed visually by airmen on the ground. The object moved at a high rate of speed and exhibited unusual maneuverability, executing tight turns and abrupt acceleration. Attempts were made to intercept the object, but it evaded pursuit.

DETAILS: At approximately 2300 hours on 7 October 1951, the control tower at Kadena Air Base detected an unidentified target on their radar scope. The target was observed to be moving at a high rate of speed and exhibiting unusual maneuverability. Several airmen on the ground also visually observed the object, describing it as a bright light that appeared to change direction abruptly and accelerate rapidly.

Attempts were made to scramble aircraft to intercept the object, but it evaded pursuit. Ground-based anti-aircraft weapons were also fired at the object, but it remained unaffected. The object was tracked on radar for several minutes before disappearing from the scope.

CONCLUSION: The reported sighting of the unidentified flying object over Kadena Air Base on 7 October 1951 remains unexplained. The object exhibited characteristics that were highly unusual for known aircraft or other conventional aerial phenomena. Further investigation is warranted to determine the nature and origin of the object.
