ERDING, GERMANY
29 OCTOBER 1952

STATEMENT

At approximately 0730 hours on the 29th of October, while walking west toward the Erding Bowling Alley, accompanied by 3 3/4 officers, I sighted an object in the sky. The attention was called to this object by 2 USAF pilots who were parking their cars. The object was round and appeared to be silver in color. It was hovering and moved in any direction at a very fast pace and said "It isn't any conventional type aircraft".

This object was in sight for approximately 20 to 30 seconds and then disappeared from our view behind the bowling alley. The speed of the object was so fast that it seemed to disappear in a matter of seconds. It passed from a northwesterly course and maintained a level altitude. It appeared to be about the size of a small automobile. It seemed to
glide through the air at a constant speed. I could not distinguish any wings or propellers. It appeared to have a silvery color.

At no time during the sighting was any sound heard.
