Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Panel

1. The next meeting of the UFO panel will be held during the month of September 1960. The place will be announced at a later date by telephone.

2. All during the life of the Air Force program to investigate and evaluate sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena or objects, it has been recognized that the names "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" or "Unidentified Flying Objects" have been used to designate phenomena or flying objects which have been observed. Reports which are pure figments of the imagination or which are a result of misinterpretation or misidentification are called "Unidentified Flying Objects" and tend to establish in the public to the natural extension of associating the term "flying saucers" with greater curiosity.

3. You are requested to consider an official name for the program "Unidentified Phenomena/Objects" as for the alphabetized name, this would result in "UFO", not too different from the present "UFO".

4. You are not restricted to the names mentioned above, and at the meeting you should suggest any which you feel to be more appropriate.

5. Our sincere appreciation is offered to you and your organization for the efforts which you have made in this connection. Only through such willing and cooperative attitudes between organizations can only result in successful completion of our assigned mission.
