"AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

TAG IF-23-53   PAGE 3 OF 4 PAGES

1. Report follows of the information obtained by this office in compliance with your request for information on the subject sighting of an unidentified flying object reported to have occurred on 29 July 1953 at Key West, Florida. 

Only one object was sighted on each occasion. It was very bright, white in color but no small that the observer stated he could just barely see it. It was observed to have a circular motion and descent, rising back up at a 45 degree angle. The object's speed was reported as unknown, since the observer did not know the object's true size. The object was observed for approximately one half minute during the sighting on 29 July 1953. No other details were available. Similar observations were said to have been observed on 2 previous occasions. These maneuvers, the vertical and lateral circular motion, are believed to have been observed on both occasions. The object was estimated to have been at an altitude of approximately 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The observer was a civilian, a commercial air pilot by occupation.

A second sighting was reported at 2135 EST. A smaller, white object was reported at that time, but no details were available as to its maneuvers or other characteristics.

The foregoing is a summary of the information available from this sighting as obtained through interrogation of the observers. The interrogation was conducted in a manner to insure completeness of information and authenticity of the report."
