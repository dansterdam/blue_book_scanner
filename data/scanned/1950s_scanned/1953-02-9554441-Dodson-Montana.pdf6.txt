Unfortunately, there is no photograph present in this image. The text appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, describing a sighting of a flying saucer over Nairobi, Kenya.

SYDNEY N.S.W. FEBRUARY 23, 1953

The report of what is believed to be a large saucer over observed, reached the Australian Flying Saucer Bureau from Nairobi, East Africa. The witness, Mrs. [Redacted], Nairobi, wrote:

"I left Mombasa at the end of June 1947, on the S.S. Llangoyty Castle on route to Sydney, Town, and coming through the Straits of Mozambique about the beginning of July 1947, when my attention was drawn to an object which appeared to be a large saucer shaped like a plate, hovering above the surface of the water at a height which I estimate to be about 20 feet. The saucer was motionless, until it suddenly began to revolve at a great speed. It then disappeared from view as it moved too quickly, in a fast speed, for my eye to follow. It was a very bright object, which flashed like metal in the sun, and appeared to be made of a substance resembling stainless steel and seemed like a solid one-piece construction. It appeared suddenly, made one complete revolution and then disappeared."

FLYING SAUCERS:
About 20 feet above the sea, parallel with the Subsidiary Castle, and travelling in the same direction.
Gaining a little in speed, after a second or two, the whole shape disappeared without a sound, from the rear of the vessel it was making about 7 knots length of the object. It appeared that there must be something inside that was transmitting light, but still we could hear no noise from the flames. No windows could be seen, only a solid mass of metal which if it had been a complete circular ship, would have measured about 4 times the width of the ship, which was about 4 knots a high.
