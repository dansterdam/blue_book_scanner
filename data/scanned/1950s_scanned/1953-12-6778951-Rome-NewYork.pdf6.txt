METEORS

By mariners reporting their observations of these bodies are greatly assisted in learning the regions desired to have the observations of mariners made possible, whether by bearing in altitude, or by relation to fixed stars, or both.

Computations on the observations on these trails and their direction of drift should be made as soon as posssible, since this wind direction is the upper wind direction at the altitudes at which the observations were made.

Second Officer Kenneth Davis of the American SS Esro Linden, Frankfort, master, reports the following meteor observation: 

AT 0010 U. S. T., December 12, 1953, in Lat, 26°44' N., long. 81 °00' W., a bright red and green meteor was observed bearing approximately 210° true, just 45 minutes after the moon had set. The meteor traveled in a horizontal direction for about a minute and a half, then exploded and disappeared, bearing about 260° true, at about 10° of arc above the horizon. Wind est, at temperature 80° F., sea temperature 80° F.
