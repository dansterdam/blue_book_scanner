"Two things impressed me much; firstly, when it stood still the rim of the disc was very clear and sharp, but as it started moving this rim became hazy, as if it had some motion, either rotating, pulsating or vibrating. I could not discern whether or not it rotated, it just became blurred. Secondly, after looking intently at it for some minutes I felt a very disagreeable sensation in my eyes; they felt irritated, the same feeling as after looking for a long time at a bed television screen".

"Suddenly I saw a second disc. It had come down from somewhere without my seeing it arrive.  Its stood much farther away. Its shape was slightly different. It, too, had a slightly dished disc, with a cabin, but this cabin protruded slightly from the underside as well as from the top. This one stood perfectly still, without any movement. The other kept hovering around slowly over the German countryside as if it looked for something. At count three, number 1 leaped away. It shot away making several very sharp angles. At the same time, the blue-green hue appeared again.  After some wild leaps at speed I have never seen before, it shot up as a bolt of lightning and went off with one vertical flame into space. No sound was heard. The other remained for some seconds, then capsized on its edge and took one vertical leap, one fiery blue streak into space after the other _ also without sound.
