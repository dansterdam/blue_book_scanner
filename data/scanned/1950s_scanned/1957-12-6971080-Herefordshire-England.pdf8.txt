TRANSCRIPTION:

Sir, on reading Flying Saucers from Other Spaces by Donald E. Keyhoe I was considerably impressed with the enclosed report sheets and the statement that the U.S.A.F. takes an interest in U.F.O. reports. As the article is written by an ex-U.S.M.C. Officer, I feel the matter deserves consideration. However, I have discussed the matter with my staff again and they remain of the opinion that the reports have little real substance. We have not received any reports that could be substantiated, and that some of the statements are of a rather fanciful nature.

While I do not dismiss the possibility of the existence of interplanetary vehicles, I cannot at the moment see any use to the U.S.A.F. taking any action in this matter, beyond filing reports that are received. Perhaps you could let me know if there is any additional action I could usefully take. I can probably provide you with more extensive details of the cases reported and perhaps you could let me know if you consider it would be worthwhile pursuing the matter further.
