The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet. The sheet includes a handwritten report with details about an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

Dining car in night train received message and Conductor contacted me and said a missile was sighted over Lake Superior and to be alert. Looked out of train window and saw a light in sky followed by what appeared to be a missile coming from south high-speed and gaining altitude. Had a solid trail like a vapor trail. I watched it for about 15 seconds until it disappeared from sight. I called the attention of other train passengers to it and they agreed it was a missile. I don't know if that's the case or not, but it was definitely something that appeared and behaved like a missile.
