The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an UFO sighting.

On the 19 december 1952 approximately 6:30 p.m. there was flying at 7,400 feet an unidentifiable object of 150 degrees in view a few AY Engines traveling about 20 degrees to our course and approximately the same altitade. The object appeared to be about 30 to 40 miles away. 

The object appeared to be silver white in color, with a bright blue-green trail like flame at the rear. It had a vapor like trail appearing approximately three times its own length traveling. This object was in my sight for several seconds before it passed into a cloud. At the time this object was in view we were heading 180 degrees when this object was in view to rize through 210 miles in 2.2 minutes. when I first sighted the object I called the radar operator's attention to it.
