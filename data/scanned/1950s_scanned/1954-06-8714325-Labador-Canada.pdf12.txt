CASE SUMMARY NUMBER 3

On 20 June 1954 a British Overseas Airways pilot, flying in the Labrador area, reported sighting a peculiar type of wavering light formation in the sky. He described it as being one large object surrounded by several smaller objects and having a jelly-like appearance.

A subsequent report from a ship at sea appeared to describe the same phenomena at approximately the same location. The ship maintained that the sighting as the objects were on to state that atmospheric conditions were prevailing on that date.

Project Blue Book evaluated the sighting as an inversion reflection of the planet Mars.

An ATIC evaluation of this report was furnished to the British Air Ministry upon their request.
