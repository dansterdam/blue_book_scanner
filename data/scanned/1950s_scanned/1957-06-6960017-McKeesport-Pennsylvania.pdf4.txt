DATE OF INFORMATION 28 June 1957
FROM CL/473

FIGHTER SQ. (AD) (TAC) First Air Force, Pa.

DATE OF REPORT 1 July 1957

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significant data in one concise paragraph. List enclosures at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112aâ€”Part (3))

This investigator has been unable to determine what was responsible for the sightings by Mrs. ______. Experience has shown that the area in which her. _______ lives is responsible for the majority of the "Flying Saucer" reports received by this station. The steel mills in the McKeesport area produce vast quantities of dust, which, with the proper combination of twilight and artificial illumination often produce peculiar sights.) I consider it very probable that this is what Mrs. Pollard and Mrs. Dodd saw.
