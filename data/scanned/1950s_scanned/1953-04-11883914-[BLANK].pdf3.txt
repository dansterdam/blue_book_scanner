The image does not contain any photographs, but rather contains illustrations or sketches. The first sketch on the left shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above it. The instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the viewer first saw it, and to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon at its later position.

The second sketch on the right contains two smaller sketches. The larger one shows a road with buildings on either side, with a person standing on the road. The smaller one shows a more distant landscape with an object in the sky.
