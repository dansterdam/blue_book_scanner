Transcribed text from the document:

Top red, after it began to slow down, it caused me to look at my watch. Then after I looked again, I noticed a mass of very small lights white, but smaller. That must have been lighting the object. Then the mass of lights about one third the size of the original object. This mass of lights after staring about 15 seconds after the object then suddenly went off as a light. It remained dark then after about 30-34 minutes, bright lights then appeared to drift as close to the top where a mass of lights were about 7-8 min. It is hard to estimate if the lights were on the object that it was. Can't say for certain is was not attached to the small lights vanished all at a time. Then the small object appeared to be lined up in 4 or 5 shapes. Then it which pointed downward until only 1 light remained. The car was small tail lights passed it was on the remote. The year was 1952 until it was invisible.
