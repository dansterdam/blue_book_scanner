The image does not contain any photographs, it is a scanned document that appears to be a letter. 

The text in the document says:

Dear Senator Smith:- In regard to the enclosed,as written by Col.Boyd of the Dow Air Force ,Feb.12th 1959. As you will see that the letter is dated back in '59,with the idea of me getting back the pictures;now it wasn't pictures I gave him,it was negatives,but to see if you could hurry things up a little by investigating the said problem. I would like to have them,as quite a few people are awfully interested in the subject (flying objects) and the picture I have,but are very interested in them. As you haven't heard from me for quite some time. I will say that I was a friend of **** a quite a while ago,they have sold the house he lived in at Winterport. Wishing you the best of health,and a nice New Year in all this"messa"we're in; I remain Sincerely yours Belfast,Maine (04915)
