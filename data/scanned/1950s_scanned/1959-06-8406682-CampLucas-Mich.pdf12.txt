COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: 1ST LT. L.M STINGLEY ON DUTY.
WHEN AAA FIRST REPORTED THE OBJECT, THEY REPORTED IT AS A WHITE
LIGHT WITH A FLASHING RED LIGHT ON TOP, WHICH WAS IN ORBIT. I
ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY A CARGO OR PASSENGER TYPE A/C EQUIPPED
WITH A GRIMES LIGHT. THE OBJECT COULD NOT BE PICKED UP BY ELECTRONIC
MEANS, NOR COULD AAA PICK IT UP ON THEIR RADAR. SINCE THE OBJECT WAS
NOT IN AN ADIZ, AND WHEN IT DID MOVE IT MOVED TO THE NORTHWEST, PLUS
THE FACT THAT NO ONE HAD ELECTRONIC CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT
