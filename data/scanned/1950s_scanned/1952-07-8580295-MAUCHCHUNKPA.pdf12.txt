There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. This appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report from the Project Blue Book case files.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUMMARY: Pilot sighted object at 15,000 feet altitude which was traveling at approximately 600 mph. The object was described as elliptical in shape, silver in color, and approximately 30 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 30 seconds. Other witnesses to the sighting were two B-17 crews. No other details are available.
ANALYSIS: The reported sighting is considered a possible genuine report. The apparent high speed and altitude of the object are beyond the normal capabilities of known aircraft. If the object observed was of the size and speed reported, it could not have been a conventional aircraft.
CONCLUSION: The object sighted is unidentified. Further investigation is warranted to obtain additional details.
