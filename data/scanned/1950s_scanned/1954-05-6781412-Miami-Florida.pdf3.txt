Transcription of the text:

A witness, to the effect of the city on the ground, described as follows, some strange things which were in a little ground, and others in the fields surrounding it. This appears to be a partial, roughly sketched account and account. It was a scrape and some of the areas contained in the report were perhaps a little difficult to understand clearly. The witness goes on to say that this high degree of details seems to be authentic and not faked. At times, I'm not certain that one could really make due careful enough conclusion from the variety of information given, but at some points the account does seem to have substance which merits attention. There may be more to examine on the report's following pages.
