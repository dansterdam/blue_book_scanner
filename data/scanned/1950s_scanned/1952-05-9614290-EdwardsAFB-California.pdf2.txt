AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON, Edwards AFB, California
DATE: 29 May 1952
FLIGHT REPORT NO.: Good
SUMMARY: At approximately 1330 hours, 29 May 1952, two objects described as disc-shaped were observed making rapid, erratic maneuvers over Edwards Air Force Base. The objects were sighted by a number of persons known to be reliable observers. While one of the two objects reported as conventional aircraft, the other revealed a difference of fifty-five degrees in the angle of observation. The unusual performance characteristics, as compared to known aircraft, and the education of the observers, make this report noteworthy.
