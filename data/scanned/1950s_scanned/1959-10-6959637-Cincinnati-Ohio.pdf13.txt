Transcription of the text in the document:

Not sure and Thin about a seen
Possibly of flying saucers near or around
Cincinnati. I'm sure it was something
not earthly from my standpoint-I mean
standing into my house and watching
it for several at the object. I did see
it move directly overhead. I watched
until it disappeared-it left just
The tail so was just below ant
The clouds-a strange looking object. 
It moved much faster than any jet or
airplane and seem to have no noise. 
The experiment was startling. If it was
the first time I ever seen anything like
Lighting for. Moore did not see it
With me at the time. This is the report
of the first time I ever seen anything
like that. I though at the time it was
an object help it is not at all what
I have read much about these strange
little craft.
