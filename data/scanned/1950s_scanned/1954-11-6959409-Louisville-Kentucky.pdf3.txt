Background:

15 Nov 54: Major C. Williams, Ft. Knox, Kentucky, called 1st Lt. Athens of Flt 3-B, 4602nd AISS to report an UFO observed over Louisville on 12 Nov 54. Refer to Attachment #1.

13 & 15 Nov 54: Two newspaper articles were extracted from Dayton newspapers relative to the same UFO sighting over Louisville. Refer to Attachment #2.

17 Nov 54: Mr. [REDACTED], Physicist with the Oak Ridge National Laboratories, attending a conference with AMC officials at WPAFB, visited ATIAE-5 relative to a UFO observed by him over Knoxville, Tenn. Mr. [REDACTED] was not sure of the date and stated the UFO was observed on either the 14th or 15th of Nov 54. The UFO was described by Mr. [REDACTED] as being transparent, round and hovered at a very high altitude. He stated he saw what appeared exhausts from 2 jet a/c pass the object, one in front of it and one behind it. Mr. [REDACTED] further stated that he and his associates had always had an unofficial interest in UFO's and had in the past, been able to satisfactorily identify most of the UFO reported by the newspapers. However, in this particular instance, he was startled by the size of the UFO which he could see extremely well, but was unable to see the jets that passed by it. He saw only the jet exhausts. He realized that the object could have been, and probably was a balloon of some sort, but desired the official evaluation if possible.
