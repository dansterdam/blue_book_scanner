AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. R-1-53
COUNTRY: Greenland
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (SIMIUTAK)
DATE INFORMATION: 26 June 1953
FLIGHT INFORMATION: Major, USAF
STATEMENT:
a. Reference your message AFOIN-AT-AIR-G-23-53, 30 June 1952 concerning the Simiutak flying object case.
b. Collision of object and pitball was seen through the theodolites.
c. Pitball conditions were scattered in clouds at 8,500 feet and 25,000 feet with visibility of about 3,000 feet.
d. A one hundred foot pitball would not be expected to burst below 35,000 feet and probably not until 45,000 feet depending upon the pressure-altitude conditions and instruments. The Commander of the 13th Weather Detachment states that it is doubtful that this condition or particle in the air would be an optical illusion.
