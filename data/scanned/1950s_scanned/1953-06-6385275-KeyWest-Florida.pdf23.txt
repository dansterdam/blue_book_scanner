25 February 1954

Mr. [redacted]
New York 21, New York

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Because of our geographical proximity to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the Air Technical Intelligence Center and its control station at Orlando, we frequently receive from ATIC reports of unidentified flying objects which indicate, from the initial data recorded from the observers, that an astronomical or meteorological interpretation of the phenomenon may be in order.

We have received your report of the phenomenon witnessed last 19 June near Key West, Florida, and we were particularly impressed with the fine job done, both in observing and in reporting.

A few additional questions come to mind which, we feel, might help us clear up the incident.

I shall be in New York some time this week, and would appreciate the opportunity of discussing this with you personally, since this is somewhat of a problem which would be willing to contribute her report as well.

I trust you will find it convenient to cooperate with us in this matter. I shall probably contact you Wednesday morning.

Very truly yours,

J. R. Gluck
Astrophysicist
Evarson Dewillin Observatory
