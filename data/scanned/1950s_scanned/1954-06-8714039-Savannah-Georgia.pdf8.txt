SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT,
SAVANNAH, GEORGIA

13. The object was sighted over Savannah, Georgia at approximately 3:15 p.m. EST on 8 June 1954. It was observed by an aircraft crew of a Savannah Airways flight from Atlanta to Savannah. The crew consisted of the pilot, copilot, and a "check pilot" who was observing.

The object was first sighted to the northeast of the aircraft and appeared to be about 5 miles away. It was describing a circular course and when sighted was heading in a southerly direction. The object was observed for 2-3 minutes. The pilot estimated the size of the object to be about 20 feet in diameter.

The object was a bright, metallic, disk-shaped object reflecting sunlight. It seemed to make no sound. The object climbed and descended several times during the observation and then finally disappeared in the distance.

The pilot stated that the object was definitely not an aircraft, balloon, or any known object. The pilot, copilot, and check pilot are experienced airline personnel and stated that this sighting could not be explained in any conventional terms.

The project officer has interviewed the crew and obtained their statements. The object could not be identified.
