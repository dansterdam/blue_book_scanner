AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Investigation of Alleged "Flying Saucers"

Location: Fort Worth, Texas
Date: 9 - 21 April 1950
Incident No.: CAP-2-79

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:
1. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Texas, published on 15 April 1950, a front page story and photographs on an alleged "Flying Saucer" sighting.

2. The report was investigated since it was the first known time that pictures had emerged and were considered to be "genuine" - the pictures have definite intelligence value.

3. An interview with Mr. J. Hickey, Director of Intelligence, was held and after evaluating the story and negatives, the following was established:

a. The photographs were taken on 16 April 1950 by an amateur photographer near the Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas. The photographs are considered genuine.

b. A study of the negatives by photo technicians at this headquarters indicates that the negatives have definite abnormalities or effects resulting from a physical origin. 

c. The report is being downgraded at a later date due to lack of significant intelligence value. This report is released in accordance with letter, Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, dated 10 January 1950, subject: Release of Project "Blue Book" Information.

APPROVED:

/s/ HAROLD T. MARTIN
