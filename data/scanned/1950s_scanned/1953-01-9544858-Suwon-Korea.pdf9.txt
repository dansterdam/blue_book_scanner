The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes an incident that occurred off the coast of the United States, where a squadron of planes was performing offshore combat maneuvers when a "giant object" was observed. The object then shot into the sky, vanishing within seconds.
