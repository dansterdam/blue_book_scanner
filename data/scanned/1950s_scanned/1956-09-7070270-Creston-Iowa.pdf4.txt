The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a simple hand-drawn sketch or diagram depicting an elliptical or oval-shaped object. The text at the bottom of the image states "PAGE THREE REPORT FOR" but does not identify any specific individuals.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the text found in the document:
