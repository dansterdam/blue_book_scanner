FOR ACTION TO COUNTERACT ANY STORY BY LIFE MAGAZINE, TO WHICH NEGATIVE WAS SUBMITTED. A RASH OF UFO REPORTS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FOLLOW, IF PHOTO SHOWN BY LIFE WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES OF HOW PHOTO TAKEN. STATISTICAL SURVEY HERE SHOWS INCREASING NUMBER OF HOAXES AND ATTEMPTED HOAXES BY JUVENILES DURING LAST SIX MONTHS.
PART III - REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF INVESTIGATIVE DATA.
SOURCES STATEMENT AND UFO PRINT.
A. SOURCE STATED HE TOOK PICTURE OF OBJECT WHILE STEADYING CAMERA ON ROOF OF EARLY 1950 MODEL SIX CYLINDER FORD. ENGINE WAS RUNNING, LIGHTS WERE ON AND THE AUTOMOBILE DOES VIBRATE WHILE RUNNING. THE NEGATIVE WAS DENSE. IT TOOK SEVEN MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TO MAKE THE PRINTS.
D. THE PHOTOGRAPH IN QUESTION IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN COMPOSED OR MADE UP BY SOME SORT OF TRICK TECHNIQUE REQUIRING TWO OR MORE EXPOSURES OR ELSE WAS A TRANSPARENT PLASTIC OR FLORESCENT PAINTED BALLOON OR WAS A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. THE LATTER IS LESS APPARENT DUE TO THE SPOTTING IRREGULAR TONE OF THE CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE IN FRONT. IT IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT THE BRIGHT LIGHT WITH HALO EFFECT (TOP REAR OF OBJECT) WAS PHYSICALLY A PART OF THE CIGAR SHAPE BECAUSE ANY LIGHT AS BRIGHT AS THAT ON TOP OF AN OBJECT WOULD HAVE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM THE OBJECTS TOP SURFACE; THEREFORE, IT IS BELIEVED THIS LIGHT WAS MADE BY ANOTHER EXPOSURE.
