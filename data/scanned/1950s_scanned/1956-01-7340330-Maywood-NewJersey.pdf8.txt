There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

IT MOVED IN A ABSOLUTE STRAIGHT LINE
NEVER, DURING MY OBSERVATION DID IT ARCH IN MY VIEW OR CHANGE DIRECTIONS. THE OBJECT WAS SOLID AND OF A SHINE OF SECONDS.
IF IT IS MY IMPRESSION - A REAL SHARP YELLOW SHEEN IN THE MANUFACTURE OF NEON LIGHT FROG SAYS SEEN AND GONE QUITE SIMILAT TO WHAT I SAW.
