FLOWER AND COOK OBSERVATORIES
1955 January 25

The Commanding Officer, U.S.C. & G.S.,
United Pettersen Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Sir:

Before making my request, I had better tell you my official position so that you understand the background why I am writing. I am president of the Flower and Cook Observatories, and assistant professor of astronomy. At my request, a former director of the Flower and Cook Observatories, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, had to retire automatically at 68. I was director of the Flower and Cook Observatories; I am no longer, and the last important one of which is enclosed. On pages 115 and 116 you will find that I am still director of research. I hope this explains that all others have been replaced.

Now as to my request: On 1957 March 15 at about 10 p.m. (E.S.T.), a very brilliant object passed over the United States. Most reliable newspaper clippings report it was observed by very many people, most of small value, as coordinates are not given.

At the object was so brilliant, there seems every chance that some photographer happened to take a picture of it. If so, and if possible its orbit in space can be determined, and if possible its orbit in space can be determined, and if will be highly appreciated. The reports will be carefully returned, and if possible its orbit in space can be determined, and if will be highly appreciated.

I served on the scientific staff of the Air Force during the Second World War. I had the proper clearance.

Very respectfully yours,

Dept. of Astronomy, 
University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia 4, Pa.
