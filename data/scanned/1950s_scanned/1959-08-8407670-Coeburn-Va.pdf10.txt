The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a document from the Air Technical Intelligence Center of the United States Air Force regarding a UFO sighting in Coeburn, Virginia in August 1959.

REPLY TO AFCIN-4E2

SUBJECT: UFO Photograph - Coeburn, Va. (

TO: SAFOI-3D (Major L. J. Tucker)

1. The attached negative was forwarded to ATIC by Mr. who claims the photograph is that of an unidentified flying object, and was taken by him in Coeburn, Va. during August 1959.

2. The ATIC analysis of the film is that the spots are "air balls" and that they appear to be either out-of-focus scattered light, or due to some defect in the film during developing and preventing small areas from being reached by the developer.

3. Mr. stated in his letter that he has been informed that the Air Force pays $100.00 for photographs of UFO's. This is, of course, not true, and it is suggested that this information be included in your reply.

4. The address of the witness is:
