A/2c L, 3/Set. Eugene L. Chaffee, AP 576-01-167 (Operations Specialist) and A/2c C.L. Ackroyd, AF 11-66-52 (Operations Specialist) reported the following information on an unidentified flying object:

At 2210 local, 31 July 1952, while enroute to their living quarters after a briefing session, the witnesses observed an unidentified object to the north of Kadena Air Base. The object was moving straight down, but its course changed erratically thereafter, finally moving off to the north.

As it again moved across the sky, it picked up considerable speed and left behind it a trail of clouds in the sky that might have caused a reflection or refraction of light.

The object appeared to be round, with little depth, and its altitude was unknown. The object disappeared from view through the clouds and was not seen again.
