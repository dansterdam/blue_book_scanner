Dayton, Ohio. Sighting reported 6 Nov 57 at 7:15 p.m. 
Witness: Mr. ----, age 53, of 5 Orange St., Dayton, Ohio. Occupation: Manager, Dayton Plumbing Supply Co. 
Narrative: Witness was driving his car east on the Rte. 4 Bypass, approximately 7 miles west of Dayton, when he observed a bright light approaching from the southwest. The light appeared to be about 10,000 ft. in altitude and was moving at high speed, approximately 800-1,000 mph. The light was very bright, brighter than a star, and appeared to be surrounded by a glow or haze. As the light approached, it suddenly increased in size, then decreased in size, then blinked out. The total duration of the sighting was about 10 seconds.
Witness stated that the object was traveling much faster than any jet aircraft he had ever seen, and that it maneuvered in a manner that no known aircraft could duplicate. Witness was quite disturbed by the incident and felt that he had observed some kind of "flying saucer" or unidentified aerial object. 
The Air Force investigation concluded that the sighting was probably of a meteor or natural phenomenon, despite the witness' insistence that the object was under intelligent control and maneuvered in an unconventional manner.
