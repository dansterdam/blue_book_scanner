It's Only Star, Folks! 'Thing' Is Identified From Plane Window
By AP - Weatherly, Pa., July 7 (AP) - Passengers on a commercial airliner saw "something" in the sky last night, but North Central Airlines Co-pilot Capt. William Zabel identified it as merely the Morning Star. 
The passengers were aboard an NC 12 flight from Minneapolis to Pittsburgh when they spotted the "thing" through the plane's windows. Zabel, who has been flying for 12 years, said the object was only the planet Venus.
"We were cruising at an altitude of about 23,000 feet when one of the passengers spotted it and asked me what it was," Zabel said. "I told him it was just the Morning Star, or the planet Venus, and he seemed satisfied.
"We had a good view of it and it was definitely not a flying saucer or anything unusual. It was just the bright planet."
Some of the passengers, however, said they saw the "thing" maneuvering and that it appeared to be larger than a star. But Zabel said the object was stationary and remained in the same position throughout the 30-minute flight.
"I've been flying 12 years and I know what the morning star looks like," he said. "That's all it was."
