STATEMENT OF: PVT RAY E. HAMPSHIRE  UNCLASSIFIED
US 25 136 144

While watching several jets and their vapor trails, I noticed what looked like a star at a greater altitude. By watching it for awhile it seemed to move back and forth. So I went over to a GCA site and told them to try and track the object. While they were setting up on the UFO some of them picked up these objects straight overhead. So they set in auto-tracking on them, it appeared to be several objects of the "VT" people and the clutter was about 15,000 yds. The antenna swept about 1800 and they lost them. So I returned back to the MPG and they said there was another object overhead so we watched it for a while then it took off in a northward direction and passed the jets which were almost out of sight. Then I lost it.
