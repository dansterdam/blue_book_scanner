No Case (Information Only)
30 April 1956 East Mansfield, Massachusetts

April 30, East Mansfield, Mass. - Mrs. Gilmore, 1776 East Street, described what appeared to be a bonfire in the sky at 8:15 p.m. She said, it came whistling down and plunged to the street, just a few feet from her house. A ball of fire, the size of a baseball. Then it toppled over and hit the road, in a burst of orange flame. The newspaper account added, â€œSmall fragments burned on the ground. They were brought into the Gilmore home; but as they cooled, they faded away, disappeared without trace. In a few moments, there was nothing left...Only a strange burnt mark in grass on the roadside where the fire burned. (Mansfield News-Times, 5/7).
