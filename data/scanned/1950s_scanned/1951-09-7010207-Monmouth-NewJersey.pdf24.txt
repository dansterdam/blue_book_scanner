ON THE SCOPE AND APPEARED TO BE HOVERING.
THE OPERATORS LOOKED OUT OF THE VAN IN AN
ATTEMPT TO SEE THE TGT SINCE IT WAS AT SUCH A
SHORT RANGE, HOWEVER OVERCAST CONDITIONS
PREVENTED SUCH OBSERVATION. RETURNING TO THEIR
POSITIONS THE TGT WAS OBSERVED TO BE CHANGING
ITS ELEVATION AT AN EXTREMELY RAPID RATE,
THE CHANGE IN RANGE WAS SO SMALL THE OPRS
BELIEVED THE TGT MUST HAVE RISEN NEARLY VERTICALLY.
THE TGT CEASED ITS RISE IN ELEVATION AT AN
ELEVATION ANGLE OF APPRX 1500 MILS AT WHICH TIME
IT PROVEDED TO MOVE AT AN EXTREMELY RAPID RATE
IN RANGE IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION ONCE AGAIN
THE SPEED ON THE TGT EXCEEDING THE AIDED
TRACKING ABILITY OF THE SCR 584 SO THA MANUAL
TRACKING BECAME NECESSARY. THE RADAR TRACKED
THE TGT TO THE MAXIMUM RANGE OF 32000 YARDS
AT WHICH TIME THE TGT WAS AT AN ELEVATION ANGLE
OF 300 MILS. THE OPERATORS DID NOT ATTEMPT TO
JUDGE THE SPEED IN EXCESS OF THE AIDED TRACKING
RATE OF 700 MPH.
