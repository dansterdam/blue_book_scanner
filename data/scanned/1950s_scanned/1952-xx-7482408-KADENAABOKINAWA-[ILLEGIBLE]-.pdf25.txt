Kadena, Okinawa 7 July, 1952
My visual observation at about 2145 on 7 July, 1952, in Kadena, Okinawa. While on a routine night flight in a T-6 aircraft, I observed a luminous object which appeared to be stationary. The object was not a star or planet as the night was clear and there were no other similar lights visible at the time. The object appeared to be at high altitude and did not resemble any type of known aircraft. I kept the object under observation for approximately 2 minutes before it seemed to fade away into the distance. I was unable to determine the exact size, shape or altitude of the object, but it appeared to be moving very rapidly when it disappeared from sight. I have had considerable experience in night flying and am familiar with various aircraft and celestial phenomena, and this observation did not resemble any known type of aircraft or celestial body that I am familiar with.
