Brilliant Meteor Seen 
By Many Here Saturday

A brilliant meteor seen in broad daylight was reported by a number of Tacoma residents who were amazed to see such a sight shortly after the moon Saturday. 
Among the callers to The Tacoma Tribune office was Frank A. Reds of 5019 So. L. who said he saw the meteor's "silver streak" that looked like a rocket streak and left a trail.
As they watched, it turned downward and disappeared.
D. J. Moran of 9804 American Ave. S.W. said he saw an oblong object, shining down behind some trees, and he thought it to be a crashing plane.
Others described it in various terms, some thinking of it as a flying saucer, but all here who saw it were unanimous that it appeared luminous and of high speed. 
Tacoma, however, was not the only point of vantage to see the celestial visitor as it was witnessed generally over the entire Northwest. Following is a report:
