The following information was furnished this office by the 6th OSI District (ID), Robins Air Force Base, Robins Field, Georgia:

"Captain EUGENE E. McMANUS, AC-66650S, 511th Operations Squadron, 511th Air Base Group, Turner AFB, Ga., reported to this office on 24 July 1952 that on 23 July 1952, while testing and awaiting clearance from Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, to conduct a training flight, he and his wingman observed four silvery, circular aerial objects located in the vicinity of Lockbourne AFB and Lockbourne ARS, Ohio. Captain McMANUS stated that these objects were easily visible to him, and that there were four (4) in number. Capt. McMANUS further stated that one of the objects seemed to hover above the other three objects and shoot red and green lights which appeared similar to bursts of small arms fire. Capt. McMANUS observed these objects for approximately 15 minutes and described them as being round in shape and almost fluorescent white in color. He added that he arranged himself so that he could sight the objects through the plexiglass dome of his aircraft. Capt. McMANUS stated that the objects did not seem to have any forward motion, but rather seemed to be stationary or hovering. He could not determine the exact size of the objects, but stated they appeared somewhat larger than a C-54 aircraft. Capt. McMANUS further added that weather conditions from Lockbourne AFB set up an observer telescope".
