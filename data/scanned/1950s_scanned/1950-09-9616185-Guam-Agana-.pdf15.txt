The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr.

Your letter of 21 April addressed to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has been referred to this office to reply.

I am sure that you are aware that the U.S. Air Force is charged with the responsibility of investigating and analyzing all cases of unidentified flying objects. Further, as you know, the policy of the Air Force is to inform the public of the findings of this program.

To date the Air Force has, in our investigation of many cases, uncovered no physical evidence which would indicate the presence of any extra-terrestrial, physical, and/or intelligent sources nor has there been any evidence that unidentified flying objects constitute a threat or danger to the national security of the United States.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheets on this subject. They plainly state the Air Force position on this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
Office of Information Services

Mr. David H. Dennet
