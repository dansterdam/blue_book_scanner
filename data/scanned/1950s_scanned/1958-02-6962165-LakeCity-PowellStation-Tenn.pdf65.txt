"RYAN SANDERSON SEES GREEN FIREBALL: On the night of Saturday, February 8, the well-known attorney, Robert L. Sanderson, and GET Vice President of the Charlotte, North Carolina, and had just passed the tiny village of Mioco (about 30 miles southeast of Raleigh), when in the back seat, noticing a bright in the northwest luminous object, rising behind the trees in the southwest and catching up with the car. At the time, the trees were silhouetted on a clear sky, and as the object approached it appeared to be in the shape of an elongated oval, emitting a 50 foot or more bright and tapering sharp tail, from which spurted a few orange sparks that looked like short shoots from a rifle. It appeared like a rounded, three-dimensional thing, not a mere glaring light. It passed over, to their left, and within four seconds was lost to view behind the trees. In the northwestly and northernmost maneuvers, the horizontal course of this object seem to put it in the general class of the enigmatic "green fireballs"."
