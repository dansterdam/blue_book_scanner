In the above-described shape and position, apparently not moving, for approximately (33) seconds. It seemed to shine with a bright metallic glisten and to show no signs of blinking lights. The object then appeared to assume a conical type shape, and approximately half of its altitude at this instant, a bright glowing greenish bluelight was observed emanating from its base, narrowing as it proceeded to the object's top. This glowing light seemed to flash and diminish in size at the bottom, and the object moved to diminish in size. Upon the cessation of the greenish blue light, the object seemed to gently descend in an almost straight line, traveling at a descent angle of approximately 30 degrees to the ground, and remained in sight for approximately one and one-half (1-1/2) to two (2) minutes, and then disappeared from view.
