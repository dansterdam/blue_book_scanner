The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a pointing arrow and the text "In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it."

The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with a person standing in the foreground, and two smaller sketches on the sides. The larger sketch appears to be an example of how to complete the larger sketch from the first image.

The third sketch is a smaller landscape view with a curved horizon line.
