The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page discusses two dates that are mentioned as possibly being the sighting of an object, and the writer states that their wife saw the object in November and they saw it in October.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

22 March from Maxwell AFBASE. I wouid about northern a few minutes after 9:10 there. 

The information I have given on my information is any tions that may come is informed upon regarding documents or information as much as they possibly can. 

The two dates that appear as to seeing the object are unrelated. My wife saw it in November and I saw it in October. If you have experience of reports from MAT-93 to verify the dates the object was observed, would indicate clearly the date.
