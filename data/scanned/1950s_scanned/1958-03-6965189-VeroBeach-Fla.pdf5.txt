17 April 1958

Dear Colonel [redacted],

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 25 March 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object sighting on that date.

A check of radar, ground observer corps, civil airlines, military bases and other agencies in the area failed to reveal any reports of unusual activity on that date.

For your information I am inclosing a copy of the latest Department of Defense Fact Sheet on this subject, dated 9 November 1957.

Thank you again for your interest.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
