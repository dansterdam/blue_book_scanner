APPENDIX I
Artesia, New Mexico - 16 January 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 16 January 1952, two members of a balloon project from the General Mills Aeronautical Research Laboratory and four other civilians observed two unidentified aerial objects in the vicinity of the balloon they were observing. The objects were described as having a spherical or circular shape, and were 30,000 ft. and 20,000 ft. in altitude at the time of the observation.

The objects were observed twice, once from Artesia, New Mexico, and once from the Artesia Airport. In the first instance, one round object was observed moving in an arc, and in the second instance, two objects were observed, one smaller than the other. The balloon, according to the witnesses, was at an altitude of 5,000 ft. and the objects were observed at higher altitudes.

A short time later the same two observers and four civilian pilots were observing the balloon from the Artesia Airport. Two objects at approximately the same location were observed northwest. They circled the balloon, or apparently so, and flew off to the northwest. The time of observation was about 60 seconds. The two objects were the same color and size as the first object. They were flying side-by-side. When the objects disappeared from view, they disappeared and the observers assumed they were disc-shaped and had turned on edge to bank.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Unfortunately this report was not made until 5 April and did not reach ATIC until 16 April. Due to this time lapse, no further investigation is contemplated. The observers are known to be very reliable and experienced.

III. CONCLUSIONS
None.
