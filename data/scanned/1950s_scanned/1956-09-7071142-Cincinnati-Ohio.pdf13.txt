a. Textile sample:
The sample purported to be so-called "angel's-hair" which has been disseminated and micro-analyzed. Tests and physical characteristics indicate that the material is rayon or rayonlike fiber and in no sense "angel's-hair" as claimed. The material shows no unusual characteristics and did not volatilize.
This is in the type of material sometime widely disseminated as having supernatural or unidentified characteristics. It is in no sense a product of other than normal textile manufacturing process.
Sincerely,
