No noise was apparent on object's west side. SOURCE said maneuverability was exceptional and precision of motion amazing. Relationship to the aircraft, SOURCE stated that his aircraft passed under the observation of the object and continued on a heading of 270 degrees.

The object at this point appeared to "oscillate" and "pulse" and crossed his flight path at an estimated 1,000 feet.

The size was estimated in comparison to a 50-cent piece held in the palm of his hand at arm's length and appeared to be approximately 12-16 inches in diameter. SOURCE noted one red light resembling an aircraft running light on top of the dome. The remainder of the object was luminous, giving off a steady brilliant whitish-blue glow. SOURCE obtained a good view of the object from underneath side while passing under it. Source described the surface as smooth, wave-like impression. (Final 4' sketch of under side).
