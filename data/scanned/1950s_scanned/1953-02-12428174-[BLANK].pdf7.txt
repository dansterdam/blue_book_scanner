Other Simultaneous Sightings
Any sighting of an object seen from two separated locations is relatively important. These include two locations on the ground, from the ground and air, etc. Or the best way to gather very accurate data is to utilize two theodolites or a theodolite combined with a plain visual sighting. The use of a theodolite is considered an instrumented observation. For those who are not familiar with the term, a theodolite is a device used for accurately measuring the azimuth and elevation angles during weather balloon flights. Nearly every air base and large civilian airport has one. It can be put into use by merely calling the weather station and requesting that they try to observe the reported object.
The data needed are the time, elevation, and azimuth at one minute intervals for as long as the object is in view or for at least 20 minutes if it appears to be hovering. If an adjacent air base can be contacted and requested to do the same, preferably at the same time, you've hit the jackpot as far as good data are concerned.

Reporting Solutions
If, during an investigation of a sighting, after a TWX has been sent reporting the incident, the investigating officer should identify the reported object, ATIC should be immediately notified as to the solution.
Popular Theories
Many theories have been advanced that all of the reports are due to mirages, sun dogs, ice clouds and what-have-you. Some of our reports are caused by such things. We have received excellent photos of sun dogs and descriptions of mirages. These are definitely in the minority, however, and cause only a small percentage of the sightings.
Another popular solution is that all "flying saucers" are "skyhook" balloons. To check this, a study of about 25 cross-country balloon tracks were made.
