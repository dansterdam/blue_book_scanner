The image contains two sketches.

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) and an object above it. The instructions ask you to imagine being at the point shown and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. You are then asked to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.

The second sketch shows two larger scenes. The main scene appears to be a landscape with buildings and trees, with a person standing in the foreground. The smaller scene on the right shows a silhouetted person standing on a road with mountains in the background.
