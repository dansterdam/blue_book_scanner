Transcription of the text in the document:

Oh course they are supposed to be rellow and shiny and hover and perform fantastic aerial maneuvers, but this is not the case in the present instance. My friend 'ho) originally spotted the object says it was a steady and rather dull grayish-white color. As he watched it, it would seem to move ahead for a short distance, then stop and hover for a few seconds, then move ahead again, but always maintaining a steady and even speed, neither accelerating nor decelerating abruptly. It was observed for several minutes before it disappeared from sight. My friend says it made no sound whatsoever, in contrast to some reports of humming or buzzing sounds associated with UFOs.

This object was seen in the early evening, shortly after sunset, when it would have been difficult to make out details of shape or structure. My friend did not attempt to estimate its size or altitude, since he had no known objects nearby for comparison. He is a mature and responsible individual, not given to fantasies or undue excitement. Although he was somewhat puzzled by what he saw, he does not claim it was anything more than an unidentified flying object, the nature of which he cannot explain. He reported it promptly to the authorities, as he felt it was his civic duty to do so, particularly since the object was observed in the vicinity of a major airport.
