RADAR STATION INVESTIGATES WAVE OF SAUCER REPORTS IN
LEELANU, MICHIGAN: Major Homer D. Chappell, commanding officer of the 255th 
Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, was directed by D/4C, 
USAF, on 27 March 1956 to investigate a wave of saucer reports in the Leelanau, 
Michigan, area. The case report was supplied by a civilian, who said that the 
object was sighted by several persons, was observed for about 45 minutes, and 
that it maneuvered with the naked eye, but when Chappell watched it through binoculars,
the object disappeared. Then Chappell said he saw a big, bright, white light hovering motionless,
then it began to move slowly and then rapidly accelerate and disappear. He said the
object did not appear to be an aircraft and that it defied explanation.
