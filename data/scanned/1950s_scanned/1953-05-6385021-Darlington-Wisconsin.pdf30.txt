5 June 1953

Miss C. Clucas 
Perkins Observatory
Ohio State University
Columbus 10, Ohio

Dear Miss Clucas:

As I promised at our recent meeting at Ohio State, you will find enclosed a copy of the report of an unidentified light over Darlington, Wisconsin, on 31 May 1953. This was taken from the Dayton Journal. 

As yet, I have received no answer to our query to Max Field at Madison and as soon as this comes in, I will give you a call and we can compare notes.

Thanks again for your quick action on this matter. I hope you will mail this sighting down. I think probably Dr. Hynek is on the right track when he says that one was a meteor and the other a meteor and the other a meteor.

Best regards,

1st Lt R. H. Olsson
