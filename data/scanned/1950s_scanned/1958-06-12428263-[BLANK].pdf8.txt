A. As with any free-lance author, Mr. Ruppelt's Theories, opinions, and conclusions are his own, and not necessarily those of the Air Force. His book was reviewed and passed on by Hq USAF from a security viewpoint only. While most of the statements in his book are factual, the inferences and implications that he attempts to leave are definitely questionable.

As project officer of UFO program, Ruppelt had good knowledge and appreciation of various technical and scientific fields; competent in monitoring investigations, studies; collecting and correlating data for analyses, and conclusions. However, he was not an expert in highly specialized fields such as astrophysics, meteorological optics, psychological influences, etc., for which Air Force has relied on many scientists and specialists, whose conclusions are considered more valid.

E. Answers and info in order of questions submitted in Mr. McElroy's letter: (1) Project Blue Book is a continuous Air Force project; is directly related to Air Force responsibility of defense of Air Space over U.S.; and rigidly prescribed by a standing directive, AFR 200-2, for the detection, identification and analysis of things in the air that may be a threat to U.S. (2) Yes, Reports still continue to come in. (3) Since 1953 a total of 2764 reports have been received, for an average of slightly over 550 per year.
