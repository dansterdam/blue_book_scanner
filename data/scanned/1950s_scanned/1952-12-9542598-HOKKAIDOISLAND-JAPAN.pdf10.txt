STATEMENT

We were watching a tight orbit over Sakhalin (48°48' 27'N) at 20,000' awaiting a radio contact on 8276 kcs. The object was first sighted at 0600. It appeared to be making a ground beacon. It was unable to establish radio contact. It came from a westerly direction at a high altitude of 18 due to a cloud cover below a maneuver to descend it came to a 4500' altitude and continued on a constant course toward the east. The color change was from green to white and back to red. The maneuver lasted for approximately 5 minutes. After it changed to white, its speed increased to approximately twice of that of our jet fighter heading on it. It rolled out of our sight in a vertical attitude, leaving a trail behind it. When we lost the object our heading was 095° and the time was 1928.
