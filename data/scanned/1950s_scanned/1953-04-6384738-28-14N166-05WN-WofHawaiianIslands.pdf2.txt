Second Officer A. Horrigan of the American SS. American
Starling, Capt. G. Bitsikas, Master, reports the following obser
vation: 

“On April 14, 1953, at 1456 G. M. T., in lat. 35°07’ N., lon.
153°08' E, a meteor was observed bearing 320° at an altitude of
30°. The meteor traveled almost horizontally and disappeared
bearing 295° at an altitude of 25°. The movement of this meteor
was relatively slow being visible for from 5 to 7 seconds, and was
a brilliant white light about twice the magnitude of Venus. The
unusual sight excited the imagination of the lookout who reported
lights in the sky. It, indeed, resembled no meteor that this ob
server had ever witnessed, for about halfway in its travel the
meteor seemed to be five lights moving in procession. There 
was no increase or decrease in the brilliancy of the light and/or
lights which resembled a mother ship which had launched and
was guiding other ships. All five lights moved across the sky in
a line and then suddenly disappeared simultaneously on the bear
ing and altitude mentioned above.”
