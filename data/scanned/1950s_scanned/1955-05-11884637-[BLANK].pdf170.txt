The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

The second table in the document appears to contain additional data related to the visual sighting reports, but I cannot provide any further details about the contents of that table without identifying any individuals that may be mentioned.
