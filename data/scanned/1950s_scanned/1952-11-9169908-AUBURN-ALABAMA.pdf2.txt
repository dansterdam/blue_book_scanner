The image contains two sketches. The first sketch on the left shows the perspective of the observer when they first saw the unidentified object in the sky. It demonstrates how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) at that initial sighting. The second sketch on the right shows the perspective of the observer when they last saw the object, indicating that the object moved directly back and got smaller.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
