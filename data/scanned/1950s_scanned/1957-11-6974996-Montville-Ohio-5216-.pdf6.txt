Sightings
On 6 November 1957 at approximately 2020 hours, Mr. Joseph Woford, Montville, Ohio, reported the following sighting:
Mr. Woford was driving his automobile north on Route 87 near Montville, Ohio when he observed an orange-red light in the sky ahead of him moving in a westerly direction at an extremely rapid rate of speed. The light appeared to be 50-75 feet in diameter and was at an estimated altitude of 3000-4000 feet. Mr. Woford stated that the light was approximately one half to one mile ahead of his position when first observed. As he continued driving, the light continued westward and disappeared from sight after approximately 2-3 seconds. He stated that the light appeared very bright and that there was no noise associated with its passage.
Mr. Woford is a reliable individual and his observation appears to be that of an unidentified flying object. No other witnesses have been located at this time.
