The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a letter dated December 22, 1959 from Lawrence J. Tacker, Major, USAF, Public Information Division Office of Information, to a Mrs. [redacted] of Stoneham, Massachusetts.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Your recent letter addressed to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, concerning an unidentified flying object sighted by your family in August 1959 has been referred to this Office.

This Office is responsible for maintaining liaison with the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center in the investigation of unidentified flying object sightings. This sighting was therefore referred to in your November letter to this Office, which sighting was determined to be too old to be of current value in our valved evaluation.

However, since you feel that this sighting was significant, I am enclosing two United States Air Force questionnaires which should be completed by you and your husband. When the completed questionnaires are returned, they will be forwarded to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
