The first sketch shows a curved line and includes instructions to imagine the viewer is at the point shown, place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape with a person standing in the foreground, and two smaller sketches on the right side depicting different views of a landscape.
