IT IS THE REPORTING OFFICER'S OPINION THAT THE OBSERVER MIGHT
HAVE NOTICED A NATURAL PHENOMENON SUCH AS STARLIGHT. THERE
IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A LIGHT CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT BEING IN THE
AREA AT THE TIME SINCE LOVELL FIELD IS NEARBY. THE REPORT WAS
TAKEN BY TELEPHONE AND THEREFORE FURTHER ANALYSIS IS NOT POSSIBLE.
