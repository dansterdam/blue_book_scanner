(COMMENTS (FOR RECORD, IF NECESSARY))
1. I have reviewed this file and signed the attached Memo No. 2 addressed to APOIN-4. Please have Col Hurley initial the green sheet and dispatch.
2. This has been a long, involved and difficult task. I would like to express appreciation to Major Pryme and Mr. Sanderson for their most effective efforts in getting this thing back in proper focus.
3. When the new regulation is published, it may be a good idea to wrap up briefing for Gen Lewis to advise him of our progress in realignment of roles and missions.
Further, until the new document takes hold, I suggest Major Byrne continue to watch the situation for APOIN. If and when it starts to go off the track again and misconcued communications arrive in APOIN, he, as the most knowledgeable officer, can take the immediate action to reorient proper adherence to our intra-air Force agreements.
