or three minutes a car could be seen rounding a curve from right to left. Another light was observed which disappeared and then appeared at another location. The investigators thought that that someone had probably gone to bed as it was very late, and some neighbor of the first had come home. This theory was just laughed at. To the investigators, it had the appearance of a distant house light. After watching in other areas, everyone returned home.

(1) Drove to Clintwood to contact Mr.   . It was very difficult to locate and when we finally located him, he didn't have very long before going back to school (see TAB E).

(2) Drove to Haysi to contact Mr.    Mr.    did not live in Haysi and investigators had to drive back toward Clintwood. Source lives south of Haysi several miles (see TAB B).

(3) Drove to High Knob which is situated approximately 10 miles southwest of Coeburn. It is a recreation area in a national forest. The trees in this area are thick and tall this time of year, making it impossible to see anywhere but up.

(4) Returned to Coeburn for the evening. At approximately 2300, a Mr.   , a newspaper reporter, visited the investigators and asked for information concerning the sightings. We could not give the information requested and Mr.   was so informed. As he had observed some of the strange lights we asked him for his description (see TAB F).

e.: Friday, 12 June 1959:
