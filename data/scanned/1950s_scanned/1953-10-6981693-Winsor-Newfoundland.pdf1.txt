10. CONCLUSION: Though all observations tend to fit the pattern of a Saturnoid-type object, the possibility of a meteor or distant flare cannot be eliminated. The object was under observation for about 15 minutes, during which time it remained stationary at first, then moved very rapidly on a straight course to the north-northwest before disappearing. It appeared to be a bright bluish-white object, flaring and pulsating at irregular intervals.
