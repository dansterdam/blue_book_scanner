"A brightly lighted object was observed at about 1155 1\larch 1958 by Sgt. Dexter A. Smith, while he was on duty at Lowry AFB, Colorado. The object was reported to be approximately the size of a basketball, round in shape and emitting a bright white light. The object was observed as it flew across the sky from east to west and then disappeared in the distance. The object was observed for approximately 15 seconds and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. Sgt. Smith reported that the object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet and was absolutely silent in flight. Sgt. Smith had visual observation of the object for approximately 15 seconds before it disappeared from sight. He stated that he had never observed anything quite like it before. All personnel on duty in the control tower also observed the object at the same time. The information was immediately telephoned to the Operations Officer on duty and all pertinent information was relayed to the Project Blue Book Office of the Air Force at Dayton, Ohio. A complete report has been forwarded to this office. The weather at the time of the observation was clear, with light winds and good visibility. The object was described as round, like a basketball, and emitting a bright white light. It was observed traveling from east to west at a very high rate of speed and at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. All observers agreed that the object was absolutely silent in flight and unlike any aircraft with which they are familiar. The report was made in accordance with existing Air Force directives."
