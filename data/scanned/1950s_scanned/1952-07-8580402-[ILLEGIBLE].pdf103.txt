Carson Sink, Nevada
July 2zt, 1952

Three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) were observed by two Air Force Pilots in B-25 aircraft at 11,000 ft altitude on July 2h, 1952 at 1540 hours, PST. The objects were shaped like silver-white arrowheads (somewhat similar to a Delta wing aircraft) and appeared slightly larger than an F-86 aircraft. The speed was estimated as very fast; total observation time was three - four seconds. The time was too short to make any definite observations. The sighting is carried in Air Force files as unidentified.
