No Case (Information Only)

29 June - July 30 1956
Yonkers, New York

Case: The Herald-Statesman of Yonkers, July 3, said, "Skyvatchers report thrilling post-midnight sight..." It is of orange color, more nearly red. To one with a go-power telescope, it appears to be round, than oval. It was moving at what seemed to be a fast speed. The phenomenon was noted after 1 a.m. on Saturday. Another report tells of the orange-red color moving around the skies near or a little later just ahead of the rain. The remainder of the newspapers item gibbered in ridicule, a letter received from XX Yonkers, describes his observations in more detail. Said,

"... I phoned the Herald-Statesman and spoke to Ossie Reisler, who seemed describing my sighting. He asked, "You saw it, too?" I said yes. I told him I didn't know anyone else saw anything and not to use my name if he used the story.  

On the night of June 22, at about 11:40 p.m. there was a bright orange-red light moving around the sky. It seemed to be about 500 feet up. It moved erratically, then hovered for a while, then suddenly shot away to the south at a tremendous speed and was gone. There were others there, too, who saw it But I didn't know them. About 12:15 a.m. on June 23rd, the same or a similar object appeared again, only this time it seemed to be about 1,000 feet up. It hovered for a while and then shot away to the west at a terrific speed and was gone. 

Then, on the night of June 22nd at about 12:20 a.m. Mrs. X and I were sitting on the back porch about 10:30 p.m. and saw another object coming from the north. It was moving directly overhead. It seemed to be round or oval and had a reddish-orange color. It moved rapidly across the sky and then stopped and hovered. Then it suddenly shot away to the west and was gone in a flash. I don't know what these things are, but they are something quite different from anything I've ever seen before. They are extremely hard to keep in view due to their accelerating speed. I checked it for 15 seconds and when I returned to the house my wife said "There, it went!"
