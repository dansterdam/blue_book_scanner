The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document, likely a report from Project Blue Book, about a UFO sighting incident that occurred on December 9, 1952 in San Antonio, Texas.

STATEMENT

1215 hours, 9 DEC 1952
SUBJEET: Unidentified Airborne Object, apparently one mile South of the Seven Sisters Road intersection San Antonio, Texas. Object was traveling in a south-westerly direction.

I was driving my car on a heading of approximately 0 degrees. Suddenly, a pale green light appeared in the sky about one-half mile to my left. It did not make any sound. The object seemed to be traveling at a very high rate of speed, much faster than any jet aircraft which I have observed. It was heading in a south-westerly direction and passed out of sight within 5 to 10 seconds. It appeared to be a two o'clock position on a slightly downward course. The velocity of the object seemed greater than any jet aircraft which I have observed.

The intensity of the light seemed to be comparatively brighter than any star or planet which I have observed. The object appeared to be descending on a slightly downward trend, seemingly losing velocity, and it seemed to dim somewhat as it proceeded on its course until it disappeared. 

The object was not like any jet aircraft which I have observed. Its shape appeared to be pointed or wedge-shaped.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
