The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The document is a "HEAD ROUTING SLIP" that includes information about an incident involving a "fireball" sighting on April 17, 1958. The document also mentions that a questionnaire was sent to the person involved in the sighting, who reported seeing a cylindrical object executing "right-angle turns".
