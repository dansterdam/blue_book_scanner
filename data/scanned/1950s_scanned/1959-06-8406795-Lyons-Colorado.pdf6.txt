U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)
In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if needed.
The handwritten text describes an observation of a bright object with light beams that hovered over a field for a period of time before suddenly disappearing. The observer mentions that the object did not follow the normal flight patterns of any known aircraft.
