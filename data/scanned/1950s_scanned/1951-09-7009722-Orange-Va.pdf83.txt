The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document. The document discusses an interview with a witness, Mr. [redacted], who was interviewed on the evening of November 7, 1951 by Lt. Ruppelt and Mr. H. N. Bossart of the Reese AFB OSI detachment. The purpose of the visit was to obtain data on the photos taken by Mr. [redacted] and to attempt to determine the authenticity of the photos. Mr. [redacted] was again questioned as to the events leading up to taking the photos and how he took them. His story was identical to that given in the OSI report.

Further details are provided, including that Mr. [redacted] had experience in taking pictures at night and had experimented with star shots. He realized that he would have to give the objects as much light as possible, so he responded with a 1/10 of a second, the "fastest" combination for a Kodak 35. The object appeared at about 90 degrees from the horizontal, and the direction was NNE. The objects went a little to his right and disappeared at about 30 degrees from the horizontal at SSE. This gives an arc of very close to 120 degrees that the object followed as it was captured by his camera.

The interrogating officer, Lt. Ruppelt, has been an amateur photographer for 14 years and all the data and procedures given by Mr. [redacted] were accurate and very logical. No progress was made in attempting to determine whether or not the photos were authentic.
