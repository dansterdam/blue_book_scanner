The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the letter "A" marking the point where the object was first seen, and the letter "B" showing how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen. The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a person standing in the foreground, and another smaller landscape scene in the inset.

Text extracted from the image:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
