I would like to report an experience I had early this morning
about six o'clock.

I was driving south towards Frederick, Md. and was about eight
miles from the town when I noticed what appeared to be a slight or 
very small bright or glowing light. This light seemed to be hovering
or standing still about six hundred yards to the right of my car.
I eased up a little closer so that I could get a better view of this
light. As I got closer it seemed to move slowly to the right and 
then would make when on a twenty to one glide. It's speed was faster
than we are accustomed to seeing jets or fast aircraft travel. This
light or object appeared to be about the size of a basketball at the
distance it was from me. I observed it for about two minutes and 
then it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and
disappeared. In the field northwest of Frederick, Md.

I have referred to it as a light because there was no downward beam
or trail or any other indication of a craft. And it was more of a 
bluish light than an amber one.

Very truly yours
