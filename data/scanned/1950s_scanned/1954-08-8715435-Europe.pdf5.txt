1. In compliance with your request, laboratory examinations of 4 metal samples and a textile thread purported to be "angel hair" have been made at White Stork.

2. The following results are submitted to your offices:

a. Metal Samples:
All four samples were found to be ferro-chromium and magnetic and not radioactive. The composition obtained spectrographically for these samples was:
Chromium 67 - 71 percent
Silicon 0.1 - 1.0 percent
Ni, Co, & Mn 0.2 percent
Fe, Ca, & Al 0.5 percent
Balance

The crystalline structure and non-oxidized condition of these samples points directly to the fact that a high-temperature such as would be encountered by certain meteoritic origin has not been imposed. Both the common appearance and the analysis of these samples strongly suggest that they were cast from the same mold or steel foundry where chromium is customarily added to steel melts of this form.

b. Textile Sample:
The sample purported to be "angel hair," reportedly a volatile by-product of the fuel used in "flying saucers," was given both chemical and microscopic tests, and it is (in all probability ferron), a material commonly used in the U.S. which was very probably a synthetic textile after exposure to air for 72 hours in the Air Weapon Materials Branch did volatilize.

3. A formal report was not requested from White Stork. Rough draft memoranda from White Stork are attached hereto, and the samples which are man made are returned herewith.
