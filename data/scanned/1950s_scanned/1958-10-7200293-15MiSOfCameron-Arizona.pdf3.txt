Transcription of the text in the document:

WITNESSES IN Danville, Ill., saw the three to five objects in the sky at Monon, Ind. as they were moving in the same direction, occasionally to dart away in a different direction.

As Monon No. 91, a northbound freight, was passing Dillon's Crossing, the engineer and fireman saw four strange lighted objects in the sky just ahead of the locomotive. At first they thought they were airplanes, but soon realized they were not. As the train approached the lights they seemed to gather together, and then darted away, singly, and at high speed. This happened several times as the train went on to Indianapolis. The crew believes these were unconventional flying objects. However, the Air Force said they were not surprised and that these were probably reflections from the locomotive headlight. Other people in the area also witnessed the strange phenomenon.
