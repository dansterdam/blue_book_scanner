II. Report of Interview. (Continued)
D. Air Instructor, Dayton Municipal Airport, - 25 June 1954.
1. Upon completion of our discussion with Captain Wagenhals, we were introduced to Lt Colonel McClure (Reg AF Instructor). Colonel McClure had landed just before Lt. Roe. After landing, Lt Roe went to Colonel McClure's office and related the story to him. During our discussion with Colonel McClure he verified what we had previously obtained from the source on the UFO.
2. Lt. Roe suggested to Colonel McClure that at first he thought it was a star. But when he changed position a few times, it became apparent that it was not. (This statement was not revealed to the undersigned airman during his interview with the source.) Lt. Roe also stated he passed over the Dayton tower twice so that the tower personnel could observe the object, but sustained negative results.
3. Colonel McClure, who was returning from Pittsburg in a C-47, stated that visibility was good all the way from Pittsburg to Dayton. He also stated that a civilian Martin 202 had accompanied him from Pittsburg to Dayton. Just prior to landing the Dayton tower asked Colonel McClure if he had noticed any UFO, to which the Colonel replied "No".
4. Colonel McClure expressed the opinion that the UFO could have been a "scarcity" reflection which happens from time to time while flying an L-20 at night. However, the Colonel highly recommended Lt. Roe as a qualified observer and further stated, "This an old combat pilot with a lot of experience and in my (the Colonel's) opinion is a very well-sensible man, very reliable and sincere."
