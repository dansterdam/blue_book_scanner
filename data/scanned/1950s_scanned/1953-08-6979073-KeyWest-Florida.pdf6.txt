The image contains a document titled "UNCLASSIFIED" which appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, specifically related to a UFO sighting that occurred on 24 July 1953 in Key West, Florida.

The text in the document is as follows:

Between the hours of 2300 and 2330 EST, a student at the Fleet Sonar School United States Navy, Key West, Florida, observed a bright object in the sky over Key West. The object appeared to be approximately the size of a pin point or a star, very bright white in color, proceeding from low on the western sky-line to a point directly forward and overhead. The object then blinked out instantaneously before it reached the zenith. The observer described its distance from him as approximately 1000 to 1500 feet. Speed was reported as unknown, since the observer did not know the object's true size or distance from him. The observer stated that the object appeared to move in regular smooth circles.

Inquiry was made as to the observer's general reputation and character. His supervisor in Sonar Operations stated that he had no knowledge of the observer having shown poor judgment, poor maturity, or having exhibited any other peculiarities during his tour of duty. The supervisor described him as a quiet, conscientious, good student - not outstanding but above average. The interviewer adjudged him to be stable, well-adjusted, and very consistent with his answers after the observation.

The weather at the time of the observation was reported as a broken overcast. Clouds were reported to be solid to the west where the object disappeared. A check with CAA office of U.S. Weather Bureau at Boca Chica Key revealed no unusual activity on 22,300 feet.

There were several aircraft in the area and one of them was equipped with a searchlight. There is a possibility that the observer saw the searchlight scanning the area.

Conclusion: Other - probably searchlight or aircraft.
