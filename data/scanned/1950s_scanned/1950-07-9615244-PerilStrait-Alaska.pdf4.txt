Flying Saucers Seen in Sky Here

A number of Clinton county residents saw a phenomenon in the western sky Monday between 9:30 and 10 P.M. which they de- scribed as appearing to be flying saucers. 
Herbert Harcum, of Route 73, west of Wilmington; Mrs. C. A. Henry, Louise street; Mrs. Glenn Curtin, West Locust street, and Mrs. Roy Henry, of Benneft Road, all told the News-Journal they had witnessed the shooting lights in the sky.
Mrs. Roy Henry said they looked exactly like those she saw a year ago between 11 P. M. and 12 midnight, except for the one stationary light spot which Harcum and Mrs. C. A. Henry also saw.
Harcum described the lights as fuzzy revolving discs or saucers, not very high above the horizon which flitted across the sky. He said one of them went from north to the west, seemed to turn back toward the north for a short dis- tance and then stopped, remain- ing stationary, while other lights flashed across beneath this one.
Mrs. C. A Henry said the made things which flew across the sky to the left at a high rate of speed. Some of them seemed to be somewhat like a smoke ring, Mrs. Henry added.
Mrs. Glenn Curtin, who was driving into Wilmington on the Port William road when she no- ticed the lights, said they seemed to be in groups of two and would cross each other, traveling in op posite directions. She did not see the stationary light, however. 
There was no distinct appear- ance, Mrs. Roy Henry said, de- scribing the lights as similar to a dim kerosene flame. 
There were reports in Cincin- nati of strange lights in the sky and the Associated Press told the News-Journal that Cincinnati meteorologistoIplained that the lights were caused by a cloud condition which brought about the unusual play of light rays.
