TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

I was well aware of the fact that the personal "opinions" and "theories" of observers of these various phenomena are neither solicited nor appreciated, but I feel it my duty to give my personal impressions of this "manifestation" -- --to wit-- 

I had the distinct feeling that we,the viewers, were the objects of "observation",and not the other way around. That this "object" was not " solid" in the accepted sense,I feel certain ---- rather,it seemed to be living, sentient energy displaying intelligence and even (at least I seemed to sense) a very sense of humor. ----If not to use we yokels, why the blatant and open display complete with weird transfigurations? -- -I felt it was "laughing at us"

I have presented the facts to the foregoing to the best of my ability and with no exaggeration,and also with no deliberate intent to mislead or deceive.

We all know that the practice of deception and quackery is what makes the word of honest folks subject to doubt, so please accept this in the spirit with which it is submitted-----in the interest of scientific truth.

Signed:
Arnold, Missouri 63010
