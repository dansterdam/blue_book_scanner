The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a systematic study of unidentified flying objects by the United States Air Force.

Text extracted from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. Looked similar to Russian satellite, 20 ft/12 feet.

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.)
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not vary sure 
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Started to pulsate on form indicated, became dimmer and disappeared out of sight.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which would have the same appearance as the object which you saw. Like a small ball except not shiny. Than appeared to be lit some form or fluorescence, no plane seen.
