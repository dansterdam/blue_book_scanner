ATIC 0-06, 22 May 57, ATOIN-XL, SUBJ: Report on Oxnard UFO Case - 22 March 1957
A. This investigation is suggested as a result of a recent inquiry received by the Director from a private individual concerning an alleged UFO sighting in the Oxnard, California, area on 22 March 1957. The director's interest in such a case is understandable, since the Air Force's position on the publicity and evaluation of UFO reports is well known.
B. The report is an Air Force investigation (reference above) which substantiates the claim of the observer and indicates that a possible conventional explanation or identification of the object cannot be made at this time. Since the committee must come from Headquarters USAF, accordingly, it is the opinion of the Director that any further inquiry or investigation of this case should be over the signature of higher level, possibly the Office of Information Services.
6. In conclusion, it is the opinion of this Center that this case was improperly handled at its inception, and the unfortunate train of events which followed to give the observation undue prominence could have been avoided. The unit initially receiving the report should have contacted the nearby Air Base unit which was responsible for UFO investigations, instead of the local police and other civil authorities.
