TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

13 May 1952

Division (Def), Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, do hereby wish to make the following statement:

At approximately 1500 MST, 10 May 1952, I sighted an unidentified airborne object from my home at 2227 Eastern Avenue, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I went to the front porch of my home to observe the object more closely.

While watching the object, it went behind the Kirtland Air Force Base and identifying the various types of planes, suddenly an oval-shaped object came out again and identify an object that she had sighted in the sky. When I went out-side, this object was hovering over the Kirtland Air Force Base, at an altitude above 20,000 feet. The object was shaped like a disc and had a definite constant speed of about 150 miles per hour. I followed the object with my field glasses and observed that it had a definite dull orange color and appeared to be rotating slightly. I could not estimate the speed of the object, however, I cannot estimate the speed or the real height. In approximately 30 seconds, another object appeared in the southwest section. When I saw this, I ran across the street and telephoned the Control Tower of Kirtland Air Force Base and reported it to an officer on duty at that time. I warned him that I had it on the scope, but he said that we wasn't able to pick it up. By the time we finished our conversation the object was in the northwest, and it was much higher than the first one that I had identified. Two F-86's were flying at about 20,000 feet, and the object was much higher than their altitude.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 13th day of May 1952.
