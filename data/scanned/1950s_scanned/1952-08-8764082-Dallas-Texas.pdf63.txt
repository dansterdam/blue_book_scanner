Captain Ruppelt,

These remarks should clear up the questions which you asked in our recent telephone conversation.

Capt XXX, re: red flares on 21 Aug 52, could not locate.
No evidence of unusual or unusual comments sighted by tower personnel during past two weeks.

People flying where boys were reported and Deputy Sheriff told them about 14:00 and evil spirits before coming into contact with some.

Between living directly across the road from place where starting occurred, were contacted and stated they did not arrive home until after the incident occurred.

Deputy Partin states that there was no unusual odor when he arrived on the scene.

Key West Naval Station has blimp. It is possible the station at Jacksonville may have one, but we could not get a positive answer on them.

We received the machine in this return mail. We will see that for your, don't hesitate to call on us.
