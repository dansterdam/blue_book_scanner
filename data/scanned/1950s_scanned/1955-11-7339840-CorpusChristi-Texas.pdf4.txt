CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS
18 NOVEMBER 1955
THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT ON OR ABOUT 7 NOVEMBER 1955 A UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY MYSELF AND OTHERS IN THE SKY OVER CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS. IT WAS SIGHTED AT APPROXIMATELY 1500 HOURS AND OBSERVED FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 10 MINUTES. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE OVAL IN SHAPE AND SILVERY IN COLOR. IT MADE NO SOUND AND SEEMED TO BE TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. OCCASIONALLY IT WOULD STOP AND HOVER BRIEFLY BEFORE RESUMING ITS RAPID FLIGHT.
THE OBJECT WAS WITNESSED BY MYSELF AND SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE EMPLOYED AT THE LOCAL NAVAL AIR STATION. THEIR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE OBJECT WERE CONSISTENT WITH MY OWN OBSERVATIONS. WHILE WE WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT SIZE OF THE OBJECT, IT APPEARED TO BE QUITE LARGE.
THIS SIGHTING WAS REPORTED TO THE USAF UNIT LOCATED AT CORPUS CHRISTI AND I UNDERSTAND IT WAS INVESTIGATED BY PERSONNEL FROM PROJECT BLUE BOOK.
