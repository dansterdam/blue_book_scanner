FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

On the 21th day of June 1952, an Inspector Jack J. Grunstem, an officer in the 5th Security Division, reported several objsets observed at altitude of 2,000 feet. 

The objects appeared to be of metallic construction and according to the inspector were traveling at extremely high speed, approximately 2,000 ft. per sec.

The inspector further reported that the objects were approximately 20 to 25 degrees in altitude and traveled in an east to west direction for a distance of approximately 30 to 45 degrees of arc.

The objects were first observed at 11:13 hours and were under continuous observation for a time period of approximately 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.

I have had a fair amount of experience in observing aircraft, and this sighting was not at all similar to any conventional aircraft that I know of, including jet or rocket propelled devices. The objects seemed to be traveling at a fantastic rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft. They also appeared to change direction very rapidly, which is not characteristic of our present day aircraft. 

In conclusion it is my firm belief that the objects were not of this earth, but of some other origin. I am completely convinced that these were not any type of man-made device, but were of an unknown origin.
