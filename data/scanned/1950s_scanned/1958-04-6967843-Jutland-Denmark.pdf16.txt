4 Flyers Die
in Stratojet
Explosion

NORTH COLLINS, N.Y.
April 10 - (UP) - Four crew-
men perished today when an
B-47 Stratojet bomber ex-
ploded in flight while attempt-
ing to refuel over this western
New York community.
The sleek six-jet bomber from
Limestone, O., Air Force base
was just preparing to make a re-
fueling approach on a KC-97
propeller-driven tanker plane at
about three miles when blew apart
about one mile astern. The tanker
was not damaged. Its crew re-
ported seeing the wreckage
"hurtle earthward, but no para-
chutes.
Three bodies were found in one
large piece of wreckage, ap-
parently the front of the plane.
Luckily the automatics identified
the dead as Maj. Harold L. Kelly,
33, aircraft commander, Escuin-
de, Tex.; Lt. Col. John Robert Guyer,
33, pilot, Wilmington, Del.; First
Lt. Richard Feller, co-pilot,
Pompano Beach, Fla. and First
Lt. Albert Gene Mongold, 24,
Shreveport, La., the navigator.
Mongold's body was the last to
be found and identified.
Westover Air Force base in
Massachusetts reported the
Stratojet carried four men, with
one apparently an instructor. The
B-47 was flying a "normal train-
ing mission," Westover officials
said.
The big bomber was not armed
and did not carry any nuclear
bombs.
Hundreds of residents wit-
nessed the explosion and fire-
ball of the wreckage, which scat-
tered over a five-mile-wide area
of farmland about 20 miles south
of Buffalo.
