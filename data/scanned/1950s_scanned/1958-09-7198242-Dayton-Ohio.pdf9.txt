The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photographs. The text on the page appears to be handwritten observations and notes about a reported UFO sighting.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Called Capt. Mare Flight Service:
Lockheed - 188 (a big mission on) with many
in the rear, particularly to the south of the ship.
Capt. Mare said that description sounded like
"might be right". Motion could be that of an
orbital object.
Vended CAAB - Clear, 9 mi's. vie.
CAAB had no comments from anyone
traffic or tower, negatives - nothing
had been picked up on radar.
Past .OPS - Had 4 jet aircraft
tonight ops.- had picked up a list of track
lights. No comment from tower or ATC
U.S. WX. Had no contact.
We are clean, bright moon.
This happened approximately 0100Z to
0300Z - The visibility of sighting was quite critical as the
reports came. The reflection of sunlight on wing -
very suspicious in nature. Also very definite - confirmation of unusual night flying activity.
Need additional details.
