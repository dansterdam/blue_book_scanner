SUBJECTS: Request for Analysis, RADAR UFO

FROM: ATCH-4-21 
DATE: 30 Oct 58 COMMENT NR. 2

1. The first of these reported sightings seems to indicate the possibility of one or more balloons since the targets were more or less stationary except for a slight side to side motion. The radar guide could have picked up an object at slightly low altitude and then locked on another at a higher altitude which would have given the impression that a rapid ascent had occurred. Efforts to sight the target visually failed which would indicate either a small target such as a balloon or possibly a false target as discussed. The target was tracked on the SCR-584 radar which is considered to be accurate.

2. The second of these reported sightings seems to indicate a false target because of the erratic nature of the signal return and efforts to sight the target. False radar returns sometimes occur occasionally due mainly to atmospheric and weather phenomena, but sometimes due to spurious signals from various known sources of interference.
