AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The analysis by Captain Ruppelt was that the phenomena was an aircraft, probably some type of jet or experimental aircraft. The report indicates that the sighting was considered authentic and was investigated, but no firm conclusion could be drawn as to the exact nature of the object observed.

The report states that the object was sighted by the pilot and crew of an Air Force plane and that it could have been a meteor, weather balloon, or some other type of aerial object, but that it was not possible to determine its exact nature.
