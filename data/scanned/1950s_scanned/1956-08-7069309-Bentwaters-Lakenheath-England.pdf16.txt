VISUAL SIGHTINGS

The following is a report concerning the sighting of unidentified flying objects in the vicinity of Bentwaters and Lakenheath, England. The report is dated August 7, 1956.

The report states that on the night of August 13-14, 1956, at approximately 00:30 hours, an unidentified object was observed by the control tower personnel at the Royal Air Force Station, Bentwaters. The object was described as a bright light, moving rapidly through the sky. It was observed for approximately 15 minutes.

Simultaneously, at the Royal Air Force Station, Lakenheath, radar operators detected an unidentified target on their screens. The object was tracked for over an hour, moving at varying speeds up to 600-700 knots. Attempts were made to intercept the object with RAF fighters, but the fighters were unable to get a visual identification.

The report concludes that the visual sightings and radar trackings appear to be related and that the nature of the object or objects observed remains unidentified.
