An account of the investigation by Capt. Chas. Hardin, USAF, and J. A. Hynek, of the reported visual/radar sightings of Unidentified Objects at Bismarck, N. Dakota and Black Hawk, S. Dakota, on 5/6 August 1953.

We arrived in Bismark at about 19000Z, 12 January 1954, where Sgt. Wesley Harry of the Bismarck Filter Center met us. Within 20 minutes we were at the Filter Center and had been offered a cup of coffee. We first examined the original logs of the incident, and Sgt. Harry pointed out that the Filter Center was first alerted at 0515Z 5 August 1953, that an object was about 70 miles south of Dickinson, N. Dakota. At 0523Z another call came in stating that an object was 15 miles north of Rapid City. At 0538Z a call came in that an object was just south of Almont. At 0542Z, or 2342C, Sgt. Harry Sighted an object from the Filter Center roof. He had gone out on the roof to look toward the SW to see if he could see anything of the reported object.

Re: Fig. #1. Sgt. Harry's description of the object has been treated many times in the reports and so I asked him primarily about motions. Fortunately he had power lined near by and so as soon as the object appeared he checked his position on the roof by marking points around his shoes. The motion of the object was described as indicated on photos #1 and #2. He stated that this represents the mean motion of the object, but that in between it moved erratically up and down as much as one or two times the distance between the horizontal telephone wires. He insisted the motion was abrupt. Apparently it came in rather rapidly, but when it got west of the Filter Center it hovered, moving up and down.

Mrs. (redacted) spent most of her time watching this object and her evidence was essentially the same as that of Harry although she did not see it as soon.
