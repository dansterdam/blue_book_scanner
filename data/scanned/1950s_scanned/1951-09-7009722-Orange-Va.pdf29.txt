There does not appear to be any photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document.

UNCLASSIFIED
CONFIDENTIAL
1. The images on the negatives were caused by 11-18 striking unexposed film. The negatives were not retouched.
2. The individual lights in the "formation" varied in intensity.
3. The intensity was greater than any surrounding stars as the stars did not register. (The photos were taken under CAVE conditions.)
4. The individual lights changed position in the "formation".
5. Reinforcement of the photographer
6. The OSI was requested to interrogate the photographer in another attempt to gain more definitive information about the sightings. This attempt was unsuccessful, and the OSI stated that there were no indications that the photographs were not authentic.
7. Future Investigations
A new approach, however, will be made during January. Arrangements are being made to have a Project Grudge consultant and scientist visit the sighting area. If the photographs are authentic, they are important and warrant a thorough investigation in that:
1. They will give an accurate measurement of the angular span.
2. The light source, although it appeared to be of low intensity to the eye, was highly actinic.
3. The movement of the individual lights in the formation can be studied further.
4. Density comparison tests can be made.
