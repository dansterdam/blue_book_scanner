Transcribing the text:

Was made shortly after dark and very definitely CAR was calling police and we were over 2/3 called me and said " had you noticed when (they) lights was over there about 2:30 and 12 to 1:00 and 1:30 and 2:30 AM" It amazed me for it was fact it the lights where on the ground the pilot in close by and seemed to come up. The object was 28 to 30 feet in diameter, The pilot in the jet seemed to be distracted or watching, for he was flying in level flight and seem to stay at the same height. 

For brightness comparisons - a Neon sign would not show as bright. It was a little larger than a 50 gallon oil drum. It seemed to be some 1000 ft off the ground and on the bright side of a hill The pilot was westbound The object was white or silver on the top and the bottom seem to be about the same color. The pilot never did fire his jets.

From indications conversation afterwards it seems that one of the city police cars or an army vehicle stationed at the base some 15 miles east of Indiapolis were on the roads over the area at the time. The pilot did not seem very disturbed nor did he alter his course.
