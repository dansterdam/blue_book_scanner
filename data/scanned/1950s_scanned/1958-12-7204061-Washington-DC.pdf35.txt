Project Blue Book
Official Air Force Termination Report

FOREWORD

Project Blue Book was the code name for the United States Air Force's systematic study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969. This special report summarizes the findings of the project and presents the conclusions reached as a result of this effort.

The Air Force no longer investigates UFO sightings, nor maintains files on such phenomena. The responsibility for any future UFO investigations has been transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in conjunction with the Aerial Phenomena Office of the Environmental Research Laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce.

This report was prepared by the Directorate of Information, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, as a resum√© of Project Blue Book and its conclusions. While it reflects the official position of the United States Air Force, it does not necessarily reflect the views of the Department of Defense or the United States Government.
