1. Two objects were sighted emanating a bright blue-white light equal in intensity to a first magnitude star but only one-half of apparent diameter of same. The light varied in intensity but not at equal intervals as do the running lights of conventional aircraft. The two objects were maintaining the same altitude and course to the South. The objects were too far apart to be connected and they maintained the same distance from each other until shortly before the contact was lost when the rear-most object appeared to swerve to the West. The apparent speed was slow and shortly before contact was lost moderate atmospheric interference causing the lights to seem to waver was encountered.

2. These objects were first sighted at 11:55 P.M. Central Daylight-Saving Time on 23 July 1952 and were observed for approximately nine minutes.

3. These objects were followed by the naked eye for approximately five minutes. A pair of 6 x 35 binoculars were then obtained and the observation continued for the remaining four minutes.
