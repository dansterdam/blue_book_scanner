"in a book with it it seemed not long ago and when i found it i had to answer a few days ago that i first started writing to people in this town and i remember this thing as on the cover of the book the thing this is the latest bulletin received no. 11. and on the margin Canterburg. This latest sighting reported by residents was ??? in Canterbury on Sept. 23rd 1949 when about 10 observers watched an object in the sky from 7:15 to 7:25 p.m. at first they thought it was an aircraft but as it approached closer it was seen to be a bright orange-yellow color with a zig-zag motion. The object moved quickly west then suddenly changed direction and headed east. It remained in sight for about 10 minutes and gave the impression of a controlled flight. I would not want my name released as I fear some trouble may develop from a few local people who are very skeptical about everything and do not really know what they are talking about."
