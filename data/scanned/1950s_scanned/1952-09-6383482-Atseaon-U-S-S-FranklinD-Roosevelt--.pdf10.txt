Stating what it was that we saw, but that he saw it too, at the same time as I was photographing it.

As I said during our telephone conversation today, I would appreciate a quick return of these transparencies and any other information in willing to make about these pictures for publication.

We will look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

Editor
