"5 January 1961

Dear Mr. Chapman:

This is to acknowledge your request of 31 December 1960 for a copy of the initial progress report on the UFO Bridge project. 

I regret that we do not have copies of this script for distribution. However, we do have a file copy on hand and your request to receive this office for read or copy it in whole or in part.

In addition, I am including the latest Department of Defense Fact Sheet on the general subject of UFOs. This clearly states the position of the Air Force and the Department of Defense.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt. Colonel, USAF
