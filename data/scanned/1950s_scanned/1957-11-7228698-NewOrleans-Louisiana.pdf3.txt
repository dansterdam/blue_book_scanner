The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project Blue Book record card from November 1957, describing an observation of an oval-shaped object in the sky near New Orleans, Louisiana. The object was several times larger than a conventional aircraft, moving at high speed with no sound. The conclusions section indicates that the object was probably a meteor sighting and over and not a conventional aircraft.
