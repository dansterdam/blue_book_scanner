The image does not contain any photographs, but rather an "UFOB INDEX CARD" that describes a sighting of a single object in Santa Margarita, California on June 5, 1955. The card includes details such as the date, location, type of observation, number of objects, and a brief description of the sighting.

Now, I will transcribe the text from the document:

8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS

Stationary  
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING  
Two reports arrived from approximately the same place (1.5 miles apart) and at the same time. The ground observer outside Camp San Luis Obispo said they took place at almost the same time. By coincidence or the two we see they are possibly the same sighting. Due to the fact that many brilliant objects are reported in these sightings, these sighting could fulfill the description of a Balloon. Possibly Balloon.
