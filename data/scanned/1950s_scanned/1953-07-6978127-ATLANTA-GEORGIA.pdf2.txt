THE INVASION CONTINUES
Sherman, Texas photo:
Large, unidentified flying object, sighted over Sherman, Texas. The UFO appeared as a "submarine-shaped" object, silvery grey in color, and measuring an estimated 60 to 80 feet in length. It was observed to be flying at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet over Denton, Texas, on April 3, 1953.
Early in the Spring of 1953:
Two young men and two young women, driving alone on a country road near Atlanta, Georgia, reportedly saw an unidentified flying object which passed very close to their car. The UFO hovered for several minutes before speeding away. The incident was reported to local authorities.
Tuesday night in Oklahoma City:
The control tower at Will Rogers Airport received several calls from citizens reporting "strange flying objects." It was later confirmed that no such objects were detected on radar. However, sightings were reported from other parts of the state.
The flag of sightings were reported over a three-night period over the same area. We have been in situations before where sightings occurred over the same area for several consecutive nights, indicating that something is there. The question now is, what are they and where do they come from.
