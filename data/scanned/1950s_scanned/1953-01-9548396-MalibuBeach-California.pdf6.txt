SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 29 â€” Reports by several persons, including a commercial pilot, of disk-shaped objects streaking over Southern California skies were under investigation today by Air Force, Marine Corps and CAA officials.
Four such objects were reported flying in a tight formation over the city at various times today. A pilot of a Northrop Aircraft Co. plane said he chased a fiery object for several minutes, but was unable to overtake it. At the same time, control tower operators at Long Beach Municipal Airport reported seeing what they said was a "large, brilliant flame" in the sky.
The two airmen and a photographer at Long Beach said they watched the objects for about five minutes until they disappeared. Photographer Jim Wilkinson did try to photograph them, but was unable to do so.
The Marine pilot failed to identify the object, but he said it had been clear for some 25 miles when he chased it. Lake Elsinore, 120 miles southeast of Los Angeles, discussed the possibility that it was a star re-entry, but astronomers said that was unlikely.
The tower controller at Long Beach reported hearing a rumbling, like coming from a jet, some distance away.
