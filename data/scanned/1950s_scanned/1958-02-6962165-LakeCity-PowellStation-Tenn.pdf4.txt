CHAPTER I
PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM OPTICAL TRACKING
OF U. S. EARTH SATELLITES
by
J. Allan Hynek* and Fred L. Whipple**

In the satellite program of the International Geophysical Year, the optical satellite tracking program of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has played a role of major importance. The principal tasks include the visual acquisition of the artificial earth satellites, the computation of search ephemerides and predictions, the operation of a world-wide network of optical tracking cameras, the reception and analysis of incoming data, and last but not least, the dissemination of the results to the scientific community.

Remembering that since October 4, 1957, there has been a total of which objects have been launched into satellite orbits, we hardly need to point out that the efforts expended by thousands of persons, including the volunteer Moonwatch team members, in the Optical Tracking Program alone are outstanding. With great satisfaction, our staff members have participated in this undertaking, our staff members have participated in this under-taking, and we have been proud to play a normal call of duty.

The cooperation of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in furnishing us with critical prediction data for satellites has been exceptional. This has been of major importance. Also, the computation of ephemerides and orbital data would have been virtually impossible without the cooperation of the Computations Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.
