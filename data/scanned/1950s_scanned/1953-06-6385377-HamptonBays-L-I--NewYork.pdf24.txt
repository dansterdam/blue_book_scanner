From 10:00 to 10:15 P.M. I saw one of these small torpedo like craft. Around the front side of this craft's darkened mass near the front, there appeared to be a small opening. This craft hovered about fifteen minutes, then the small craft dived around the front of the house.

For about it's last fifteen minutes, then the small craft dived around the front of the house.

Subject: T.V. set. There was a Curious Distortion of Stations including:

Tonight between 6:00 P.M. until 7:30 P.M. on my T.V. set, on all the stations here, i.e. Channels 2-4-5-6.

There was also an overlay in 2 stations as specially on Channel 5 in New York City, then it would fade out and in would come Philadelphia Channel 3 on Channel 2. 

This distortion and overlapping and horizontal bar reception kept up for an hour and a half, when just as suddenly as it had started, it disappeared and ever so occurred.
