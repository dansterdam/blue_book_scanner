PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 3 July 55
2. LOCATION: Augusta, Maine
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: No
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: approx one minute
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: One spherical object with a greenish hue and a red light to ten miles long. Trail was also green and appeared to gyrate and move rapidly. Occasionally the ground-radar seemed to lose it for a moment. A humming sound was noted.
11. COMMENTS: Although the duration of sighting was very long for the object to have been a meteor, it is known that the object was probably a meteor. It is known that the trail of a meteor is a good radar reflector and the description of the object fits that category.
