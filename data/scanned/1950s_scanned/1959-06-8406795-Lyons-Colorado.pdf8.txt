Dear Sir:

A flying object was observed near Longmont, Colorado, by several people. Some of the people were able to get a good look at the object and claim that it was a metallic disc-shaped object that hovered for a few minutes and then accelerated and disappeared at a tremendous speed.

The report states that the object was about 20-25 feet in diameter and that it had a flaming exhaust or trail behind it as it accelerated away. The witnesses felt that the object was under intelligent control and that it was not a conventional aircraft or any known type of vehicle.

The report also mentions that some of the witnesses were afraid to come forward and talk about what they had seen, as they were concerned about ridicule or being thought of as "crackpots." However, the report indicates that the witnesses were reliable and credible, and that their accounts should be taken seriously.

The report concludes by stating that the sighting was a genuine unidentified flying object and that further investigation may be warranted.
