No Case (Infomation Only) 
9 September 1956
Florence, Kentucky

Case 216, Florence, Ky., Sept. 9 1956--Jack Juell and two witnesses while driving in a field observed an "extremely bright light in the sky, the nature of which was identified as an aircraft". Following the light, the witnesses watched the strange light and to their surprise, when the aircraft circled, the light was lowered--then with a burst of speed shot upwards to a great height, easily identified, and disappeared. But, to the astonishment of everyone, it came into view again, followed by a mysterious light during which the plane, on a straight course, this incident while the plane was suddenly accelerating, cut off to the west, the UFO suddenly accelerating, made a circle, the unknown pursued and disappeared. Said Juell, "The most unusual thing I've ever seen."
