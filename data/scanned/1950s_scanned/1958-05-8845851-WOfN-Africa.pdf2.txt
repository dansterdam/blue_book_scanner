THE HOLLY RIVER SAUCER
HANK MOLLOHAN: We couldn't tell too much what color it was, as there in the road. 
BARKER: What was his name again? I want to get in touch with
him.
HANK MOLLOHAN: I really don't know. He was a man called Rodney Bolsmap, a trooper Coole. 
BARKER: I had heard reports from other people who had talked with you that you had seen two little men about three feet tall.
HANK MOLLOHAN: There was another man with him who called him Rodney Bolsmap.
BARKER: I talked with him last night. I asked him, "What do you think of these people?" And he said, yes, he was aware that it seemed to become just standing up something. And he said that you acted rather frightened. Were you? 
HANK MOLLOHAN: No, we wasn't exactly frightened. We wanted to get up on top of the mountain with them that night, and we told them we wouldn't go. It would be the next day, but it wouldn't go after that night.
BARKER: Did you feel it might be dangerous to go up there?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Why, yeah, we didn't know exactly what we'd run into.
BARKER: This was it after dark when you seen the object?
HANK MOLLOHAN: Oh yes, I suspect it was 7:00 o'clock when we left.
H. G. MOLLOHAN: Yeah, later than that. 
HANK MOLLOHAN: It was about 10:00 or 10:30 when the police got here.
BARKER: Now after it was dark, did you see any lights?
HANK MOLLOHAN: We thought we saw one light. We weren't able to tell much about it.
H. G. MOLLOHAN: Now, let me get a word in here. There were three of them fellows up there that had lights. Wasn't there?
