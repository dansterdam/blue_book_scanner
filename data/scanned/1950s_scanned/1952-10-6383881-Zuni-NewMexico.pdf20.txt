Washington
10 November

Dear [REDACTED],

The inclosed report of an unidentified object has been presented to me with an unusual degree of fervor by the author. He states that up until the time he saw the damned thing he was an unalloyed sceptic, but that now he is a thorough-going convert.

His qualifications for unbiased observation are considerably higher than most people's. He further makes the point that he had co-observers with qualifications and prior attitudes similar to his.

Sincerely
[REDACTED]
