A check was made with the Army and Navy for any helicopters. H-37's are stationed in San Francisco area. These aircraft fit the description given by the witness. They have an engine on each side of the fuselage driving one large rotor.

The conclusion of this Center is that the H-37's flying in the area as described is probably the object seen in production for a specific training mission at a nearby location.
