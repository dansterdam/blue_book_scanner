Pilot Sends Plane into Steep Climb Over Atlanta—No Damage
SAN JUAN, P.R. March 6—(AP)—An American Airlines Constellation jet airliner was forced into a steep climb over Atlanta, Ga., Tuesday night to avoid a flaming object, according to the pilot's report.
Captain Matthew E. Van Winkle, Philadelphia, said the object appeared about 25 miles ahead and 1,000 feet below the airliner, which was flying at 17,000 feet on a run from New York to Miami.
He said the object seemed to be stationary, emitting a blue-white flame. Van Winkle said he threw the plane into a steep climbing turn to the right to avoid the object.
Passengers were reported to have been shaken up by the sudden maneuver, but no one was injured. The airliner landed safely in Miami.
