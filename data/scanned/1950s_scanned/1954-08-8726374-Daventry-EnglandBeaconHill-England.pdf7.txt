REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN-H2X    1 AUG 1960

SUBJECT: UFO Information (James Haney)

TO: SAFOI-3d (L/Col Tacker)

1. The following is in reference to numbered paragraphs of letter, copy attached.

a. Reference paragraph one, this Center has no record of UFO's sighted over Oklahoma City during August 1954.

b. Reference paragraph three, this Center has not received the film listed as "Motion Picture" over to the Air Force.

c. Reference paragraph six, ATIC has no information to the effect that ADC has filed an administrative firing defect. ATIC has no information concerning an ADC order which forbids firing on anything which gives indication of being a friendly aircraft. It should be noted that Air Force records, from the time that ADC's piloted gunnery training programs were in existence, clearly show that the interpretation of these instructions as absolutes are, of course, at a higher rate during wars or other periods when combat is imminent.

d. Reference paragraph seven, a limited amount of information concerning the U.S. Air Force and friendly foreign nations' policies on the control of UFU reports that are made in the United States each year.

PHILIP G. EVANS
