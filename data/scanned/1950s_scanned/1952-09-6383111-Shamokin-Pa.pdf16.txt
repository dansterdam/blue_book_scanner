On the morning of 6 September 1952, a meteorologist was taking weather observations in Durban, Union of South Africa, when he saw a white object moving smoothly across his field of vision. After two more had appeared and passed in the same manner, he called a coworker, with whom he observed three more saucers. He was able to follow one of them with a theodolite, which indicated that the object was at a high altitude. It had about the same shape as a weather balloon which was then at an altitude of only 3,500 meters. The spherical objects appeared to be at an altitude above 6,500 meters.

Both men have been meteorologists for some time (the second man is the director of the weather bureau at Natal). Their information was written into the records of the local meteorological office.
