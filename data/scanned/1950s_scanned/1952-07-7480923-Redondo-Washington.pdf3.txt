The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with handwritten text on the page.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details or the object that you saw, and places on sketch beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this? (Circle One): Yes No. Then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other ones?

26.l Have seen them before, but only one at a time, usually a clear night sky, from a car while driving. Can't recall exact dates, but they have been seen over several years during 1940's and early 1950's.

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?

The object appeared to be round or oval in shape, bright in color and moving rapidly across the sky. It did not appear to have wings or a tail, and produced no sound that could be heard from the ground. My best estimate is that it was probably a type of jet aircraft, possibly some new experimental craft that was classified at the time.
