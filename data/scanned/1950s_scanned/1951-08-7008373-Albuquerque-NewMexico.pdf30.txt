Appendix II

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 3 AUGUST 1951

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On the evening of 3 August 1951, at 2:15 PM, a civilian base security guard on his wife observed that they described a strange aircraft over the backyard of their residence. The aircraft was described as being disk-shaped. It hovered above the vicinity for about one and one half times the time of a B-36, with which they were familiar. The object was silvery in color, approximately 100 ft. - 1000 ft. in diameter, and there was no sound that could be attributed to the aircraft. All lights were extinguished, and the object disappeared from sight as suddenly as it had appeared.

(See Appendix I for possible related incident.)

II. WEATHER

Broken clouds at 17,000 ft. Visibility five miles, wind S at 5 mph.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

The possibility of this being a known aircraft was checked with negative results. This aircraft has not shown up on any monitoring or unidentified aircraft.

The observer's background was checked and since he has a "Q" clearance, it has been established that he is reliable.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had seen the object, but no other report relative to this sighting could be located.

The photographs referred to in Appendix I were sent to the OSI at Kirkland Air Force Base. These photos were shown to the observer and they advised that the photos submitted by the observer, as shown in the Appendix, are the same as those taken by the observer.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

None. The investigation will be continued until the authenticity of the photographs and the observer can be determined.
