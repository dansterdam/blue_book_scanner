29 April 1957
White Plains, N.Y.

April 29, 1957: At 9:55 p.m. CSI member Bill  and his wife were watching Arend-Roland from the roof of their apartment house in White Plains, New York, when they saw a flight of lights sweep across the sky, which was very clear. From the southwest, four objects about 30 degrees above the horizon, in ‘V’ formation, streaked across the sky and disappeared into the northeastern part of the night sky. The objects were very light luminous blue, and their apparent size was about that of a pinhead at arm's length. Their apparent elevation remained about the same (30 degrees); however, there was a slight downward slant (about 5 degrees) from the horizontal plane, toward the northeast. They were in view for approximately two and a half seconds; they did not appear to change their shape, color, or brightness. "I’ve watched the sky through the telescope and with the naked eye for some time and I can say I have never seen anything as odd or as strange as these four objects. In fact it gives one a kind of feeling one does not soon forget." Mr. drew the flight path of the objects on a star map; it passes between Polaris and the Comet Arend-Roland.
