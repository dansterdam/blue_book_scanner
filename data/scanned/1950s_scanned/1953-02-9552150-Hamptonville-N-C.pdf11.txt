The image does not contain any photographs. It consists of two sketches or illustrations. 

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object depicted above it. The instructions indicate that the observer is asked to imagine the object's position relative to the horizon when they first saw it and when they last saw it.

The second sketch shows two larger illustrations. The left one depicts a person standing on a road with trees and buildings in the background. The right one shows a person standing on a road against a landscape with hills in the background.

Transcription of the text:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
