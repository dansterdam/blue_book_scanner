STAFF SERGEANT PERRIS BEAT BAILEY TO THE WAIST BLISTER. OPEN-MOUTHED, HE SAID "THE INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTROL THIS LIGHT -SHOOTING SHIP COST OVER $70,000...SIXTY MILES IN THE COCKPIT. EARHOLES EVER WERE GLUED TO THE AUXILIARY SCOPE" FORTY 61.  MILES SUDDENLY THE OBJECTS SWEVE, HEADING STRAIGHT FOR THE D-29 HARTER, BUT BEFORE ONE COULD MOVE THE CONTROLS, AN INCREDIBLE THING HAPPENED. 64. OBVIOUSLY CRUSHED UNDERNEATH THE OBJECT WERE HUNDREDS FOR SECONDS. THEN - SWIFTLY PICKING UP SPEED, THE UNKNOWN OBJECTS PULLED OFF TO ONE SIDE. THE SAME - AMAZING- HARTER SUDDENLY SPLIT OUT OF SIGHT. HIS HALF-INCH SPOT SCALES ACROSS, STOPPED SLOWLY, HIS AFTER-IMAGE A CONFUSED BLUR ABOVE THE SCOPE. 69. THEN STILL MOVING, IT MERGED WITH THE OBJECTS" MASSIVE FORM ALL AROUND IT.71. FAST THAT HARTER SUDDENLY TURNED IT FLASHED ACROSS WILLIS' SCOPE AND WAS GONE. CAPTAIN: DID YOU SEE THAT?76. WE CLOCKED IT AT SAID COLEMAND - YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS - IT WAS MAKING OVER 8,000 MILES ALL HOUR!78. WHAT'S JUST WHAT I FIGURED. THE REST OF THE WAY HE KEPT THE CREW ON ALERT, BUT NO MORE UFO'S APPEARED. 81. CAPTAIN HARTER HAD RADIOED AHEAD, AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS WERE WAITING_. 84. NOTHING WOULD CHANGE THEIR STORY - AND STATEMENTS IN THE REPORT SHOWED THEIR FIRM CONVICTION. 85. A MAIN GROUP OF CLIPS WAS NOTED AFTER THE SET WAS CALIBRATED TO ARC DISTANCE FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN SECONDS, A CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT RAN FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS.89. LIEUTENANT COLEMAN SAID IT AS BEST'HE COULD, "WITH A STOP-WATCH OVER A KNOWN STAR RATE, I TIMED IT AT MACH 12 - BY DAMN IT WAS TRAVELING AT 12,240 M.P.H!" 95. THE ENTIRE CREW TO LOOK FOR THE OBJECTS VISUALLY AND FLASHES OF LIGHT WERE NOTED. THE OBJECTS COULD BE SEEN FOR MILES, BUT WHEN OBSERVED UP CLOSE, THEY DISAPPEARED AS SUDDENLY AS THEY HAD APPEARED. 97. 20 OBJECTS IN ALL ARE RECALIBRATED THE SET AND THESE SAME TYPES WERE NOT NOTED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE VERY LARGE ONE. LASERSIZED AS OVER 45 FEET IN DIAMETER, CAME UP TO WITHIN 4 TO MILES OF OUR TAIL, SOME UP TO WITHIN 40 MILES OF THE CRAFT, PASSING VERY CLOSE, DISPLAYING SMALL LIGHTS AND MOVED AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED AND WAS NOT A SOLID. FUNCTION OR OPTICAL. 98. COAST GUARD REPORTED A MASSIVE FORMATION CLOSER THAN THE FIRST ONE SEEN (THAT AT ONE TIME JUST SEEMED HUGE DURATIONS' - THE FAD OPERATOR REPORTED AIR SPEEDS OF THE OBJECT TO AVERAGE 5,240 M.P.H. 97. AT 0-C-LOCK-UPON LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW, I SAW A BLUE-WHITE STREAK TRAVEL PAST TO REACH. 98. STAFF SERGEANT GREAT PIECES OF WHATEVER IT WAS DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WINGS. I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED IN THAT POSITION AND SAW TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS APPEAR, DISAPPEAR, AND REAPPEAR.112.
