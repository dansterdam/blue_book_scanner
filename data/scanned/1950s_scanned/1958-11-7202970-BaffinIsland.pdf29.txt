TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

AUGUST 14, 1959

1. In answer to a request by Dr. Olivi'er, the following information is submitted:

a. 29 April 1959, 2219 hrs - Two observers at 9000 feet altitude, located at 65 degrees 5C'N and 85 degrees 12'W degrees (over Baffin Island). They observed a bright white light, trailing a fiery tail, apparently moving at a very high speed from northwest to southeast. The light came to within about 30 miles of the observers, then slowed and appeared to hover for two seconds. It then accelerated and disappeared in a descending curve.

b. 5 July 1959, 0102 hrs - At 71 degrees 30'N and 74 degrees 25'W (over the Davis Strait), two observers in an aircraft chserved an object which was visible for approximately 15 minutes. It appeared as a bright, steady white light, and was observed to make a slight change in direction, increase in speed, and gain altitude. The object then appeared to split into two parts, one of which continued on the same course, and the other part reversed direction and disappeared.

c. 14 December 1959. No location given. Two observers reported seeing a brilliant bluish-white object in the sky, which appeared to increase in size and luminosity as it approached, and then diminished in size and luminosity as it moved away toward the southwest. Duration of sighting was reported.

d. 1 December 1959. No location given. Two observers reported seeing a bright light which appeared to maneuver and then disappear. No further details were provided.
