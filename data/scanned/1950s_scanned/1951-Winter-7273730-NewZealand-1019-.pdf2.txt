The image contains three black and white photographs that appear to be landscape scenes. The photographs show silhouettes of trees and foliage against a body of water and the sky. There seems to be a reflection of the landscape visible in the water in the bottom two photographs.

REPORT NO. 7273730 OF 24 JANUARY 1951

On the evening of 14 December, 1950, the observer, Mr. [redacted], a member of the staff at the [redacted] Observatory, Te Awamutu, was driving a car near Waitomo, New Zealand, when he and his companion saw an unusual luminous phenomenon in the sky.

Mr. [redacted] states that at about 8.30 p.m. on the evening of 14 December, he and his companion were travelling home from Te Awamutu to their home in Hamilton, New Zealand, and when they were about 10 miles north-west of Te Awamutu they saw a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving rapidly southwards. At first it appeared to be a star, but it soon became obvious that it was a self-luminous object of considerable size.

The object was visible for approximately one minute and during this time appeared to change direction and altitude. When first seen it was at an altitude of about 30 degrees above the horizon and when it disappeared from view it was at an angle of about 15 degrees above the horizon.
