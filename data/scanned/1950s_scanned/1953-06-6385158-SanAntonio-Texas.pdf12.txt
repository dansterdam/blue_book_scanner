STATEMENT

At approximately 10:20 PM on 2 June 1953, I was out in the back yard hanging clothes on the line. At the time I was facing southeast. When placing a pin in the clothes, I happened to look up and saw a streak of light. At first I believed it to be a so called, falling star, but the unidentified object was continuing to move at what seemed to be an extremely high altitude and also another similar object was following behind it at some distance. I could hear no sound from the objects and they seemed to be going at a terrific speed. Immediately I called my husband and we went to the front yard. I showed him the direction they were going and he picked up into view the same thing I did.

As for the description of the objects and other pertinent information, I agree substantially with the facts stated by my husband.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:
