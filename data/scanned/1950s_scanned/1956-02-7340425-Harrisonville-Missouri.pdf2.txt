"At 2045 hours, Mrs. ______ Harrisonville, Mo. (telephone called to report what she thought was an object in the sky that resembled a â€œflying saucer over Harrisonville, Mo. All times that she remembers. The first occurrence was 3 week ago; the next time was last Friday, 10 Feb 56; and again tonight, 13 Feb 56. The first time she saw the object she thought it was not very important and immaterial but after seeing this object 2 other times, she thought she'd notify someone. She stated that the strange-looking object resembled a flying saucer that was very bright and moving slowly. The first time she saw this object it came from the east and then disappeared to the north. Tonight she said the object made a circle pattern over Harrisonville, Mo., and then disappeared to the east. She said that the object was brighter than any star in the sky and when it disappeared, it did not fall out of sight like a star."
