Venus--So Bright--Causing Quit a Stir

"THE HERALD SAYS: THIS PAGE FROM THE "BLUE BOOK" SHOWS A REPORT ON WHEN VENUS WAS MISTAKEN FOR A UFO. IT WAS VISIBLE AROUND 7:30 P.M. LAST NIGHT AND CAUSED QUITE A STIR AS PEOPLE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A UFO. OFFICIALS FROM HEADQUARTERS AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON WERE CALLED IN TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT. THEY DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MERELY VENUS AND CALMED THE EXCITEMENT."
