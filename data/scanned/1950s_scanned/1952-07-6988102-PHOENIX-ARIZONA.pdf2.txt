The object I saw was white & shiny on the underside - something which I had never seen before. It was 
wide enough for any person with average eyesight to see.

There were two settings made for the second 
one I will refer you to Mrs. [Redacted] of Tucson, 830.

One thing must be understood. The dull, orange lights 
on the object were the only distinctive things about the object.
