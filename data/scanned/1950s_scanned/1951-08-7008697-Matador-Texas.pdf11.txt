MATADOR, TEXAS - 22 August 1951

On 22 August 1951 at approximately 1:45 CST two ladies were driving in an automobile south of Matador, Texas. The object was described as a pear-shaped object, similar to an ellipse or ellipter in color, which refracted sunlight on some type of surface. It moved through the air at a very high speed, they judged faster than a jet plane. It made a sizzling or buzzing sound as it passed through the air. It maintained its course for about 30 seconds, then disappeared. There was a firm of any exhaust.

As the two ladies were driving north from Matador, Texas, the driver of the automobile first noticed the object. It appeared and disappeared within about 10 seconds. The object flew roughly in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of more than 1,000 mph. It was oval in shape and larger than the 5-seat required for the car. It was gray in color with no visible means of propulsion. In less than 10 seconds it moved out of sight to the west.

Status of Investigation
It has been reported that a road repair crew saw the same object later on the same day. Attempts will be made to contact members of this road crew and obtain their statements. There may also reports of crow hunting activity in the area, but if so, these would only account for a small portion of the incidents could have seen this activity.
