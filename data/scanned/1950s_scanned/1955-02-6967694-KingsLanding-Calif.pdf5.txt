I have been sitting up all night - can't get a wink of sleep. My nerves are absolutely ragged to pieces. I was Soooooooo excited about the sighting I had last night about 10:30 in my back yard. I was reading the paper and suddenly looked up and my God I There in the sky was a huge bright light that seemed to change in shape and color and dart all over the place - it just seemed to defy all the laws of gravity. I have never been so excited in my life. I have called the police and they have been out but say they can't do anything. I have called the newspaper and they have been out but can't find any trace of it. I am more than just a little jittery over this. What, I was greatly impressed to see a huge ship or whatever it was hovering in the sky, changing shape and color and darting all over the place. It surely did not seem to be of this earth.
