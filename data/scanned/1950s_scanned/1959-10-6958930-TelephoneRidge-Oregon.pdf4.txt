SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI PB (Mrs. ...)

1. A letter from Mr. ..., Newport, Oregon, to Capt Hector Quintanilla contained a report of an observation in October 1959. Mr. ... requested an evaluation of his observation. Mr. ... sighting was an object he related to any conventional air vehicle. The brightness and clearness of the object and the locale of the sighting tend to rule out mirrages and reflections. From the information presented, we are unable to identify or evaluate his observation.
