NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
DESCENT DELAYED
Sun's Rays Send Balloon Upward
CROSBY, Minn., Aug. 20 - (/P) - Warmth from the sun's rays today temporarily delayed a descent planned to start at 5:00 a.m., the Crosby Sentinel reported. The balloon had been scheduled to come down a bit earlier this morning, but the rays caused it to rise again. New calculations were being made today to resume the descent later, the newspaper said.
AF YORK, Pa., Aug. 20 - (UP) - A balloonist was brought down safely after a trip into space, it was reported today.
The unidentified man took off in a balloon from an iron mine pit near Allendale, Pa., this morning and was observed at heights variously estimated from 12,000 to 20,000 feet. After the balloon had reached its peak, it began to descend and the man was brought down safely in a field.
Dr. David G. Simons, who observed the launching, said the flight was "excellent except for the landing." He said the balloon rose rapidly, apparently reaching an altitude of more than 15 miles.
Col. John F. Stapp, a rocket sled pilot, said he witnessed an "excellent balloon flight" and was "astounded at the rapidity of the ascent and the height attained."
The man was immediately picked up by Dr. Simons after the landing, in a field near Allendale. No injuries were reported.
"Back into another world," the unidentified balloonist remarked as he emerged from the balloon.
The balloon is reported to have ascended vertically at a speed of about 1,000 feet per minute. It was observed at various heights by witnesses on the ground before the ascent was terminated and the descent was made.
Indications were the last stage of the flight occurred around 4 or 5 o'clock this morning.
