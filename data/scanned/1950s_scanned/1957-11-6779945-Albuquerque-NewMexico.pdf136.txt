The shared image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a routing slip or form used for processing reports.

The text in the document is as follows:

E-30 ROUTING SLIP
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: OSAF
REMARKS: The Air Force (ATIC) received no report on this sighting. This is a routing slip only. It indicates that reports and similar unusual air craft sightings were received but, according to the information, there was nothing unusual for that day and the sighting probably got no further than a routing slip.
