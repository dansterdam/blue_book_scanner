Transcription of the text in the document:

21 October 1958

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 29 September 1958 concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object on 28 September 1958 near Frederick, Maryland.

We have received a number of letters concerning this same sighting and the local newspaper carried considerable publicity regarding it from Frederick, Pennsylvania. An Air Force fact concerning this sighting is that the Air Materiel Command has conducted a thorough investigation and has forwarded all facts concerning this sighting to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for analysis, which results indicate that this sighting remains unidentified.

Again, thank you for your interest in this matter. Your letter will be included in the case file of this sighting at the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

For your information, I am enclosing Department of Defense fact sheets on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
