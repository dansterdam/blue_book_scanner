ATIC ACTION: T/Sgt Drepperd, who interviewed Mr. , told him that from
all indications the object he saw was the same one or one similar observed over
Louisville, Ken., a few days earlier. Also, preliminary investigation suggested
that the object was probably an experimental balloon released by the General
Mills Corporation in Minneapolis, Minn. Sgt. Drepperd informed Mr. Green that
when positive identification is made of the object, that he, Mr. Green. will be
notified per his personal request.

The identity of the ADC Unit in Knoxville was established as the 460th FIS
of McGHEE-Tyson Airport. If there were jet a/c in the air near the object, as
stated by Mr. Green, they were more likely assigned to this unit. A wire of
inquiry dated 18 Nov 54 was forwarded to the Intelligence Officer of this unit
relative to the sighting.
Refer to Attachment 03.

6 Nov 54: On this date, 3 civilians observed a UFO over the vicinity of
Brandenburg, Kentucky. 1st Lt. Athens, FIt 3-3, 4602nd AISS interrogated the observers on 11 Nov 54.
Refer to Attachment #4.
ATIC EVALUATION: Preliminary investigation suggests objects observed in all of
the cases above to be balloons. Quite possibly it was the same experimental
balloon released by the General Mills Corporation. General Mills is presently
under contract with the Air Force and Navy for experimentation research program
of the upper atmosphere.
