Contractual period - 1 April 1950 to 12 September 1950. Some photographic activity occurred on 27 April and 28 April 1950, but simultaneous sightings by both cameras were not made, so that no information was gained. On 30 August 1950, during a Bell aircraft missile launching, several phenomena were observed over Holloman Air Force Base by several individuals; however, neither Land-Air nor Project personnel were notified and, therefore, no results were recorded. On 13 August 1950, the phenomena were again observed after a V-2 launching. Although this film was expended, proper triangulation was not effected, so that again no information was obtained. On 13 September 1950, arrangements were made by Holloman APB for Major Gover, Commander 93rd Fighter Squadron at Kirtland APB, to be on call so that aerial objects might be pursued. This would make possible more intimate visual observation and photography at close range. Major Gover was not authorized to shoot at the phenomena. Generally, the results of the six-month contractual period may be described as negative. Although the photographic theodolites functioned continuously, the grating cameras functioned very little, since the military personnel assigned to operate them had been withdrawn due to the needs concerned with the Korean situation.
