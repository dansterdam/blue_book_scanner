We served as aircraft spotters and during the last war were called back when the post was active. We served again for a short period for any emergency as we are familiar with the observation tower.

The first particular incident we noticed when on observation was a slight haze or vapor drift over the mountain north of Sacramento. This haze or vapor seemed to increase in density and come our way, and then suddenly vanished leaving no trace. This happened time and time again, and the mountains over which it appeared changed in their outline as if an actual object were moving. We watched and report this incident time and time again to the military authorities as it seemed puzzling and of unusual occurrence not accounted for by any known phenomena. We attempted to watch carefully and get all information possible.

We should add that it was not only we who noticed this unusual activity but others did also, and many inquiries were made to us by people who had observed similar happenings, but none seemed able to give a satisfactory explanation.

We described the event as much as we could, but feel that the authorities perhaps did not give it the importance we felt it deserved. We hoped that reporting it might lead to some explanation or investigation, but nothing further seems to have been done.
