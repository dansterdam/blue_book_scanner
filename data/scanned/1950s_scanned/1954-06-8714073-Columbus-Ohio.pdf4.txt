"Before I left the source, I explained to him the sensitive nature of this situation as far as the Air Force and the press were concerned. He stated that he was called earlier in the day by a reporter and had given him an account of the sighting." 
"The source stated he did not initiate release of the incident to the press and that he did not have any idea of whom informed them first. In fact, the source was quite angry upon learning of the initial leak to the press."
"I completed my interrogation of the source at approximately 1335 hours and returned to ATIC."
