27TH FIGHTER ESCORT WING
 APO 942
1.  AT APPROSIMATELY 21201 (7:30 PM) ON 9 DECEMBER 1952 A DISC-SHAPED FLYING OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY SGT. L.M. CHASE OF THE 27TH FIGHTER ESCORT WING NEAR HAKODATE AIRFORCE BASE, HOKKAIDO ISLAND, JAPAN. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 60 FEET IN DIAMETER AND WAS ILLUMINATED BY AN INTENSE 
BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT.  IT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME IT MANEUVERED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, MAKING ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND ALTITUDE, AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
2.  MATERIAL IN QUESTION:  THE REPORT INDICATED THAT Sgt CHASE WHO OBSERVED THIS PHENOMENON NOTED IT HAD A METALLIC SURFACE WHICH REFLECTED THE LIGHT SIMILAR TO THAT OF ALUMINUM. NO OTHER SOLID OBJECTS WERE VISIBLE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION.  HE STATED IT APPEARED TO BE COMPLETELY SILENT IN OPERATION AND GAVE NO INDICATION OF ANY FORM OF PROPULSION SYSTEM. THE OBJECT DID GIVE OFF A VERY BRIGHT BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINATED THE AREA AROUND IT. HE STATED THAT SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO ALERT OTHER PERSONNEL TO THE PRESENCE OF THE OBJECT BUT IT HAD DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE IT.
3.  WEATHER CONDITIONS:  ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE WEATHER AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION WAS CLEAR WITH GOOD VISIBILITY. THERE WERE NO WEATHER BALLOONS OR AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AT THE TIME.
4.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS:  THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THIS REPORT DOES NOT PERMIT POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOME TYPE OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN OF ITS MANEUVERING CAPABILITIES AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION WOULD TEND TO MAKE THIS UNLIKELY. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS REPORT BE FORWARDED TO THE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER FOR FURTHER EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS.
