Text in the document:
U.S. Air Force could determine if the object was under intelligent control or not at the time it was observed, because of the apparent maneuverability and speed of the object. It is further stated that at the time, the object appeared to be under intelligent control because of its erratic movements and its apparent response to the actions of the observer. He directs the "tone" of the operator and states the object was doing what he directed it to do.
The witness states that he had the object under observation for about 20 minutes and that the object was first observed about 1:30 a.m. on the date indicated. He states that the object was metallic in appearance and reflected the light from the searchlight which he was playing on it. He describes the size of the object as being about 60 to 100 feet in diameter. He states that the object appeared to be a solid body, reflecting the light, and that he could see no openings or protrusions of any kind. He further states that the object seemed to remain at a fairly constant altitude of from 800 to 1000 feet and that it appeared to be traveling at a speed between 500 and 700 miles per hour.
The above is a summary of the witness's description of the object observed.
