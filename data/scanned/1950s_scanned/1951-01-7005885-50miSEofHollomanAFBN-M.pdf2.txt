REPORT 22 JANUARY 1951

On 22 January 1951, while participating in Project Cosmos at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, we took off at about 0500 E and proceeded to the Holloman Launching site at 10,000 ft. where we started tracking a balloon.

At 0630, a balloon was at to attain an altitude of about 100,000 ft. As it was ascending, the balloon broke off at about 20,000 ft. and continued to rise, still maintaining a dark, metallic appearance. It appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed, far greater than the balloon itself. A small, star-like object appeared next to the balloon. At this time, collision insurance was notified.

The object continued to rise and soon passed out of sight. At the next and final observation, the balloon had descended to 60,000 ft. and was rapidly losing altitude. It appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed. The object was not seen again.

Holloman Radar was called to verify if any other aircraft were in the area and when informed of the object, they state they had no information of any other objects in the sky.

The incident was reported to the Project chief at Holloman AFB and on the supervision, Major Kalil of Electronics Sub-Division was also contacted.
