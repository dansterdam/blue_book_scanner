The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Air Intelligence Information Report document.

Transcribed text from the document:

I was outside looking at the sky when I saw a round orange-red glow of fire. It glew up and had a white ring or puff's smoke around it and than it dissappeared on me. I can't account for the flash of the fire and the smoke as far as I can tell or my neighbor I saw another in the same direction and than it dissappeared on me.
