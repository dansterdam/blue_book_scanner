"It seems and after leaving the state that the stops myself as to what I thought they could be and how they could affect us, I was baffled. When they left with the light, which I could see from the porch, I watched them until I could no more. What was the significance of their coming and going in such a strange manner? If only I knew how to interpret this strange occurrence, it might help solve the mystery. As it was, I could only conjecture. I felt that this was no ordinary sighting, for the strange maneuvers and the brilliant light they displayed were quite different from anything I had ever seen before. It left me puzzled and concerned, for I had no way of knowing what implications this might hold. I could only hope that further information might come to light that would shed some understanding on what I had witnessed that night."
