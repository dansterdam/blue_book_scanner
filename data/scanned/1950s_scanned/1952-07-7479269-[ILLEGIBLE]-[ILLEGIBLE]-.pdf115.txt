Dear sir:
Yours in the mutual maintenance service. I wish to report a sighting of an object which came into my yard on the night of July 4 this year. I was in the backyard with my family for the holiday, and we all saw the object. It appeared to be shaped like a cigar-shaped box, with lights on the side. For a moment it seemed to be motionless, then it moved out of sight rapidly. I would be pleased to give you any further details you may require. Please let me know if you wish to know more.
Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
