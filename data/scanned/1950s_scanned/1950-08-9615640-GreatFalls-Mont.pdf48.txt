The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text reads:

Montana Case: * In 1952, after an ATIC interrogation of witnesses and evaluation of data, and our opinion at that was that the UFO's apparently were two F-84 aircraft. In support of this contention, a few weeks ago an extremely able and very detailed analysis was made by a private laboratory of the film strip in question. Their conclusions, in part, were that, "Photographs of the UFO's indicate that airplane reflections might possibly look like the images shown on the film." The fact that the images do fade is reminiscent of airplane reflective phenomena". Also strong corroborative evidence is given by simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances made by this laboratory which show that aircraft can look similar to the two white blobs shown on the Montana films. There is, therefore, no compelling reason to alter our original evaluation.
