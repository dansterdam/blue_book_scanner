INFORMATION ONLY
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION  11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
This case was reported in March-April 1966. Since the actual sighting had occurred some time ago it is almost impossible to check it out. Also due to the time lag the pertinent data has probably become distorted. Therefore this case is considered information only.
