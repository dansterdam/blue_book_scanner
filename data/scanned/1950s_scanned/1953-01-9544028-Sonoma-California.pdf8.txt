UNCLASSIFIED
Sonoma, California                                     10 January 1953

I. Description of Incident
At 2335, two civilian sources observed one small flying object moving at a great rate of speed and performing violent maneuvers. The object's round was similar to that of a jet aircraft, but smaller. It made a sudden change of direction first to the right, then to the left, and then dropped to the ground apparently dead, and disappeared.

II. Discussion of Incident
The only known aerial object capable of appearing to go through the described maneuvers would be a balloon; however, the time factors and velocity estimates do not support this conclusion.

III. Conclusion
Unknown
