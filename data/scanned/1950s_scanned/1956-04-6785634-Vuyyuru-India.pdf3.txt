CANADIAN BAPTIST MISSION
Vuyyuru, Kistna Dist.
Andhra State, India
27 April 1956

Dear Taylor,

I have seen my first flying saucer to-night, only it was more like a flying dirigible. Balloons of a peculiar shape and sound were encountered several times before the facts, which were witnessed by at least fifty to sixty people on three different occasions, 27 April 1956. Vuyyuru sighting, time 2021 hours, as I was arranging my projectors to give an outdoor showing of some pictures. While sitting for a small adjustment to be made, I noticed a rather misty luminous form which seemed like three elongated cigars, revolving in a formatin. The formation came due south and came down to about 2,500 feet, and just before it got to where we were sitting it turned and seemed to descend in a lateral direction. On the actual turn, instead of the cigar shapes, there appeared five, somewhat larger objects, spherical in formation, which moved back again into formational flying. The formation took 22 seconds, by count, to pass overhead and was absolutely silent. No noise of any kind was heard. Then the formation simply disappeared. Speed might be estimated at twice 200 miles per hour, but difficult to judge accurately because of the sudden disappearance. In a sense they reminded me of the luminous appearances of dolphins at play in the Red Sea, only instead of up and down, we had to look up.

No attempt is made to diagnose what appeared, the facts are recorded by me immediately after the appearance are written down. Interpretations I leave to the more enlightened, or those with bigger and better imaginations. 

Yours Sincerely,
[Signature]
