On the 25th of August 1951 at 2150 hours from my home located near Albuquerque, New Mexico I observed the following:
This aircraft was flying in a south by east direction at a speed I thought to be about 300 miles per hour.
The aircraft made no sound and the distance was quite large, but the aircraft was close enough so that the lights from Central Ave. reflected from the lower side of the craft.
This aircraft was unusual in the following ways: there was no noise, the size I could see was about 1/6 that of a B-29, the lights were soft and glowed like a spread V with the wings sloping back at an angle of about 15 degrees.
On the rear edge of the wings soft white lights were located in pairs, these light patterns reminded me of those on aircraft that I am familiar with the appearance of.
Over the front edge of the wing tips extended to the rear side of the wing tip extending beyond the lights of each pair.
Each pair of lights were separated by about eight times the distance between the lights of one pair.
The wings appeared to retain their size from the center to the end without any taper.
No identification or markings could be seen and this aircraft had no exterior lights of any kind that could be seen. The aircraft was in my sight about 5 minutes.
This is a true description of the aircraft as I observed and remember it.
