REPORTED BY: Lt. JAMES E. TAYLOR
SUMMARY: On or about 0700 hours, 27 September 1952, an unidentified flying object was seen by LEONARDO JOSE BARRERA, a Naval Aviation Cadet, test assigned to Hondo Air Force Base. The sighting was made at 0700 hours on a heading of 140 degrees over Hempstead, Texas. The object was approximately 200 feet in diameter and was observed for 1-1/2 minutes at a distance of approximately (35,000) feet. It was definitely metallic in composition and was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately (25,000) feet. It is reported to have been observed by another Cadet, name unknown, who was assigned to the same area. The object was described as disc-shaped and seemed to be translucent. It appeared to glisten and was a bright silvery color. It was hovering or executing an extremely slow rate of speed of approximately 30 miles per hour. No sound was heard. Both observers were familiar with various types of aircraft and stated that this object was definitely not an aircraft known to them. Both observers were questioned separately and their statements are essentially the same. Their observations are considered credible.
