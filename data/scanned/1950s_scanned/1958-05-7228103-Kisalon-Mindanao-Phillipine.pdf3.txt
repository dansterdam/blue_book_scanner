ORIGINATING AGENCY 
OAIRA, Manila, Philippines
IR-92-58
1. Quoted herewith is extract of letter from Father Labrador, who provides the Manila Observatory (PAGASA - L-2494-54), to Father D. McNally, Director of the Manila Observatory.
"ALL ABOUT: AT (4 - 17 17) p.m. a brilliant spot light on the little platform at the end of the Western sky, was in the eclipse (zenith), southern part, a very bright, sharply defined phenomenon, lingering for about 30 minutes. And its apparent source was disappearing westward."
Referred 405 milliliters. Disappeared from my view behind Palayan Mt. Head.
There was no sound. It moved away very fast but it seemed to stop or slow down in the small in curve and then proceeded again with great speed. The size was about 1/20 part of the moon and its color was white. The direction was from East to West.
If it is true that such phenomena are within 50 miles I thought many would notice the. It seems to be a major phenomenon rather than a mirage. The whole of Manila was lighted up.
The following comments were made by Father Labrador in his original report:
"The angle reported by Father Labrador seems perfectly to the described of the unknown object." It is reported that the Russians are using a re-en-try technique of capsules from their satellite vehicles. If this is true, the pattern observed here would fit such a description. There would be a slowing down as the vehicle came in for a landing in the atmosphere and then it would descend again.
That Father Labrador should be in a position to observe another "phenomenon" is quite reasonable if these vehicles are originating from the same place."
