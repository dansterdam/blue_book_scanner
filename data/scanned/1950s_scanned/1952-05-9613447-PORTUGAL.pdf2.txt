The Director of Security, ATIC, states that the following information was reported concerning an unidentified object observed over Portugal on 16 May 1952.
At approximately 11 o'clock, strange things took place in the sky over Santarém. According to detailed information received from there, some strange spherical form, silvery in appearance, was observed to maneuver through the sky. This object was first observed as a brilliant sphere, but from which we transcribe the most unusual data. After having observed this peculiar maneuver for some time, it was made of a luminous or was point-in-that color, and had an intense explosion, breaking into several parts or fragments. These fragments then became horizontal lines or broken lines, and some remained horizontal and apparently stationary for some time. The fragments gradually disappeared without trace.
Security Offices' Comment: The town of Santarém, located northwest of Lisbon, is a popular resort area and always in the public eye. There is a possibility that the description given is a garbled account of some natural phenomenon and that the spectacular display described did not actually occur as stated.
