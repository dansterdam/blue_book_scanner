1950th AACS Squadron, 350-69. Subject: Sighting of Strange Objects or Light

Pilot of the T-6 calls me when he closed his flight plan. Lt. Cumings, the pilot, gave me his information, which I have entered in paragraph 8.

8. About 2245 hours I again observed the light at a much greater distance with less intensity of light. It was soon gone from sight.

9. In the great intensity of light I could see its shape as it moved, as described in paragraph 8, which was an unusual shape and clearly dropped in a vertical direction out of sight in a time period of about 5 minutes.

10. While observing the light I noticed that it slightly changed in color varying from a bright white to a yellowish orange then back to white.

11. Individuals who saw the light were in Ground Control, Weathers, Rotan Tower, 2d Aviation, Anderson Tower and others from whom I received phone calls.

12. I have been in Anderson Tower for six months but have never witnessed any similar conditions.

13. I am convinced that the light was not any type of man-made aircraft, balloon, flare, meteor or star.

14. If this light was housed in any type structure I am unable to describe it.

15. Lt. Cumings, pilot of the T-6, called the tower on a second instance reporting that he had again seen an identical light to the south as he lost the operations.

16. I received reports of other "strange lights" after the light in question was observed, but I believe there were only three, since I was unable to see it.

17. I am not an advocate of interplanetary "saucers" and in writing this report am only describing something a strange occurrence which I witnessed and am unable to account for.
