SUBJ: "Flying Saucer"; Observation of
1. At 0250 hrs., Friday, 19 December 1952, I observed an object in the sky similar to the illustration in Life magazine of April 7, 1952. This object, while similar to the illustration, was somewhat larger in appearance and traveled at a speed estimated at 75 to 100 miles per hour. It appears to have a pulsations near the forward end and near the rear. The object was first observed through binoculars and was tracked for several minutes while it was traveling in a northerly direction, apparently at a very high rate of speed. The object was seen at two different points but no accurate estimates of the distance or the rate of speed could be determined.
