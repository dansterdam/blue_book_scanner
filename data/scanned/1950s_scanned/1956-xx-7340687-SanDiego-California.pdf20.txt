Hato Reyes, Puerto Rico 0024
February 10, 1967

Major Quintanilla, Junior and Staff:

Today I read the special "LOOK" magazine article about the NICAP and the NICAP guide to UFO's and have decided to report you my own observation just as it occurred.

During the year 1956, I was living with my mother and brother at our home in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We lived in a house where its own, now lives and named on the street in front of the house at 12:00 Noon and suddenly over my head and with the palm of my hand covering the sun (as some overhead) I observed a brilliant air-like dish which seemed to me over 100,000 feet. It continued my mother and suddenly disappeared but it was at a height of what it seems to me over 100,000 feet. I continued my mother and sudden disappeared but it was at a height of what it seems to me over 100,000 feet. I continued my activities and with the palm of my hand covering the sun. After about 10 seconds it reappeared again and this time it stopped but it was at a height of what it seems to me over 100,000 feet. It continued my mother and suddenly disappeared but it was at a height of what it seems to me over 100,000 feet.

I heard then about the UFO and I am almost sure she saw it. She had told me that she was from St. Louis, Missouri and I was also told that she was a professor and Dean of the University of Puerto Rico and she was to the best of my knowledge a very fine lady as far as integrity and sincerity are concerned. The Ponce Parkville Guide, maybe, Puerto Rico, come on as Dean of the University of Puerto Rico, as he was in charge of students, is responsible for the activities on March 3, 1967, and I was also told that he was a very fine man as far as integrity and sincerity are concerned.
