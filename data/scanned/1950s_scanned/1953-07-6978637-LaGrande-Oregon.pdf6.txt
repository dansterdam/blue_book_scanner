Report contains information concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object by a naval aircraft over La Grande, Oregon on 6 June 1953. An F-94 fighter aircraft from McChord AFB, Washington was vectored to investigate the object. The object was described as round, white, and moving at high speed. No trail was observed. No other personnel of tactical air command or air defense command posts were informed of the incident. It is estimated that the whole incident would be 10 minutes after receipt of information from the Seattle AARTC Center. It is my belief that the date of reports 2 July 1953, should read 6 July 1953.
