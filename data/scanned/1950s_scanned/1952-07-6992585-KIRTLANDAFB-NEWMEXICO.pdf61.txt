There are no actual photographs on this page, only sketches. The first sketch depicts an arc with a label "Your eye" at one end, "Horizon" at the bottom, and "Overhead" at the top of the arc. There are two marked points, labeled "A" and "B," indicating the position of an object in the sky as observed by someone at different times. The second sketch shows a side profile of the same observation angles.

The text on the document reads:
