Case No. 1023

REPORT TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

On 23 March 1950, at approximately 11:35 AM, Investigator, Military Intelligence, interviewed WENDELL CIRCLE, at his residence, Wendell Circle, Fort-ad-Rock, Oceanport, New Jersey.

On 23 March 1950, at approximately 12:45 PM, he arrived in Little Silver, New Jersey, by train in transit from New York, to his home, 14 March 1950, he observed an unidentified object in the sky as it looked over his shoulder, west by northwest, to observe the sky as it passed over his home. He stated that the object was very high in altitude, and the visibility was unlimited, while he watched the object he estimated the length of the object to be approximately 40 to 50 thousand feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 2 to 3 thousand miles per hour. Further stated that his observation was of approximately ten seconds duration and that the vapor trails he saw, although somewhat diffused, were at an attitude of approximately 40 to 50 thousand feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 2000 to 3000 miles per hour.

Due to the distance, it was unable to determine what was causing the trails he saw, although he concluded they had just started when he first observed them.

He apparently occupies a position as Mechanical Engineer. He was formerly an officer and served with the 206 Field Artillery, 76th Division, during World War II. He stated that he was also an Intelligence Agent during this period and reported periodically to G-2 in Washington, D.C.
