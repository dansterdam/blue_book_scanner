There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text in the document is as follows:

29. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One): Yes or No 
29.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One): Yes or No
29.2 Please list their names and addresses:

* 30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.

It is to be noted that the undersigned is acting as liaison between the writer of this report and the authorities at the Air Force Base. The writer states that he is willing to do whatever is required in the way of additional investigation or information to give the case proper consideration. However, he may not do so since he does not have his address listed on this report.

I would like to comment, however, that I am very well acquainted with this case as I have known the writer for approximately ten years. I can vouch for the fact that he is a highly intelligent and responsible individual and would observe such an object as is described in this report as accurately and objectively as he would any other phenomenon in the sky. 

S-30. We would be glad to receive another questionnaire in regard to one or two members of our coming Astronomy Club who gave a personal report on an unidentified object seen in this area October 22nd.
