Shiloh Sept 16
Mr. Capt. Oliver R. Hill
Sir:
On 8:30 P.M. some time ago Jill Dobbins and myself saw a metallic disc-like object hovering motionless for some considerable time. I had no camera with me to take a picture. The object rose vertically at a tremendous speed and disappeared from view.
I notified the Air Force at Dayton, Ohio and had an interview with them but they seem to be rather skeptical about the report.
As I have not had any previous experience I would appreciate any information or assistance you could give me in regard to this matter. As they here do not seem to be too interested in such matters, I would be grateful if you would give the incident some consideration.
Thank you
