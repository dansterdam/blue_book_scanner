The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

to determine that there is a certain amount of that which must be done each day. which does not mean suspense slip items...was explained  
Therefore, I feel that I must take this information in regards to the public.  It is difficult for one man to be Project Officer, technical advisor, public information specialist, research and chief preparer, lecturer writer, and a host of other things which are not apparent even to the attached example which had to be accomplished with 7 days time. The shaded example which had to be accomplished with 7 days time, was the sort of priority and interrupting things my time seems to be occupied with, and which take one week, by one man.
Again I should like to apologize, but I feel this matter has reached a stage where I must ask for help.
