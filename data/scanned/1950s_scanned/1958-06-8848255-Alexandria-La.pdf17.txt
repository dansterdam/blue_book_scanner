AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT OF Unidentified Flying Object
UNIT OR ORGANIZATION: ALEXANDRIA, LA., Police
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 26 JUNE 1958
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 11:15 PM
Ref: AIR 28-1 (Subject) Report of Unidentified Flying Object dated 25 June 1958. For File 12:. Contents of reporting officer. It has come to the attention of the investigating officer that one rather raiher than officer AER 28-1 (Subject) Report was the first to observe the unidentified flying object in question, as referred to in the referenced report.

Yesterday, 26 June 1958, the investigating officer received information that another officer had seen the same object and that a local newspaper reporter in Alexandria, La. had also interviewed a resident who had seen the object. It was this latter information that brought the matter to the attention of the investigating officer. He made several tests involving the use of a camera in an effort to recreate the curved winged formation and the flashing light observed. The results of these tests are inconclusive and do not positively identify the object as being anything other than what was previously reported. The photographs taken by officer Brown are reflections of sun light.
