Alain Michel investigated this case within 48 hours and has provided us with some additional details. He feels that the facts were indisputably sincere. This opinion was shared by the people of the village, but according to the confidential information, they were mistaken when they saw. Michel added that "he and his unnamed companion were still trembling with emotion when they talked to me." Because of the bright light carried by one of the four small beings, Michel was unable to give a minimum description: their silhouettes, a to 5 feet tall, rather round bodies. They waited with a "floating" gait. The others described seeing, no nearer than 30 yards, three little men and one bright, glowing in the middle between 10:50 and 11:15 p.m. P.m. Michel also ascertained that the small beings in question remained in the field "from 10:10 to 10:40 p.m.". One of the witnesses, a young woman who was run-ner in the Olympic games, she ought to enter the Olympic games." Regarding the "black language" found in the road, the writer writes: "At first sight one thinks on an intense heating of the road in a circle 6 about 3 yards and of an internal melting of the tar, which seems to have flowed. But this is uncertain. The road is lightly traveled. These plaques may have been left by the wind-unrolling machin which other cases by, because the incidence is able to make such plaques. Michel has no personal opinion about the case. He found it impossible to decide: "but there is a presumption in favor of the witnesses."
