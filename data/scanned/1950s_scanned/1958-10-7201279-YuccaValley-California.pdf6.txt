FROM: AFOIN-4E COMMENT NO.: 1

1. The ATIC had these portions of Mr. - film containing the socalled UFO enlarged for detailed analysis. The enlargements did not reveal any additional detail which would aid in the proper identification of the phenomenon.

2. The analysis of the film indicates the object was stationary, yet Mr. -  film contained enough to get adequate photographs revealing certain details. It is in the opinion of the ATIC that the obvious reason the photo was not good is photographs taken in the dark at night and under poor visibility conditions.

3. The object was photographed for a total time of approximately six seconds. This was determined by counting the number of frames on which the object appeared and knowing the camera speed.

4. In view of the limited data available, the ATIC is unable to come to any definite conclusion as to what the object is. However, it appears to be a reflection of some sort. Knowing the reputation of Mr. - , it is conceivable that he photographed exactly what he saw.
