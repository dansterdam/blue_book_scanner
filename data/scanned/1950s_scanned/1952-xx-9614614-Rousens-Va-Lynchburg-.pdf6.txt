Richmond (AP)—A mysterious and shiny "thing" flashed across the Southside Virginia horizon yesterday and astronomers, Weather Bureau officials and science fiction fans were taking turns today guessing what it was.
Was the "thing" a meteorite?
Was it just a bright star, perhaps?

Or—here we go again—a flying saucer?

State police dispatched a trooper into Powhatan, scene of most of the reports. The trooper notified headquarters that he had spied nothing out of the ordinary.
