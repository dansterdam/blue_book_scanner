The image contains three sketches or drawings depicting observations of unidentified objects in the sky. The top sketch shows a curved trajectory of an object above the horizon, with instructions to place an "A" at the starting point and a "B" at the ending point. The middle and bottom sketches show different perspectives of the observed object, with instructions to use these sketches to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
