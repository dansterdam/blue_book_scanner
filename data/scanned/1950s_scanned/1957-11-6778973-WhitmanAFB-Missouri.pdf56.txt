1. Reference message this Headquarters, DOI-7536, dated 7 November 1957.

2. Attached are six diagrams depicting the tracks of UFOB's in the vicinity of Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base, Oklahoma, from 22 October to 31 October 1957. The diagrams were received from the 5th Air Division (Def), Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base, Oklahoma, and are the result of radar tracking. The tracks show erratic maneuvers and change direction when
observed by radar trainers. It should also be noted that the turns were so sharp that normal aircraft could not have executed them.

3. From the radar scope, the returns were easy to recognize as they appeared unusually large and bright. Readings of airspeed, altitude, and heading as tracked by the radar varied from 5-7 degrees to 5-7 degrees, thus indicating abrupt changes in direction as well as a wide variation in speed. The difference in readings was not explained by the operators
as they were not correlated by the operators with any known aircraft.

4. Based on this analysis, it appears that the turns were unusually sharp and could not have been executed by conventional aircraft. The radar scope and tracks
suggest that the objects displayed performances beyond the capabilities of existing aircraft.

5. Radar photograph: As inclosure #7 is a photograph of the original film taken at 1113Z on 6 November 1957. The photograph is of poor quality, as the camera
did not hold the image of the radar scope. The photograph was taken with color film. At the time this photograph was taken, the 1330Z target was considerable
to the return of a B-47 aircraft and was tracked on both the azimuth and elevation scopes of the 1330Z target.
