Text transcribed from the document:

WHEN THE INTERVIEWED THE MEN LATER, JUST ONE OF THE FOUR WHO (CENSORED) REPORTED A U.C.S., AND HE DIDN'T SEEM TO SURE ABOUT IT) (THIS WAS MERELY CASUALLY STATED THERE WAS NO FUSS...SO..HE LEFT IT OUT) AFTER COMPLETING THE DRAWING...HE TOOK IT OUTSIDE TO SHOW MRS. (CENSORED) WHO TOOK ONE LOOK, DECIDED WE SHOULDN'T BOTHER MESSING IT AGAIN..AND ASKED HIM TO TAKE IT AWAY...SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT ANYMORE. WE SPENT THREE HOURS AT THE (CENSORED) HOUSEHOLD THAT MORNING AND AFTERNOON, AND ASKED IF WE COULDN'T COME BACK THAT EVENING WHEN THE MEN WOULD ARRIVE FROM EVANSVILLE INDIANA. THREE OF THE MEN, (CENSORED), AND TWO OTHERS HAD GONE THEIR SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST TO GET A TRUCK REPAIRED. THE WOMEN AGREED WE COULD COME BACK THAT EVENING.
I TOLD HIM SO DARN HARD TO GET THE SKETCH THAT IT ALMOST HURT MY MIND...I SAT DOWN TO REDRAW THE SKETCH, AS HE RATHER BRUSQUELY SAID WAS THE RATHER POOREST DRAWING BOARD I'D EVER WORKED ON. TRACING THE BASIC SKETCH SO AS NOT TO LOSE THE PROPORTIONS, I SMOOTHED UP THE ROUGH SPOTS, AND SHADED THE DRAWING TO GIVE MORE EMPHASIS TO THE FACIAL AND BODY FEATURES. IT WAS THIS DRAWING THAT I TOOK BACK WITH ME THAT EVENING AROUND 7:30. AFTERAGAIN CHECKING IT SIDE-SIDE COMPARISON, I HAD PROCEEDED IN THE FIELDS ALL DAY...AND PROCEEDED IN ARRIVAL BY AN HOUR. I VERY QUIETLY LAYED DOWN THE DRAWING ON THE BED BESIDE WHERE I WAS STANDING, AND THEN MOVED AWAY. (CENSORED) CAME INTO THE ROOM, GLANCED AT THE BED...SAW THE DRAWING...HELD IT AND PICKED IT UP...AND GAVE US ALL THE COLD CHILLS BY DECLARING "THIS IS IT, THIS IS IT, IT LOOKS JUST LIKE IT"... (LATER HOWEVER, HE HAD A LOT TO ADD TO IT, HE SAID THAT NO ONE ELSE SEEMED TO HAVE SEEN).
