The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram or sketch rather than a photograph. The diagram depicts a mountain ridge with a number of concentric circles or swirls radiating outward from it. The text mentions "Mountain Ridge" and "Mountain Ridge" and discusses the appearance of objects in the sky. 

Producing the text from the document:

On Dec 26, 1951 us went int DARK. sky. cove was in the center of the DARK Circle Lighting up an area about 400 yrds wide the cover was irregular in shape much like the outline of a large low cumulus cloud, it was brilliant white like magnesium Burning. The cover was about 100 yrds high at the center and tapered down at the edges. It hovered for several minutes, then moved out over the MOUNTAIN Ridge and DISAPPEARED. Mr. & Mrs. X & 2 children saw it, it made no noise, it was real close, I was called to come & see it but by that time it was going over the Ridge and had DISAPPEARED. I could get no picture. The view only lasted for 3 or 4 minutes. This was Central Standard Time. From then until we could no longer see it, it was apparently stationary, but the sky was dark and the object was brilliant white, so as contrasted with the sky it may have been moving slowly. The objects were not much different than many "stars" I have seen, except that they were brilliantly lighted, as I described. I think it was some kind of aircraft, but I do not know what.
