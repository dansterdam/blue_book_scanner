SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:

1. A check was made with the weather station at Lincoln AFB, Nebr. and the wind readings at 2100 CST, 12 Feb 57 were:

Surface - calm
6,000* - 290 degrees at 30 knots
10,000* - 320 degrees at 45 knots
16,000* - 280 degrees at 60 knots
20,000* - 310 degrees at 80 knots
30,000* - 310 degrees at 80 knots
40,000* - 290 degrees at 70 knots

This station only releases ceiling balloons and then only when sighting, and the balloons were clear on the day of sighting. It was learned here, that balloons are released at Omaha, Nebr. by Universal Weather Service for the Air Force, on this schedule: balloons would have been released at 2100 CST, 12 Feb 57.

Universally it is an attempt to gain further information. This will verify the information gained and also attempt to determine what the weather conditions were at the time, and what the flying conditions were that the objects engaged in. They were engaged in lengthy research requiring the release of balloons.

At the University of Nebraska, it was learned from Mr. that the University of Nebraska Balloon Research Department also does research on sightings of UFO's. He was contacted and they reported no activity on that date, since they maintain no regular schedule of balloon releases, but engage in research when they feel it is necessary.

CAA radio at Omaha, Nebr. was contacted and they reported no activity or sighting on that date. They did report, however, that flying conditions on that date were overcast and only limited visibility was possible. There was nothing unusual observed or reported in their area on that date.

Through flight service at Lowry AFB, Colo., it was learned that under VFR conditions at Denver airport, there would have been good visibility those nights; however, the airport was closed that night due to bad weather. So there would have been no unusual activity reported.
