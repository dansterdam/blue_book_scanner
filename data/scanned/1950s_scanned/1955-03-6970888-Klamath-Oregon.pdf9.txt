1. SOURCE: USNR Officer and family Observers:

2. DATE AND PLACE ACQUIRED: 19 August 1955, Klamath Palls, Oregon
                                   Date: 22 August 1955

3. PRC-31. F-75-10471. Subj:  UFO Sighting

4. ABSTRACT: Complies with paragraph 21, AFPR 200-2

"UnassT-ified" Classification: "

5. DETAIL: At about 9 a.m. 19 August 1955, a heavy mist in process of lifting near Manna Pools-Ranch Kerker Krumhurn State who had taken a cottage here for a week, reported a metallic object with what looked like ripe yellow bands bouncing over the metallic having, and disappeared.

The reports will be seen to throw a large mystery this entire incident as there seems no way of verifying the whole thing, only say we believe them implicitly since they are reported as reliable sources. Fear of ridicule being connected to the AF prompted the USNR to request us to take all details. 

In conclusion, the objects observed seemed to be the size of mouth fishfood and not bird or insect, clouds of birds may have made the objects. 

It is reported that this type basin is not one over sea-level in this region, being in moist proof to establish further if much can be added to this ascertain report "
