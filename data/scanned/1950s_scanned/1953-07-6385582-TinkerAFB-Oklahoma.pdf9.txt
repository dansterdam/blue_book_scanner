Text from the document:

It could see one (1) object, very bright and sort of pear shaped. It did not look like it had a trail in its rear as the object moved across sky. There was no sound and no trail observed. There seemed to be a small light at just the extremity of the object. 

It looked like it was twice or Tinker Air Force base and south of Oklin Tinker AFB 35 was 15,000 or 29,000 deed likeness.

I have been on the chart force for eleven (11) years. I am usually opposed to the weather and observe aircraft over the field.

The weather was clear, the sun shining. There were a few floating clouds.

I believe it was a weather balloon. The sun was shining on it.
