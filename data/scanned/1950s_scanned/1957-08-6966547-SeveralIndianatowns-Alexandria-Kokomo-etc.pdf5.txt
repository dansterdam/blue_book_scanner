INDIANAPOLIS
"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, There is Liberty"
WEDNESDAY EVENING, AUGUST 7

AIR OF STATE
W and

Church Council
U.K.'s Religious
Liberty Inquiry
"Protestant and Orthodox
churches have de-
clared thru a committee
that broad inquiry into prob-
lems of religious liberty
among Roman Catholics is neces-
sary.
"This is a further action of
the World Council of
Churches, which has an-
nounced through its secretary
general that the inquiry is
aimed at the Roman Catholic
Church and some fears it has
caused."
Instead of issuing pro-
nouncements, the committee
studied the problem, and it
was decided to put its diplo-
matic forces to work for a
further consideration of the
question.
