STATEMENT BY CAPTAIN WILLARD F. BOWLBY
On 13 January 1952 Captain WILLARD F. BOWLBY, participated in a tracking operation of a visual object observed by ground observers. This object was tracked by Captain BOWLBY in his F-86 jet for approximately 20 minutes at which time the object was lost from view. The object was first sighted at approximately 11:20 AM CST by observers at the Ground Intercept Radar Station near Amarillo, Texas. The object was traveling at an estimated speed of 800-900 knots and an altitude of approximately 60,000 feet. Ground radar confirmed the presence of the object. Captain BOWLBY was then scrambled to intercept the object. Visual contact was made and the object was closely trailed for approximately 20 minutes at which time the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The object appeared to be a white or very light gray circular object, slightly larger than a P-51 fighter plane. During the time it was under observation, the object maintained a relatively steady course and altitude, although minor deviations were noted. At the time the object was lost from view, Captain BOWLBY estimated it to be in excess of 7,000 feet and traveling at a speed far beyond the capability of any known aircraft.
