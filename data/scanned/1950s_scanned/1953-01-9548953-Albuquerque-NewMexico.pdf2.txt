Dear Capt. Ruppelt:

I am enclosing a newspaper clipping out from the 1 February 1953 issue of the Albuquerque Journal.

You will note from the article that some photographs were taken of an aerial object on 29 January 1954 by cinematographer for a televisions news company. As a result of checking with Mr. Hensley, we learned that the undeveloped negatives were sent to Life magazine. We attempted to turn the photographs over to the Air Force but they had been sent to Life before we could obtain them.

I do not know what these photos may prove to be. I have an incompatibility of a meteor was ruled out by Dr. La Paz. I realize this information is rather indefinite. I thought it advisable to check with you before further investigation. Without the photos, his story is almost impossible to explore. I thought that you, if you think it advisable, could probably obtain the photos from Life.

Please advise if any further action is necessary on our part.

'Saucer' Is Sighted
in Technicolor
New Mexico airmen saw a strange
object with the camera-eye of a television
camera. The airmen photographed the silvery
object as it hovered over an airfield. 
According to the reports, the saucer shaped
craft, suspended motionless in the air, suddenly
shot upward at terrific speed and disappeared
into the clouds. The airmen said the light was so
intense that it lit up the ground and Theatre and
seemed to hover over the field for about 15 minutes
and then shoot away.
