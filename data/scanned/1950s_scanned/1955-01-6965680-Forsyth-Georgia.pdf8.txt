AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

24 Jan 1955

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 

1. REPORT OF OBSERVATION 

On 6 January 1955, at approximately 1900 hours, a Mr. S. N. Forsyth, a resident of Forsyth, Georgia, reported that he had observed an unidentified flying object. 

The witness stated that while driving home on Highway 401, approximately 3 miles east of Forsyth, Georgia, he observed a bright light in the southern sky. The object was described as round, approximately 30 feet in diameter, and appeared to hover about 500 feet above the ground. 

The witness stated that the object remained stationary for approximately 2-3 minutes, then accelerated at a high rate of speed in a northeasterly direction and disappeared from sight. 

The weather at the time of the observation was clear, with very little wind. No other witnesses were reported. 

2. INVESTIGATION 

The Air Force conducted an investigation of this report. Interviews with the witness, Mr. Forsyth, confirmed the details of his observation as outlined above. No other witnesses were located.

3. CONCLUSION 

Based on the information obtained during the investigation, the Air Force was unable to identify the observed object. The witness appeared to be a credible observer, and his description of the object and its behavior could not be readily explained. The case was therefore classified as "UNIDENTIFIED".
