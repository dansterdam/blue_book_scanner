There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an Air Intelligence Information Report from Project Blue Book.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

I. SOURCE: Address Redacted, MARYLAND
Present Position: Test Engineer for BALTIMORE & OHIO RAILROAD
Qualifications: Research Manager

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a tall, capable man of middle age. He was known by all workers in the BALTIMORE & OHIO headquarters, and was previously the chief of the U.S. Signal Corps. He defined himself as a man of integrity and willing to help.

III. SOURCE stated the PITMAN solution was used to "wash down railroad cars". It is required from two (2) pipemen on each side of the car as it is drawn between them. The solution is kept in large vats nearby the spraying operation. Although not probable, further information on the solution (2 MARCH 1955) will be called to report if it comes in from the source.
