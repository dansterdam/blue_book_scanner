Page Six.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"Noting the report will be of some service to you. It would seem rather routine data, but could denote real interest or significance to myself, and others, who might see that it adds to what they should know, such information being scattered and there is no proof for the witness, that such a thing was seen here. Those people who hesitate to question the sanity of the person describing it.

Out here in Hampton Bays they have an airport lookout service. Looking over the country along the coast, this service is really a watch. There are occasions where men on watch think they see unusual lights in the sky distant from the aircraft at the airport. This could not always be, namely, stating that it was observed to ascertain as to what actually was seen, whether it was an aircraft or planet, or what.

I have hesitated to relate this event to anyone, and nobody has asked, as I do not want any description that may indicate a criticism. Our attempt to exhibit a courtesy can build a sense of better than other behavior on our part. We were sitting on our front porch enjoying the beautiful moonlit evening.

IF I can be of any further service to you, please do not hesitate to call upon me.

Respectfully yours,
