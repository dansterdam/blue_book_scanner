This is a July 20 report. I am writing to give you a report on the sighting of an unidentified flying object, which was seen on April 6, 1955 near Jamestown, California.

At approximately 11:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on April 6, 1955, a County Sheriff's Deputy and a female companion were driving southbound on State Highway 49 about 2 miles south of Sonora, California. They noticed a bright, silvery object in the sky ahead of them, at an estimated altitude of about 5,000 feet. The object appeared to be hovering and was very bright. As they drove closer, the object began to move rapidly to the north, and then stopped and hovered again. The observers said the object was about 50-75 feet in diameter, and appeared to be circular in shape.

After hovering for a short time, the object then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight within 2-3 seconds. The witnesses reported the object made no noise and left no trail. They stated they were certain it was not a conventional aircraft, and that it exhibited characteristics typical of an unidentified flying object.
