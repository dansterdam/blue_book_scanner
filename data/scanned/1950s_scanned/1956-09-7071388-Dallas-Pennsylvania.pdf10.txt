The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report discussing a UFO sighting or experience.

"little green man" or expect to see any, though of course we assumed that the craft was being piloted "by somebody." I think we both felt that it was probably some sort of military craft being tested by the United States Air Force, and publicly unannounced as such.

About its size....we agree that it was "about the size of the court house" which, in Richmond, is a mighty big court house!

When we reached French Lick I related this experience to Hortense Myers, Indianapolis INS editor, and assistant chairman of the Press Women's convention. She told me they had been asked not to publish such reports, and advised me to say nothing about it. (To tell you the truth, I don't think she believed me.)

It has been more than 10 years since then, of course, and we have read many reports about UFO experiences during this time, but have had no more such experiences ourselves. Nor have we read any accounts which described the "lumineal color" we saw, or the wisps of smoke (?) or vapor (?) emitted from the center opening. And because there is a very serious interest in investigating UFO accounts at this time, I decided to send you mine.
