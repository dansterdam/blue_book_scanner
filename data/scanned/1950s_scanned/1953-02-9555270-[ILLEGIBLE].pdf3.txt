At approximately 2110 hours, 26 February 1953, I saw a strange ball in the sky about forty miles away and approximately 1,200 to 1,500 feet in altitude. It appeared to be stationary or slowly rotating, and was flashing various colors as it was observed.

After that, a searchlight was apparently used to watch the ball again. As it descended, it appeared to stop and hover, then seemed to go out. It was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes. 

On 28 February 1953, a bright object appeared in the sky, which seemed to be high and bearing was the same as the ball mentioned above. It was observed for approximately one-half hour and disappeared.
