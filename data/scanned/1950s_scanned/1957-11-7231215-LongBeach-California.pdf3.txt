AF FORM 112--PART II 
UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DEC 5, 1957 ALSS

AT APPROXIMATELY 1530 HOURS PST 5 DECEMBER 1957 I
WAS ON PATROL IN A 80TH AIRCRAFT WHEN I OBSERVED
TO OUR LEFT FLYING OBJECTS WHICH APPEARED TO BE
CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF
SPEED. THEY APPEARED TO BE METALLIC IN COLOR AND
WERE EMITTING NO EXHAUST PLUME OR FLAME. THEY
TRAVELED IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION AT A CONSTANT
HEADING AND ALTITUDE FOR APPROXIMATELY 90 SECONDS
THEN DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME I OBSERVED THEM THEY APPEARED
TO BE MAINTAINING A SPEED WHICH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE
IN EXCESS OF 700 KNOTS. THERE SEEMED TO BE NO
EVIDENCE OF WINGS OR OTHER AIRCRAFT APPENDAGES WHICH
WOULD NORMALLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRAFT OF THIS
TYPE. THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE UNDER POSITIVE
CONTROL AND MANEUVERED IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE
OBSERVED MOVEMENTS OF THE OBJECTS BY THE OBSERVER.
