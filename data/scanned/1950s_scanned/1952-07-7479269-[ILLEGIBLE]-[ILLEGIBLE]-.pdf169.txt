The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions for sketching an observed object. The diagram shows a horizon line with an "A" position and a "B" position, indicating the object's starting and ending positions. The instructions ask the observer to draw the motion of the object and include details about its shape.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
