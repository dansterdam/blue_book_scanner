Dear Major Coleman:

On 10 June 1961, at your request, I sent you information regarding 
a sighting of an unidentified flying object over Rushville, Nebraska early 
in January, 1951 I would appreciate knowing, in accordance with AFR 200-2 
section 8, the outcome of the official study into this sighting.

Would you please send my a copy of the latest DDD News Release on the 
subject?

On 7 August 1961, I requested information regarding two Chicago-area 
sightings. (4 Nov 57, Elmwood Park; 19 Jul 58, Des Plaines, Ill.) I have been 
trying to obtain inform at about these incidents for over a year. If I can-
not get it through normal channels, I may be forced to seek assistance, as 
I have done before.

On 11 September 1961, I requested information regarding a series of
UFO reports (30 Aug 61; 5 Sep 61) over Cincinnati, Ohio. I would like to
learn the official conclusion in this case, in accordance with AFR 200-2,
section 8.

Major, I have a considerable amount of patience and I feel you are 
competent for the work you are doing. I hope you will provide the informa-
tion requested, thereby insuring also that both these characteristics will 
remain unchanged.

             $incerely:

          4/1
