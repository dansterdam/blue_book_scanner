LO LLANO, TEXAS

INFO:

PROJECT: A UNIDENTIFIED-5-53
REMEMBER HALF-2-7-53 regarding sighting made by Capt. *** on Mar 53 at 2315 CST. AFIT finds that no known meteors or showers were present on this date and, therefore, sighting probably was not caused by such phenomena. However, search lights and relfecting bosones reflecting off clouds or haze layers present a possibility. Accordingly, AFIT suggests the following information to be considered by ATIC: What was the cloud cover, if any, at the date and time of sighting, its altitude and composition (stratus, cumulous, etc.). Base weather at Kelly AFB should have this information.
In reply the Project Blue Books.
