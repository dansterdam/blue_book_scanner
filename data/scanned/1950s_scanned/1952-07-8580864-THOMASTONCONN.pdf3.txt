The lower object appearing toward the front appeared very black, when the upper part was a brilliant bluish color. It steered to the left and appeared to be very black. Only one such object was sighted and it passed out of sight below the horizon. The object appeared larger than a star, and seemed to be metallic in appearance and shape, being somewhat elongated. The witness states that the object moved much faster than any conventional aircraft and disappeared far more rapidly than any jet powered craft would have.
