STATEMENT OF MAJOR McKOWN

On the evening of 19 December 1952 while enroute from Kadena to Anderson Air Force Base, Guam, an incident was reported by the undersigned, Captain McDonnell, who was in the right rear seat. Captain McDonnell pointed to the object and brought to my attention the fact that a silver-like object appeared to be another aircraft in our immediate vicinity as we were looking closer. I realized that the object could not be some of our own aircraft.

It was cylindrical in shape and I was unable to notice any distinguishing marks on the shape or distinguishing condition. The tall seemed to have the appearance of exhaust from the rear end about one-half the size of the object. This outline of the object was illuminated color and was moving horizontally to the west in a downward direction.

This incident occurred in our SHIP, a 700K, at the 100 mile boundary to Guam, and I would estimate the time to be between 0545 and 0525 LT. The object appeared to be about 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Our magnetic heading at the time was 250 degrees.

The object was at considerable distance so when first pointed out but only remained in view for approximately six (6) seconds. From the closure and horizon references I estimate the distance between the object and our aircraft to be 20 - 30 miles.

Operation with own contact at 7000K as I inquired if other aircraft were in the area and was informed that none were known to be, although is reason aircraft had departed Anderson.
