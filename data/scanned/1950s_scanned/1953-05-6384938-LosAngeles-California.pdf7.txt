John T. White, O-539041

-2-

As soon as it had halted above my head, (I did not take my eyes from it) a small white cloud surrounded it. This was very unusual because the cloud was created from particles drawn together as though with some electrical force. There was a faint smell of sweet perfume in the air at this time.

The stone and cloud remained above my head for about five minutes and then very slowly ascended upwards until out of sight. Its ascension was slow requiring about 3 or 4 minutes.

Because of the nature of this observation I believe that you might be interested in the information at hand, since a collection of such information may help you in solving the appearance of other unidentified phenomena sighted by other persons.

My 20/20 vision is available to you and my training in anti-aircraft observation is a matter of record.

I hereby swear this to be true under my oath as an officer of the Air Forces of The United States.

Please inform me if you receive this communication. I suspect there may be a higher intelligence to be indicated for obvious reasons though any practical reason escapes me.

Sincerely yours,
2d Lt., USAFR
