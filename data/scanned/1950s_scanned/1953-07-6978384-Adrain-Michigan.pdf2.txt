U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may restate information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

The text of the handwritten description is as follows:

"The object which appeared appeared to be disc-shaped. The color was light pink or white and the size was estimated to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object moved in a horizontal flight, remaining level with a dark, shadowy trail or exhaust behind it. At times the object seemed to increase in speed while at other times it seemed to decrease speed. At no time did the object change direction or altitude. I watched the object for approximately 5 minutes as it moved across the sky and out of sight. I had a few companions with me at the time who also observed the object. They all described it as I have described it above."
