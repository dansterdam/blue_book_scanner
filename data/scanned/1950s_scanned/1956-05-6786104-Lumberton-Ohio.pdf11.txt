The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline), with an "A" mark on the line to indicate the height at which an object was first seen. A "B" mark on the same curved line shows how high the object appeared above the horizon when it was last seen.

The second and third sketches appear to be examples of how to complete the larger sketch, showing the position of the object when it was first seen ("A") and its position when it was last seen ("B").

There is also some handwritten text at the bottom of the image that says "Seen to travel back & fort".

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
