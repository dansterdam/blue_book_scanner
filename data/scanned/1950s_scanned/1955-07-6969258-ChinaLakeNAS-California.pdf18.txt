Air Intelligence Information Report
Flight 1-3, 1602d AACS
Page 20 of 20

The text in the document is as follows:

This headquarters does not concur with the possible causes of this sighting offered by the reporting officer, for the following reasons:
a. Balloon possibility: The sudden reversal of direction, the high rate of speed, and the direction changes all eliminate this possibility.
b. Aircraft possibility: The duration of the sighting, the slow movement to the east, the lack of sound, and the non-conforming flight characteristics would eliminate this possibility.
c. Astronomical activity: The fact that this object was initially sighted at 45 degrees elevation and the detection of the object was maintained for some length of time would eliminate the possibility of astronomical activity.
d. Critical phenomena: This object was initially picked up on radar and was seen by three people for a long period of time, thereby eliminating the possibility of optical phenomena.
2. This report is forwarded to ATIC as "unknown".
