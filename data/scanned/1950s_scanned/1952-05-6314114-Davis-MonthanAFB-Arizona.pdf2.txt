Upon questioning, the pilots denied that the object interfered 
with either the flying characteristics of the B-36 or the naviga- 
tion or radio equipment. 
   
Upon disappearance from the aircraft the UFO lost altitude, crossed 
under the aircraft, joined the other object and the two separated 
at extremely high speed in a southerly direction. (Aircraft alt1- 
tude, airspeed, heading, UFO headings,approximate speeds and 
exact size estimates are in the original report, but I can not reoom- 
ber them.) During the close proximity of the object the pilots 
did not try evasive action. 

The aircraft and crew were from Carswell AFB, Texas and were on a 
flight to March AFB, California . It is possible that this report 
is filed in Blue Book Archives under either of those base names. 

I hope this report and the diagrams are of some help, Jim.
