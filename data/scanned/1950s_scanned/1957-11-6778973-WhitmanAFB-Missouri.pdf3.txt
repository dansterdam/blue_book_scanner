AFOIN-4-EH
UFO REPORT 1957-31887
AFOIN-4-EL 17 Dec 57
AFOIN-4-ELV. 3. Bryant/jc 1957/195 255-b/Reg 6

1. Reference is made to subject report submitted from Whiteman AFB, Missouri.

2. The information submitted, while voluminous, does not include a great deal of data which would be required for a thorough analysis of the report. The speed as stated is less than 3000 mph. As already reported, while speeds in excess of 3000 mph are not unknown, they are certainly rare. The altitude and size of the object, as well as its manner of flight, indicate it was not of interplanetary origin. (Much of this information is not included in the report.)

3. It is realized that the information submitted herein is of little comfort to personnel who have seen such returns on their radar. For this reason efforts are being made to secure a competent consultant on these matters who will be able to provide a more positive approach to the analysis of the subject incidents.
