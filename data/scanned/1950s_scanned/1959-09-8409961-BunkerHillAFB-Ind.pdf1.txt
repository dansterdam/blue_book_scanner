Dear sirs:  Subject object between 6:10 and 6:30 p.m. was observed by several civilians beneath it. The general opinion was that the object appeared to be a bell-shaped craft about 50 feet in diameter and which appeared to be a maneuverable thing with fast movements on the part of the craft. The opinion is that it was not an aircraft but apparently some type of air vehicle which has not heretofore been reported. This observation was made over Bunker Hill Air Force Base, Indiana, on the evening of 8 September 1959. This organization believes this observation to be of importance and therefore, it is being submitted for your information and further study if warranted. Any information concerning this observation would be greatly appreciated.
