STATEMENT

June 18, 1952

EXTRACT 

On Saturday, 24 May, 1952, I was driving east on U.S. 66 about 25 miles west of Santa Rosa, New Mexico, with my wife as a passenger, when we both observed a round silvery shiny object in the sky. It seemed to be moving very fast to the northeast, fairly high, and to the northeast of it was quite some distance away, yet it was clear to us that it was quite some distance away, yet it seemed to move rapidly, and disappeared in the southeast, moving away in that direction. My wife made these same observations, and I testify that the above statements are true and correct.
