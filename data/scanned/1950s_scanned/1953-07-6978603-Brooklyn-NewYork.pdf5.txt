Transcription of the text:

On Sunday, July 15th, I was up on the roof & saw what I would call a saucer. It seemed about the size of a car & floated above the trees in the city. Suddenly it got faster & faster & went straight up out of sight. It made no sound & seemed to travel very fast. I watched it intently for a few seconds & called my wife to look but she saw nothing. It seemed to be metallic & glistened in the sun. I thought at the time it was some new type of military aircraft, but I have no idea what it could have been. There were no markings on it, & no vapor trail. To be truthful, when it first came to my attention, I could not believe my eyes, but I am quite sure of what I saw. I hope this information will be of some use to you.
