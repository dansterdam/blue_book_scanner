The text in the document is as follows:

"The Photographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors. Their observations of these bodies are greatly assisting in this work. It is desired to have the Greenwich time and point of appearance, course and disappearance of all meteors observed to determine their orbits and velocities. This information is of special importance as it may determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.
