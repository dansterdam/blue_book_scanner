SUBJECT: (Unclassified) UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
13 June 1954, under air police desk Sergeant's log, reflected that a 1/JD lawn R. MANLEY, AF-1447944O, a USAF air police squadron, sighted an unidentified flying object. The object appeared to be followed by two fighter aircraft. The control tower was notified. MANLEY was interviewed on 15 June 1954. He noticed a glowing light in the sky, northwest of Post 326, at approximately 9:00 o'clock. The object appeared nearly round in shape and remained in an aircraft's landing light. The object remained motionless for approximately 1 minute and then descended vertically at an extremely fast rate. It remained in the same position, and in color, changing to bright white, and disappeared abruptly. The entire sighting was approximately 4 to 5 minutes. MANLEY stated that he saw a circular white light, about the size of a quarter held at arm's length, and that it moved in a normal airline course. It was not sighted again.
