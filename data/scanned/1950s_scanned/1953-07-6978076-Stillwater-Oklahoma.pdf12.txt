The image appears to contain a photograph of some unidentified aerial phenomenon. The text describes two elliptical-shaped white lights that were observed, with the object able to be covered by the observer's thumb at arm's length. The object was reported to disappear and then return, possibly indicating a short trail. The lights were said to become dimmer and then brighter again, and appeared to be like a ceiling light from a long distance. No further details about the nature or identity of the object are provided.
