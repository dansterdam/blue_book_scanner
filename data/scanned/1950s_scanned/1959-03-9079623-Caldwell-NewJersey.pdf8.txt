Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 12 April 1959 concerning an unidentified flying object sighting at Caldwell, New Jersey on 29 March 1959.

Estimating the size and distance, the speed of the object would be approximately 900 knots, which is within the speed range of current jet aircraft.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center conclusion is that in all probability you witnessed aircraft flight.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
