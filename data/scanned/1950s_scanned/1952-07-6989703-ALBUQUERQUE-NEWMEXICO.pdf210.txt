In reply to your letter, AFOIN-ATLA-S, dated 2 October 1952, the following information has been obtained. Some of the information relating to this incident is given in your letter and this information is not repeated.
a. The unidentified flying object appeared on the GCT scope for a period of approximately twenty (20) minutes. The object was traveling at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet and was heading in a general direction of 330 degrees.
b. GCT reports the speed of the object at 550 miles per hour, and not 600 knots as was given in the original report from this section. According to the report from the intercepts, they increased their speed in order to close in on the object. The controller records that the object maintained its initial speed until the interceptor aircraft increased its speed, at which time the speed of the interceptor aircraft increased.
c. The operators were unable to measure the acceleration of the object.
d. The unidentified object and the pursuing F-94D appeared simultaneously on the GCT scope. The time and duration are not available.
e. The other two F-94D aircraft which were in the air at the time were unable to intercept the unidentified object due to the lack of information on these aircraft is available.
f. The unidentified object obtained the thirty (30) foot size and angle subtended was determined to be approximately seven (7) miles due to the limited information available.
