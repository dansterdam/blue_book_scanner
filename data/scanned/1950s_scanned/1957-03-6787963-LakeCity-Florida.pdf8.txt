OBJECT SEEN OVER TEXAS
HOUSTON, TEX., March 9 (AP) - Five residents of this city reported seeing an unidentified flying object in the sky over Houston this evening. The object, which played "cat-and-mouse" with another object said to be a plane, was described as circular, about 30 feet in diameter, and glowing with a whitish-green light. It was first sighted about 7 p.m. and was then seen playing a game of "tag" with the plane for about 20 minutes. Tex Johnston, a pilot who observed the objects, said the unidentified object seemed to be playing a game of speed and maneuverability with the plane. Hancock said he was convinced the object was under intelligent control. The object appeared and disappeared rapidly, then would zoom back into sight, changing direction swiftly.
