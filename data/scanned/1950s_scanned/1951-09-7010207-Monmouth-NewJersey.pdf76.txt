There are counter-indications that it is an attempt by these two officers to gain publicity in that the permission by the pilots to Edinworth were considered by the editor and it was suggested that the pilots were excited in describing something which they believed to exist from the sound of their voices. A ground track was established by reference to interrogation of a coast made by airborne by Lt. It is believed that the ground chart which he reported on that map is correct as the pilots considered it. No definite evidence was given as to whether the pilots are correct but only as they consider it. The map cross-section by observation from greater altitude against geographic points on the ground. Upper limited range could thereby be established. A size was reported 30 to 50 ft. in diameter is not a fixed or reliable value. It will admit a larger size even up to half dimensions. As to speed, they could not fix a value. They gave only their ground track against in about two minutes. This shape oblateness appeared the color silver. There were no more observations which we could offer the staff. At the time of this recording, conclusions are something as follows: From the interrogation of Lt.

Conclusion: That with an allowance for misinterpretation, the object makes good speeds greater than 500 mph. (b) The object cannot be fixed for size except within the lower limit.
