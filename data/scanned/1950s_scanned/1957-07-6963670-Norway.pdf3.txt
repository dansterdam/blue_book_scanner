The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a text description of a photograph, but there is no actual photograph visible in the image provided.

The text describes a photograph taken by an American tourist in Norway in August 1953. The description states that the photograph appears to show a large white, disk-shaped object hovering above the ground. The text goes on to explain the various details observed in the photograph, such as the reflection of the object in the landscape, the presence of smoke or steam, and the position of the person's hand and finger in relation to the object.

In August 1953 an American tourist in Norway snapped a picture of a dome on a cliff above the sea. It was observed some time later that the print showed a large white, disk-shaped object hovering above the ground. The print had been enlarged to show the contours better, and ATIC investigators, through comparison of the negative with the print, admitted that something was there, though they couldn't be sure what.

Through study of the negative, the investigators found that there were no mechanical or other defects in the camera itself, nor to the film, that could have accounted for the object. Further study of the terrain around the spot where the photograph was taken revealed nothing to account for the object. The investigators were baffled by the phenomenon, they could find no natural explanation for the object shown in the photograph.
