There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, containing text describing sightings of unidentified flying objects.

Further questioning of Flying Officer Miller on the sighting at 25/4/102 revealed that, in his opinion, the object was definitely a bright star. The object was sighted as being south-east of GANDER, Newfoundland at about that time. It makes it appear that Seybrrow had four unidentified plots at about that time on an object.

The report describes two different sightings, the first at 25/4/102 and the second at 26/4/102. The second sighting occurred in the vicinity of Glenwood, Newfoundland, where an operating detachment of RCAF Camp. A glow was observed in the sky and was identified by sol as something strange, but the clearing presumably occurred and the object was gone. The officials did not know if it had made such a clearing.

The report discusses the clearing with freshly broken and uprooted trees, which was used to guide the ground party back to the camp. It states that this could be due to the lack of knowledge of the area. The report recommends a low level search using infrared photos, as it is believed the clearing could have been caused by snow and bush conditions existing in the area. Further, the fact that Seybrrow had four unidentified plots at a height of 2000 feet about the time of the sighting is noted.

A map, scale 1:250,000, is included as "App 'B'" and shows the route of the search party and the route presumably taken by the sighting.

The report concludes by advising the Detachment Commander be advised of any further information required by the 72 ROAD Ground Observer Corps Detachment.
