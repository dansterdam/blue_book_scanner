and aircraft characteristics. It cannot really be considered a guided 
missile at all, in fact. It has wings, and, moreover, is designed to 
carry a pilot and to be recoverable, that is, landed, at the end of its 
mission. And yet its range is so great and its methods of operation 
so unusual, that many of its design features come within the ballistic 
missile category.

What Dr. Sanger theorized was a vehicle powered by a rocket 
engine of some one hundred tons thrust, to be about one hundred 
feet long, with a wingspan of seventy feet, a takeoff weight of 
approximately one hundred tons, a takeoff speed of around twelve 
hundred miles per hour, and capable of attaining an altitude of 
one hundred miles. Its maximum velocity would be about 15,000 miles 
per hour. Its range is so great as to carry it more than half 
way around the earth. To explain its operation and rather than 
trust my interpretation, let me put it in Dr. Sanger's own words. 
He says, "...the rocket-bomber ... climbs at full motor drive to 
a height of fifty to one hundred fifty kilometers. At the end of
