The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with a series of questions and handwritten responses.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. 

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Gradually disappeared over a period of about 25 seconds.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? What other characteristics, if any, would you want to emphasize?

The image also contains handwritten responses to the questions.
