Mrs. N.W. Grant Falls, Montana

I, N.W. Grant, was at home sight miles from the Grant Falls, being on duty at the B. of L. F. & E. office in Great Falls, Montana, when my attention was attracted to what appeared to me to be a formation of objects, maneuvering in the sky above the Grant Falls. These objects appeared to be round, and varying in size from approximately 25 to 50 feet in diameter. They seemed to be traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, and were bobbing, weaving, and darting back and forth. The objects were observed for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes, before they disappeared from sight.

The lights two were reddish in color, and appeared to be pulsating. All three seemed to disappear, just seemed to travel out of sight.
