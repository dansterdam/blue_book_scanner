Statement of: Mrs.       Bass and Transient Aircraft Section

At approximately 2130, 28 August 1952, while riding west on Duvall Street between Morton Bridges and Flightline Avenue, I saw two lighted objects. At first they failed to attract too much of my attention because they appeared to be perhaps a couple of lights on tip and of a large type aircraft. The objects were stationary, as lights do appear on an aircraft proceeding in same direction. However, the lights appeared larger than those ordinarily used on way tips. For approximately two minutes I looked steadily at the objects until they disappeared approximately at the objects until they disappeared approximately at the same speed and direction as they appeared. The appearance was as a light only - no coloring. They did not appear either oval or circular with the flat side together, but closed. When the objects moved they moved simultaneously. I did not see any exhaust or hear any noise that could have come from the strange objects.
