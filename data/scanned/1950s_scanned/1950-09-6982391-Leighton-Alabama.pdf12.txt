DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT AND INCIDENT

This report concerns a sighting of an unidentified object near Leighton, Alabama on September 6, 1950. The object was witnessed by several individuals, including the primary witness, Mr. Donald Leighton. 

At approximately 2:00 PM on the afternoon of September 6th, Mr. Leighton was outside his home when he noticed a bright silver or metallic object hovering in the sky at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. The object appeared to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and was emitting a humming or buzzing sound. 

After observing the object for several minutes, it suddenly accelerated at high speed and disappeared from view. Moments later, Mr. Leighton and others in the area reported hearing a loud explosion. An investigation was launched, and a search party was sent to the area where the object was last seen. 

Upon searching the wooded area, the search party discovered what appeared to be debris from a damaged object. Photographs were taken of the recovered debris, which showed a twisted and deformed metallic material. Samples of the debris were collected for further analysis.

The Air Force conducted an extensive investigation into this incident, but was unable to determine the origin or nature of the unidentified object. The case remained unresolved and was filed as an "unknown" in the Project Blue Book archives.
