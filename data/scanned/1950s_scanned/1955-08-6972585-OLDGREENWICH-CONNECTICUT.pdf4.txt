The image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, written in typewritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

ON THE EVENING OF AUGUST 6, 1955, AT APPROXIMATELY 8:40 PM, MRS. [REDACTED], A RESIDENT OF OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT, WITNESSED AN UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENON. MRS. [REDACTED] WAS SITTING IN HER LIVING ROOM WHEN SHE OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING ACROSS THE SKY FROM EAST TO WEST. SHE CALLED HER HUSBAND, MR. [REDACTED], WHO ALSO SAW THE OBJECT. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS BEING CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, WITH A GLOWING LIGHT AROUND THE PERIPHERY. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL AND WAS TRAVELLING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 MILES PER HOUR. THE OBJECT DID NOT LEAVE ANY VAPOR TRAIL AND MADE NO SOUND. IT CONTINUED ON A STRAIGHT COURSE ACROSS THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN THE WEST.
MRS. [REDACTED] STATED THAT SHE HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE AND THAT SHE WAS QUITE STARTLED BY THE EXPERIENCE. SHE CONTACTED THE AIR FORCE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SIGHTING TO REPORT THE INCIDENT. THE AIR FORCE SUBSEQUENTLY SENT REPRESENTATIVES TO INTERVIEW MRS. [REDACTED] AND INVESTIGATE THE CASE. ACCORDING TO MRS. [REDACTED], THE AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY EXPLANATION FOR THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD OBSERVED.
