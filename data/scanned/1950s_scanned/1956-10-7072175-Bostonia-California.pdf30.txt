    3. The case which is referenced in the attached letter is probably that
       which reportedly occurred in Bostonia, California, 19 Oct 56. Miss
       __________ ________, daughter of ___________ ________, while attempting
       to take a time exposure of the moon, allegedly inadvertently obtained a
       photograph of a UFO (attachment). The photograph was determined by FTD
       to be a double exposure, the two images being a time exposure of the
       moon and an exposure of a light fixture. Further evidence to support
       this conclusion is that if this was a fast-moving object as reported, it
       would show as a blurred streak on a time-exposed film. Further evidence 
       that this photo was faked is the fact that there are two traces of the 
       moon, indicating that the exposure of the light fixture occurred between
       two exposures of the moon.

     4. The USAF did not directly accuse Miss ________ of attempting to perpetuate
        a hoax, but she was notified by letter that the Air Force was aware that
        the picture was a double exposure and that there were other indications
        that the film had been tampered with.
