The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, a historical United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page discusses the Air Force's position on UFO sightings, the role of the Aerial Phenomena Investigation Office (APIO), and the procedures and policies for investigating UFO reports. It also mentions that Project "Blue Book" is still monitored by ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) and discusses the evaluation of UFO reports released to Headquarters USAF.

Transcription of the text found in the document:

In the opinion of this Center, the Air Force position in this matter should be firm and clear, as reflected in "Blue Book" Report Nr. 14 and the two APIO releases. However, care should be exercised not to place the Air Force in a position, where it may be misconstrued or misinterpreted, to be determining, by his individual's contemplated article in the "American Psychologist".

Reference ATIC report and case file, item 2 above.

The L4024 AISS is the prime UFO investigative organization. This organization includes both Air Defense Commands (see 7D messages in case file) conducted an investigation into this sighting. In view of fact that many agencies may be brought into play in any specific case, each unaware of the other's participation in the investigation, APIO is not well equipped to call or summon others to the APIO line was established.

Project "Blue Book" is still monitored by ATIC, but the name of the Project Officer is immaterial; as policy and high-level decisions do not originate with his office but with high level authority. The files, however, be sought for intelligence and investigative personnel, procedures and techniques. Certain data certain classified material. For example, a check into the reliability of a UFO observer and the circumstances surrounding his report may require certain highly classified information or documentary evidence related to the community are involved. The results of any authority given to specific persons to have access to these files is obvious.

The public and others have repeatedly misconstrued this as an indication of little the "real facts". 

This Center has no knowledge or any report concerning a UFO sighting by Senator Russell. Your attention is invited to a newspaper clipping, attached, in which Mr. Russell said that such a sighting had been made by someone in his office. This Air Force does not require comment. Any attempt to the effect that the Air Force has or can put such a restriction on any member of Congress does not require comment.

Project "Bear" is not known by this Center.

Evaluation of reports are released to Headquarters USAF in statistical form together with pertinent conclusions. The names of individuals, per se, are of little value, as factual, complete data is the objective. Any attempt to give a will result in tremendous task. In those few exceptions made, experience has shown that the conclusions given to the public and others have repeatedly misconstrued as an indication of little the "real facts".
