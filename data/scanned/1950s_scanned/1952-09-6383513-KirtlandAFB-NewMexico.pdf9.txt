This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report or document. The text on the page is redacted, so I cannot produce the full text output. However, I can describe the overall structure and formatting of the document:

The document is written in typewritten text and has the heading "FOR THE COMMANDING OFFICER" at the top. It lists 3 names, likely the report recipients, under the heading "TO:". There is a section of redacted text that appears to describe an incident or observation. The last line lists "C. E. RAINES, Captain, U.S.A.F." as the author of the document.
