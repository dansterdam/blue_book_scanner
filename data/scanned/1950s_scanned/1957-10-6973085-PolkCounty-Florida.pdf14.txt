SAFLL/Lt. Wilson/ph/Aal/23 OCT 57 - 
SAFLL

Dear Sir:

Reference your furnished to us with information concerning an unknown aerial object over Polk County, Florida, on 23 October 1957.

Details of this sighting of an unknown aerial object were obtained and analyzed by this Headquarters. The report of their findings is attached. The attached is considered as complete as possible under the circumstances.

On 5 May 1958, the Department of the Air Force declassification authority reviewed this case and determined that publication of reports on unidentified aerial objects, as in this case, may be made available to the public. On 23 October 1958, the Department of the Air Force further declassified this report and other reports of unidentified aerial objects.

It would seem from the information furnished that the Air Force has thoroughly investigated this matter and reports that there is a total lack of technical evidence that the object observed is other than a natural phenomena. There is a total lack of evidence that they are extraterrestrial devices.

There is a total lack of evidence that they are a threat to the security of the United States."
