WHEDON:
We require for investigation. Yet
... after the most careful study 
and analysis, we cannot fit it into
any of our regular categories. It
doesn't appear to have been a bal-
loon ... a plane of any kind ... 
nor does it fit the circumstances
of an astronomical phenomenon.
In view of this ... sufficient data
but no logical explanation ... we
classify it as a true "Unknown".
This doesn't happen often ... but
when it happens, we don't dodge
the issue. It's an "unknown" ...
and so listed.
EDWARDS:
Thanks Colonel Whedon.
WHEDON: 
Glad to have been able to be
here.
