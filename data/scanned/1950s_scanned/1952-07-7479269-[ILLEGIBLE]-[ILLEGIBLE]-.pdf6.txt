GENERAL SIGHTING.

DETAILED:
It appears that a large metallic, disc-shaped object was seen in the sky over the small town of Blythe, California on the evening of July 6, 1952. The object was first observed at approximately 7:30 PM, and was seen to hover, make sudden changes in direction, and then rapidly accelerate and disappear from view. The sighting lasted for approximately 15 minutes, and was observed by multiple witnesses.

FIRST SIGHTED: As stated, the object was first observed at around 7:30 PM on July 6, 1952 over Blythe, California.

DESCRIPTION: The object is described as a large, metallic, disc-shaped craft, estimated to be around 40-50 feet in diameter. It was completely silent and made no sound as it hovered and maneuvered in the sky.

MANEUVERS: The object was observed to hover in one position for a period of time, then suddenly accelerate and make abrupt changes in direction, at times appearing to "flip" or turn on its side. It then rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.

DURATION: The sighting lasted for approximately 15 minutes.

WITNESSES: The object was observed by multiple witnesses, including a [REDACTED] and an [REDACTED]. Their names and contact information have been redacted from this document.

CONCLUSION: This sighting appears to be a genuine and unexplained observation of a highly advanced, unconventional aircraft operating over Blythe, California on the evening of July 6, 1952. The witnesses' descriptions and the object's observed behaviors suggest this was not a conventional aircraft or any known aerial vehicle.
