The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be an Air Force Technical Information Sheet that includes a written description of a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

The text in the document is as follows:

I was sun bathing and stretched out on an Army cot looking straight up (90Â°) in bright sunlight, but with the sun well out of my vision to the rear (South) thus, looking down or to the horizon I was looking directly North. The object was traveling from South to North and on first catching it in view I immediately brought it to the attention of my wife who looked up and we then both watched it disappear most rapidly to the horizon. But for its fantastic speed the object could very well been a balloon.
