Text Extracted from the Document:

The second incident was reported to the Reporting Officer by a civilian, who observed that a light, in the mining concern, 1st floor, Lima (a mining concern), was observed for a period of two hours. The witness, a guest, stated that the object was a balloon, although the mining concern has been investigated and this object has definitely been identified as a meteorological balloon.

This object has also been observed for a period of time at Cajamarce, during night time observations by a weather station high in the mountains between Cajamarce and Huacarape.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer: Since the advent of Sputnik, I believe there has been a tendency of hysteria concerning aerial objects. An attempt is being made to not accuse individuals merely on the statements of eyewitnesses.
