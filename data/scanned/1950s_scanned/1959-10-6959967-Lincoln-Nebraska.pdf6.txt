This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the Department of the Air Force, Star Message Division, titled "INCOMING". The document describes an incident where a son was studying astronomy and had been pointing out the stars to his parents. The object they observed made sharp turns and appeared to be traveling much faster than jets. The observers watched the object from a high altitude, and the preparing officer could not explain the sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:
