The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a UFO sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

"Object first appeared at approximately 8 o'clock."
"It seemed down twilight (in the darker portion of the sky) all during my observation."
"I tried practically every maneuver I knew of to get it into the twilight and obtain a silhouette, if possible. I tried changing my heading and altitude with negative results."
"At one time, I chopped the throttle, put gear and flaps down in hopes that it would pass by. I was down to 100 - 120 RPM, but the damn thing acted like there was a pilot out there."
"When I slowed down all of a sudden, he gave a little surge at first, came practically parallel with me, and then maintained the same speed as I did off off my right wing."
"It seemed to be a regular fighter turns into the object, but at all times it stayed with me. However, when I resumed my headings toward Dayton, sometimes he would be on my left and sometimes he was on my right."
"During most of the turns, it remained at an 8 o'clock position."
"It seemed to be slightly above me at all times."
"Estimated distance from observer - "It's very hard to tell but I guess he was anywhere from 1000 to 1800 feet from me."
"Both the size and intensity were very similar to an aircraft taillight."
