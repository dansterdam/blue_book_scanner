Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR output:

These data then would be used to demonstrate the need for initiating a study of the phenomena. On 21 February 1950, an observation outlook post was set up at Holloman Air Force Base manned by two personnel. Observations with theodolites, telescopes and cameras were undertaken between the hours of sunrise and sunset.

On 5 March 1950 a conference was held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base which included Holloman Air Force Base and GRI personnel. Action was taken to initiate a three-point program which was confirmed by ACS in the form of a letter directive on 16 March 1950, subject "Light Phenomena".

a. Askania instrument triangulation by Land-Air Inc.
b. Observations with Mitchell camera using spectrum analysis by Holloman Air Force Base personnel.
c. Electromagnetic frequency measurements using Signal Corps Engineering Laboratory equipment.

Under contract to GRI, Land-Air Inc. was required to maintain constant watch at two Askania stations for a six-month period. Since an abnormal number of reports had been received from Vaughn, New Mexico, it was decided to install the instrumentation at Vaughn.
