FINAL EVALUATION

On 18 November 1954, T/Sgt. Drepperd called Lt. Cmdr Ross, Office of Naval Research, relative to the UFO's observed over the Kentucky Tennessee area. Cmdr Ross stated he wasn't sure if the UFO's could have been the Navy's research balloons. He informed Sgt Drepperd he would check and call him back.

On 22 Nov 54, T/Sgt Drepperd received a call from Mr. M.W. Keith ONR Resident Representative at the University of Minnesota. Mr. Keith stated that on 12 & 13 Nov 54, two (2) balloons were launched from the University of Minnesota. The payloads came down; one (1) over Danville, Kentucky, the other over Carlisle, Kentucky. Mr. Keith further stated that he believed the UFO's in question could very possibly have been these balloons.

Due to all available information from observers, which basically compares to those descriptive characteristics of a balloon in flight, and since there were two (2) research balloons in the same area at the time of the sightings, the UFO's observed were high altitude research balloons.
