SUBJECT: UFO Photographs Submitted by FBI on Miss ----
         Bostonia, California

To: Director of Special Investigations
    Headquarters USAF
    Washington 25, D. C.

1. Attached is a draft of a proposed letter to be forwarded
by your office to subject person, reflecting the results of an
analysis made by this Center on photographs originally submitted
to your organization by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Re-
ference letter from 460th District, Chula AFB, California,
dated 8 June 1956, a copy which was forwarded to this Center with
enlargements of the original prints.

2. Subject photography is highly suggestive of a hoax; how-
ever, this should not imply that the attempted hoax was necessarily
perpetrated by subject person.

3. Experience has shown that incidents of this type are often
publicized, with allegations and statements detrimental to the Air
Force, when explanations are not given to sources submitting photo-
graphy. It is, therefore, the general policy of this Center, where
possible, to provide a brief summary of our analysis to such indi-
viduals.
