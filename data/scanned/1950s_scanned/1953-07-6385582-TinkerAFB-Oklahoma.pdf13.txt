The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document or report from Project Blue Book, detailing an observation of an unidentified flying object.

Text from the document:

I saw the object at 1930 hours and observed it for 20 minutes.
The object appeared to be high-powered and traveling at high speed. I was standing still. I did not use field glasses or binoculars.
When I saw the object, it was at 270°7' azimuth and 59° elevation. The object appeared to be about 4,500 feet high.
The object has been reported on the ground from Tinker Air Force Base for eleven (11) years.
The weather was very clear and calm. The wind was approximately 15 to 20 mph from the south southeast. Around 1900 hours, the weather conditions changed in approximately 2 minutes.
I did not take any photographs and did not obtain any negatives.
After 15 to 20 minutes, the object disappeared in a very high, fast climb toward the west about 1-1/2 minutes.
The object appeared to have a bright glow and it remained on at all times. The color of the object was white, similar to chrome at any time.
