UNIDENTIFIED

Regarding Unidentified Objects on the Moon

ACTO-49

FROM: ACIN-4D

COMMENT NO. 4

1. This report is in compliance to a request by Col. Glasser of ACIN-4D dated 6 December 1958.

2. The subject photographs comprise three (3) groups pertaining to (1) an unidentified flying object or objects with large opening(s) or light(s) touching its image, and (2) photographs (of 35 mm film) showing several exposures of the moon.

3. These photographs and the photographic analysis prepared in order to arrive at a realistic interpretation. The analysis and interpretation phases were conducted by photo analysts for ACIN-4D. The analysis was not obtained elsewhere and relates solely to the examination of the photographs and from past experience with the problems of photography. There is no other information or evidence but the photographs.

4. In review (1) the unidentified objects giving indications of a change in appearance or shape are but small change in size, open and having a plastic body. This is evidenced by the transparency around the outlines.

5. In group (2) the interest is centered around a copy photograph of 35 mm film of a curious "spray" of diffused lights on which 5 irregular objects appear to be transparent and luminous. The photographic quality is poor and precise details of the objects cannot be concluded. The five objects in view of the moon appear to be transparent and luminous.

6. In group (3) the interest is centered around a copy photograph of the moon under different lighting conditions. The photograph could indicate some unknown reflectivity which leaves a somewhat cloudy or irregular halo around the moon's edge.
