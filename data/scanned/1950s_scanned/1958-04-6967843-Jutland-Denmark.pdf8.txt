UAF/C - 21 APRIL. NO CASE - INFO ONLY

27 June 1958

Dear Sgt. █████,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 23 May 1958 concerning unidentified flying object sightings of 1st and 2nd April 1958 at Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Neither of these two sightings were forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for evaluation and we have no record of these two sightings.

There are no restrictions covering your use of these sightings. Therefore, you are free to submit these to any organization you choose for analysis or evaluation and you may publish an account of these sightings if you desire.

For your information, I am inclosing the latest Department of Defense Fact Sheet on the subject of unidentified flying objects which denies the existence of any authenticated evidence to substantiate the existence of the popularly termed "flying saucers."

Sincerely yours,

LAWRENCE J. █████
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
