The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with points A and B marked on it. This sketch asks the viewer to imagine being at the point shown and placing an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second sketch shows a larger panoramic view, with a person standing in the foreground and various buildings and landscape features in the background. There is also a smaller inset sketch in the bottom right corner that appears to be a simplified or abstracted version of the larger panoramic view.

Regarding the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
