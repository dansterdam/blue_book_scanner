PLACE: Near Kyushu, Japan

DATE/TIME: 9 October 1952 / 2300-2345Z

OBSERVERS: 1) USAF Personnel on duty in Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (at Itazuke AB)

1. AT APPROXIMATELY 2300 GCT, 9 OCTOBER 1952, PERSONNEL ON DUTY IN THE 12th FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON AT ITAZUKE AB OBSERVED SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS IN THE SKY NORTH OF ITAZUKE. THE OBJECTS WERE FIRST NOTICED IN THE NORTHEAST ABOUT 30 TO 40 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND WERE MANEUVERING IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AS VIEWED FROM THE GROUND STATION. 

2. THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE ROUND OR OVAL IN SHAPE, LUMINOUS, AND APPROXIMATELY THE APPARENT SIZE OF A SILVER DOLLAR HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. THEY MOVED IN AN ERRATIC MANNER, CHANGING SPEED AND DIRECTION VERY RAPIDLY. SOMETIMES THEY WOULD HOVER, THEN DART OFF IN A ZIGZAGGING FASHION AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEEDS. AT ONE POINT, TWO OF THE OBJECTS CONVERGED AND APPEARED TO MERGE, THEN SEPARATED AGAIN.

3. THE SIGHTING LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES. TOWARD THE END OF THE SIGHTING, THE NUMBER OF OBJECTS INCREASED TO SEVEN OR EIGHT. THERE WERE NO SOUND OR EXHAUST TRAILS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECTS.

4. THE WEATHER AT THE TIME WAS CLEAR, WITH GOOD VISIBILITY. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED VISUALLY AND ALSO ON RADAR. IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SIGNIFICANCE TO THIS SIGHTING. THE REPORT HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO HIGHER HEADQUARTERS.
