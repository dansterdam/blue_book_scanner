WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP BREAK THROUGH THE SECRECY ON THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OR FLYING SAUCERS

It is known that Radar Reports and other data on UFO's (Unidentified Flying Objects) or Flying Saucers is under the wraps of secrecy in the military. All information is collected but the public is kept in the dark on this vital subject. What information is released is distorted and misleading. Why should this be so, asks the alert, intelligent american who prays THE NOB for all of this. There is a rising demand for the Citizens RIGHT TO KNOW about all of the hidden facts and rightly so. A Constitutional Democrcy cannot endure without an informed electorate.
                        THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO
1. Write intelligent letters to YOUR STATE SENATORS & CONGRESSMEN -- also your UNITED STATES SENATORS & CONGRESSMEN. Ask for a free flow of information on this subject. Ask them to act as your elected Representatives in this matter to see to certain that this information reaches the public.
2. Tell them about local interests, local sightings of UFO’S, photos, Clubs & activities.
3. Ask that a civilian board be appointed to collect this information and give it to the public. Let the people evaluate these reports and this information. It belongs to the people.
4. Ask for an investigation by: the Armed Services Committee -- Sen. Richard B. Russell, Ga., Chairman. Senate Committee on Gov't Operations, Sen. John L. McClellan, Ark., Ch. House Committee on Gov't Operations, Congressman John E. Moss, Chairman. Govt Appropriations, Sen. Carl Hayden, Ariz., Chairman. (Senate) Gov’t Appropriations, Sen. Clarence Cannon, Ho., Chairman (House)

If the right committee for the job (Intercpnsarency Study) does not exist, ask that immediate steps be taken to accomplish this. MAJOR WINGER S. HILL Washington 8aucer Intelligence, P.0. Box 815, Washington 4,D.C. has been going to Senators, office and evory Congressman’s office on this subject, and is continuing his work on Capitol Hill, until results are obtained. He has been told by government officials in the Sonata and House that there is NO COMMITTEE IN EXISTENCE that's qualified for this specific assignment. Interplanetary Research is unique and new to our time. It is time for action to correct this weakness. How else can we enter the Age of Space 7
5. It is time for us to face the issue squarely. The time has come for fortnight answers. Let us end the doubletalk and evasion.
6. Request a REPLY

If America is to enter the SPACE AGE with honor, let us face up to the responsibilities of the Space Age. Let us -- rather than attempt to conquer space -- begin to UNDERSTAND Spece. With this approach -- we too can become SPACE Travelers
