When tractor pilot attempted rendezvous, lights immediately took off and disappeared at terrific speed, 1.e. out of sight in 2-3 mlns. When lights disappeared, tractor pilot observed that several aircraft which had been in the vicinity had also disappeared. As soon as lights disappeared, tractor pilot reported incident to Richardson Army Air Field tower. Tower confirmed observation of lights. Aircraft from Richardson airfleld were immediately scrambled to investigate but no contact was made. Incident caused considerable local interest and excitement due to meteor.
