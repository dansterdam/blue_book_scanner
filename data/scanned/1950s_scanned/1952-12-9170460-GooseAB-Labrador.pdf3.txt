AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

Dir/Int, MEAC                                           REPORT NO.
                                                                IR-65-52 

1. The following information was furnished by the Commanding Officer, Goose 
Air Base, Labrador on the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

2. On 26 November 1952 at 2152Z, an unidentified flying object was sighted 
by an F-9F-8 pilot assigned to the 59^th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron stationed at 
Goose Air Base while in aerial flight in the immediate Goose Air Base area.

3. The object was first observed by both the pilot and radar observer of 
the F-9F-8 over Goose Air Base, then it followed a course of 195^0 for approximately 
40 miles. The altitude of the object varied from 1500 to 12,000 feet; estimated 
speed: 250 to 425 knots, with a general direction of flight between South and 
Southeast. No definite shape or size was noted by observing aircraft. Color 
reported as bright orange-red with light blue-green. No jet or rocket exhausts 
were noted; no sound was heard; and the manner of propulsion was unknown. Object 
displayed excellent maneuvering as it followed friendly aircraft in steep banks 
and turns, always maintaining the same relative distance from aircraft; speeds
were synchronized until object disappeared at 2211Z.

COMMENTS OF Preparing Officer:

1. Intercept was attempted by F-94B aircrfat but object maintained same 
relative distance. At this time of the year, "Northern Lights" and other 
phenomena peculiar to the Arctic and Sub-Arctic are prevalent which seems to 
substantiate the reason why the friendly aircraft could not close any distance 
with the object despite violent maneuvering. 

2. Weather conditions encompassing the sighting period was CAVU; wind From 
NW 315^0 at 15 to 20 knots.

3. There was no activity, meteorological or otherwise, which might account 
for the sighting.

4. Other aircraft in the area during the sighting period were C-124, DC-3, 
and Canadian Noftjstar. Pilot of the F-94B stated he observed and identified the 
above aircraft at one time or another.

5. Pilot is an experienced combat pilot with 1800 hours total time, of which 
650 hours is jet time.
