STATEMENT OF LT M. FOSTER - 7 AUGUST 

At 2020 I was flying in a heading of 110 degrees. I remarked to the other pilot who had seen the same thing. The object appeared to be traveling at a tremendous speed. We turned to the bearing and it was traveling. Our speed was increased to approximately 180 knots. The light gray air was extremely clear. We started to close the range but as we did so the object ahead of us started increasing its speed. We tried to close the range further but it was impossible. The object then departed on a bearing of approximately 135 degrees. The object was then moving at an extremely high rate of speed.
