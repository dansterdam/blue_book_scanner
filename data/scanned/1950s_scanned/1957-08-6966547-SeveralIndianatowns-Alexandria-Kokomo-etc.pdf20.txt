BLUFDA, Indiana
August 21, 1957

TO: RECORD AIR FORCE

This report is a copy of a report I made on this date.

On 12 August 1957, at about 2315 hours, I was in the yard in back of my home, when I observed a bright light cross the sky from the northeast to the northwest at a high rate of speed. The light was so bright that it illuminated the area for a moment. After observing the light for a few seconds, I went into the house and told my wife that I had just seen a flying object of some kind. I do not know what it was, but it was not an aircraft of any kind that I am familiar with. It was not the usual type of aircraft with running lights, etc. This light was a single, extremely bright light that streaked across the sky. It appeared to be high, but I do not know its exact altitude. I am submitting this report on the incident.

Respectfully,
