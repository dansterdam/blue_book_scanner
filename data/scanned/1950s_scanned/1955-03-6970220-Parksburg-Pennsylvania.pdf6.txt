The text from the document is as follows:

DATE: 5 March 1955
LOCATION: Parkersburg, Pa.
TYPE OF SIGHTING: Ground-Visual
DURATION: Approx. 60 min
COMMENTS: A limited follow-up investigation by Allen E. Hynek, revised that the object firing over the period the 5th or 6th of March 1955 continued for approximately (1) hour. This complies with the conclusion in the reports submitted that he thought the flashes and bursts were approx. over Parkersburg lasting the conclusion that he did see the slow mentioned artillery type firing over Aberdeen Proving Grounds.
