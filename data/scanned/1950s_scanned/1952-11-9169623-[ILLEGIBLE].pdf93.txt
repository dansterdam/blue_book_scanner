Summary of Unidentified Aerial Object
1. The object was first observed by the Pilot and Co-Pilot at an altitude estimated at around 10,000 feet. They had been cruising at 330 knots at 10,000 feet. After observing the object, they began a gradual descent and the object followed them in a parallel course. They observed the object for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
2. The object was described as being circular in shape, silver in color, and approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. It appeared to be flying faster than the aircraft which was then cruising at 330 knots. It appeared to have no visible means of propulsion and made no sound.
3. The object was observed to make a very tight turn, estimated at a radius of 500-700 feet, at a speed which would be impossible for any known aircraft. This maneuver was repeated several times during the sighting. The pilots stated that the object appeared to be under intelligent control.
4. During the entire period of observation, the object maintained a parallel course with the aircraft, never deviating more than 2-3 miles from the aircraft. At one point, the object crossed directly in front of the aircraft at a distance estimated to be only 1/2 mile.
5. The appearance and disappearance of the object was abrupt, with no discernible means of propulsion. It simply appeared and disappeared, accelerating and decelerating at a rate of speed that would be impossible for any known aircraft.
6. This sighting is considered to be authentic and the pilots are completely reliable. They are highly experienced and this was their first experience with such a phenomenon. They were greatly impressed by what they saw and felt that it was definitely an unidentified flying object under intelligent control.
