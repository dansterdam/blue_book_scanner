From the aircraft was not known, definite attitude cannot be ascertained, however, initial sighting on the object definitely apparent at 0745A MST. The object was ovoid in shape, emitting a bright bluish-white light on the end. At the time of the observation, the aircraft was a heading of approximately 290 degrees, the object traveling in a southwesterly direction.

The Captain of the Alaskan Air Lines, coming from the opposite direction, also sighted the object, having flown in this territory for over six to seven years, and are considered to be very reliable observers. The object was observed for several minutes, varying in size, color, and shape. During the interview, detailed sightings of several years-ago sightings, made by the pilots were discussed. The Captain who was sitting in the aisle of the aircraft was amazed at the size of the object, and the pilots and co-pilots hands shaking as they watched the object.

(A) Anything else regarding that sighting could not be determined.

(B) At the present time, no conditions, such as meteorological or astronomical, could be ascertained for this information, and if an affirmative answer is found, this information will be forwarded in a separate supplement.

(C) No physical evidence is available.

(D) No interception or identification action was taken, either by the aircraft or by any other units, inasmuch as this sighting did not indicate the aircraft or the object were in danger.

(E) Pilot called Ladd Tower immediately after the sighting and reported information regarding only other aircraft in the vicinity. The information received from Ladd Tower was given a negative response.
