Eyewitness account
Dec 15th (or 16) 1956
From Bay Valley is a  radio mathematician flying a  route 29 between Washington D.C. and Philadelphia when a strange incident occurred. At 7:30 PM, the man saw a large, round, bright light stationary in the sky. It had the appearance of a big bright star and was roughly the size of a grapefruit held at arm's length. The light remained stationary for about 5-10 minutes, then suddenly appeared to dart rapidly upwards at a steep angle, disappearing from view in about 3-4 seconds. The witness was amazed by the sudden and rapid movement of the light. He could not determine its nature or origin, but stated that it was definitely not an aircraft, meteor, or any other known object in the sky. The witness was a competent and reliable observer, and his report was considered of sufficient interest to be included in Project Blue Book records.
