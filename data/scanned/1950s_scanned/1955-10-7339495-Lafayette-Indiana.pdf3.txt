Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir

A few years ago I saw an object near my home that looked like a parachute, I ran toward where I thought it would land. But then it started going up, and then started toward me, tumbling as it came. It stopped almost right above me, and then started going to its right very slowly. I could run and keep up with it, but then all of a sudden it shot up toward the sun, and that was the last I saw of it. 

The reason I wrote so late is that I did not know who to tell this to until I saw this address in the book "Secrets of Space Flight".
