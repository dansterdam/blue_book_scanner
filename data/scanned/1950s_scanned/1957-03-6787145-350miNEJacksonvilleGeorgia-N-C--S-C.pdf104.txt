Yes, I was a passenger on that fateful plane. I and would be willing to say that no one saw anything. It had been raining when we left N.Y.C. and this was 3:30 N.Y. city time. The plane was darkened and we were all asleep. When this terrible lurch took place, everything on the plane (our luggage rack) was thrown & hit my head on the rack above. No one bothered to announce anything or explain anything. There was a general feeling of panic on the plane. When the individual lights went out, one, one at a time - some were donning their life jackets.

I felt the plane was out of control - when one hostess rushed by I asked her & she didn't know (she said) & never explained further. After a good 10 min. an announcement was made: "I thought I saw another plane in my path & swerved to avoid it." By then no one had any confidence in that plane or pilots. No one offered any further apologies or explanation when we left the plane & no one slept all nite. I was thoroughly disgusted.

One engine gave out half way. This was announced after a passenger noticed it. The "body of the hostess" lying in the aisle was a dismal sight believe met.
