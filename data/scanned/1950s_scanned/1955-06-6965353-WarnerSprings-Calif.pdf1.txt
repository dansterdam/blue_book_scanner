10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) object, silver, large, elleptical in shape, appeared to be gliding or floating at a constant altitude, appeared to the observer for a period of twelve (12) minutes. The object appeared to have a gradual buildup on the speed and then a gradual leveling off of the speed. The winds and the length of sighting seem to bear out the theory of "probably balloon".
