SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (Report No. MCXXI-62)

1. The reported slow movement of the object seen by Mr. rules out an aircraft or balloon. An astronomical plot was made and it was determined that the full moon was in the location reported for the object.

2. Due to the lateness of the report, a weather report for the area cannot be obtained. However, it is felt that the visual was looking at the moon through a haze layer which was not readily apparent.
