There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. It appears to be a typed page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text describing an investigation of observations made on June 19, 1953 in Key West, Florida.

Summary of Investigation of Observations, 19 June 1953, Key West, Fla.

Interrogated Mr. & Mrs. They talked a great deal, not waiting for questions to be put to them.

Mr. X, a deliberatelyBrcareless, highly sophisticated individual of 54, was extremely close-mouthed. He considered himself full-length upon the couch and pouring himself out, not less than 5 minutes, giving himself the opinion of observers; in fact, he states he can see stars in the daytime. As he reached over to reach his flas who could not believe him. The character of the observers is, I believe, relevant to the interpretation of the observations.

The observers reconstructed the incident; namely, that they, along with a medico-lfitimatey, had been fishing off Key West. 19 June 53. The time was at twilight, everything was still, no clouds at all, except suddenly, a dull, aluminum-colored object appeared in the sky. He studied it for a few seconds and said, "It's a disk out of range". He watched it slowly disappear in the direction of the north.

It descended to an estimated altitude of 12-14,000 feet, the speed would have been 3,400 mph and the rise of the object 600 feet.

Evaluation:
1. The incident took place within 2 minutes of sunset.
2. We can saw the moon at the same time. However, on 19 June, the moon was at 1st quarter, putting it near the meridian at sunset - almost exactly the complement of the described orientation: that the moon was not a factor.

Now, how could anyone be able to see Polaris, a 2nd magnitude star, in very bright twilight, and yet fail to see a quarter moon, which, as they had been facing south, must have been looking them square in the face?
