on an unusual sighting of a few seconds duration, it should not be
dismissed.
When a sighting has covered just a few seconds, the incident,
when followed-up in the past, has almost always proved to be a meteor or
a gross mis-identification of a common object owing to lack of time in
which to observe.
2. Number of Persons Reporting the Sighting
Short duration sightings by single individuals are seldom worthy
of follow-up.
Two or three competent independent observations carry the weight
of 10 or more simultaneous individual observations. As an example, 25
people at one spot may observe a strange light in the sky. This,
however, has less weight than two reliable people observing the same
light from different locations. In the latter case a position-fix is
indicated.
3. Distance from Location of Sighting to Nearest Field Unit
Reports which meet the preliminary criterion stated above should
all be investigated if their occurrence is in the immediate operating
vicinity of the squadron concerned.
For reports involving greater distances, follow-up necessity
might be judged as being inversely proportional to the square of the
distances concerned. For example, an occurrence 150 miles away might
be considered to have four times the importance (other things being equal)
than one that is 300 miles away.
