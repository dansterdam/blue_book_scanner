"SIGHTING: The reporting was about a sighting to some to our attention in a town called Sheffield Lake, Ohio, that occurred on Sept 10. According to the local newspapers, a number of residents watched a flying object at very close range for more than five minutes. Mrs. Pauline Phillips had roused her from her bed, she was awakened by a flickering light. She looked out of her second-floor window and saw a strange, glowing object that appeared to be about a foot above her neighbor's driveway. It was circular in shape and the interior of the object emitted a bluish-gray purplish smoke. it seems there were in a hurry to move form lawn, and rose to about several feet. The object then made a downward motion, made circular maneuvers, and shot straight up at a fantastic speed. The two girls, a husband and daughter, were steadily watching the next door room. The object made a swooping motion and seemed to shake and tremble as it approached the house. The report shows the sighting satisfied the object to the facts,and if this is typical of their investigation procedures, it is not easy to see how they are now convinced over 952 of sightings.
