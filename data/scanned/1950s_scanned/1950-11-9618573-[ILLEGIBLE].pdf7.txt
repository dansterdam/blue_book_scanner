The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) in the 1950s. The page contains a detailed map or chart, but there is no photograph present.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:
