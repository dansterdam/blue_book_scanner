MOUNT VERNON, N. Y.

Aug. 6, 1952

Dear Sir,

On August 6, 1952, at approximately 11:15 p.m., I observed a peculiar light in the southern sky, over the Bronx, New York. At first it appeared to be a star, but as I watched, it seemed to move erratically and change in size and color.

After observing it for about 15 minutes, I decided to try to take a photograph of it. I used a Kodak Brownie camera, No. 2A, with a snapshot lens. The exposure was about 1/25th of a second at f/16, with the camera on a tripod.

The resulting photograph, which I am enclosing, shows four distinct objects, not one as I had observed. They appear to be small, round and dark in color. I cannot account for the multiple images.

I would appreciate your comments on this photograph and my observations. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely yours,

/s/ Name Withheld
