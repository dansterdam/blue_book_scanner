Lt. USAF Air Traffic Squadron
I. Lt. USAF as approximately 1500 MST heard over the long line telephone the first report from a ground observer concerning a bright light that was over the area of Albuquerque, New Mexico. All is a report by a Jerald Baker, who was on the field observing with his station wagon light that was to be checked - a spot light on checking the car and a white light that the observer has shown down on the ground, and when the observer looked up he saw an extremely bright light at about the same rate of the station wagon light that was down on the ground. The observer immediately went on the phone to report this to the Control Tower at Kirtland Air Force Base. The observer examined the light for a period of approximately 2 or 3 minutes. The light remained stationary and did not move. At the end of 2 or 3 minutes the light suddenly went out. The light at the time of disappearance was as bright as the station wagon light that the observer had on the ground, and the observer stated that the sky was exceptionally clear. I went out myself and my car I was within the next few minutes. They had no apparent depth as far as I could tell. One appeared as though it were in front of me and one appeared as though it were behind me, but I could not actually determine the depth, so I'm not quite sure whether the appeared in front of me or behind me as I looked at them. They just appeared as lights and the way I saw it was as though they were stationary and the car that I was in was moving between them. The lights had no apparent size - they were just small points of light and did not appear to change in size or shape while I observed them. They were there for a very short period of time and then suddenly disappeared.
