There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which includes a sketch and instructions for the witness to provide information about the observed object.

The text found in the document is as follows:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

(Overhead diagram showing horizon and the observer's position)

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path and a "B" at the end of its path.

Very like a descending arc, starting rapid and ending a slow motion

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
