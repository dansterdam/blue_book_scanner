The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "80505 EST" and an object above the horizon line labeled "0.307 EST". The second sketch shows a person standing on a road with buildings and trees in the background. The third sketch shows a silhouetted landscape with a tree or other object in the foreground.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" on the position the object was in when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where you last saw it. It is a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
