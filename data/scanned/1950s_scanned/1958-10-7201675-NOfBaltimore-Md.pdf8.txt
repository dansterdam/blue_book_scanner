Mr. ______ No, I can’t recall any maneuvers as such as it rose.

Mr. ______ We call it hovering, like it might have been caught in the wind. It might have moved a little bit as it was hovering over the bridge, that could have been a maneuver, we are not sure.

Q. You say you were out for a drive and not on a fishing trip, is that correct?

A. Mr. ______ Yes, the paper reported this from the police report. We happened to be riding, we weren’t fishing, I never fished in my life.

Q. What was the approximate distance from the bridge where your electrical system in the car failed?

A. Mr. ______ It was approximately 75 to 80 feet away from the bridge not from the object, which was about 75 to 100 or so feet above the bridge.

Q. You did not make any attempt after you got out of the car to approach the object.

A. Mr. ______ No, through fear we decided, I mean, we decided to put the car between us and the object.

Mr. ______ To the contrary, if there had been anywhere to hide our persons I feel most assuredly we would have hidden ourselves.

Q. Mr. ______, were you treated for any burns on the face?

A. Mr. ______ At the hospital I was given, as ______ puts it, a cursory examination, a very superficial one. Mr. ______’s face was noticeably red, mine wasn’t. He didn’t examine us but this police sergeant, as I told you, told us we didn’t have anything to worry about as far as radioactive burns. The doctor seemed very limited on knowledge about what was happening. He took our pressure but it was a very limited examination to say the least.

Q. Would you give the name of the hospital and the doctor, if you can remember, and the address of the hospital?

A. Mr. ______ The hospital was St. Joseph’s on North Caroline Street. The doctor’s name, it was an intern, I can’t tell you his name…

Mr. ______ His first name was ______

Mr. ______ That would be enough to get in touch with him if you would like to, his first name I remember definitely was Mario.

Mr. ______ Well, it was 12 o’clock at night, the police sergeant and lieutenant who came down, by the way, we don’t know their names either, I am sure that it can be verified or checked very easily.
