INVESTIGATOR'S SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT (INITIAL)

INCIDENTS OF I5 JULY 1953 
23 JULY 1953
FOREST CITY, ARKANSAS 

IAD CASE NO.-B331 
AIRFORCE NO. 3-0028

BASE PERSONNEL OBSERVED 

The observers were some of the military personnel stationed at this communication facility in Forest City, Arkansas. The times of observations were about 12:00 noon and 2130 on 15 July 1953.

AT ABOUT 12:00 NOON ON 15 JULY 1953 THE OBSERVER, WHOSE NAME IS OMITTED HERE, OBSERVED SOME STRANGE AERIAL OBJECTS IN THE SKY OVER THE FIELD ADJACENT TO THE FACILITY. HE STATES THAT HE NOTICED SEVERAL OBJECTS MANEUVERING AT HIGH SPEEDS AND MAKING VERY SHARP TURNS. HIS OBSERVATION LASTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES. THIS OBSERVER REPORTS THAT NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE OBJECTS.

AT ABOUT 2130 ON 15 JULY 1953 ANOTHER OBSERVER, WHOSE NAME IS ALSO OMITTED HERE, OBSERVED TWO STRANGE AERIAL OBJECTS OVER THE SAME FIELD AREA. HE STATES THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE VERY BRIGHT AND APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN THE SKY. AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF OBSERVATION, THE OBJECTS BEGAN MOVING AWAY TO THE EAST AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED, AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND THE WIND WAS VERY LOW DURING BOTH OBSERVATION PERIODS.

COMMENTS: IT IS THE CONSIDERED OPINION OF THIS INVESTIGATOR THAT THE OBJECTS OBSERVED IN THIS INCIDENT COULD POSSIBLY BE IDENTIFIED AS SOME TYPE OF KNOWN AERIAL VEHICLE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF DEFINITE INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR IDENTITY AND CAPABILITIES, OFFICIAL IDENTIFICATION CANNOT BE MADE AT THIS TIME.

THE FINDINGS OF THIS REPORT IS TO BE USED BY THE AIR FORCE IN CONTINUING THE "FLYING SAUCER" INVESTIGATION.
