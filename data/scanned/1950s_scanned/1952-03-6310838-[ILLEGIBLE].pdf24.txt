Recommendations
It is recommended that Corbin be questioned with Corbin present because he appears thoroughly frightened, appears not to want to discuss the incident with anyone but Corbin. Corbin can be trusted to keep any investigation a secret.

Riviera Beach, Fla.
Witnesses claim to have seen a great airborne disk about 50 ft. in diameter between 10 and 11 p.m. Saturday, April 19, "over Story Creek Bridge". Disk had luminescent edges and gave off an unsteady luminous green exhaust. Disk was seen about 200 ft. in the air and took off "with the speed exceeding that of a jet plane toward Annandale."

Comment
I will try to find these witnesses and question. Reported to be angry because neighbors laughed at story.
