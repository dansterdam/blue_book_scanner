ATTN: Ltr DATE 3 JAN 1981 COMMENT NO. 1

l. Reference is made to the attached letter.

2. The brief period of radar (weak signal) target detection, immediately follow— ing reports of visual sighting of an aircraft over the Northeast end of the restricted 
area, is not sufficient to provide an evaluation. It is noted that radar targets were not detected until after visual sightings were reported. This could indicate that 
radar operators were not doing a good job prior to receipt of visual report, or that they were doing too good a job (reporting minor radar points due to random noise, etc.) after receipt of visual reports. The report leads one to believe that the target signal strength and the short time of detection of the radar target were wholly inadequate to establish a ‘radar track".
