Statement of W...., S.J.V., D.I.D., "YOOMERA", taken at 1850 hours 20th September, 1952, by J.A. McGAHEY, Assistant Security Officer.

I was one of a party of four D.I.D. personnel who attended the "Yoomera" test on Saturday, 27th September. There were two pilots and two others. I have just arrived up here myself. Statements by the others will give the full details.

Some time after the show started, S... (that's his name), turned me on to the general direction of the object. Looking towards the right of the screen and in the sky, I could see the object moving. It appeared to be travelling at a tremendous rate of speed towards the right of the screen and in the sky. I would estimate its speed to be in the vicinity of 1000 m.p.h. It was shaped like a silver dollar and seemed to be a solid object metal in appearance. As it was travelling from West to East, it passed across my field of vision in a horizontal manner, that is, maintaining a level course. It was visible for only a matter of seconds.

The calling in at the time as the object did was in a horizontal way. I would say the object was relative to the screen only a matter of seconds, that is, a flash. I did not hear any noise as the picture show may have drowned any.

Concerning the object, in my opinion it would definitely be something other than a shooting star or anything from the heavens.
