CONVINCED IT'S AUTHENTIC

Flying Saucer 4,000 Feet In Diameter
Photographed At New Mexico Air Base

Alamagordo, N.M. (UP)--
A photograph of an "unconventional aerial object" was released today and an organization which has government employees in its membership but has no official status, said a government photographic expert could not challenge its authenticity. The object was released yesterday by a group of civilians at this missile test center.

The Aerial Phenomena Organization, which has its government employees in its membership but has no official status, said the picture was taken on Oct. 16, 1957. The weird huge object hovered for 15 minutes over the east missile test range near Holloman Air Force Base, the APRO claimed.

L.G. Lorenzen of Alamogordo, spokesman for the APRO, said the name of the photographer could not be revealed. He said the Hatch Air Force Base government employee from becoming involved in public controversy was such as the decade-old debate about whether flying saucers exist.

"Experts have examined the negative and all prints and pronounced it authentic," he said. He quoted the photographic expert: "It's definitely was not a cloud."
