1.2. Base Intelligence Officer - G. Schanwitz

This is to advise you that the Navy reporting this report is a case that came to our attention on 30 June 1954. It was observed at 1951 hours on 28 June 1954 by members of the Norfolk Naval Air Station at Norfolk, Va. This device was observed a short b time and was lost to sight. It was described as round and "glowing at the bottom" and exhibited a pulsating type motion at the time of the reported sighting. Instrument data, visual observations and radar observations secured at the time indicated that the reported sighting could have been a weather balloon. However, and fast that no further investigation is necessary in this instance and that no further follow-up action is contemplated.
