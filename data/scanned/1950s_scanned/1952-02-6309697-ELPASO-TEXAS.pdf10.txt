I. CASE:

This report contained a photograph of two very unusual objects. The objects, which were quite large, appeared like rainbows. The "circles" disappeared but he took a photograph anyway. upon viewing the objects, certain spots on the planet, Saturn, were noticed.

II. STARS FILMED:

Examination under a microscope showed that the image on the negative was definitely not due to the normal, celestial spots on the negative. The nature of these imprints had been studied, but it was still considered unexplained.

III. CYCLES:

The imprints on the print were two to two and one-half inches in diameter. It was still not clear what had caused these imprints.
