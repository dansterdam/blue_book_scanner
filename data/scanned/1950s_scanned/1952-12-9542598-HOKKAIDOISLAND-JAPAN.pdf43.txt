About 10:30 the motion appeared. The object was quite small and faint at first, but gradually increased in size and brilliance as it approached and passed overhead. The rate of motion was fairly rapid, and the object appeared to be approximately 1/20 the diameter of the full moon.

The object was round, and it seemed to have a reddish or orange glow toward the front, shading off into a blue-green toward the rear. At the rear, there appeared to be a tail or trail of luminous gas or vapor. The object moved silently and with no visible means of propulsion.

The duration of the sighting was approximately 30-40 seconds. As the object passed overhead, it seemed to decrease in size and brilliance and finally disappeared from view to the northeast.

I would estimate the total angular motion of the object to have been approximately 60-70 degrees. It moved in a straight line, with no deviation or change of course.

The night was clear, and stars were visible, so the observation was made under good visibility conditions. I would estimate the object to have been at an altitude of 20,000-30,000 feet, based on the rate of motion and apparent size.
