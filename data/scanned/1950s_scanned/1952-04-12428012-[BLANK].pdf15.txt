SLIDE NO. 6

We have made a projection of the Horton design which may be of 
interest. Development of the Horton H-XVIII. A possible development 
as to performance and characteristics is shown in this slide.

Assuming an aircraft with a span of 153 feet, wing area of 4000 
square feet, and a gross weight of 200,000 pounds powered with 
4 x 10,000 pound thrust engines, the aircraft could have a range of 
approximately 5000 NM.

SLIDE NO. 7

Of the German all-wing designs, the U.S. showed the greatest 
interest in the Lippisch delta-wing DM-1 glider.

The DM-1 was to be used to test the flying qualities of the 
delta-wing planform, in preparation for construction of a supersonic 
fighter of that planform. The DM-1 had a span of 19.7 feet, a very 
low aspect ratio of 1.81, and a gross weight of approximately 1000 
pounds. The  pilot was housed in the root of the large vertical  fin.

This aircraft was to have been developed into a supersonic fighter 
powered with a coal fuel ram-jet.
