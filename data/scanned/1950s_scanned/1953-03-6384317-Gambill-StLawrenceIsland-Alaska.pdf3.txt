SUN PHENOMENON
CARIBBEAN SEA

Second Officer A Le Fevre, of the French SS Caribbe, Capt.
A. Juvin, Master, reports observing a peculiar formation around
the sun, which he classified as Bishop's Ring, on March 25, 1953,
at 1600 G. M. T., in lat. 14째16' N., long. 75째40'W. The observer
saw two rings surrounding the sun. The inner circle,
radius about 120, was quite clear and distinct and the outer circle
hazy.

Weather fair with scattered showers, wind east force 5, barom-
eter 29.96 inches, air temperature 79째 F., sea temperature 79째 F.

NOTE BY HYDRO.--BISHOP'S RING: A corona around the sun usually
with its outer edge of reddish color. It is probably due to particles of dust
in the air, as it is seen after all the great volcanic eruptions. Was named
after Rev. Sereno E. Bishop of Honolulu, who first described them after the
Krakatoa eruption in 1883.
