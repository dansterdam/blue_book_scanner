The following information was received from the 502nd Air Base Squadron, ATIC-MATS, Dover AFB, Delaware. The date of the information is 1 March 1953. A copy of the attached report was furnished.
1. Approximately 2255 to 0600 hours 9 March 1953, six (6) Air Force personnel, including the Sergeant Controller of the GCA station, observed an unidentified object moving erratically in the sky over Dover AFB, Delaware.
2. According to one observer, an F/V pilot who is considered very reliable and who furnished continuous information during the sighting, the object appeared first as a "very bright light" which changed to "a reddish color" and then to a "yellowish color". It was observed to make "fast and erratic" maneuvers and at times appeared to "accelerate and decelerate" very rapidly. No sound was heard.
3. The object was tracked on radar by the GCA station personnel and its speeds were estimated by them to vary from 12,000 to 15,000 mph. The object was observed to make several extremely sharp turns and at times appeared to hover. The horizontal distance covered was estimated to be 50 miles, the altitude varying from 20,000 to 50,000 feet.
4. The weather at the time of sighting was 12,000 feet overcast, visibility 3 to 5 miles, wind from 270° at 15 knots, 16,000 feet from 280° at 90 to 100 knots, 20,500 feet from 270°.
5. A prevalent explanation of object at New Castle County Airport, Delaware, is that observers are sighting "flares dropped" from unidentified navigato r who plotted object.
