Unidentified Flying Object

SAFHI-3, Attn: Maj. L. J. Tucker
AFOIN-4h
19 December 1953

1. The ATIC had these portions of film containing the socalled "UFO" examined for detailed analysis. The examinants did not reveal any distinct contours of the object, as the film under a microscope did not provide sufficient detail for identification of the object.

2. The analysis of the film indicates the object was stationary, yet for details of the object's identity or characteristics, nothing definite can be concluded. It is the opinion of the ATIC that the obvious reason is photographs taken under existing conditions were not satisfactory.

3. The object was photographed for a total time of approximately six seconds. The determination of the running rate of the camera was not possible, and therefore the true speeds and altitudes of the object cannot be shown.

4. In view of the limited data available, the ATIC is unable to come to any definite conclusion as to what the object is. However, it is conceivable that no sufficient detail was available to the examinants for identification, and therefore it is considered that no further analysis would be possible.
