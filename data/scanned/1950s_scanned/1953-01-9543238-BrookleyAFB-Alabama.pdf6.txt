Intelligence Officer: Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama
Details: At approximately 0900 hours, 5 January 1953, Captain [REDACTED] came to the Brookley Air Force Base Intelligence Office. He stated that the previous night, while flying his F-51 aircraft on a routine night training mission, he had sighted an unusual light in the sky. He stated that the light disappeared after about 30 seconds. He saw no other lights while in the air, and no other aircraft were observed.

Near Operations, and nearby Bates Field (Commercial), were contacted by telephone and confirmed no aircraft were operating in the vicinity at the time. No other fields in the immediate vicinity reported any activity.

When the light was sighted, the observer was facing West at latitude 30 degrees. Thirty-eight minutes North, 88 degrees, seven minutes West, and stated that the light was hovering for that period of time. It then appeared to accelerate rapidly, and disappeared. No sound was heard.

The credibility of the observer is unquestioned. Captain [REDACTED] is a Senior Pilot, with ten years flying experience, and is familiar with meteorology and navigation.

Since the report was not received until twelve hours after observation, interception was not attempted.
