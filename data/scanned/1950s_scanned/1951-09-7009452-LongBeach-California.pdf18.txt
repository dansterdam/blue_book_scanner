UNCLASSIFIED
FEFRARDS AFB WEATHER STATION reported that Santa Maria, San Diego and Long Beach loos which can easily rise to 50,000 feet, and can expand "like a balloon" if they stay 25,000-30,000 feet for a period. The flight that was witnessed by Mr. Harvey and others was described to the balloon as a "major."

STATEMENT

On 25 September 1951 at approximately 0910 ST a bogie was sighted by Capt James H. Harvey, USAF. When we sighted this bogie, it appeared to be over 20,000 feet in the vicinity of March Air Force Base.

When 13,000 feet and above, the bogie appeared to be between 15,000 and 22,000 feet and also appeared to be a swept-wing, fighter-type aircraft. He was also noted to be in a constant orbit.
