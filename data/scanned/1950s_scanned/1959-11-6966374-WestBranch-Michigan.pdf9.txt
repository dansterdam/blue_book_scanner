AF DISCOVERER VII IN ORBIT; RECAPTURE OF CONE SET TODAY

GEAR WEATHERPROOFED TO FACILITATE RETURN

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, CALIF., NOV. 7-(UPI)- The "weatherproof" Discoverer VII satellite, successfully launched for a significant U.S. satellite breakthrough, roared into orbit today.

Unlike previous satellites in the Discoverer series, this vehicle carried special equipment, including heaters, insulation, and sheaves, that should permit the recovery of its "cone" after re-entry.

The cone, a small re-entry capsule attached to the 1,370-pound satellite, is expected to be recovered this afternoon by planes and ships in a massive "fishing" mission in the Pacific ocean, southeast of Hawaii, 2,800 miles from the launch site.

The vehicle, weighing nearly a. 700-pound total, was boosted into a 133-by-322-mile orbit late yesterday by a Thor-Agena rocket.

THE AIR FORCE announced that their "advanced" satellite had been placed successfully in orbit. 

The recovery attempt was scheduled in U.S. government projection to be completed within 24 hours of the launch.

"This achievement is the next step in setting man into space," an Air Force spokesman said, "and it puts the U.S. satellite program in a long lead before we can send a man into space."

The Air Force said the 'Discoverer VII" satellite was launched Aug. 19 and since that time 21 engineers have worked continually to insure its chance of success.

"When we do catch this thing, and it very well could be insane," the spokesman said, "What we'll have addition to the 'world's first' will be very limited scientific information from the interior of the satellite."
