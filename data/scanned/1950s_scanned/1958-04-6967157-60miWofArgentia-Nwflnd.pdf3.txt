The image does not contain any photograph or visual information. It appears to be a scanned document from the Department of the Air Force Staff Message Division, describing a sighting of a white object that was observed during last 5 seconds of illumination while traveling at great speed from 138 degrees to a position directly overhead of the observer. The document states that the object dissipated in a shower of red sparks with no trail or exhaust seen. It also mentions the pilot's altitude estimate and that the pilot was currently enroute to Amarillo AFB and would then proceed to the home station at Dover.
