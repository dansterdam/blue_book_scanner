The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a scanned page from a classified UFO project report document. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

At 1916Z, Benton received four overlap pre-plots from 26th AD Control Center on an unidentified target said to be heading west at 2,000 knots with an estimated altitude of 50,000 feet. At 1917Z Benton detected a target on the vertical upper beam heading north-west with an estimated speed of 920 knots. This target was correlated as being BB-6 from Montauk. The track was carried on VU until contact was lost at a point approximately 132 n.mi. northwest of the station.

It was again picked up on vertical center and tracked until it faded at 1925Z. No further pickup on this track was made.

At 1924Z the second track was detected on VU 75 n.mi. north of the station heading 295°, estimated speed 1,500 knots. This track had no correlation and was numbered BE-111. It was carried on VU until contact was lost at a point approximately 145 n.mi. northwest of the station. It was again picked up on vertical center at 160 n.mi. northwest and carried until it faded at 190 n.mi., 305°. Both tracks were interrogated by Mark X with no response. All track information was passed to the ADW site at Lockport and Claybourne but these sites did not detect either of these tracks. Lockport was off the air for maintenance during the entire time Benton was tracking and did not return to operation until 1932Z; one minute after the track BE-111 faded.

Anti-aircraft units in the area of concern did not report any unusual, high-speed target activity. BB-6 aircraft activity was considered as a possible cause for the track at Benton AFB; however, a message to WADC established that no B-58s were flying in this area at this time.
