FOUR SAUCERS OVER CALIFORNIA AT SPEEDS UP TO 3,600 M.P.H. REVEALED IN RADAR REPORT COMPILED BY NICAP BOARD MEMBERS
Based on Information Supplied by Official Sources, NICAP Headquarters, Washington, D.C.
INVESTIGATION BY NICAP BOARD OF GOVERNORS
A further report has been received on the radar observation of four saucer-shaped objects over California in April 1952, disclosed in the report published in the April and May issues of the NICAP bulletin (Vol. 1, Nos. 2 & 3). This report is based on official data compiled from the Air Force's own records by members of the NICAP Board of Governors.
The sightings occurred on April 22 and May 18, 1952 near Oxnard, California. The objects were detected by radar and tracked by a permanent ground installation at the Oxnard Air Force Base for considerable periods of time. Their speeds were determined to be as high as 3,600 m.p.h., far exceeding the top speeds of any known aircraft.
"The saucers were picked up on radar, tracked, timed and their speeds determined," the report states. "For approximately 20 minutes on April 22, 1952, four disc-shaped objects were tracked maintaining an average speed of 1,200 m.p.h. On May 18, 1952, four similar objects were tracked for about 40 minutes, reaching speeds up to 3,600 m.p.h."
The objects were tracked on the Oxnard Air Force Base radar from 7:12 p.m. to 7:32 p.m. on April 22, and from 9:10 p.m. to 9:50 p.m. on May 18. Their flight paths were described as "erratic" and "incredible."
After the May sightings, the report states, the objects accelerated and disappeared off the scope. There was no air traffic control of any kind at that time, no known aircraft with such fantastic performance was in the area, and the objects showed no response to any efforts to communicate with them, such as visual or radio signals. The report concludes that these were Unidentified Flying Objects, not any known type of aircraft.
