STATEMENT

Dec. 2, 1952

At approximately 04435 on December 1, 1952, LaGuardia Tower requested that the unidentified controller on duty at the Teterboro Tower scan the horizon west of the field for some object sighted in the area just to the southwest of Teterboro.

After scanning the horizon for a period of five minutes the object definitely was not sighted by the unidentified controller.

At one time, at approximately 04443, a very faint amber glow was visible over the ridge just west of the airport but could not be identified as any object flying in that area.
