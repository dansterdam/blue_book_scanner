Text from the document:

ON THE NIGHTS OF OCTOBER 27, 1952 WHILE ON DUTY ON THE 1730 TO 0830 HOURS SHIFT, I WITNESSED AND REPORTED A STRANGE LIGHT TO THE SOUTHWEST OF MY STATION. WHILE WORKING MY SHIFT I SUDDENLY OBSERVED A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR AT INTERVALS. IT APPEARED TO VIBRATE OR OSCILLATE SLIGHTLY BACK AND FORTH IN A LIMITED ARC. THE LIGHT WOULD MAINTAIN A STEADY BRILLIANCE FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN DIMINISH AND PRACTICALLY DISAPPEAR, ONLY TO REAPPEAR AGAIN. THIS PERFORMANCE WAS REPEATED OVER AND OVER AT INTERVALS OF APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 30 SECONDS. I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE CONTROLLER ON DUTY, WHO IN TURN NOTIFIED THE AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON, AIR DEFENSE COMMAND, ACTING ON THE INFORMATION, THE CONTROLLER DISPATCHED A SCRAMBLE TO INVESTIGATE THE LIGHT.  WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THE PILOT REPORTED BACK THAT HE HAD OBSERVED THE LIGHT BUT WAS UNABLE TO CLOSE ON IT EVEN AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. HE STATED THAT AS HE APPROACHED THE LIGHT IT WOULD MOVE RAPIDLY AWAY MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO CLOSE ON IT AND EXAMINE IT CLOSELY.
