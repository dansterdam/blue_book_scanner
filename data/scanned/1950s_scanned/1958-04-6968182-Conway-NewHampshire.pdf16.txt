The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text. The text appears to be a report or account of some kind, potentially related to a UFO sighting.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text output from the document:

6/9/59, Approx 3:20 a.m.
Walpole, New Hampshire
4 young adults saw a bright light in the sky with a peculiar U.F.O. contly one or two times, seemed to be stationary for most part and then would make a long swiftdescent and then ascend again.
Mr. Keene observed it through binoculars and it appeared to be a solid object changing colors from bright white to reddish.
I'm unable to obtain any further details on this particular incident.
