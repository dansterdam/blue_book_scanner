Dear Colonel Mitchell:

On 30 November 1957 we received a call from Mr._____, operating for Los Angeles
212; California, reporting he had sighted several "unidentified flying objects" over his
residence at Englewood, California. He claimed these objects were brilliantly lighted and
maneuvered at high speeds. He was not able to cooperate with the Air Force in any way,
as he was not equipped to obtain photographs or films of the sighting.

As established a time for pickup, designated 43/c to arrive to residence and transport the film to be developed. There are no local Air Force facilities for handling and coloring we
could use under the current regulations. Since there are no local Air Force facilities for
photography, I picked up the film. The film had no extra processing or marking of any kind
other than the handling at the time of the filling of the object.

For your information: Attached you will find a copy of the report prepared by this office
by the children who observed the strange objects. Mr. _____ children had discussed the
sightings in detail with local Air Force and discussed ??
