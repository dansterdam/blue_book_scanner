No Case (Information Only)

20 February 1957
Westchester County, Pa.

February 20, 1957. Two F-86's were sent aloft to investigate a translucent, oddly shaped object. According to the information, coming from a CSIR member (who asks that his name be withheld), the object was sighted over Westchester County Airport around noon. He was driving to the airport when he saw the object. It was translucent in color, and in the shape of a full moon. It did not move. As the two jets headed toward the object, the witness were in his car, looking to get home to watch the event through binoculars. Driving away, he saw the jets making passes around the object. This was the last he saw of the object. Apparently the observer felt that the object might possibly have been a partially deflated weather balloon, although he was definite that he did not see the object drifting with the wind or floating to the earth. The day was very clear and quite cold, the observer himself did not notice any wind.
