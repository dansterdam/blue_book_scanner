Base Officials Studying
Meteorite From Area

"Washington, June 10 (AP)- Air Force officials said today they are again studying a metallic object picked up on the earth in Hamilton Friday. 
He said "the object, apparently a meteorite, is being studied further."

THE OBJECT, pieced together from a sidewalk, was retrieved yesterday by Capt. D.H. Finnegan, public information officer of the Patuxent River Naval Air Station.

He indicated the object might be of some significance to the station's "air operations office," since it appeared to be associated with some "indications of flight operations."
