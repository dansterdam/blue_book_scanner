STATEMENT:
TO : When It May Concern

I, Frank C. Waterman, Master Sergeant AF690727B, do make the following statement of my own free will.

On the night of 5 August 1952, I was aroused from sleep by my wife, Helen C. Waterman, to observe an lighted object from our bed room window. The time was 2300 hours and the visibility very good for there was a full moon at that hour and also few or no clouds. The bedroom window faces due North and the location of the house is approximately ten (10) miles South of Valdosta, Georgia.

This lighted object appeared to be orange in color when first observed and gradually turned bluilsh green or yellowish as it went away from sight. The course of this object was a North by North-East and was judged by me to be between forty-five hundred (4,500) and five thousand (5,000) feet. The speed of this object is very difficult for me to approximate but I would judge it to be similar to that of a 40MM shell (tracer) traveling at a flat trajectory. The altitude of this object was also computed by me to that of a 40MM shell, which I judged to explode at five thousand (5,000) feet. The shape of this object was circular and not defined as to outline. I would estimate the total time of observation to be about thirty seconds from my angle of view, until the object completely disappeared.

At the same time as I observed the fore-mentioned object, a jet type of aircraft with flashing red and green lights, was seen and heard by me passing over head in the same general heading as the object and at a slightly higher altitude of approximately seventy-five hundred (7,500) to eight thousand (8,000) feet.
