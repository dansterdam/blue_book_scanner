d. Case:

Sighting: 29 August 1955
Two miles west of intersection of Route 6 and 305.
Between 1:30 to 2:00 a.m.
Object: Typically "flying saucer" in shape. Fifty feet across.
Dome on top. A bolt of green light struck the ground in
front of men, and as men started to run. Objects landed,
door slid open, and a man came out. He informed Amer-
icandt, In English, "they" were from another planet.

7. In view of the possibility that these people may, again, contact the
President's office with a request for a follow-up or explanation, unless we can
give them some suitable reply (which we can later back up by official paper work),
it is the opinion of the undersigned that, regardless of the merits of each in-
dividual case, some action should be initiated, if for no other reason than for
our records to indicate something was done in this matter.

8. Two courses of action are contemplated:

a. A reply to the UFO Council that no firm conclusion can be reached
because of the insufficiency of information submitted.

b. Request a brief, informal investigation by the 4602nd AISS, in ac-
cordance with AFR 200-2. A reply to the UFO Council would then be that "investi-
gative action has been initiated; results unknown as of this date."

9. The latter recommendation above is considered the best approach. Any
reply to the effect "insufficient information" "no firm conclusion" "is still
under study" may only produce a large mass of additional data frm this organiza-
tion which undoubtedly will further confuse the cases on hand.

10. Your comments and/or recommendations with respect to this matter would
be appreciated.
