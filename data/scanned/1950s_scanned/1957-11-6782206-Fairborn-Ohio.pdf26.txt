The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curving line representing the horizon, with an object above it and a point labeled "A" on the curved line. The second sketch shows a larger landscape with a person standing on a road, and two smaller sketches - one showing a curved line and another showing a mountainous landscape.

Text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
