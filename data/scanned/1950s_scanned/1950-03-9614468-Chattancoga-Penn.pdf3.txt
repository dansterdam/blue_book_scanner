SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
PREPARING OFFICE: CIG Field Office No. 3, Chattanooga, Tennessee
SUBJECT: FLYING SAUCER REPORTED OVER CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE
DATE: 31 March 1950

On 23 March 1950, Mr. and Mrs. R.L. Woodwall of 2101 View Drive, Chattanooga, Tennessee, reported to the Chattanooga News-Free Press that they had sighted a "flying saucer" over Chattanooga at about 2:00 p.m. on 23 March 1950. The story appeared in the Chattanooga News-Free Press on the same date.

On 30 March 1950 both Mrs. Woodwall and Mr. Woodwall were interviewed and both stated that they had sighted a round silver object in the sky heading toward Lovell, neither lady could estimate how high the object was or at what rate of speed it was moving.

On 30 March 1950, Mr. Field, Meteorologist, Weather Bureau, Lovell, was interviewed and stated that on 30 March 1950 the Weather Bureau at Lovell released a 1600 gram sounding balloon that is probably observed the balloon after it had reached a point where the ridge currents were carrying it northward rapidly. He stated that weather balloons frequently reflect the sun's rays in such a manner as to make the object appear round and silver-like but in all probability the ladies observed the balloon.

No further investigation is contemplated by this office regarding this particular incident. Liaison has been set up with the local newspapers whereby any further reports of flying objects unidentified will be relayed to this office immediately.
