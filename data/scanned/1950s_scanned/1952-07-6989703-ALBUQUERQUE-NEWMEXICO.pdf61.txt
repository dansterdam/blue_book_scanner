I. 3/22/ at approximately 1830 HOURS, I observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the front of Twin Buttes while looking up into the sky and about one pointed up in the direction of TRAMWAY and EUBANK. It will only stay visible for a short period, say approx. 15 degree angle looking to the south and its movement was very slow and forth like a pendulum and it made a dip on each side as it swung back and forth. The object was silent and was about twice the size of a lower object and was a very brilliant light but not as bright as the sun come lines view to the west but not in the direction of the object and the object seemed to have a rotary motion though it was hard to tell exactly what the motion was. After about a minute or two the object became invisible to me and without further observation I returned to my normal duties.
