I. Description of Incident:
From OISGZ to OHTC, an object was observed from an AFB in Southern Japan. Object appeared very similar to an evening star, was first yellow in color, but then changed to green and finally to red. Object was described by observers to be Ping-pong ball size at an estimated distance of 2000 yards to the south. However, when it finally disappeared below the horizon, it again assumed the original appearance of a star.
Weather in the locality was excellent. Radar attempted to pick the object up, but with no success.

II. Discussion of Incident:
Several factors in this sighting are significant. Primarily, the object was described by the observers themselves as "starlike". Secondly, the initial observation as well as the phenomenon of the changing colors is a well-known astronomical phenomena caused by seeing at great distances.  

III. Conclusion:
Probably astronomical.
