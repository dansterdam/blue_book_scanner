The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document from the Air Technical Intelligence Center of the United States Air Force.

Mr. X
Avenue
Cincinnati 27, Ohio

Dear Mr. X,

Attached herewith are the original three (3) photographs and five (5) negatives which you submitted to this organization for review and comment on 7 November 1956. Reference is also made to your request on the status and disposition of this material.

We regret the delay, but as part of the study and reviews, the photographs were submitted to a scientist who later was assigned to an overseas project, leaving them behind.

With reference to your findings, please be advised that the photographs and negatives were subjected to a series of microscopic and other examinations including a feature size projection. The light appears to be emanating from an outside source into a container believed to be the interior of a telescope and projected a cone-like portion of the sky around the moon with the dark portion around the ovoid of light. Further indications that the latter coloration is not a photograph of the sky.

We are not in position to comment whether your source, which you state is an astronomer, was or was not aware of this, or if this is merely a case of an attempted hoax, with you as an unwitting intermediary.

Copies have been made of the original material to be included with our analysis and other data in case files.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
