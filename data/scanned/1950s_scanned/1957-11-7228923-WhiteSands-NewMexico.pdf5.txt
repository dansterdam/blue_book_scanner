AF FORM 112--PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1949

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM AGENCY: AIRS
TO: ATIC, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

I. SOURCE: Cpt. Clmrm H. Tayt, RA 12312460
ADDRESSEE: U.S. ARMY Garrison, White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico

AGE: 21
OCCUPATION: Motor Patrol, Military Police
EDUCATION: Half or tenth grade

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: Source appeared to be a "typical G.I.," naive and impressed with "unusual and impressive" objects he had observed. He was a member of the Army military patrol, and according to his own statement, had discussed the sighting with the officer in charge of the patrol and several other patrol members. Although his account may be somewhat exaggerated, it was generally confirmed by the other members of the patrol, and the source appeared to be sincere and trying to report the incident as accurately as possible.

III. TIME AND PLACE OF OBSERVATION: At about 0230-0300 Sunday morning, 3 November 1957, in the vicinity of White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico.

IV. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S): The object, or objects, were described as being "saucer-like" in appearance and approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. They were silvery in color and seemed to be glowing with an internal light. Two of the objects were observed, traveling in tandem, at an estimated altitude of 500 to 1000 feet, and at a speed estimated to be 3 to 500 mph. They were observed for a period of about 2 to 3 minutes, after which they accelerated and disappeared from sight.

V. FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS: The objects were observed to make abrupt changes in direction, stop and hover, and accelerate at extremely high speeds, all within a matter of seconds. During the observation, one of the objects appeared to extend a "protrusion" or "appendage" from its underside.

VI. COMMENTS: The source stated that the objects were totally silent in flight and unlike anything he had ever seen before. He was quite concerned and upset by the incident, and stated that he wanted to report it, since he felt it was of extreme importance. He stated that several other members of the patrol had also observed the objects and were equally amazed and concerned. The source was very cooperative and gave a rather detailed account of the incident.
