At approximately 16/1300Z APR 56, source's GCG Jim Morris (see Part II) asked source to come to National Guard Armory at Fitzgerald, Ga.

It appeared motionless and when observed through binoculars it seemed to be round or oblong. It was visible with the naked eye, and without either binocular or telescope.
