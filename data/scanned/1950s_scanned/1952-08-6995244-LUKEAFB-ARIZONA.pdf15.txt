3 June 1952
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
PLACE OBSERVED: Near Guayaquil, Ecuador
DATE/TIME: 13 August 1952
USAF MISSION TO ECUADOR
AT 2200-4, six airmen saw 50 to 60 objects hovering at approximately 30,000 feet. They were elliptical in shape and a reddish-orange in color, and were sighted for about 30 minutes. The objects were seen from an estimated distance of 10 miles and maintained a standard formation at that distance. No outstanding maneuvers were observed, and the objects appeared to hover and then slowly vanish from sight. The objects were observed from an estimated altitude of 6,000 to 7,000 feet.
W/Sgt. H. J. PAISLEY's findings are considered to be worthy of investigation.
