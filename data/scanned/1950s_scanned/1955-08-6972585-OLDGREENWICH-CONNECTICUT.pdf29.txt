The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch is a curved line diagram that illustrates how high an object was above the horizon when it was first sighted. The second set of sketches shows a larger illustration with person standing on a road, and a smaller sketch of a person viewing the horizon.

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
