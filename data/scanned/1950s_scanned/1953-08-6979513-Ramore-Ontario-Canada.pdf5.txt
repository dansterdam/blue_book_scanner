STATEMENT

At about 2230 hours, 15 August 1953, the radar operator man called the radar control and advised a glow in the sky. The object was some distance and in an east direction. This object was pulsating or flashing and would disappear and reappear. This happened several times. The object appeared to be at a high altitude. After about 2 minutes the object disappeared and about a minute later a similar object appeared in the same direction. This object remained visible for about 4 minutes and then faded away. There was no moon and the weather was clear in the estimation.
