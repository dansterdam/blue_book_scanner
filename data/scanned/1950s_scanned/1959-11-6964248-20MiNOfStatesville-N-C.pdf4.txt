Mystery Fireball Causes Se[...]

STATESVILLE. N.C., Nov. 13.-- (UPI)-- A mysterious blue ball of light appeared over the North Carolina countryside before dawn today and frightened those who saw it.

A motorist, Robert L. James of Taylorsville, N.C., said the glowing object "chased" his car several miles. He said it "hovered" over his car at "tree top levels" and moved alternately at slow and very fast speeds.

Police said a check of other police departments and the Highway Patrol showed a number of persons saw a similarly described object in the vicinity of Hickory and Salisbury, N.C.
