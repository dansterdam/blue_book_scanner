Subject: Small Flying Formation.
(Continuation) of Events of October 3rd, 1953.
Time 0115-0145.

This event had just come to its conclusion when I finally gave up and went to bed. 

Several times during the evening, particularly between 0130 and 0145 I thought I saw a blower or some similar object high in the sky. However, it could not be too certain as to what it was, as it would have been too far away for me to identify positively. I couldn't be too certain outside point, as it could have been an airplane, but I am inclined to believe it is they who control its operations.

Another detail I should like to add to this both in the case, as I seem to be as prevalent, to me than when I was awake. And the small craft is seem to gone to bed and stayed there, I do not recollect them or nor did they reappear.

I shall have no further reports for a while, since I am leaving Harrison city, until Wednesday, October 14th, as my business may require that I be away. However, it is possible that I shall see something more if I return sooner. That is the case of us, sometimes need to wait from some of the fantastic events which I have viewed there. If isn't this I know, that I have never seen befor, and it is just that I wonder what next is going to happen.
