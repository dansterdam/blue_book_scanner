"AF Studying Photograph of Disk Formation
By GEORGE HOWARD STAFF WRITER

WASHINGTON, July 30. -- An article on the study of photographs of flying saucers is published by Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, officer in charge of the Air Force's project to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects.
The article, which appears in Flying magazine, describes the analysis of a photograph which purports to show a flying saucer taken at Tremonton, Utah, on July 2, 1952.
Ruppelt got the picture from the Air Force and then turned it over to the Navy's Photographic Interpretation Laboratory at Dayton, Ohio, where flying saucer reports are taken and studied.
Capt. Ruppelt, the article states, is the Air Force's project officer in charge of the inquiry into the problem of flying saucers. The article notes that he took the matter over when the controversy on flying saucers was centered in Washington. Capt. Ruppelt said he is in no position to give his opinion as to what the object was, but he does say he believes it could be a flying saucer picture.
'Could Get Frames'
Gen. Vandenberg said he is convinced the 'object' picked up by radar over Washington in 1952 could be explained. He said they are not secret weapons or devices produced in this country. He was usually asked to produce proof, the article states, and he discounted the idea they are from another planet.
The article states that a number of 'credible observers' have reported seeing things in the sky which 'appear to be discs.' It says the rate of speed and maneuverability of these objects is such that it is difficult to explain them as weather balloons or meteors."
