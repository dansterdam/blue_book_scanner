AF FORM 112 - PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: 12TH AIR DIVISION (DEF)
HEADQUARTERS                   12-293 ATIC FORM 12-29
DATE: 3 - 23 AUG 1952
PAGES: 2 OF 2

1. REQUEST AIR DIVISION (DEF) 1-28-53 ATIC FORM 12-29.
2. OTHER AIRCRAFT IN AREA UNKNOWN.
3. OUR CONCLUSIONS: IN OUR OPINION, THE OBJECT FROM OBSERVER'S LOG, OBJECT OVER URBAN
AREAS AT APPROX 45,000 FT. ELEVATION, MET NORMAL SPEED OF 30,000 KNOTS, WITH EXHAUST AND
FLAME EFFECT, APPEARS TO BE PROJECTILE FROM SOME FORCE FROM RUSSIA. TRAJECTORY AND
SPEED WOULD INDICATE MISSILE TYPE WEAPON, NOT AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECT WAS TRACKED FOR 8-10
SECONDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED. THERE WAS NO EXPLOSION OR IMPACT ON THE GROUND AS OUR
RANGE FACILITIES COULD DETECT. THOSE FACTS WOULD INDICATE A MISSILE TYPE WEAPON.
