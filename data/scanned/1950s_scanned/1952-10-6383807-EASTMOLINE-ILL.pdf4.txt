PAGE TWO
THE OBJ. APPEARED TO REMAIN IN THE SAME GEN AREA AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF CONTRACTION OR CHANGE IN SHAPE. IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE OBJECT WAS UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL. AS TO THE MOTION THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NO SOUND CONNECTED WITH IT THAT WAS HEARD BY THE WITNESSES. IT COULD BE MORE PROPERLY DESCRIBED AS FLOATING OR HOVERING EXCEPT FOR THE TIME WHEN IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND MOVED OUT OF SIGHT. THE OBJ. DID NOT APPEAR TO BE EXHAUST DRIVEN SINCE IT WAS OF THE SILENT TYPE. THE OBEJECTS APPEARANCE AND BEHAVIOUR AS DESCRIBED BY THE WITNESSES WAS VERY UNUSUAL, QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ORDINARY AIRCRAFT. THEY COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS A KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT.

PAGE THREE
IF A LARGE GROUP STANDING ON HIGH GROUND COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE THING AT CLOSE RANGE AND VISIALLY FOLLOW IT AND MARK ITS FLIGHT PEW FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, IT MAKES IT QUITE POSITVE THAT IT WAS A REAL OBJECT AND NOT SOME SORT OF OPTICAL ILLUSION. SHORTLY AFTER FLIGHT WHICH LASTED FROM 2 TO 3 MINUTES THE OBJ. DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. THE WITNESSES WERE RELIABLE PERSONS, SOME BEING AIRPORT PERSONNEL AND COULD NOT BE CONSIDERING AS BEING PRONE TO IMAGINATION OR EXAGGERATION. CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR DESCRIPTION AND SIGHTINGS OF THIS OBJ. MUST BE ACCORDED CONSIDERABLE CREDENCE.
