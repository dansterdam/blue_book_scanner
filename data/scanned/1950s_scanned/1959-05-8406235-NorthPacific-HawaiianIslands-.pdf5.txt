Gentlemen:
This report is to make my observation available to your office for any use it may have concerning the object I observed or any other similar observations. This object was observed by several people on the evening of May 21, 1959, for a period of approximately 45 minutes.

The object was first observed at approximately 9:10 P.M. local time as it passed over the southwestern part of Ashland, Oregon. It was moving rapidly in a northeast direction at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape and had a bright glow about its perimeter. The object seemed to wobble slightly as it moved across the sky, and the speed of its movement was estimated to be approximately 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour.

As the object moved into the northeastern part of the sky, it appeared to slow down and then came to a complete stop. It remained stationary for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. During this time, the object appeared to change shape slightly, becoming more elliptical in appearance. At one point, the object also seemed to emit a pulsating or flashing light. After remaining stationary for this period, the object then resumed its rapid movement toward the northeast, disappearing from sight in less than a minute.

The weather conditions at the time of the observation were clear, with scattered high clouds. There was no wind at the surface. The object was observed by several people, including myself, and all of us were amazed at the speed and the maneuvers of the object. We all agreed that it was not an aircraft or any other known type of aerial vehicle.

I hope this report may be of some use to your office in its investigations of similar sightings. If you have any questions or require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
