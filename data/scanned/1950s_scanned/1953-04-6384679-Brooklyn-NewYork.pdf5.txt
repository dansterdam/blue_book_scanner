Here is a rough sketch of how the sighting appeared:

LIGHT CUT
X - 0 X
X - 0 X
1/2 SEC.
2 SHINY
THERE

NOTE: PASSED SLOWLY
FROM RT TO LEFT EDGE
SOUND - NONE

NOTE - THE OBJECT IS DRAWN WHERE APPROXIMATELY
FULL SIZE AS IT APPEARED TO ME. 

  As per the sighted account, the estimate of 150-200 yards is merely a guess - assuming that it were similiar in size and distance (see 45 ft) to an airliner.

  On the distance - it could have been more than 200 yards, but hardly less, since the angle subtended by it was not at all imperceptible, but quite distinct.

  Against appeared to be traveling in a SW'N - NW direction towards Jamaica Bay in the vicinity of Rockaway Beach.
