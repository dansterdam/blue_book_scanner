She further stated that the object's movements were in a "waverly" direction, somewhat erratic. She stated that she could not account for this object, except to say that it moved in a very steady and controlled manner, and appeared to be at a very high altitude compared to aircraft operating in the area at that time. Mrs. c------ estimated the object's altitude to be at least 30,000 feet. She stated that the object appeared to be traveling quite rapidly, and in her opinion, in a westerly direction.
