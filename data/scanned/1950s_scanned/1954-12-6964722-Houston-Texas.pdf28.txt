PROPAGANDA BALLOONS TAKEN FOR 'SAUCERS'
Rome, ANSA, In Italian Morse to New York, Dec. 9, 1954, 2330 G.M.T.-19 (Excerpts)
Farugia--The many "flying saucers" lately seen by people in Umbria have turned out to be balloons filled with propaganda.
ITALY AND THE VATICAN
Dec. 19, 1954
Today Carabinieri seized many such balloons around and in Lake Trasimeno, Umbria. The balloons contained Anti-Communist propaganda leaflets written in Hungarian. It is believed that the adverse weather conditions in the past few days caused these balloons to fall on Umbrian soil--balloons which people mistakenly thought were "flying saucers."
