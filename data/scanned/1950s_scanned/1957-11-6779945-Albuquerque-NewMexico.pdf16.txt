Moore 
Says of Trip

THE ABOVE PHOTO (not related to the Moore story, which begins on Page 10), was sent to us by a correspondent in Albany, N.Y. who wishes to remain anonymous. He states that the object was photographed on November 6, 1952 near Albuquerque, N.M. The object was observed to hover and move slowly toward the northwest for several seconds. Our correspondent rushed into the house, secured his camera, and took this picture as the object was moving away slowly toward the northwest.
