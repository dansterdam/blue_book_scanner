TWO SIGHTINGS BY A PROMINENT SCIENTIST IN 
CHARGE OF HIGH-ALTITUDE COSMIC RAY RESEARCH

October 10, 1951 -- Two observers were just starting on a flight and were approaching (in a small plane) from the north an altitude of 8,000 feet. We started to climb towards the balloon on a course of 320 deg. At 9,000 feet I noticed a strange object crossing the skies at a great speed, coming from the northwest. I called the co-pilot's attention to this object and we watched it go behind a cloud, remaining there about a minute. When it emerged, it reversed its course and sped off towards the northwest at a tremendous speed. This object appeared to be about 1/4 the size of the balloon. We were climbing and about 10 miles from the balloon. The object had a peculiar glow to it, crossing behind the balloon from west to east very rapidly, first coming in at a slight dive, traveling for about a minute and then making a sharp left turn and climbing at an angle of 50 to 60 degrees into the northwest at a terrific acceleration and disappeared.

October 11, 1951 -- Four witnesses D. H. and I were flying at 10,000 feet observing the grab bag balloon when I saw what appeared to be the same object to the southeast of the University of M. Airport. I pointed it out to D and we both made the following observations: The object was moving from east to west at a high rate and very high. We tried keeping it in sight on a constant course and using gunsight wings it subtended an angle of one to two mils.
