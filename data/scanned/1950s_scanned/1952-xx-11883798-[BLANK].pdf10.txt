Dear Colonel Porter:

Your letter of the 5th is acknowledged. We are glad to obtain your general concurrence with our recommendations. These appear to be three possible methods of handling the situation, one of which (Proposal I) is at present utilized.

PROPOSAL I. (ATIC alone)
a. Project Blue Book would be handled by ATIC alone. There would be no complicated outside help.
b. ATIC would receive all reports, consider and aggregate them into two categories: (1) normal and (2) unusual for a numbered folder, action.
c. ATIC would make a preliminary analysis for each "ATIC action" case. 
d. ATIC would prepare and furnish ATIC-2 with a flash report, an interim report, and a numbered final report on each "ATIC action" sighting.

PROPOSAL II. (ATIC plus Contract Technical Group plus Advisory Committee)
a. High Level Advisory Committee
1. Would not exceed three people
2. Would act as counselor to ATIC
3. Chairman would act as spokesman on Blue Book matters for USAF activities
