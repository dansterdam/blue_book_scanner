AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 3-D, 46024 ATSS
From: 2nd Lt. Part Teo, Report # 30-UTOB-3-56
Report: When I first saw the object in the sky it appeared to be an extremely bright star-shaped object, but much larger than an average star. As it approached me, it became more defined and at one end a brilliant red section was evident. This section seemed to be emitting a stream of small white particles, giving the appearance of a single vortex. The object disappeared and the outline became very faint. It seemed to turn around. I left before it changed at all in appearance. The color was just the natural color which is different, but so much brighter. It stayed in one position in the sky throughout.
