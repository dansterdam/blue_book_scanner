STATEMENT OF RAYMOND GREENE

I, RAYMOND GREENE, do hereby certify that the following is a true and accurate statement of the facts concerning an unidentified flying object which I observed on October 6, 1957:

On the evening of October 6, 1957, at approximately 7:00 p.m., I was driving along the Angeles Crest Highway in California. As I was traveling in a northerly direction, I observed a bright light in the sky to the southwest. This light seemed to be moving in a westerly direction. 

At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but as I continued to observe it, I noticed that the light was much brighter than any aircraft lights I had ever seen. The light also seemed to be changing colors, going from a bright white to an orange-red color.  

I pulled my car over to the side of the road in order to get a better view of the object. As I watched, the light suddenly accelerated and shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from view within a matter of seconds.

I am certain that what I observed was not an aircraft, helicopter, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. The object's rapid acceleration and change of color are not characteristic of conventional aircraft. I am submitting this statement in the hope that it may contribute to the investigation of unidentified flying objects.
