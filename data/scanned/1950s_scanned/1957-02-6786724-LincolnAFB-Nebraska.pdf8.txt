NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

16 February 1957
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire
White Plains, New Mexico

February 16, 1957 - A spectacularly brilliant blue-green fireball exploded over the vicinity of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts at about 4:25 a.m. The light was seen over sections of three states. Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, and was described by one person as "resembling ball-like objects described elsewhere in this issue." - Boston Globe, 2/17, etc.

February 16, 1957 - Another fireball-type UFO (or actual fireball) was seen by White Plains policemen and his wife at about 7 p.m. when they saw a brilliant blue-green object streak to the west at a high rate of speed. It was irregular in shape and appeared to be about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. It was traveling at high speed on a horizontal trajectory to the south, at a constant elevation of about 150°. In turning away to concentrate on the road, the driver of the car reported he last saw it on a compass bearing of 245° (S.W.). His wife watched it disappear behind the building in front of the car. There was an impression of a tail, but again we request any additional information that might be supplied by readers.
