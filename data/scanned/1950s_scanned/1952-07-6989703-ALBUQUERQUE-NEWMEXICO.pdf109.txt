The text in the document is as follows:

"To: *** [redacted], Los Angeles, Calif #12-250, DO HEREBY STATE THE FOLLOWING: 

THE INCIDENT THAT I AM DESCRIBING TOOK PLACE APPROXIMATELY 10:50 HOURS MST ON THE 23RD OF JULY. I WAS AT THE AIRFIELD TOWER AT THAT TIME. 

THE NATURE OF THE INCIDENT OBSERVED WAS VERY SHORT-LIVED AND QUITE UNUSUAL. IT APPEARED AS A VERY BRIGHT SILVERY DISCLIKE OBJECT WHICH FLEW DIRECTLY ACROSS THE TOWER IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION. IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HALF DOLLAR HELD AT ARMS LENGTH AND SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY SILENT. IT APPEARED VERY SUDDENLY AND DISAPPEARED EQUALLY AS SUDDENLY, ONLY BEING VISIBLE FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR SECONDS.

I SAW IT JUST FOR A FEW SECONDS. IT WAS A DISTINCT GLOW IN THE SKY. THOUGH IT WAS NOT QUITE STATIONARY, IT WAS NOT IN POWERED FLIGHT BUT APPEARED TO BE GLIDING. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS.
