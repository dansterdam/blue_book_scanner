AT FORM 112â€”PART II UNCLASSIFIED 
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
FROM (OWMER) PAGE OF PAGES 
Statement by

At approximately 1740 hours, 24 February 1953, my wife and I left the apartment at 1403 East Chaffin St., Sherman, Texas, to go to the theater. While driving along 7th St. in Sherman, I suddenly noticed an object in the sky which appeared to be a star, only it was moving. I pointed this out to my wife and we both observed what appeared to be a bright light in the sky. It seemed to be at a high altitude and we watched as it moved across the sky, gradually disappearing from view. After calling Intelligence, I had my wife sit down and write out the attached drawing. I had the impression that the object asked or signaled in some way, as if it was aware of our observation. I asked my wife if she considered the object to be "only a star", and she stated emphatically that it was not a star, but rather some type of aerial vehicle, definitely not an aircraft, meteor, or star. The object appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed and did not follow the normal path of a meteor or aircraft. The total time of observation was 3 minutes.

The concluding morning I called weather and found that at the time of sighting the ceiling was 1400 feet and overcast was very thin and could almost be seen through.
