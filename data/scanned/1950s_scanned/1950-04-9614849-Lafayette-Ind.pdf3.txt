The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed text document describing a UFO sighting incident. I have transcribed all the text found in the document as follows:

You don't seem surprised," I said after the conclusion of my account. 
"No," he said, "I live in De Soto, Illinois, and at the time of my sighting it was near my home. From him, the details of the newsboy's sighting I have described. I was greatly edified that this had occurred to me, and I have become just a little interested in the other side of his story than that. My pastor, a man of irreproachable character, had himself been on U.S. Route 51, south of the Carbondale city limits, he had seen the object hovering in the sky for an instant before descending to the trees. In the same manner in which the newsboy and his wife or companion described it as streaking away from De Soto I managed to contact the while newsboy, whose story was as described.
My enthusiasm was revitalized. I had to get my story published. They were rejected by all popular magazines. It was in August, 1957, that I discussion "Saucers" magazines and I realized that here was a publication that was open-minded, to say the very least. However, I was because almost of the things that therein seemed so . . . I hope the faithful will pardon my saying this as strange. 
I'd still I know the flying what I duty-bound to tell today, for I what the public legend is based on an absolute fact, and if that had crime beneath the of be myth, those of us who have access to fact must disclose it.
The photograph was taken from Reillilis, facing south-southeast. The lines in the upper left foreground are utility wires, and the things in the lower right are the tops of trees. The tops of the telephone poles can be seen as the lines wind down the hillside. The "saucer" is hovering, just prior to taking off.
I get a weird, creepy feeling when I look at this picture. My Palmer once said, "What have I seen? An Unidentified Flying Object."
