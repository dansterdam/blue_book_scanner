1. Reference is made to letter, with G-2 Chief, dated 12 February 1951, subject as above.

2. The following additional information is furnished as a matter of interest to your headquarters:

"1. On 1 January 1951 a red and green balloon-shaped object reportedly descended upon the Stockton, California, vicinity. Shortly after a dull roar was heard, the object exploded. Upon lifting the cloud an item which appeared to be about 6 feet in length was found. No other evidence of the 'balloon' was forwarded to the Air Force investigation.

"2. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has advised that examination of the evidence submitted revealed the object was not a 'flying saucer' but the remains of a Japanese balloon, which was attached to a small paper container and some wire. The container and wire, which showed no evidence of burning, were preserved for possible further examination.

"3. No additional information to the fact that information contained herein has been derived from sources other than USAF. In accordance with paragraph 3a, AFR 200-2, this information will not be made outside of USAF channels."
