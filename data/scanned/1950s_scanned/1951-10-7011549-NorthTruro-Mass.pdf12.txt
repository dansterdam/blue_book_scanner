The weather information does not support temperature-inverted anomalous 
propagation. There probably are other discrepancies in the upper atmosphere 
which could also cause anomalous propagation. 

The possibility that meteors entered the atmosphere and were detected cannot 
be disregarded, and may be the answer to this report. A meteor would cause 
ionization of the air which should increase the target detectability. Short 
duration of the condition supports this theory, rather than anomalous propagation.
