UNCLASSIFIE:

CREOLA, ALABAMA 

On or about 21 July 1953 at 20:00-20:30 I  local time, approximately 
way home from work on Highway 45 in Creola, Alabama. I saw what appeared to 
be a metallic, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky. It seemed to be 
about 40-50 feet in diameter and 15-20 feet thick. The object moved slowly 
across the windshield of my vehicle. I could not make out any shapes or
details of the object. For a brief moment it appeared to stop and then
continued on its way. The object moved at a speed that was far in excess of 
any jet aircraft I had ever seen. I pulled off the highway and stopped to 
observe it further but it disappeared from view. The sighting lasted for
about 2-3 minutes. I could not associate it with any known aircraft. The
stability and speed of the object were such that this estimatin was not a star or
planet or any known type of aircraft. There was no sound and only a few clouds and bright
stars.
