Apparently the object bore a narrow light or beam of light; course apparently changed somewhat as brightness diminished. 
75Â° Bearing - - east of north wss a disappearance of this light. 
Went into haze and noticed a hame-made telescope. Definitely saw two light -- could not tell whether they were ground or airborne. Turned towards north (?). One light (A) was about one-third the brightness of (B).

While observing the above phenomenon - came through a rift in the clouds and headed into the west.

At 20:12 still followed by (B) which had slowly diminished in brightness - about 3 degrees or 3 times the apparent size than (B). Shortly moved northeast of (A) - could definitely see the lights. On way moved out of sight of observer one light at a time disappearing or fading into the night. 

At 20:14 this fascinating object then gathered luminescence and moved in what appeared a straight line - the light rose up and went out, out of sight.
