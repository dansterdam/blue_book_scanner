UNCLASSIFIED.

Airborne, I switched to our squadron common frequency, and requested assistance from any "confine" aircraft in the vicinity. The Commanding Officer and his wingman, who were carrying out a low pass operation in the vicinity, answered my call for assistance. They checked my instruments for altitude and engine limitations, and flew in a 500 climb, maintaining their prescribed 150-155 knots. Holding in tight climbing turns, making about two orbits to my one. At 11,500 feet I ranned down the object stationary over a point a little west of our airstrip. The Commanding Officer reported over increase A/S 11,000 feet as turned by lights from a severe thunderstorm they had encountered in their approach. They were still in the area, but I did not see them. The object, as reported, continued in my sight. All this took place in about 55 to 70 minutes, and at the Commanding Officer's suggestion we returned to base. The Commanding Officer allowed us the light, but the object did not.

Having had experience with jets against conventional-1 in "Dog Fights", I have a good idea of their speed, but this object in the encounter described previously was nothing like jets. It was smooth in motion, and slowed or approached or receded at varying velocities, nothing but this white light. Pulling up even more after it passed, I tried to see if I could hit its wash or slipstream, but there was none. Only this single steady white light that could move with phenomenal speed and maneuverability.
