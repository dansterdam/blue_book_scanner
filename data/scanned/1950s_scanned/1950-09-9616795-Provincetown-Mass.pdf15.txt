The image contains a Winds Aloft Computation Chart, which appears to be a graphical representation of atmospheric wind data. The chart shows a polar coordinate graph with concentric circles indicating wind speed, and radial lines indicating wind direction. There are annotations and handwritten notes on the chart, including "CAPE COD".

Here is the text from the document, transcribed using optical character recognition:
