COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by light reflections on windows or doors in the Perry residence. It is probable that the SOURCE saw such reflections.
2. SOURCE was very distaught and so very firmly convinced that she was being visited by "flying saucers". It was extremely difficult to question her. However, since the sighting was of such short duration, appearing at one moment and disappearing the next, and the light movements horizontal along with intermittent flashing, and the source saw was between her and the hillside some seventy five feet away at eye level.
