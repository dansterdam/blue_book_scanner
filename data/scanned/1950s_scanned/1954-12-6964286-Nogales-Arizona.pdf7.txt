The past two months most scientific people are seeing of reporting. a least 12 or 15. 
On 1-86 so strange event happened about 7:40 pm and was seen by several others including myself. 
The bright light traveled from the northeast to the southwest direction. it moved at a terrific speed and would disappear and reappear. When it would reappear it would be in a different position.
It made no noise and seemed to be completely under control. There were no other lights visible. It passed directly over us and we could not determine its shape or size from that distance.
After passage it disappeared going back towards the northeast. I am unable to account for this phenomena. It surely could not be an aircraft or anything else I have ever seen. 
It was so fast and maneuverable that it could not possibly have been a meteor or any known aircraft.
