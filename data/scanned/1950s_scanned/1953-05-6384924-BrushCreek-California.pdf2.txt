Miners Plan To Ambush Saucer And Little Men
BRUSH CREEK, Calif. (UP) - The miners declared that they saw a strange orange-colored flying object and saw what resembled "little men" working around it. They said they plan to ambush the object and its occupants the next time it appears. The miners claim they saw the object hovering above the remote Marble Creek area. They said they believe the object may have been searching for uranium deposits in the area. The miners asked if it would be legal for them to take arms against the object and its occupants the next time they appear. They claim they will be on the lookout for the object, which they said appeared to be about four feet in diameter, and about four feet long with a dome on top. The object, they said, was spotted on June 29.
