Gentlemen,

Someplace in the papers I have seen a report of our laboratories producing, technically, missile speeds or 350 times velocity of sound.

About 8.30 P.M. or thereabout, there appeared TWO flying objects near my home, travelling fast, one was diving NORTH from Sunnyvale towards my home, and the other was travelling South and approaching paralled. One I mentioned to a companion "Wow, that's real flying". This object suddenly disappeared as it seemed to go into a kind of maneuver that was a magic, "Wow, he's gone", and was reported as flying saucers and no following. 

I first noted these two objects through my windshield and as we were in the twilight darkness, I was one of the impression, that which caused in my mind an impression, that which caused in my mind an impression of a similarity to the searchlight beam in their movements.

Further my impression was that the two objects were flying either at a similar or at possibly 40 miles high, in which event 1000 M.P.H. would not have been an observation. 

It did not notice chance those two objects come across the sky from any particular source. They simply appeared in the sky, and went behind the horizon in very short minute, they both slowly turned and melted away. It might not be any value or use or even inconsequent, but it also is my presumption that any eye witness to sky phenomena would not claim to seen much of other. In event some of course, our Government is doing many things in avition of which I as Citizen Layman know nothing. In event some one has under observation high flying objects, we better find a way to stop its production or we will be having bugs in our structure shown to country.

Yours truly,
