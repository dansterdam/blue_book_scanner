There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

and tried to find out if you can find anything in my past history with
which you really smear me about the most you could find is that when I was
discharged from the service that on my records and I have them, it says
one thing and on the military records it says that I was discharged for malaria
Psychopalhiostlietic. But since when has any man ever been judged of havirg
any mental disorder without having gone before a ygaychiatr c board a or been
in a pgyehiatric ward for observation. I can assure you there is not one damn
thing to it. If anyone cares to go through the records they will find absolutely no clinical record, in any way. The only thing I know is
there was a Jewish Major and from what I can find out probably a Communist, 
and further checking if I find out he is a Communist I may will hound him to
the day he hits the grave. There's an argument that developed between him and
I and MI just told him what was what. As a matter of fact I told him about
a big fat bellied, doctor getting up and telling me that is
what.
