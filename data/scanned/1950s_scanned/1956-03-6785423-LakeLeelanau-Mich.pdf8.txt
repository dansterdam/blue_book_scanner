II. RELIABILITY SOURCE: According to his own account, he sighted what he believes to be a flying object on the date and in the location mentioned. He appears to be a reputable young man, reporting it due to his sense of public duty. 
III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHT: "On the 26th of March I observed some bright lights in the sky. They traveled very rapidly and changed colors while I watched them. At first the object was a steady bright white light. Then it turned to a reddish-orange color. Finally, it changed to a bluish-green shade before disappearing from view. The object was first sighted about 1:00 PM (CDT), about 45 minutes after I had stopped working in the field. I watched the lights for about 3 to 5 minutes. The brightness and color changes were very noticeable.  I noticed it in the north, about 45 degrees above the horizon. It moved in a straight line from north to south. I watched a couple of nights to be sure of what I saw."
