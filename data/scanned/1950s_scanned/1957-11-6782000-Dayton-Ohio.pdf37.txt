UFO RESEARCH ORGANIZATION

Dear Colonel Gregory:

A month ago I wrote the Air Force Press Desk requesting information on the subject of UFOs. I received a letter stating that because of the difficulties involved you could not furnish me with any information. However, I wish to write again to assure that I will. It seems that action is being taken by your office to be extremely careful about UFOs, and I don't really expect to hear from you as a result.

I request the following information: The official Air Force explanation as to the reason for the UFO seen by Mr. E in Cuyahoga County, Ohio on December 5, 1957. It was seen for several minutes. The Air Force has knowledge of it, and I would appreciate your official explanation, if any.

Occasionally I do make a thorough investigation of what I consider exceptional good UFO sightings. It is thought that the Air Force was really uninterested in their apparent attitude of being too busy or the UIO problem, and perhaps something about the case which you don't know about.

Sincerely,
