24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Would the material reflect light or appear luminous? And what other details would you include in the appearance as the object which you saw? 
It would appear to be made of a dark colored metallic material, approximately 3 feet in length and about 1 foot in diameter, with a cigar-like shape. It did not appear to reflect light, but had a dull, non-luminous appearance. The object seemed to fade out gradually rather than disappearing abruptly.
