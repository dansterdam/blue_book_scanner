The text provided in the handwritten description on the form states the following:

"About 12:30 am my neighbor called me to come to my window to look at unusual object in the sky. I went to the window and observed an object that appeared to be very large, brightly lighted and was travelling at a high rate of speed in a southern direction. The object appeared to be several thousand feet in altitude and travelling much faster than conventional aircraft. After observing the object for approximately 30 seconds it disappeared from view or its lights went out. The weather was clear and visibility was good. During the observation the object did not seem to change altitude or direction and made no noise. This is all the information I can give on the object I observed."
