Official U.S. Air Force UFO form

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 - 3 - 52
33. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object was circular, metallic in appearance, reflecting the sun's rays. It was also absolutely silent, making no sound at all. It hovered for a few seconds, then moved at tremendous speed, literally disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. The object had a circular formation and remained stationary for a short period of time. After remaining motionless for a short while, it accelerated and shot off at approximately 90Â° right angle then leveled off, maintaining a constant speed and gradually disappearing from sight. I concluded that the object I observed was most likely an unconventional aircraft or a guided missile of some kind, considering the speed and maneuverability displayed.
