UNCLASSIFIED
16 December 1957

We were working as usual on our 4:30 to 12:30 shift on the night of December 16, 1957. While working on the control panel of the sudden flare was an increased amount of motion. I was pulling at the time and didn't know what was going on. The overhead seemed to be flaring up outside. If this was someone to relieve me as do I could find out what was going on. 
On going outside I discovered lights in the sky. They appeared to be moving at a tremendous speed. They were very bright and slightly smaller than commercial aircraft. At one time I looked at it through 7x50 binoculars and it appeared the size of a dime at arm's length. It varied altitudes at almost every move. At one time it appeared to be below 1000 feet and at other times higher than 7000 feet. It appeared to be at those altitudes at seconds and fractions of a second it seemed. From the way it appeared on the scope it couldn't be a reflection off of some clouds because there were no clouds in the sky.
