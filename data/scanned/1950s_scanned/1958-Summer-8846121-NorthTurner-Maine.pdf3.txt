UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET (continued)
two saucers, one inverted upon the other and joined by a dark rim which seemed to be transparent, in the center of which was a dense glowing, luminous mass. This was situated about 5 miles N of North Turner, Maine. An unidentified female witness saw them through open window and watched them drop down to just above the trees, hovering motionless for about 5 minutes, then rise vertically so rapidly and silently, and disappear to the left and passed out of sight. She saw no occupant or ther visible source of propulsion. There was no sound. She was so excited and shaken that she did not come to the house to call anyone else to witness. EVALUATION: I checked on everything I could. I know the witness personally and they are vouched for her sincerity and excellent work. She did call the sheriff at the time and reported it, and showed only vague details. I have expressed that USAF would probably all it to be some known aircraft, but do not think this is the case, and I am convinced that what she saw was not any known aircraft at that time. Her report is being carried on as unidentified, due to the fact that she saw clearly what she described and there is no logical explanation as to what the objects could have been.
