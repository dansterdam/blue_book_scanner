Interrogation of Captain Airline Pilot - 24 November 1951
Mr. was interrogated by Lt. E. J. Ruppelt on 29 November 1951.
Mr. was Captain of Capital Airline Flight 124 on 24 November 1951. His co-pilot was . The flight was en route to Detroit, Michigan, from Richmond, Michigan.
At approximately 1335 EST (2335 Z) both pilots of the DC-3 noticed an object passing in the sky. The object seemed to be at their altitude, which was 1000 ft., and appeared to be at their airspeed. They were conversing with Detroit, who confirmed they had a target on their radar. The object passed in front of them and disappeared.
The object appeared to be 12 inches in diameter, round, "dullish blue" light source with no tail, or trail, and was comparatively bright. The object was visible for approximately 4-5 seconds until it disappeared in the distance. Its speed could not be estimated.
On landing at Grand Rapids, the pilot heard that the tower operators had also seen the object. He was interrogated and confirmed that the tower had intercepted a message from self-ridge, that the tower had picked up the object on their radar. (Comments: This radar pick-up has never been heard of before and will be investigated.)
Mr. noted that while he and the co-pilot judged the object to be at their altitude, it had been east of their location. He stated that the night was very clear except for the usual haze.
COMMENTS: All during the conversation, it was apparent that Mr. did not believe this was a meteor. He mentioned the possibility of an experimental missile. It is apparent that if this is a meteor, it has no characteristics of a normal meteor. It is apparent that he had seen all kinds of meteors and had never seen anything like this before.
