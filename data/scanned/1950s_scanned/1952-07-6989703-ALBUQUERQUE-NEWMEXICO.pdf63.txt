ten minutes after 4:37 PM MOUNTAIN WAR TIME ON 29 JULY
1952. There were 20,000 feet in the air and when I first saw them
they were coming towards me and seemed to be traveling about
400 miles an hour. As they came nearer they seemed to slow down
and then picked up speed again. I observed them for about a minute
while they were above the building. They seemed to be round
silver objects about the size of a sheet of paper. I observed them for
about so seconds turning and moving as above described.
