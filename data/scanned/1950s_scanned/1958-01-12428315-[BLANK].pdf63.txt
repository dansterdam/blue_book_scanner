The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a scanned page from a report or document. The page includes several captions describing what appear to be enlargements or close-up views of a "lamp saucer" or some type of light fixture.

The text in the document is as follows:

CUT TO LAMP SAUCER - ARTCARD /.50
WHEDON:
Enlargement reveals ...

CUT TO ENLARGEMENT OF LAMP SAUCER - 
ARTCARD /.51
... strange lines coming from the 
object ...

CUT TO FURTHER ENLARGEMENT OF LAMP 
SAUCER - ARTCARD /52
... and further enlargement show
these lines to be part of the
corner-ceiling of a room. The
saucer turning out to be a light
fixture.

CUT BACK TO EDWARDS AND WHEDON.
We get all kinds of pranks.
