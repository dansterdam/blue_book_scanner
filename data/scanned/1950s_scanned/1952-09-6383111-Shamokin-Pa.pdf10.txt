Dear Sirs

I am writing to you tell what I saw last Fall about
last days of September one night when visiting to my friends
when returning home. About 10:30 p.m. a flying object or
they call a flying discos. This flying object came down
within 50 feet from the car on this road, about 25 feet
height of the ground. It haded a light and it stood about
60 seconds in one place and it move away and it turns its
light off when it took off, This object was big and round
with a nickel plated rim around edge of this object. I
should of wrote you this before but I never did get around
to do, but as I writing you now, I cans to think about it.
If the Army wants more explaining about this object, I
be willing to do so.

Yours truly,

(Signature blacked out)
