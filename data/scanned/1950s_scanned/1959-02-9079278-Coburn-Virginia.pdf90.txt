There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The document consists entirely of handwritten text.

I will now produce the output of the text found in the document:

I remember reading in the paper that nine objects were seen in the night. Had any of you see these? 

Yes, we saw them from the Coburn football field. Through field glasses they looked like a red light which would fade to a yellowish light when the back cover was turned.

Do you think they could have been airplanes that you saw that night? Well, they could have been airplanes, because during the past couple of weeks we have been seeing airplanes, there's going in the same direction as the unidentified objects have been going. 

As soon as we have pictures or some of the written material telling more about these objects, we hope will answer the question if some of the objects that have been reported were airplanes.

What have you seen since your first sighting, Mr. _____?

That was all I saw. By the way, you expressed your interest in the size of the objects and that would be my estimate that they were a little larger than about the size of a automobile or a little larger. 

About the size of a station wagon.

Are there any additions to what has been brought out thus far that you all might have seen?

The phenomenon about which many people are excited in Coburn is a light, really an orange light, which radiates out from the top of the mountain. On several occasions this light has seemed dim. It has also seemed to go up and down from the top, silhouetting against the light. 

Was it your guess or to what was found - what would seemed to be stripes or marks or any indications that seemed odd to you that recerds, to be found and marked or characterized in any way?
