Air Intelligence Information Report
13 July 1952
PAGE 5 OF 5
UNCLASSIFIED

The text in the document states:

"Slightly larger than the ordinary star and possibly a little brighter than average, the object was observed on clear, moonless night for two or three minutes. I looked at it steadily for some time as it seemed to remain stationary, occasionally making small up and down movements. I could see no distinctive marks or features which might identify it. To me it appeared to be simply an unusual star or celestial body."

In conclusion, the report makes a brief summary of all the data reported during the investigation.

The report is signed at the bottom by the investigator and is marked as UNCLASSIFIED.
