1. The following, received from the Cleveland Detachment of this District Office, is forwarded for your information:

On 5 August 1954, Mr. ----- ----- (Cleveland, Ohio), Equipment Co., advised Special Agent ------, -------, that he had sighted an object in the sky on 2 August 1954.

On 6 August 1954, Special Agent ---- --------, interviewed Mr. ------- at his residence. Mr. ------- advised that he sighted an object in the sky at 1717 hours, 2 August 1954, which appeared to be southwest of Lorain, Ohio. At the point of sighting, he advised that he was in the vicinity of the shopping center near the Cleveland-Hopkins Airport, Lakewood, Ohio. The object appeared to be the size of approximately a shirt button. He stated that the shape of the object was round and appeared to be rotating. There was a definite trail or stream of chromatic dispersions and the object was very clear in appearance, with no distortions observed. He estimated that the object was at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet and he observed it through binoculars for approximately three (3) minutes. The object suddenly dropped vertically and came to an abrupt halt at approximately 2,000 feet, and then suddenly accelerated horizontally and disappeared. He advised that the object faded out, likening its disappearance to a TV set being turned off.
