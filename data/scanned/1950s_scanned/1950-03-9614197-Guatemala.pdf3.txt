Subject: Request your comment on the desirability of the following
release to J. P. Cahn representing "Flying Saucers" and associated press:

"In reply to your query, Captain, USAF, recently on inactive duty, did not see the "flying saucers" himself. He did turn in a report on an alleged sighting of 3 or 4 shiny objects by 5 TACA crew members. The sighting supposedly took place over Guatemala Airport on March 15, 1950.

The objects according to the information given to him by the 5 TACA crew-men, were flying at high altitude, and at very high speed. They were reported to make no noise and left no vapor trail."
