ROUTING AND RECORD SHEET

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Airborne Object
TO: District Commander, 1st District CEI (CIC) USAF, Westover AFB, Mass.

1. The research associate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., was interviewed on 9 October 1950 concerning sightings of unidentified airborne objects on 21 September 1950. He has been with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a Research Associate since 1946. His rank with the Air National Guard is that of Major.

2. The following is an extract of a letter written on 27 September 1950 to a Major TUTTLE, Staff Weather Officer, 33rd Fighter Wing, Otis Air Force Base, Mass:
"An exceedingly puzzling event occurred during the 3rd run when the planes were heading northweast at 30,000 feet. (see attached sketch) ... we picked up another plane (?) in the radar and the pilot reported that it was moving swiftly and erratically. It turned about 14Â° and appeared to be moving away at a terrific speed. The echo disappeared suddenly and then a minute later reappeared just as suddenly, went into a very tight (for the speed) turn to the right, headed back toward us and passed closely over our flight. (the sketch represents this closely). The pilot felt it went under us (perhaps went under). The sketch represents the relative positions of the two planes."
