Silver Sphere
Deflated as
Sky Mystery
A brilliant silver sphere, which
drew thousands of persons to their
windows and switchboards by the
hundreds along the West Coast
from San Francisco to San Diego
yesterday afternoon, deflated and
vanished as mysteriously as it appeared.
Aerial Visitor Identified:
An experimental weather balloon
from the Army's National Weather
Research Center at Los Angeles
Airport lost its silvered outer skin
and thus became invisible to the
naked eye, government officials
said.
Thousands watched the sphere as
it reflected the afternoon sun, changing size and color as it drifted across
the sky. Some telephoned newspaper
and radio stations demanding to
know what the silvery globe was.
The first report came from South
Pasadena about 12:45 p.m. and in
less than an hour reports came
from all over the Southland, from
Long Beach to San Fernando
Valley.
Weather men said the sphere was
a 6-foot-diameter experimental
balloon released from the National
Weather Research Center earlier
in the day for upper air observation.
As the plastic balloon rose to about
30,000 feet, its outer surface, coated with aluminum for visibility,
cracked and peeled off.
"It was an excellent experimental
balloon and we're sorry it got away
from us," one official said.
