STATEMENT OF

CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR

29 August 1952

On the night of 21 August 1952, I was on duty as a control tower 
operator when the Officer of the Day came to the tower and requested me 
to make checks on an unidentified aerial object. The Officer of the Day 
stated that he had a report from Chickasaw of a flying saucer 
sighting. The Officer of the Day and myself went out to the UHF antenna 
tower and observed the object. We could clearly see it and it appeared 
to be a greenish-white light in the sky.

At this time the GCA operator reported that he had a blip on his scope 
on a bearing about 5 miles to the north and below the scope. The Officer 
of the Day requested me to take a look through the binoculars which were 
on the roof. The only remark I can make is that the object appeared to 
be the size of a T-33 jet going to Tawson Air Force Base. Alabama. The 
Officer of the Day called the Air Force base, but they could not confirm 
the sighting, although they were on the alert. The object then disappeared 
and I could find no trace of it on any other instruments. I cannot give any 
other details except the remarks concerning color.
