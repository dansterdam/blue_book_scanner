The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a Routing and Coordination Sheet from 3 July 1953.

The text in the document is as follows:

ATC FORM 0-66 dated 24 Jun 53, Subject: (U) Unidentified Flying Object, AFCIN-11 
AFCIN-4X25
taken a trip to Venus on an invitation. 
This Center has never verified this fantastic story, and records no receipt or report concerning the purported negative.
ATIC has no record of the writer of the letter, nor purposes of correct reference, and to prevent mirsrouting, your attention is invited to the fact that subject request for information has been inappropriately termed a UFO report.

FOR THE COMMANDER:
