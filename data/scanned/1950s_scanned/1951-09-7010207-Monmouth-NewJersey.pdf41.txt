Private was a member of a radar training detachment and stationed at Fort Monmouth. He had a background in that he was a student majoring in mathematics at MIT and was to have graduated in the class of 1951.

Story as given by Private: Private stated that Mr. ___, an instructor, came out to the set he was working on and instructed him to look out for fast moving objects. He called Mr. ___ shortly after and told him he saw a fast travelling object. This observation was taken as a joke at first by Mr. ___ Private could not remember the date of this observation, except that it was in the morning and it might have been observed on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, possibly 11 or 12 September.

Private stated that his set was working satisfactorily and that he picked up the objects at 5700 mils (azimuth) and had a good return on the range scope. He put the set into automatic track and noted that the object travelled in an erratic manner. It was always in range and in the N-NE quadrant. The range was about 20,000 yds and never less than 15,000 yds. Always received a strong echo and wasn't bothered with fading. The object was extremely maneuverable. Private estimated that the speed was 500 mph. When questioned as to what he knew of anomalous propagation, he indicated that he knew of this phenomenon but believed there was no indication that weather conditions were negative this particular day for such propagation. He also stated that the signal strength was very strong and there was no variation of amplitude. He couldn't say how fast the object was climbing but estimated that the rate of climb was 9000-27000 ft per minute. He stated that he thought the object had high acceleration.
