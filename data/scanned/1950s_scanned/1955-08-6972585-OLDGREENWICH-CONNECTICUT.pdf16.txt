Hopkinsville Case: The report given to you that the incident was reported to "Stanford Field" gave us a little trouble. There is no Stanford or Stewart Field. The nearest AFB is Sewart in Tullahoma, Tennessee, quite some distance away. Therefore, our plan to contact the nearest AFB to Hopkinsville for particilars will be kept in abeyance pending receipt of the following information: What field was the incident reported to? Date or sighting or incident? Name the family? Would appreciate if you can help us out on this, Dr. Hynek. It seems the scrap of paper which some of this information was taken was lost or misplaced.
