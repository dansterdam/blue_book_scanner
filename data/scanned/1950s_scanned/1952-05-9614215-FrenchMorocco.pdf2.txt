UNIDENTIFIED FLOATING OBJECT
FRENCH MOROCCO
27 MAY 1952

AREA: MOGADOR, FRENCH MOROCCO
WITNESS: ARARI P. TOOTLIAN, Colonel, USAF

SUMMARY: (Witness reports details of observation) On 27 May 1952 between 1330 and 1500 hours, Colonel Tootlian observed a large, round, metallic object floating at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet above sea level. The object was under observation for a period of from twenty to thirty minutes.

"The sea was very calm at this time without any white caps at all. The tide had started to ebb and the sun was still clear of the horizon."

"I made a line of sight on the object with reference to three other objects (sea markers) and it did not move during the time of observation."

"I have over nine hundred hours of flying time over water and between months in the Pacific Theatre. I have seen many phenomena." 

"It was impossible to locate the object at 18002 but was unable to locate it."

"On the morning of 29 May 1952 at 0730Z I was still unable to locate it, although the condition of the sea and visibility were nearly the same."
