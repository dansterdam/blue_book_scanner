III. CONCLUSIONS
A. The 115 was radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was most probably a balloon launched by the Wright Field laboratory for a routine weather observation.
B. The 1050 was radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was a weather balloon.
C. The 1236 was radar sighting on 11 September 1951 which was determined to be a weather balloon.
It was probably possible that all three sightings were the same type of aircraft, namely weather balloons, since there was a pronounced radar activity and the weather at the time indicated weather conditions suitable for this type of aerial vehicle.
