The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon (skyline) and instructions to imagine how high the object was above the horizon when it was first seen. The smaller sketches show the position of the object when it was first seen ("A") and when it was last seen ("B").

Transcribing the text:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
