The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch drawing labeled "ARTCARD W/31 - (WHITTED SKETCH)". The text describes the sketch and the event it depicts, including the observation of an unidentified object by two pilots, for which no satisfactory explanation was provided by scientists or experts.

CUT TO: ARTCARD W/31 - 
(WHITTED SKETCH)
EDWARDS:
And this is the sketch drawn
by co-pilot Whitted. Same general
shape ... double row of what
appear to be windows....no wings....

(CUT BACK TO EDWARDS)
What was it? To this day....according
to the two pilots involved...
no logical explanation offered
by scientists, by experts...fits
the bill. People may argue about 
what they saw...but they can't
deny that they saw something...
something that these men with
thousands of hours of flying
experience had never seen before
...and haven't seen since!

Is there an explanation...a
reasonable, natural explanation
