BY 1130 I head other aircraft in the area, but the sound was 
completely different. Several times I were out, but could never 
see any. For this reason I feel the strange craft was MUCH LARGER
AND MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY OF THESE AND PRODUCED A MUCH GREATER NOISE.

The day was hazy, very slight breeze, warm enough to be out without
a sweater or coat. The craft was white while visible in steady layers.

I can best describe the altitude in terms of 6 clock.  Standing at
the center, and looking between the ten and eleven, the object was
about three inches in diameter.  I could see the entire circular
edge, with the silvery spokes brightening up and down thru the center,
but nothing which changed the circular shape.  It was seeming ly still
for the two seconds during which I observed it, but it was very distinctly.
Yet it was gone so quickly from sight though not so very far off.  

I have been one of those specialists who laughed about "Flying Saucers".
Yesterday I heard them discussed and my thought was not to discover
a "Flying Saucer", but to identify aircraft for my own satisfactio n.
In almost ten years working on newspapers, I have not had such 
an exciting or unsuspecting experience.  I know just how incredible
it must appear, but please accept it as true, and I hope there are others
who saw it to substantiate my report.

Very truly,
