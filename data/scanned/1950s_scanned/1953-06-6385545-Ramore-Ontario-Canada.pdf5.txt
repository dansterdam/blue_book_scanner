STATEMENT

At 2345 EDST 30 June 1953 I observed a thin glowing line in the sky to the North. This line appeared from the North to the Southeast and as it moved it began to grow larger in the vertical direction, but still maintaining its horizontal size. It had assumed an egg shape - point on top.

It was a strange color, had no dark spots, and looked like a luminous object trailing some sort of projection. As it moved to the East it appeared to be wobbling and gyrating wildly. The edges were smooth and it had a shimmering effect.

At the time the sky had broken clouds and it was rather windy.
The moon was not visible during this occurrence.
