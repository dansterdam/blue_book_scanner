There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with questions about the observations of stars, the moon, and unidentified objects.

9. IF you saw the subject at NIGHT, TWILIGHT, or DAWN, what did you notice concerning the STARS and MOON?
9.1 STARS (Circle One):  a. A lot   b. A few   c. Many   d. Don't remember
9.2 MOON (Circle One):  a. Full moon   b. Full moonlight   c. No moonlight - pitch dark   d. Don't remember

The document then continues with a series of questions about the observed object, its brightness, movement, and appearance, as well as whether any optical devices were used to observe it.
