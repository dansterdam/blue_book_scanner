Technical Intelligence Center is not to investigate "Flying Saucer" reports, it is charged with the prevention of technological surprise by a foreign country. All enemy aircraft, guided missiles, etc. and any equipment related to these articles is studied at the Air Technical Intelligence Center. 

The document discusses ATIC's function of telling what you're protecting against. It discusses a hypothetical scenario of Russia flying some totally unheard of new type of aircraft across the California coast, and how ATIC would try to intercept and identify it. 

The document then talks about Unidentified Flying Objects, stating that if ATIC is able to collect the facts on an incident and identify the reported object, it is no longer an unidentified object and ATIC is not interested. However, if ATIC is unable to identify the reported object, a complete report shall be forwarded, as it may be some type of weather effect and vectored the aircraft toward it.

The document is classified as RESTRICTED UNCLASSIFIED.
