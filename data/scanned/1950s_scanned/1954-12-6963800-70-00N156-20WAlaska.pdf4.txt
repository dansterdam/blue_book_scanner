SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in a final one-sentence paragraph. List enclosures at lower left. Details of report on AF Form 112—Part II)

1. A B-47 crew, while flying in bomber formation in vicinity of 71-CON – 156-20N
at 30,000ft, between the hours of 1620Z and 1705Z, 12 December 1954, reports
sighting of UFOB approximately three miles ahead of the aircraft, waning in
color from blinking red to steady white, and totally dissolving with approach
of daylight after forty-five minutes of intermittent observation.

2. The object reported is without configuration or performance, and though it could
easily be mistaken as a fighter-type aircraft at first sight, is is believed,
after preliminary analysis, to be a celestial body or the reflection of such
a body.

                                                       R-35501
