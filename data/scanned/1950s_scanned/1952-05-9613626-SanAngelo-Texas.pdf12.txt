AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects, San Angelo, Texas
DATE OF REPORT: 5 June 1952
DATE OF INCIDENT: 29 May 1952
PLACE: San Angelo, Texas
INTERROGATION OF: Lt James T. Wood, 9 Intel. Offr, Interrogation of BB-36 crew members

SUMMARY: This report was received by this headquarters. It was thought to be of sufficient importance to forward for evaluation. All squadron pilots on this date reported sight of several bright objects which were manoeuvring at high speed in the area.

The attached photographs prove the authenticity of the report as observed and the only explanation of the objects that can be reached at this headquarters is the impossibility which that have been established from the examination. The objects do not fit out this possibility, but since the visual sighting by the New Mexico testing station, this does not rule out this possibility, and since the wind is reported to be 1,000 ft due to 25 knots, it seems unlikely that balloon caused this report.
