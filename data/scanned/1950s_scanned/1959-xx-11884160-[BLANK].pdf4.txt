The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The Aerial Phenomena Advisory Panel, at its regular meeting on 27 July 1954, reviewed the final summary of reported aerial sightings. The report states that the current program of UFO investigation remains open to serious potential criticism by the public since possible evidence of inexplicable phenomena could arise from close examination. It mentions that there have been some cases where military and civilian crew members, and passengers, witnessed an unexplained sighting of their American Airlines plane on 25 February 1959.

The panel recommends that even after the lapse of six months, it is urgent that the investigation in this case be intensified by a full report to be made to the panel at an early date. It further recommends that the earliest possible moment when, in its judgment, a case warrants such immediate investigation, it should be viewed with its significance or scientific value.
