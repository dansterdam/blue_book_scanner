PREPARED BY: Capt ROBERT P. MASCHAR, F-12, FWS, USAF
STATION: McGuire AFB, NEW JERSEY
DATE: 8 Dec 1952
COPY NO.: 1

DIS., New Jersey, 6038 February Resgtisrrent. A approval: AT 1750-1830 EST.

Qn 8 December 1952 at approx. 1725 an object or light appeared bright in the sky approximately 1700-1930 EST.

Imitatly 15 degrees to the bright object in a northerly direction was another object or light appearing. With the aid of a landmark, the observer was able to determine that the objects travelled in a straight course approximately 8 to 10 degrees of arc.

The object seemed to be revolving from right to left with what appeared to be the tall light intensity, increasing and diminishing. The color of the light varied from white to yellow with no red patterns observed.

The size of the object never seemed to change during the hour of observation but the change in intensity seemed to swell the light from 1/8th inch circle (original size) to a 3/8th inch circle. Flared edges (1" x) . Weather at the time of the sighting was clear and visibility was unlimited. (See Point 6 on Inclosure #2). Distance and altitude not computed.
