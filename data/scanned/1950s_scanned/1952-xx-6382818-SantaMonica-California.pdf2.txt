The photograph shows a night scene with a large, distinct spherical object visibly brighter than its surroundings, positioned in the upper right area of the image. Below the spherical object, there appears to be a landscape that is dark and textured, which could be clouds or a terrestrial feature. The scene is poorly lit overall, aside from the bright object, making other details difficult to discern.
