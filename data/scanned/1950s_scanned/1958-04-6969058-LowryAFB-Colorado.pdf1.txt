PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 6-2-58
2. LOCATION: 
Lowry AFB, Colorado
3. DATE/TIME GROUP: Oatc: 6-2-58 Time: 1430 Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual 
5. PHOTOS: Yes
6. SOURCE: Military
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 4-5 mintues
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
9. COURSE: At first appeared to be a falling leaf or small bird, then seemed to be a fast moving, white-silvery object descending rapidly in two parts or at least two separate appearances in succession. 
10. CRISP SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: As seen in two parts or at least two separate appearances in succession, the object appeared to be a small, rapidly descending white-silvery object, possibly tumbling or rotating. It appeared to be dividing or separating into two parts. The second part seemed to disappear or go out of sight at a considerable distance.
11. COMMENTS: This appears to be an unusual sighting reported by a reliable observer who is apparently an experienced observer of small aerial objects. The object was seen to appear and disappear in rapid succession in a manner suggesting some type of division or separation. The "1958 Gamma sighting" referred to may relate to this type of unusual phenomenon.
