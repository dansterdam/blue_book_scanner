SUBJECT: Sighting of unidentified aerial objects 

DATE: 7 December 1958

Dear Lt Ruppelt of Technical Information:

This concerns a sighting of unidentified aerial objects near Russellville, Alabama, on 26 November 1958. 

On the above date, about 1:00 AM CST, Mr. R. D. Johnson, an employee of the Alabama Power Company, was driving alone in his car on Highway 43 near Russellville, Alabama. He observed what he described as a "white, brilliantly lighted object" hovering over the highway. This object was approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter and about 10 to 15 feet off the ground. It remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then moved rapidly to the northeast out of sight. 

Mr. Johnson stated that he had never seen anything like this before and that he was quite surprised and frightened by the incident. He did not report the sighting immediately, but mentioned it to his supervisor the following day.

It is requested that this information be turned over to the proper authorities for investigation, as Mr. Johnson feels that the incident warrants further study.

Sincerely,
W.L.C.
Lt Col, USAF
Chief, Russellville Resident Detachment
