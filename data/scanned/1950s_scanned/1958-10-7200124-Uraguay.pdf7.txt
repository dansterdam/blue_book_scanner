The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but rather features text in Spanish.

The text reads:

INFORME

CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION DE OBJETOS VOLADORES INDENTIFICADOS

SERVICIO DE INTELIGENCIA-FUERZA AEREA URUGUAYA

Which translates to:

REPORT

CENTER FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

INTELLIGENCE SERVICE-URUGUAYAN AIR FORCE
