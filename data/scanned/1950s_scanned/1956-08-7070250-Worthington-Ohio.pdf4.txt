Fairhaven, Massachusetts

Case 202, Fairhaven, Mass., Aug. 27, 1956â€”Miss Norma Mello tells of an observation made by her aunt and uncle. She writes: "At about 8:25 p.m. Mrs. P. W., who was standing at the east window, called to Mr. P. W. to come and see the object which was motionless, appeared to be about the size of a grapefruit. 'There was a small reddish dish light to the right of it,' and Mr. Bence continued watching it until it faded away about one-half hour later. Twenty-five minutes later, Mrs. Bence looked again and the object was back, horizontally back and forth in the same area. About 5 a.m. it faded away as if into a mist."
