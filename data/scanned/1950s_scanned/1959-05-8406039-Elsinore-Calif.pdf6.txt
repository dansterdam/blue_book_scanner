Dear Mr. 

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter
of 17 January 1960 concerning an unidentified flying object
sighting and your interest in this field.

The file was carefully checked by the photographic
branch of the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center at
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, and the UFO was not considered
visually identified through this analysis.

This sighting did not have sufficient information to
allow a valid conclusion.

Thanks for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

Enclosures LAWRENCE J. TACKER
