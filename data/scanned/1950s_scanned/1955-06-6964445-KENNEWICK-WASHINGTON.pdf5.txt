1. DETAILS OF SIGHTING
2. TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE.
3. 5 DEC 1956
4. COMMANDING GENERAL, 4602D AIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SQUADRON (AIS), AND AIR FORCE BASE, COLORADO
5. THIS CENTER IN RECEIPT OF UFOB REPORT DATED 12 JUNE 1956, SUBMITTED THROUGH THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, KENNEWICK, WASHINGTON IN 1955, COPY ATTACHED.
6. BASED ON THE LIMITED DATA SUBMITTED, AN EVALUATION OF THE REPORT, PLUS A GENERAL CHECK OF ACTIVITIES OF THE AREA IN QUESTION, IS SUBMITTED.
a. THE UFO SIGHTING WAS REPORTED ONE YEAR AFTER THE INCIDENT. THE DATA INDICATES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN IMMEDIATE AND ON-THE-SPOT INVESTIGATION.
b. IT APPEARS ODD THAT AN OBJECT AS LARGE AS DESCRIBED, AND APPEARING AS LOW ALTITUDE OVER A FAIRLY LARGE TOWN DURING A "METEOR NIGHT", WAS NOT OBSERVED OR REPORTED BY OTHERS.
c. KENNEWICK, WASHINGTON, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 75 MILES NORTHWEST OF PORTLAND, OREGON, HAS A ESTABLISHED U.S. WEATHER BUREAU BALLOON-LAUNCHING FACILITIES WHERE FREQUENT BALLOON LAUNCHINGS ARE SCHEDULED EVERY SIX HOURS.
d. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY NINE TO TEN MILITARY AIRDROMES AND MISSILE SITES IN THE VICINITY OF KENNEWICK, BETWEEN YAKIMA AND KENNEWICK.
e. RADIOSONDES BALLOONS LAUNCHED AT NIGHT FROM MILITARY AIRFIELDS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE A GLOW FROM INSTRUMENTS AS THEY REFLECT THE SEARCH LIGHT BEAMS, THUS CREATING A VISUAL EFFECT WHEN REFLECTING ON THE SURFACE OF THE BALLOON.
f. THE GENERAL WIND DIRECTION ON THE NIGHT OF THE SIGHTING INDICATED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER TYPE OF BALLOON. MANY TYPES OF WEATHER, RESEARCH, OR SPECIAL BALLOONS THAT MAY BE LAUNCHED PERIODICALLY, AND DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS, WILL REMAIN AT A LOW ALTITUDE CAUSING AGAIN A "FLOATING" OBJECT AND IRRESPONSIBLE.
g. IT IS APPARENT THAT J. RICHARDSON IS A FLYING SAUCER ENTHUSIAST WHO HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED ON THE SUBJECT BEFORE, AND SAUCERS FOR YEARS AND HAS "SEEN EVERYTHING" ON THE SUBJECT CONFIRMS HIS BELIEFS.
