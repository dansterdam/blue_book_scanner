SUBJECT: Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft.
1. One object, unusually bright and a brilliant white, appeared to be three or four times as large as a star. It was observed in a general easterly direction from the observer's position. It had a red and left tail or flight trailing; no sound appeared to have accompanied its speed, as well as a pattern of flight, although it would zig zag in an abrupt fashion. Observer stated his opinion that the object did not appear to be conventional aircraft and in his judgment displayed convincing traits of planning and maneuvering ability, which discounted theory of its being a balloon.
2. Observation made on 12 January 1951, approximately 2200 EST.
3. Visual sighting on corner of X and D Streets, Stewart Air Force Base. The observation point was on hill of approximately 100 feet altitude.
4. Observer was 2d Lt., headquarters and Headquarters Squadron, Stewart Air Force Base, New York. No previous aerial observer experience.
5. Visibility excellent; ceiling high with scattered clouds.
6. Observer stated on 11 January 1951 at approximately the same time, he noticed this brilliant object in same general position, but was in sight only several seconds before it descended and was blocked from view.
