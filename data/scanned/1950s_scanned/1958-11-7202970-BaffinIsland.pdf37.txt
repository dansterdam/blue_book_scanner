There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. The image shows only typed text, which I will now attempt to transcribe:

8 November 1952
Purportedly Sighted

Big Green Flash
Light: Brilliant

This document appears to describe some kind of sighting, possibly of a "big green flash" or "light: brilliant" event. However, without any additional contextual information, I cannot provide any further details or analysis about the content.
