Text from the document:

"Elf in a Mid-Continent Airlines Craft said 'No wings were straight, not a swell- nothing like one of our jet bambers, and there were no jet ports visible.'  James J. Stechscher, of Spence Air and one of the 11 passengers aboard, said 'As we took off from the Sioux City field at 6:20 o'clock,' Vintner said, 'the tower called in to say something was wrong with the flight in the sky.'
'We spotted the light and it seemed to be hovering, we followed it,' he said. 'Then the light went out just like that,' he said, snapping his fingers to illustrate.  Vintner said his DC-3 was doing 120 miles an hour and the other craft was going faster than that in the opposite direction.  'I just turned my head from watching him go past our wing when there he was again, about 20 feet to our left, going in the same direction we were,' he said.
'They mystified him because 'we just can't turn as fast.'  This strange plane flew 'very, very fast' and 'at a terrific speed.'
The strange plane flew below the DC-3 and Vintner said he checked his compass and found the plane was flying southeast at Omaha.  He said he checked the airport and found no air-force jet planes scheduled in that area."
