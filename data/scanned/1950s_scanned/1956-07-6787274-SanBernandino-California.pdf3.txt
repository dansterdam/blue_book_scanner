Lt. ATIC, Subj.: Analysis of UFO Report, IR-01-56

This will assist in determining the sun's position at that time and whether the sun was out among other factors, as the statement of the source to the contrary notwithstanding, as our case files often disclose.

a. The direction and angle of elevation which the camera was facing. Not given in this.

b. The type, make, lens size of the camera, shutter speed, and exposure settings used. In all cases where the source states he does not know what f-stop or speed used, the minimum and maximum scale of those cameras gradients should be obtained, and drives in the AP 112.

c. Type of film used.

f. There an object is not shown in mid air, as in this case, determine whether any object or means just outside the picture area could have been used to support the supposed "flying saucer" which may have been misidentified in this instance.

g. Consider the observer's age (13, in this case); his opinion or interest regarding "flying saucers"; whether any motion pictures of flying saucers were recently shown in his location, and whether he has done any extensive reading on flying saucers or his interest sparked chiefly by some information published in the newspaper of a recent date. Investigators must consider the plausible and possible inaccuracies of such very brief and unconfirmed statements.

h. Refer to AIF 200-2, "Intelligence Photography," for guidance on collection involving photography, with specific reference to pertaining to paragraphs 17 and 18. This manual is also used by investigative units of the army, navy and FBI.
