THE KALISZEWSKI-MOORE STATEMENTS
A U.S. Air Corp dispatcher, dating Minneapolis, Minn., April 13, 1949
The statements of two individuals, Kaliszewski & Moore, claim they saw:
KALISZEWSKI'S OWN WORDS WERE: "I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS - IT WAS SPACE SHIPS FLYING AT TERRIFIC SPEEDS, I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE." THEY WERE SIMILAR, TERRIFIC, FAST. THEY HAD A BLUE LIGHT SHINING FROM THE CRAFT.
CHARLES U. MOORE, AN AERONAUTICAL ENGINEER, CONFIRMED SIGHTING THE OBJECTS.
HIS COMMENT: "I WAS ABOUT TO START MY CAR AND SUDDENLY I OBSERVED A PECULIAR CIRCULAR GOLD-COLORED OBJECT PASS ACROSS THE SKY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT WAS ABOUT 100-200 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT DISAPPEARED IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS OF OBSERVATION."
THE AIR FORCE'S BALLOON EXPLANATION WAS NOW A COMPLETE BUST.
