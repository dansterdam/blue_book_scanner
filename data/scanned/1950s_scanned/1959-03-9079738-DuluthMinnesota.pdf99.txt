The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the top shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) with an object above it. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine the object was above the horizon when they first saw it, and to indicate its position using the curved line.

The lower part of the image contains two smaller sketches. The larger one shows a road or path leading towards a horizon, with mountains or hills in the background. The smaller sketch on the right shows a more distant view of the horizon and landscape.

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
