1. The following information was received by this office from Headquarters Camp Atterbury, Indiana:

On 13 July 1952, a civilian pilot with a private plane reported sighting an unconventional aircraft at about 3,000 feet altitude over Crawfordsville, Indiana, at about 1930 hours local time. The pilot stated in substance: "At dusk about 2030 hours, 12 July 52, I was flying alone in my private plane in the area of Crawfordsville. As I was approaching the Crawfordsville area, I noticed an object moving rapidly at a high speed from the northwest to the southeast. The object appeared to be about 200 feet long, elliptical in shape, and brilliant in color, somewhat like a neon sign. The object descended to about 3,000 feet and passed directly overhead at that altitude. I was sitting in the car with my wife. No other lights were visible on the object as it passed overhead. The object descended rapidly to an altitude of 500 to 600 feet and continued on its course toward the southeast at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object descended so rapidly that my wife did not have sufficient time to see the object." This sighting was relayed to this office by military and civilian personnel stationed at Camp Atterbury, Indiana, as a credible observation. The observations are based on my experience of eight years as a pilot in the Air Force Reserve.

"The above information in regard to time, appearance, and speed has been confirmed by military and civilian personnel stationed at Camp Atterbury, who observed the phenomenon as described."

2. This office contemplates no further action in this matter.
