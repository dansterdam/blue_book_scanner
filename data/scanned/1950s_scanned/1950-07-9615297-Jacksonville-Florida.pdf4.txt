Office Memorandum - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
TO: Lt Colonel Fullerton
FROM: Colonel Failing
SUBJECT: Investigation of "Flying Saucer" Reports
DATE: 19 July 1950

The text in the document states that an attached memo dated 14 Jul 50 has been reviewed, and although it appears that too much time was spent on the investigation, it is suggested that a detailed review be made of the case history to see if there is any incident that has not been reported by other personnel on the same incident. It also states that any additional evidence contracting or confirming the same incident should be reported by a number of people, and that the excessive contacts can only be kept at a minimum if information in these matters can be limited.
