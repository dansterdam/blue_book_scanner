SUBJECT: Unusual Sighting

TO: Director of Intelligence
Headquarters, United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

On Monday night, 10 September 1951, I was flying as co-pilot in a C-47 on a local flight from Andrews Air Force Base. At approximately 10 o'clock I would estimate our position was 10 miles northeast of Andrews at 6000' on a course of 230Â°.

At this time I saw an object ahead of us at approximately 8000' altitude, 30 miles southeast of Andrews, apparently traveling in excess of 600 and 900 miles per hour. The light was of great intensity and magnitude and seemed to be white-hot. I would estimate its speed to be in excess of 500 miles per hour. The total time that I observed this light was in the neighborhood of 2 seconds. When the light disappeared, there were no trailing lights or no outline of any object visible.

I would estimate the trajectory was either parallel to the group of slightly downward. I have never before encountered anything which would lead me to believe the exhaust from a rocket.
