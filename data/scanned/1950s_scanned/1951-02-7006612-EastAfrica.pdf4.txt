FEBRUARY 10, 1951, Claimed by Capt. West African Air Force Cpl. Woodward, and several other civilians, at Kano, West Africa about 9:00 p.m. Local Time.

Captain Westlower, of the West African Air Force, and Cpl. Woodward were on duty at the airport at Kano, West Africa, on the evening of February 10, 1951. Captain Westlower had just relieved another officer who had been on duty, and was going to stay at the airport until 7 p.m. normally. However, as they were working, an object was sighted in the sky at about 9:00 p.m.

At first it appeared to be a star, but it soon became apparent that it was moving rapidly, and was heading in their direction from the northeast. As it approached them it slowed down and appeared to hover directly over the airport at a height estimated to be about 500 feet. It was observed for about 10 minutes or more.

During the time it was under observation, the object remained stationary, except for slight irregular movements, and a faint reddish glow was observed around its outer edges. No sound was heard from the object. Several other civilians, who were on duty at the airport, also observed the object. To all of them it appeared to be circular in shape, and about 30 to 40 feet in diameter.

Captain Westlower estimated the thing was over 300 miles per hour when first sighted, but slowed down to a complete hover over the airport. He stated that his impression was that the object was under intelligent control. He said it was easily observed, and that there was no doubt as to what they had seen. The object finally shot away to the northeast at a terrific speed.
