Text extracted from the document:

On 6 December 1957 at approximately 2015 hours, a USAF, T, OKAMOTO, Pilot of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing at Chitose AB, Hokkaido, Japan, observed an unidentified object. He first thought it to be a star, only it was several times brighter and much larger. The object appeared to be stationary and emitting a flashing light. He observed it for about 5 minutes. The movement could be detected from the light and out of the light and out of the light slight movement could be detected. At the same time the object seemed to be tumbling - the light getting brighter and dimmer. When first observed the object was about 90 degrees above the horizon. During the observation it lowered to about 45 degrees. The object finally disappeared in the direction of the horizon.
