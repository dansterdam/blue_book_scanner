MEMORANDUM REPORT to Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE 

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/09, February 1951

1. At 0055Z, 10 February 1951, I was the Plane Commander of Flight 125/09 from Bermuda to Argentina. We were climbing to 10,000 feet on an instrument flight plan. Our position at 10/0552 was 41-40 North, 50-03 West, or about 500 miles southeast of Newfoundland and at 10,000 feet on a standard instrument flight plan. Our speed was 110 knots. The weather was clear with about 60 miles visibility and the wind was variable at about 40 knots.

2. I was in the cabin of the plane checking the passengers when one of the navigators, Lieutenant N. 7. COONE, came up and reported to this phenomena. I watched it for a minute and went forward to the cockpit to get a better view. Upon reaching the cockpit, I took the plane off of the automatic pilot and turned to a true heading of 290° in pursuit of the object. The object kept on a heading of about 290° and was at about the horizon in a very short time.

3. It would appear to the speed to be well over 1500 miles per hour, and the diameter to be at least 300 feet.

4. My first view of it resembled a huge fiery orange disc on its edge. It then appeared to go into a vertical position as it flew off overhead. It was throwing off a fiery trail as it went over the horizon. I aimed the plane to go after it but it was gone in a very short time.

5. At 10/0345, I called Gander Tower on VHF and asked them if Gander had any information on an unidentified object in the vicinity. They stated they had none but would investigate. When we landed at Argentina at 15/2202, we were interrogated by Capt. D. N. PARTLETT. Apparently LCDR WASHINGTON, British TCA, Argentina, was flying on the right side at the time of the incident.
