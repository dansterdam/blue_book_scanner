The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text description of a "sun dog" sky display that was observed on May 24, 1954. The text describes the phenomenon as a "technical flying saucer" and how it was reported as such in the local newspaper, The Daily News.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
23 MAY 1954
Dayton, Ohio

MAY 24, 1954

'SUN DOG' NAME GIVEN
SKY DISPLAY
That kinda' of colorful rays seen 
in the skies around noon Mon-
day wasn't a technical flying saucer, 
it was just a "sun dog" a fairly 
common occurrence according to 
Weatherman Emie Gillam. It is caused by the sun 
shining on the ice crystals that 
form in this clouds. Looks pretty 
while it lasts though, don't it!
Someone thought it did; called The Daily
News for the explanation.
