The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document regarding objects observed following an MX 776A test on April 27, 1950. The document does not contain any photographs, but rather describes the observations in text form.

Objects observed following MX 776A test of 27 April 1950
1. According to conversation between Col. Baynes and Capt. Bryant, the following information is submitted directly to Lt. Albert.
2. Film from station P10 was read, resulting in azimuth and elevation angles being recorded on four objects. In addition, size or image on film was recorded.
3. From this information, together with a single azimuth angle from station MF, the following conditions were drawn:
a. The objects were at an altitude of approximately 150,000 feet.
b. The objects were over the Holloman range between the base and Tularosa Peak.
c. The objects were approximately 30 feet in diameter.
