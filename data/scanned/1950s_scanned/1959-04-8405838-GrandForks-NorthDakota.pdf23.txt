1. Following is a written account of a telephone call between this directorate and the UFO Center. This is the information offered to the Center.

A call was received at the Grand Forks Air Force Base Operations on Wednesday morning, April 13. It was from a farmer, N.D., telephone number ...his farm is located 7 1/2 miles north and 2 miles east of McHenry. The farm is approximately 1 1/2 miles away from a Minuteman II missile site, T-37, and this is the reason he made the report. Sometimes between 3-7 April 1955, he made a sighting at 8 p.m. in the evening. All he could tell was that the object resembled glass balls in a ring and made a sound like a farm tractor backfiring. He didn't make the report at first, but later changed his mind because of the Minuteman II site.
