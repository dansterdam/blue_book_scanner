velocity on the order of two to fifteen miles per hour would have bee
involved in the sighting. This light passed directly over the observers heading east to west at an altitude of app a few hundred feet. The light was steady and white in color and about the siz
a medium sized airplane. It seemed to be about 250 feet from the observer
straight line path and was in sight for about a minute. The observers
thi  was some sort of observation satellite, but they were not controlled b
operation.

2. The object whose size was clearly directed against the moon, traveling at hi
speed and described as saucer-shaped and much larger than either of the previously 
described objects. It was observed to be saucer-shaped in appearance and of such a size that it blocked out abo
third of the diameter of the moon when directly in front of it. The object appeared 
to be traveling at a high rate of speed and was observed for only a few seconds. No other details are known.

3. An object (a) of unknown shape and size. (b) It was observed by a single obs
 was estimated to be about 100 feet in diameter. (c) It was observed as it appeared to fl
o reflect the sunlight, but was not directed in the manner of a reflecting objectarth. The object was observed for several minutes.  It may have been less tha
1000 feet in altitude.

10. It is not known what these objects were, but our best analysis indicate
they were neither birds, aircraft, balloons, nor any other known celestial objec
s they are unidentified aerial phenomena.
