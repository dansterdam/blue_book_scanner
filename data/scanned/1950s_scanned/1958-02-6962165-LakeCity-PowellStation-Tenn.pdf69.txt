MEMO ROUTING SLIP
NAME OR TITLE: MAJOR L. J. TACKER
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: SAFIS-3 - OSAF
REMARKS: Larry - The Air Force has never received a report on this incident. 
About several days ago there was a dispatch or news item on the United Press ticker to the effect that military-type rockets had been sighted over Oates, Ten., and it was concluded that the story caused some excitement to the village military authorities. Apparently this story caused no military action to be taken, nor is it recalled.
