Unidentified aerial object sighted in Eastern sky, from eastern portion of Cincinnati 
(Madison Place) at approximately 10:30 Saturday, August 16, 1952.

SITUATION: Sitting on porch, scanning skies. Sighted object cannonballing 
from apex of neighbor's roof.

WEATHER: Mostly clear with intermittent cloud masses. Humid.

DESCRIPTION:
   size: Large. An estimate: quarter size of a full moon.
   shape: Globular. Of clearly defined outline; posterior, the same, without luminescent, gaseous or scintillating trail.
   color: Brilliant luminous white; without aura, haze or scintilla. No shaded portion in center noted, as in August 13th sighting.
   altitude: Object approximately less than 5000 feet.
   course: Flying due North in positive direct course with a lifting tendency of 
approximately 20 degrees. At no time did the object fall in arc or 
trajectory.
   speed: Faster than any known jet plane, slower perceptably than the usual meteor. Time lapse from initial point of vision to sudden extinction: 
3 seconds.

OTHER CHARACTERISTICS: No sound whatever. No spinning motion perceptable. Object 
maintained steady course without diminishing in size or brilliance; 
then as controlled by switch, the light cut out instantaneously.

EVALUATION: First impression: a large meteor. Still not discounting the meteor 
theory in later evaluation, however there remain certain anomalous 
features, viz: 
(1) Its steady uplift in flight without trajectory 
(2) No luminescent trail
(3) Low altitude
(4) Its phenomenally sudden extinction!
