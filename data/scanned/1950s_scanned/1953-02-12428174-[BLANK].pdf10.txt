The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a text document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

cameras, however, and consequently have not put them out in the field. The grasping it as a rather touchy piece of equipment and are having trouble getting it to stand up under certain conditions.

We realize that this is not a fool-proof measure. These cameras are not a piece of highly developed scientific equipment, but we do hope that we may be able to obtain some information.

Other Instrumentation

The possibilities of more extensive instrumentation has been discussed in detail. Many suggestions for more complete cameras, special aircraft instrumentation, and other detection devices have been studied. It is possible that a study contract for such instrumentation may be let, but no actual program will be started now. The cost of such a program would cut-depth the results.

Conclusion

In concluding this briefing it can again be stated that in none of the reports so far received are there any indications that the reported objects are a direct threat to the United States, nor is there any proof that any of the reports received have been reports of any radically new unknown material objects.

We admit we cannot explain every report but we believe we know enough about the unknowns to say they are not anything to invoke undue speculation.

The project will be continued. Even if a system for the "fool proof" explanation of every sighting is developed it will continue because you never know what may happen in the future.

The one threat that could come out of this problem of "flying saucers" is a "wolf, wolf" situation. Some people take an exceedingly "dim view" of such reports and use no logic in trying to explain them. We do not want to clutter
