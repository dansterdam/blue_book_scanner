Based on the image, there does not appear to be a photograph present. The image shows a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, which contains handwritten text describing an unidentified flying object sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

This is a further follow up on the information I have written on page 6 part 32. As the object accelerated to the westwards it seemed to rotate and accelerated to a jerk like shifting. First then there was a flash, then it was gone. Also the object was sharply defined, as if it was slightly luminous. It seemed slightly transparent like its impression as the dark. I will never forget as long as I have seen anything like it before.
