1. - The time has arrived for X1 to take a good look at what DIN-4
is planning about these UFORS.

2. - The enclosed memorandum from AFOIN-4 represents their efforts 
to develop a distinct change of policy on this subject. This memo 
file also represents an attempt to align the new program with stated
policy of AFOIN and SAFPS.

3. Briefly, ATIC wants to accomplish the following (See AFR 200-2):
a. More clearly assign and define the responsibility for 
investigation to ADC.
b. More clearly assign and define the responsibility for 
analysis and evaluation to AFOIN-4. 
c. More clearly assign and define the responsibility for 
public information to SAFPS.
d. More clearly establish coordination between AFOIN and
AFODC (COLONEL J. C. NORBLOM) on this subject. (See HOI 11-37
attached.)
