AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 7-h, 46002d AISS
Commanders of the Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the phenomenon observed on 22/06/51 at Sirius and Procyon when viewed below an angle of 10-15 degrees may have been an optical illusion or a refraction from the celestial bodies, Sirius and Procyon.

2. The fact is generally known among astronomers that the two stars mentioned are bright and high in the heavens, the diffraction-colored fringes appearing clear when viewed on a clear night.

a. The persisting nature of the UFO sightings augments the chance of its having been a balloon or balloons. The celestial bodies of sirius and Procyon having been in the approximate location of the UFOs for the duration of the latter's sighting suggests misinterpretation on the part of the observer.

(1) At this point it might be mentioned that if the observer had previously been acquainted with the appearance of diffraction-colored fringes around bright stars, this interpretation may have prevented any error.

Views with: For and in the absence of a definite observer or possibly definite evidence, the phenomenon is viewed as a probable optical illusion or refraction from the celestial bodies, sirius and Procyon.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was caused by the stellar sirius and Procyon.
