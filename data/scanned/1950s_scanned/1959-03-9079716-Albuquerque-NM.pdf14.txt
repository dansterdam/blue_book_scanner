SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT OVER ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO
On the evening of 8 March 1959 at approximately 1949 hours, a very bright light was observed moving in a northwesterly direction over the Albuquerque, New Mexico, area. The object was observed by numerous persons and its course and speed were verified by the control tower at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
The object was observed as a rapidly moving, extremely bright light which appeared to be traveling faster than any known aircraft. The object left no vapor trail or sound as it moved at great speed. It was observed by Albuquerque police and Air Force personnel, and its course and speed verified by the control tower at Kirtland AFB. The object was visible for approximately 2 minutes before it disappeared from view over the northwest horizon.
Military and civilian observers were unable to identify the object as any known type of aircraft or other aerial vehicle. Project BLUE BOOK has classified this incident as "UNIDENTIFIED".
