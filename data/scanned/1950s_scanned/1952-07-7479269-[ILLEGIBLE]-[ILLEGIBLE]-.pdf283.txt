STATEMENT OF: Pvt Carroll H. Rush Jr.
1 July 1952

While watching airplanes maneuvering I noticed an object almost directly overhead. At first I thought it was a star and I called it to the attention of my companions as such. Then I noticed that it appeared to be a highly polished metallic object reflecting light. It appeared to be round but I could not determine whether it was flat or spherical. While watching this my eye was attracted by a moving circular object of approximately the same size and altitude. It did not appear as bright as the first object. It appeared to be moving at a approximately the same speed of a jet plane but I noticed it was constantly accelerating and continued to accelerate as it moved off toward the South. The most striking thing was that it appeared to be accelerating until it disappeared at an angle of approx. 30* above the horizon. As for an estimation of speed I would say it was going 3 times as fast as a jet plane when it disappeared. This took place at 0430 hours. Two or three minutes before it disappeared it left a trail similar to a jet plane when it breaks the sound barrier. The object did not appear to be an airplane because of its acceleration and speed. I also noticed that it left no vapor trail which I believe was due to the fact that it was above the jet planes and the water vapor in the atmosphere.
