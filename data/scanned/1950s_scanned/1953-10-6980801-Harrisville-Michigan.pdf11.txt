Text extracted from the document:

AERONAUTICAL SYMBOLS
RADIO FACILITIES
Methods of indicating specific radio facilities are shown by symbols as indicated:
Radio Range.........................O—LF/MF, LF, or Compass Locator
Radio Range.........................O—VHF/UHF Station
Nondirectional Radiobeacon........O—LF/MF
Nondirectional Radiobeacon........O—VHF/UHF Station
Marine Radiobeacon................O—LF/MF
Radio Direction Finder............O—LF/MF, VHF/UHF
Radio Direction Finder............O—VHF/UHF (Radar)
AURAL RANGE
A_____________N
The arrow heads indicate the "ON" quadrant. The arrow shafts are magnetic and the magnetic variation at the position of the ground station is used for computing these.
VHF OMNI-DIRECTIONAL RANGE (VOR)
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL
Controlled Civil Airway
Uncontrolled Civil Airway
Blue line where shown indicates IFR traffic controlled areas.
