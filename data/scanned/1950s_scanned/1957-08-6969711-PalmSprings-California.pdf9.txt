SAUCERS OVER LYTHIA, GENYA

COPY is also indebted to Dr. Olavo Fontes by the following items about saucers:

The "Ouro P. Preto" metallurgy school "told the pupils the saucers were seen over the school; they saw a very bright circular light, hovering close to the ground. 61 students and 3 teachers saw it' (time 18.30 (6:30 PM) as they were leaving the school)."

They sent a description of the saucer: "It was circular, about the size of a car, from which emanated a bright white light that illuminated the whole area around it." The saucer stayed there for 6 minutes and then took off at great speed.

This incident "was also reported by more than 20 persons (students, teachers and other townspeople)"...

The document then goes on to describe other UFO sightings and related information.
