On the 7th of December 1951 between approximately 7:00 P.M. and 7:30 P.M. Central Standard Time, a luminous object was observed in the sky over Keck, Kentucky by four persons: Mrs. Loueilla Keck, her husband, and their two children.

The objects was described as round in shape, about the size of a basketball and luminous with a white or bluish-white glow. It moved rapidly across the sky at an altitude estimated to be about 1,000 feet. The object made no sound and left no trail. It was visible for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing.

The witnesses stated that the object appeared to be under intelligent control, since it made abrupt changes in direction and speed during the observation. 

This case was investigated by a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, United States Air Force. The report concludes that this observation could not be identified as any known object or phenomenon and that the witnesses were credible. The report is classified as "Unidentified".
