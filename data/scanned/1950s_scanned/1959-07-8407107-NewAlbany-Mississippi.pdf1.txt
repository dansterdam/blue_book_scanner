10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Roundish-silvery obj which appeared to be motionless in the western sky. In size it was
close to the diameter of the sun; however, 
not rnd, but oblong & at a 45° angle. After 
about 3 min, a thin white trail, about 1/4 
length of obj was noticed leading away fr obj 
in a parallel line. Shortly after this the obj 
began to move & disappeared into the clouds, 
climbing. Unlike vapor trail in that it was 
thin and fluffy. Went in house and got BX. 
Obj lost but appeared in clouds. Disappeared 
back into clouds.

11. COMMENTS
Obj possessed all the characteristics of an a/c w/the exception of the 
initial observation of being motionless. 
Obj was probably moving toward the 
witness or away fr him & gave the 
impression of being stationary. Contrail 
are often thin & fluffy. Evidence 
indicates that this was an a/c 
sighting.
