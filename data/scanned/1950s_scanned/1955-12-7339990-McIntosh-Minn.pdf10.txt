Dear Mr. Comton:

I have read over again the report regarding the information I gained relative to the sighted UFOB. The conclusion of your report plus a few other factors have persuaded me to write this letter.

I would like to report that on being interviewed in 1955, the facts I gave part of there was apparently incorrect, and I now realize it was because of the significance of the sighting which led me to embellish my story is the thought that has dawned on me. This has caused me to feel that I would like the true significance of whether it was a significant sighting or not.
