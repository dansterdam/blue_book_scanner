The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, with instructions to mark the position of the object when the observer first saw it ("A") and its position when the observer last saw it ("B"). The smaller sketches show two landscape scenes, one with a road and trees, and the other with a person walking on a road.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
