On 11 September 1953, a strong radar echo off from Keflavik Airport was reported at 1900 local time. The radar return was observed for approximately 15 minutes and was approximately 60 miles from the radar site. The track was confirmed by another radar site and also by the pilot of an aircraft in the vicinity. The pilot reported having a visual contact with a bright light moving slowly at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet. The light was observed for a few minutes and then disappeared from sight. The radar return was lost at approximately 1915 hours local time. A second similar radar return was picked up at approximately 2130 hours local time, but again visual contact was not established.

The object as observed on radar was about the size of a small aircraft. It was moving at a fairly constant speed of approximately 30 knots. Its course was somewhat erratic, but generally seemed to be moving in a northerly direction. During the period of observation, the height of the object did not vary appreciably from the 5,000 foot level at which it was first observed visually.

The pilot's description of the object as a bright light approximately the size of a small aircraft, moving slowly at an altitude of about 5,000 feet, is generally consistent with the radar observations. The pilot stated that he had never seen a similar light before and could not account for it.

The investigating officer was convinced that the light was not an aircraft, and the radar return was not caused by any known type of aircraft or other material object. It is felt that this incident may have involved a possible astronomical phenomenon.
