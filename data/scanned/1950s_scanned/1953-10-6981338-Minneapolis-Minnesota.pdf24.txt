THE QUESTIONABLE ASPECTS OF THE SIGHTING

The time of the observation and the true character of the object are questionable.

For Visually Tracked Targets, The Speed and The Abrupt Changes Of Direction Are Especially Puzzling. Speed Using The Equation Angle (A SEC) AND THE Rate Of Angular Travel (ABOUT 1 MINUTE PER SEC) VELOCITIES CAN BE COMPUTED BY ASSUMING DIFFERENT ALTITUDES AND DISTANCES AWAY FOR THE OBJECT.

UNDER ASSUMPTIONS FROM 3,000 FT TO 30,000 FT ALTITUDE, THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING BETWEEN 600 & 1,800 MARK. EVEN ASSUMING A CONSERVATIVE 20% ERROR, THE OBJECT WAS PROBABLY MOVING AT GREATER THAN SONIC VELOCITY. YARDSTICK MOVEMENT OF THIS MAGNITUDE FOR 10-15 SEC WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY DANGEROUS IN NORMAL OPERATIONAL AIRCRAFT.
