The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report related to Project Blue Book, discussing radar observations and possible causes for radar malfunctions or anomalies.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. Since three (3) different Radar Observers and three (3) different APC-33 radar sets were involved in these radar contacts, it is thought unlikely that radar malfunction could be the cause.

2. Since the visibility at flight altitude in each incident was good, it is felt that the radar return had been caused by a material object, visual sighting would have been accomplished.

3. In view of paragraphs one (1) and two (2) above, it is believed that the radar returns were caused by some atmospheric condition or phenomenon which might be peculiar to Alaska only, or to Alaska and the Northeastern Command.
