FLYING SAUCER LOOKOUT
LAB SETUP IN CANADA 
BY EUGENE GRIFFIN
(Ottawa, Nov. 11--CP)--Establishment of a Canadian government observation station to watch for flying saucers, the first in the world, was announced today.
There is a very high degree of probability that these sighting are real objects, and a 60-power telescope has been installed by Wilbert B. Smith, senior radio engineer of the transport department, to investigate the new saucer sighting station.
He said the federal transport department, which is in charge of the telecommunications and teletype section, receives constant reports of saucer sightings. The total number, he said, is classified information.
Explanation: Illusory optical illusion explains the optical phenomena. But in every sighting there is always some physical explanation. We have decided to take the saucer phenomena seriously in Canada.
A saucer sighting station has been set up near Ottawa and scientists here never have been instructed publicly to report any such observations. Some of them have been very active in studying the physiology of the saucer sightings.
If they prove to be manifestations from another source other than this planet, it may well open up a new era of man's concept of his universe. This project, which is specially built for saucer investigation, is kept secret in a gravitational studies institute here, a part of the Defence Research Board. It is not open to the public.
