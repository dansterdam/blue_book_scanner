a click at 5:55 p.m. a 40 to 50 foot strange, large and
brilliant object, shape of a Dumbbount, was watched for
several minutes moving slowly to a point about midway
between the horizon and the zenith. It then it stopped. In
the early morning hours of Dec. 1st the object, found
to be glowing and a soft dull olive green, was reported
to be 30 to 40 feet long, 20 feet wide and about the
size of a four engine bomber. Mrs. L. estimates that the
object completely covered the moon. Mrs. L. said the
object was silent while doing so, turned solid red.

It disappeared behind some trees on a ridge nearby.
Mrs. L. called her husband, but he arrived on the scene
just after the object had vanished with a light receding into
the sky. The Weather Bureau was phoned, but they had
no explanation for the phenomenon.
