"Statement of 2/Lt Vai J. Giles Jr.: 

19 October 1953

At approximately 19:30 hours on 19 Oct 53 I came out of the officers club at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado and observed a strange object in the sky. The object was extremely bright and appeared to be circular in shape. The object appeared to be hovering or staying in one position. I watched the object for approximately 15 minutes. During this time the object appeared to change position slightly and then would return back to the original position. At one time the object appeared to emit a very bright flash of light. After observing the object for approximately 15 minutes, it suddenly disappeared. I am unable to estimate the exact size of the object but I would say it was reasonably large. I am also unable to estimate the exact distance of the object from my position, but I would say it was a considerable distance away. The object did not appear to show any lights as the ground or buildings. The sky was clear and there was no other aircraft in the area that I could observe. I have never seen anything like this before and I can find no explanation for what I observed."
