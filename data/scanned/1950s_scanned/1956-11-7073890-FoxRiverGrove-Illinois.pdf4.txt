Here is the text from the document, as transcribed by an OCR system:

speed of somnol id about 720 m.p.h. and 2 hours she was going much further than that. The object was pretty far away and it still moving very fast. The altitude that I stated was just a guess at the time as an air plane it would have to be pretty high for you not to hear its engines) I saw along for a time getting redder and redder. At the end of its flight it turned into a change of a cigar (p.3). Three small round objects came from an outer dark part of the sky Gradually a cloud and merged into the cigar shaped object. The one big object flew off for a few seconds and then just disappeared. There were no winds that I could see. Seen by November 16, 1956.
