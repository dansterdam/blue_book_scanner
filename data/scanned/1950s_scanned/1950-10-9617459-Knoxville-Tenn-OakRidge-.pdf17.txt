UNCLASSIFIED

19 October 1950

Command, Stewart Air Field, Newburgh, New York) - He called back and said the only information was to determine if the object could have been a reflection.

"Targets were appearing with some regularity and proceeding South."

"They all traveled at a speed of between 100 and 155 miles per hour, held good heading and disappearing at various intervals, North of Clinton and faded right at the area line. Reappearance of this target at last coast on the same course 182 degrees was 5 (eight) miles inside area." This target faded after three sweeps (Revolutions two minutes).

"The tracks varied at time from one applicable to very light." (C (aircraft) up to 1/c of the C-47 variety (Meaning the reflected intensity of Radar waves made the target appear at first like a small aircraft and then like a large one)).

"We operated both on High Beam and Low Beam and picked up the same tracks."

"All traveled at the same approximate speed and general course. During the night this course, spread from 170 degrees to 230 degrees (magnetic compass heading)."

"At 0210 E.S.T., called Captain Summers at Nobody, he called EADF, Captain Hutchinson, and received permission to release fighters to normal status."

AGENTS NOTES: This document was signed by the Radar Controller on duty at the time of these occurrences.
