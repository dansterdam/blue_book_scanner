Objects in question were sighted approximately 45 minutes northwest of San Angelo. The observation was called to them and I observed them out of the line forward blister. There were seven objects about 50 to 75 miles away about 10 degrees above flight line at 11 o'clock of the aircraft. They were very white and had the appearance of having phosphorous trails, and were in a vertical line. No movement was apparent and as we drew closer I figured they must be vapor trails and so I returned to my work. This all occurred on 19 May 1952.
