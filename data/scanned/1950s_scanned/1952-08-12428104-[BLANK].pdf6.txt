IS THERE A SIMPLE, NATURAL EXPLANATION?

Astronomical, meteorological, and light phenomena, or simply failure of observers to recognize familiar objects in the air for what they really are, may explain many reported UAO sightings. 

It is midnight. A luminous body, seemingly as bright as the sun, breaks across the sky. It emits sparks and puffs of smoke, and trails what appears to be a long, fiery exhaust. The object then disappears with a series of flashes, and shortly afterwards a fearful roar and earth-shaking explosions are heard. Only one man witnesses this event. Never having observed anything so awesome in the skies before, he is convinced that he must have seen an interplanetary space ship.

Perhaps he has. It will never be possible to say with absolute certainty that he cannot have seen an extra-terrestrial vehicle. There are no other witnesses to the incident and, therefore, by the rules of evidence, no one competent to contravert conclusively the conviction that he has seen space travelers in transit. Chances are, however, if he were more familiar with astronomical phenomena, he would identify his UAO as a more conventional visitor from space -- a meteorite. What he has seen and heard tallies very closely with the frequently observed and startling phenomena of light and sound that often accompany the fall of meteorites.

Over 100 million meteors fall daily. One hundred million or more meteors come racing into the earth's atmosphere daily at speeds of 100,000 miles per hour, to meet their doom under the fierce and tremendous frictional resistance encountered at such speeds.
