The text on the page provides details about a sighting of a "greenish blue fire light" by an aircraft commander, instructor pilot, and bombardier. It describes the trajectory and altitude of the observed object. The text also mentions a weather sequence at Walker AFB and details about the observed object's visibility and altitude.
