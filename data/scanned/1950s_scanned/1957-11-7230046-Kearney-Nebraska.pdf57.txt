  The remark is often made, "How 
come there are no witnesses to a 
space ship landing?"
  I don't know that I can answer 
that fully, but in the case of my 
experience of November 5, I under-
stand there may be a number of 
witnesses for there were hunters and 
construction workers in the vicinity. 
In fact, a local radio announcer in 
Kearney allegedly has a tape record-
ing of two business men in Kearney 
who testified that they heard a ser-
ies of sounds while pheasant hunt-
ing the afternoon of my contact, 
that they believed came from the 
ship. This same announcer checked 
with the Lowry Air Force Base and 
learned that they had no aircraft 
aloft the afternoon of November 5 
between 1:00 and 6:00 P.M. due to 
the low ceiling and hazardous flying 
conditions.
  Also, many folks are wondering 
why the occupants of the ship spoke 
German. Again, I don't really know. 
But oddly enough, when my boss 
came to Kearney to see me after my 
release from the hospital he had 
with him a business associate from 
Mexico â€“ a man who was very much 
interested in my experience. After 
I finished telling him about it he 
told me that he had encountered a 
similar ship in Mexico! It, too, was 
occupied by four men and two wom-
en - only they talked in Spanish! 
You will have to draw your own con-
clusions.
  Another thing I am often asked is, 
"Did you ever read any books on 
flying saucers before your experi-
ence, or were you interested in the 
subject?"
  I had heard something about fly-
ing saucers, as everyone has over 
the years, from reports in news-
papers, etc. But I had never paid 
any particular attention to the sub-
ject. As I have often said, "I didn't 
believe, I didn't disbelieve but they 
certainly made a believer out of 
me!" As to books, I hadn't read any 
on the subject before my experience, 
and I haven't read any since either.
  Now I'm going to conclude my re-
port, as of April 5, 1958, when I re-
ceived some information from
NICAP (National Investigations
Committee for Aerial Phenomena) 
regarding one of the questions the 
visitors asked me. (What was the 
plane carrying that went down, the 
besides passengers?) NICAP sent me 
a couple of Western newspaper 
articles which I am copying for 
your information. The first is a 
story from the Des Moines Register, 
dated November 9, 1957:
  "A large Stratocruiser, enroute be-
ween San Francisco and Honolulu, 
is reported missing after having 
sighted mysterious blinking lights 
in the sky early this morning. The 
last position given by the plane was 
about 900-1000 miles northeast of 
Honolulu. A military transport fly-
ing near the area reported sighting 
similar mystery lights, blinking off 
and on, 120 miles north of the last 
reported position of the Stratocruis-
er after it had been reported miss-
ing. A full scale sea and air search 
is in operation with aircraft hoping to 
find the plane carrying a crew of 4 
and 36 passengers in the event it 
might have plunged into the sea."
  (Note: Later reports said #4 a- 
board.)
  Was there a suggestion that space-
ships (mysterious blinking lights) 
might have caused the accident, I 
wondered, and was that why my 
spaceship friends wanted me to find
out what else that ship was carrying 
besides passengers?
  Then another news clipping, an AP 
article, published January 16, 1958, 
in the Omaha World Herald, gave 
the following information:

    of Plane's Crash Unsolved
