The object was described as bright, oval-shaped, and the size of a "DC-6" at a distance of 35 miles. The object was observed for 10-15 minutes, remained stationary at first, then moved slowly east and disappeared. The weather was clear, temperature about 60 F, and visibility good. The target was tracked on radar, confirmed visually, and its inability of airborne radar to pick up the target (while searching) indicates it was not metallic. The report states that the object rose slowly up and down, and would not move fast, the results of such weather changes frequently do not move at very high speeds. Suspected to be a natural phenomenon, such as a balloon, or an unusual meteorological conditions, but no conclusions have been established, This report is one of the many brought about by some weather condition. The fact that no aircraft were assembled for the mission, and that the incident was not investigated, serve to indicate the nature of the incident.
