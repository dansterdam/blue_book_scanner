Seveval Report Seeing 
Red Satellite, Rocket

The Soviet satellite and the third stage of the rocket which put it into orbit were observed by several witnesses, according to reports. The satellite, visible as a faint red star, passed over Milwaukee, Wisconsin at 22:18 on October 4. The rocket, which was bright red in color, was seen to be about one-fourth the size of the satellite and travelling at a much faster speed. The rocket was observed at an altitude of 23,000 feet for about 25 seconds. The satellite was observed for about 45 seconds at an altitude of 300 miles. Lloyd Berkner, director of research for the Associated Universities, Inc., stated that the rocket and satellite were probably visible because they were reflecting the sun's rays. The distance of the satellite by triangulation is estimated to be 1,000 miles.
