UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT

Time Sighted: Approximately 1700 to 1705, Date: 29 April 1953

Size: Approximately that of a F-80 fighter aircraft

Shape: Circular with no extension of control surfaces

Color: Metallic silver

Track of object: From north to east

Flight time observed: 60 seconds

At approximately 1700 the officer sources, enroute to FEAF from San Francisco on the USNS General A. W. Brewster, sighted an unidentified object approximately the size of an F-80 fighter aircraft, at 3 o'clock, altitude 2000 feet, and slightly below the clouds, at a distance of about Â¼ mile. This object appeared to remain stationary for a few seconds, then turn at right angles towards the ship, gain altitude and travel in an arc to a position of 5 o'clock disappearing through the clouds aft of the ship.

The object did not perform with the smooth control movements of any known aircraft. Rather its controlled action were erratic with some turns at 90-degree angles and near vertical climbs. The movement from 3 to 5 o'clock was in an arc.

Position of the vessel at time of incident was Lat 28 degrees 14' N, Long 166 degrees 05' W.

Estimated speed of this object was in excess of a jet fighter aircraft.

Path of object as shown.
