The image appears to be a photograph of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The photograph shows a circular instrument or gauge with numerical markings around the edge. The text at the bottom of the image indicates the date "JUN 13".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the text found in the document:

JUN 13
