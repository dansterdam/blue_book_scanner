The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report of unidentified objects sighted in the neighborhood of Rawlins, Wyoming on July 15, 1958.

The text in the document is as follows:

Report of Unidentified Objects

Sighted in Neighborhood of Rawlins on July 15, 1958.
(per U.S.A.F. Headquarters Wire of July 15)

These objects were quite possibly meteorites or meteors, descending in a somewhat different and more or less erratic course than would be expected of meteors. They were observed by several people and while it would be impossible to determine their exact nature, they were certainly not within the bounds of possibility.

Their varied and erratic movements and disappearance from direct vision seem to indicate something more than ordinary meteoritic activity. Their varied and erratic movements and disappearance from direct vision seem to indicate something more than ordinary meteoritic activity.

To may be interesting to note that we have three other reports of somewhat similar unidentified objects as follows:

Las Cruces, N.M. - July 25 - 08 27 U.T.
Grandy, Colorado - August 1 - 08 26 U.T.
Lochlort, Wyoming - August 1 - 08 32 U.T.

Color was not mentioned in the Las Cruces case. The objects sighted in this case were about the size of a regulation football and traveling in a more or less easterly direction. All were traveling in a more or less easterly direction.
