PILOT GETS CLOSE VIEW OF SAUCER FOR BRIEF INTERVAL -- Casablanca, Maroc-Presse, 23 Sep 52

The pilot of a transport plane flying over Casablanca, Morocco, on 23 September 1952, had a close encounter with a flying saucer for 10 seconds and about 50 meters in the same direction as the saucer while making an approach at the same level. As he was preparing to land at an airfield in Casablanca, at 1825 hours, he noticed the strange object about 30 meters to the left of his plane as he circled the airfield. He saw a luminous object fly between his plane and the ground. It flew the same line of flight as the plane, maintaining the same speed. The latter was doing 220 kilometers per hour. It looked like a bright light, and the object was going about twice as fast. He mentioned it to his passengers, who saw it too.

He heard no noise coming from the object. As the pilot passed the plane, it disappeared. It is possible this was the same object that was sighted at the US Airbase at Nouasseur by ground personnel, who reported it, fearing it, as this was a regular occurrence.

That same evening, in Azemour, French Morocco, a French couple and their farm workers heard a loud explosion as the strange flying object passed over their farm. This is the first report: a very fast way of moving in this same case the flight was said to have occurred at 1820 hours.
