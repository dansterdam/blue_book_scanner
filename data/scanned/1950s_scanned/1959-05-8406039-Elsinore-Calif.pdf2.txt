The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a typed document or report. I will proceed to transcribe the text from the document as an OCR system:

Having had a conversation with a man of the legal intelligence (OLA) who had a sighting of the three objects(large luminous objects) just after 5:25 P. M., March 12, 1959, near Hidden Valley.

I had not written because of the nature of such a report and due to the many recent personal problems and family illness, etc. which I have had to deal with and which have occupied me greatly. 

A documentary of the truth concerning UFO's on T.V. took 3/4 of an hour which contained measures which I could not consider as coming to the point and which I cannot relate to. 

The film strip (roll) developed only which is carried to the letter.  The other observers are unknown to me besides those of Elsinore, California, the site of the UFO.

My secretary visited frequently this area for health reasons, and how unfortunate it was that I was not present. It was standing by my car in front of the house. Lucille was just coming out of the house and was half way between the house and the car. She observed the navy-type craft with the hand-twirling. The clicking of about 2 seconds.

I imagine I heard that and possibly that was my car. I cannot say for certain, if this was the following in the first place.

The UFO hovered on the hill above near the "Stallions' house" and moved (toward) for about 2 minutes then proceeded in a downward direction.
