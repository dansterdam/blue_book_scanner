JET CHASE OF LARGE CIRCULAR OBJECT INVESTIGATED BY EAST AIR FORCE
For eight months the Far East Air Force has been in possession of an Intelligence Report describing the jet chase of a strange round object larger than a B-29 bomber. According to this report, the UFO accelerated to a speed of about 2000 miles per hour when the jet tried to close in.
Intelligence Report Details Released to NICAP --
Full details of the chase were revealed to NICAP on August 27. In an uncensored version released nowhere in the Air Force since 1953. Whether or not release of this important case indicates a change in Air Force policy or is an isolated incident, is yet to be determined.
The report of the jet chase sent to NICAP from a Far East Air Force office bears the following heading:

Air Force Tells Congressman It Has Given NICAP "All UFO Information" Despite Written Refusal
Despite an official refusal on July 16 to release any information on UFOs to NICAP, the Air Force gave NICAP all the same information in September. This contradiction was admittd by the Department of the United States Air Force.
This contradiction in statement was noted, and an on-the-record conversation with the Air Force on question of UFO reports. Maj. Gen. John A. Samford, Lt. USAF Ret., Director NICAP, follows:
The identical statement sent to Admiral Hillenkoetter and the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena: "The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena is not a governmental agency."
