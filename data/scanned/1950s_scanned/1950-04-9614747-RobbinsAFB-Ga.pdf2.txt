2. Captain Charles H. McMahon had returned to the base a few minutes before 0400 hours this morning after seeing an aerial object. He states that he had the object for about one or one and a half hours on the plane. He wears glasses and was interested in flying discs, but believes his glasses are connected to 20/20. He states that he had had three (3) attacks in the evening of 9 April prior to this. He said he did not believe either this crime or fatigue were sufficient to impair his vision.

Captain McMahon stated that he had not listened to Henry J. Taylor's broadcast or read related articles, and that he did not know he was being observed. He says several other people saw the object relative to that subject, but that he had no particular interest in air-craft or flying discs.

4. After his plane landed, Captain McMahon had some friends drive him over to the hospital. The time of his arrival at the hospital was approximately 0450. He planned to get some rest before recording for duty for the day.
