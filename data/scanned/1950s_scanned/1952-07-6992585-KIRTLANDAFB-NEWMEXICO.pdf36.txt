There are two hand-drawn diagrams in the image. The first diagram shows a straight dashed line labelled "STATIONARY" with arrows pointing from "A" to "B" (labeled "ROUGHLY WEST TO EAST"), indicating motion, and at point "B" there is text saying "OUT OF SIGHT". The pattern of the lines suggests an object moving across the sky and then disappearing from sight.

The second diagram shows two shapes: one is a cross with a circle in the center, and the other is an ellipse. There are notes beside these shapes. 

Here is the OCR output of the text in the document:

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could
construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape
would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the
same appearance as the object which you saw.

DESCRIPTION: ALUMINUM LENS-LIKE OBJECT

UPPRESSED RATHER THAN SEEN.

(2) OBJECT TOO DISTANT TO INSURE
PERFECT CIRCULAR PLAN.
