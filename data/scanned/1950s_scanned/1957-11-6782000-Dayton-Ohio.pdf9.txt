The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marked on it, and instructions to imagine that you are at the point shown and place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

The second sketch contains two smaller sketches. The larger one shows a person standing on a road with buildings and mountains in the background. The smaller one shows a curved horizon line with a mountainous landscape in the background.
