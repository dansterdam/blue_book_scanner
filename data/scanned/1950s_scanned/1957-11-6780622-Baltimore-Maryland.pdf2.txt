Dear Sirs,

After reading in the press your latest progress report on the investigations of unidentified flying objects over a recent 13-months period, I am anxious to know what were your findings concerning the report I sent you. My report was sent to you with a letter dated December 15,1957 and it described an unusual aerial object which I saw over Baltimore on November 6,1957 at 9:43-9:47 P.M., E.S.T.

I would like to know at least into which of the six general categories you have placed my report. The details accounting for the object's most unusual appearance would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
