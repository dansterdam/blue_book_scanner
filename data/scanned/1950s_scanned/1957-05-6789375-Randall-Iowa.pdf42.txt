RADIO ASTRONOMY

Watch Radio Waves From Comet Rivaling Halley's

> THE COMET Arend-Roland predicted to rival or outshine Halley's in brightness is being scanned for radio waves. (See p. 251.)

The Government's largest radio telescope, a sensitive, 50-foot antenna at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, is tuned in at a frequency near 1667 megacycles, and aimed at the comet's expected position in the sky.

The Naval Research Laboratory scientists are looking for the "hydroxyl" group, OH, in the comet's tail. This group has been seen optically in comet tails, and is predicted to emit radio waves at about 1667 megacycles. If the hydroxyl is found, it will be the first time that its radio waves have been detected from any heavenly object.
