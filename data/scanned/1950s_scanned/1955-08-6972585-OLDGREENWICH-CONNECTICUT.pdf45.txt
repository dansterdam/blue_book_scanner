The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The sketch shows an elongated oval shape with a bright central point or light source. The text appears to be handwritten notes or descriptions related to the observed object. However, the image does not contain any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

The red was pulsing and going in a pattern of some kind I was watching it go through a cycle of lights for about 5 minutes that seemed to indicate it was a machine of some kind and not a normal phenomenon we see in the sky as a plane or meteor etc very unnatural moving slowly and gracefully I cant pretend to know what it was but I've seen a aircraft that were within my understanding of what planes do and this was nothing I've ever seen before totally distinct from ordinary flying machines in all of its movements and the qualities of the light.
