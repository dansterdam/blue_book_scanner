The image contains several illustrations demonstrating principles related to the perception of objects from different perspectives. There is no photograph present in this image.

From light and shadow - an object casts a shadow away from the observer if the light is nearer.
From aerial perspective - large objects seen indistinctly appear to have haze, fog, or smoke between them and the observer, and therefore are usually at a great distance.
From terrestrial association - objects ordinarily associated are judged to be approximately the same distance.
