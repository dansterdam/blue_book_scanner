Details:
On 6 July 1950, "Farmer Tells of Watching C-54 Launch Flying Saucer" Dowagiac, Mich., July 6--A young, hard-working farmer not given to seeing "things" has reported watching a flying saucer launched from an Army C-54.
John Keller made the report to the Dowagiac newspaper, and said his two young sons would verify his statements.
Keller said he watched a saucer shaped like an automobile hub cap, about 25 feet in diameter, and 12 to 15 feet thick, launched from a low-flying Army C-54 on June 29. 
Keller said the launching took place about a quarter of a mile from where he was riding a tractor, in a hay field.
The plane was heading southwest at a low rate of speed, about 300 feet up, when it suddenly came to a point, according to Keller, and a saucer-shaped object was launched from the belly of the plane. It made a high-pitched sound as it rose straight up due south. It easily outdistanced the C-54 and was out of sight in seconds.
"It looked like a gigantic hub cap or half of a sphere. It's topside looked like chrome and had a little dome protruding", and the bottom was dull grey. Keller said he didn't know the object's purpose but when his two sons, Larry and Johnny, then he saw "the launching."
