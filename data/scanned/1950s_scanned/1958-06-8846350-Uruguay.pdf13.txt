SMOKING SAUCERS
Marysville, Calif, (AP) A brilliant light traveling slowly north-
east past Marysville and emitting a smoke trail was reported by a
dozen listeners to radio station KMYC Monday night (February 16,
1959). The object was sighted at 6:00 P.M. Viewers said it disap-
peared into a cloudbank after two minutes.

Believe the above is the same type plane seen by me June 10, 1958 at
about 3:50 P.M. It seemed to rise near a clump of trees growing along
side a stream, and just south of the small mountain range called The
Buttes. It was a clear day. I imagine it was not more than 10 or 15 feet
in the air when I first spotted it. It was gaining altitude rapidly and
headed in a southwesterly direction. It traveled close to the ceiling at an
exceptionally high rate of speed. Shortly after I first saw it, it was
between me and the sun and I could see the outline of a cigar-shaped ob-
ject about 150 feet in length, enveloped in a cloud of smoke from nose
to tail. It looked like a giant cocoon hurtling through the sky. Watched
object from moving taxi for about 20 minutes. Phoned C.A.A. at Its of-
fice at Yuba Co. (California) Air-
port. Cab driver saw it also.
