The text in the document is as follows:

"This is a report compiled in good faith to the authorities of what I and many others saw in the night sky over Wilmington last night. The object that was observed had a very peculiar shape to it, and the manner in which it traveled was not like any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen. 
It was circular, rather than the usual tail-wing design, and it seemed to just float along in a very smooth and steady motion, with no sound that I could hear. I estimate the object was traveling at a speed somewhere in the vicinity of 300 to 400 miles per hour, as it disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. Several other witnesses in the area were able to observe the object as well, and all describe it in a similar manner.
I am in no position to hold any opinion as to what this object might have been, but I felt it was my duty to report what I saw to the proper authorities in the interest of public safety. I hope this account is helpful in your investigation of this matter."
