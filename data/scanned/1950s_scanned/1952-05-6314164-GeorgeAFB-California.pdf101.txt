1. A/2C T.J. Mathis, 146th Fighter-Bomber Wing, George AFB, California, do hereby make the following statement concerning my observation of an unidentified flying objects on 13 May 1952:

2. The object was round and small and appeared to be very far away. The color was whitish like a fluorescent light or the sun. It made no sound and seemed to be in a steady flight. At one time the object seemed to turn on its side and then became normal again. It was looking at the object and it was almost directly overhead when it disappeared. The object disappeared very fast, almost like a light being turned off. It must have gone straight up.

3. Time sighted: 1425 to 1455 13 May 52.
Time observed - 30 minutes.

4. Visual observation from the air. Speed 150 mph. Altitude 10,530 ft.

5. I was sitting in the rear seat of the aircraft north of George AFB. The object was out in front of us. The aircraft was in a flight east to west and west to east. It appeared to be above us. It was a little north of us. The aircraft I was in was at least 20,000 feet below the object.

6. The weather was very clear - no clouds and a slight haze below.

7. The object might have been from Muroc Air Force Base.

8. None.
