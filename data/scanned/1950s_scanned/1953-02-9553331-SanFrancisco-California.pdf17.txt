BERKELEY, Feb. 9.--A San Francisco attorney said today he and a companion saw a formation of objects over the San Francisco Bay area at dusk yesterday, shining and flippinq and swinging in an "incredible performance." 
The man. who asked that his name be withheld, said the six or seven objects were about the size of a baseball and seemed to be at an altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. He said they were spotted over the bay near Treasure Island and Berkeley at 5:45 p.m. yesterday. 
"We watched them for about 15 minutes," the attorney said. "They were going at a terrific rate of speed, just flashing along. Then they would suddenly reverse direction and go the other way. 
"Two of them came very close together and then split off in different directions. It was an incredible performance, like nothing I've ever seen before." 
The man said fireballs don't have the performance capabilities of these objects. "I'd hate to think of them as missiles or anything of that sort," he added. 
"Not a jet, Either" 
"They were not jet aircraft, either," he said, "because my friend and I are both familiar with jet performance and these things were moving much faster." 
The man said he could not identify the objects, but he is convinced they were not conventional aircraft. 
"We watched the weather bureau broadcast this morning," he said, "and they had nothing to report about any unusual weather phenomena that would account for what we saw." 
The Weather Bureau said no special weather conditions were reported for that period over the Oakland area. 
"Whatever it was, it was high up - some 5,000 to 10,000 feet - and it was very, very fast," the man said. "It just didn't seem like anything we had ever seen before."
