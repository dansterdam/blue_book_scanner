Saturn Visible in South
Along with Venus and Jupiter, which will be visible in the eastern sky in the early evening, and Saturn in the southern sky that will continue to be seen through the night, Saturn has been well placed for observation during the past several months.
By James Stokley
Although Saturn is always an object of great interest to astronomers, during the past summer it has been unusually well placed in the evening sky for observation. This planet, which is the second largest in the solar system and known to have a marvelously complex ring system, reaches its farthest point north in its annual orbit around the sun each August, and this year it so happened that it reached maximum northern declination on August 20.
Together with Venus and Jupiter, Saturn was easily observable in the southern sky in the early evening hours throughout the summer months. This brings an opportunity for detailed study of Saturn and its rings which may lead to further understanding of this strange and fascinating planet.
Caption Text

Observers Reports
Several amateur astronomers have reported unusual atmospheric phenomena observed in the vicinity of Saturn during the past few weeks. These observers, located in widely separated parts of the country, have described seeing "strange objects" in the area immediately around the planet, apparently unconnected with the ring system. 
Additional observations are being made in an effort to secure more definite information concerning the nature and cause of these phenomena. It is hoped that further study may lead to an explanation of these unusual sightings.
