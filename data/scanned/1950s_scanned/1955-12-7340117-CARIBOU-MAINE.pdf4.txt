Seemed the car too, it had slowed. I didn't have any fear, it didn't frighten me. It seemed like it paused or hovered, then started out very rapidly in a southerly direction. It seemed to take off at a terrific speed. I watched it until it disappeared from sight. It traveled through the dark sky very rapidly. I actually believe I saw a flying saucer. I can give you details about its appearance. It was a disc or ellipse shaped object and had a brightglow around the edges. It made no sound that I could hear. It didn't seem to be anything man-made that I know about. I estimate its size to be at least 50 to 60 feet in diameter. My brother didn't get a good look at it as his attention was on the highway. I turned to him and said "Did you see that?" But he didn't see it. I was slightly disappointed as I would have liked to discuss it with him. Other than that, I don't know what else to say. I wanted to report this to the proper authorities but my brother didn't seem very interested. I'm hoping that by reporting this you can evaluate it and perhaps learn something about what I saw that night. Let me know if you need any further information from me.
