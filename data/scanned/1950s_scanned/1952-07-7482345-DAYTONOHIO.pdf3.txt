The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, showing handwritten text describing a UFO sighting.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"Early tonight unusually bright object was observed in sky. Seemed to be descending and ascending alternately. Crossed sky from horizon to horizon in about 5 minutes. Described as larger than full moon, brilliant white, and silent. No exhaust or trail visible. Moved very rapidly, faster than any known aircraft."
