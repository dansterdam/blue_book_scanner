10. Location of any air traffic in the area at time of sighting. Foster Tower reported no known traffic.

11. Position title and comments of the preparing officer, including his preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sightings. Assistant Air Operations Officer. One jet aircraft (T-33) from this station was airborne at the time of report, but was at 40,000 feet. No other jet aircraft were reported in the local area. Preliminary analysis indicates a meteor is the most probable cause of the sighting. There exists the remote and unlikely possibility that the object was a jet aircraft equipped with after burner, with the A.B. in operation.
