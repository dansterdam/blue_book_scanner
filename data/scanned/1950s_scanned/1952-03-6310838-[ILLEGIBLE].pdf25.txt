The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Transcribed text from the document:

Though I was on Gibson Island at the times mentioned, neither my wife or I recall any unusual noises, and we heard it or felt any vibrations we would have identified at as noises and shocks that we have been attributing to aberrictions. The police say, have had many similar incidents reported, but laugh then off. A news post telephone operator refused to be interested in stewart's story, said he had heard a "dozen similar" incidents on Saturday evening and dismissed them all as hallucinations.
