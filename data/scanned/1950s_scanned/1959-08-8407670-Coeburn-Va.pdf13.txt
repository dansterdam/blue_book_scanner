I have a very interesting photograph that I took in Coeburn, Virginia last summer. I just recently had it developed and an enlargement made of it. It has some very interesting objects on it. I believe them to be UFO's as there were many seen in this area of the country last summer and as far as I know they are still being seen. There are three of them on the photograph, one of which is very large. I also know that there was a check made of them during the summer of 1959 by Secret Service agents. I also know that SAC dropped some strips of aluminum over the area in 1959 to jam the Navy's radar station on Black Mountain near Coeburn.

If you are interested in the photograph please let me know as soon as possible! I think that with further processing this photo would be very valuable to your files.

Yours truly,
