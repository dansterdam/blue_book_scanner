AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. CB 482
PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

7. I am aware of the location of the Yahata Steel Mills in the approximate area in which the light was observed. The greatest period of activity at the steel mills has been the last few days of each month when new steel orders are being received. This has been the result of any industrial activity in this area. The light was stationary and not capable of causing the rapid movement observed.

8. Based on the flight characteristics and the actions of the light, I must have been dealing with something that had many miles offshore due to the distance traveled by the light, which must have been of tremendous speed to be visible from the earth's surface by the change in angle to the line of sight. The light came from the north and apparently was in a straight line and was not erratic in motion. It was as if the nature of the light was broken and not a solid over-cast.

9. Interviews of witnesses confirms the sighting referred to in this report. The sighting as described by other persons within the Ashiya-Ashiya Air Base confirmed by persons with military personnel were very similar and differed only in details.

10. Weather during the time of sighting was scattered clouds 3,000 ft., ceiling 12,000 ft., visibility 10 miles, wind 5-8 M.P.H.
