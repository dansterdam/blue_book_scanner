The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph present in this image.

The text in the document is as follows:

NOTE:
This report tho small in nature, reflects an observance of something that, thru the use of powerful magnifying glasses, was studied and observed at some length, without any definite conclusions being reached as to its actual identity. Further action seems unwarranted in this particular case.
