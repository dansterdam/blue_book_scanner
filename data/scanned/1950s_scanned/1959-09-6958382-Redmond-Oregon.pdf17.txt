At 1500 30 March 1960, Sgt Rolfe, 25th Air Division called to 
report that the gap filler antenna is located close to Lapine, Oregon. 
He also stated that the radar site had seen the same object quite often 
( quite often to mean more than 3 times but less than 10, but no specific 
period for these observations). The site would not commit themselves 
as to whether this gap filler antenna was considered as part of the 
normal background for the station. 
Communication people of the 25th ADIV do not believe th gap filler 
antenna was responsible for the returns, but rather a mountain EXft peak 
which is normally out of range. Targets of this type are typical of 
coastal and mountainous areas, occuring approximately 8 to 10 times a year. 
No additional witnesses, other than the two already reported, could be 
found to confirm the visual sighting. 
 The 327th ACWRON is located at Keno, Oregon. The gap filler 
antenna is located on South Pauline peak. South Peak is 98 nautical miles
WNE of Keno, and 3!> nautical miles south of Redmond Radio . 
In view of the above information, the ATIC feels there is no valid 
reason to change the original AXX&AAXStXX evaluation.
