There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object moved, Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. If possible, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.
22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
(Circle One): a. Pencil, b. Pea, c. Silver dollar, d. Baseball, e. Dime, f. Nickel, g. Grapefruit, h. Basketball, i. Quarter, j. Half-dollar.
23. (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): a. Certain, b. Fairly certain, c. Not very sure, d. Uncertain. 
25. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe the physical characteristics in your own words as a layman and not as a scientist who would give technical terms.

25. How did the object or objects disappear from view? SLOWLY CLIMBED OUT OF VIEW

Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have?

IT GLIDED SILENTLY, WITH NO APPARENT MEANS OF PROPULSION OR VISIBLE MARKINGS. I HAVE NO FURTHER DETAILS TO GIVE.
