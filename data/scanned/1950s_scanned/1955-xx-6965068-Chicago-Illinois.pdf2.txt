Dear Sirs,

Back in 1959 I sighted several U.F.O.'s, along with my brother, while playing on the Northwestide of Chicago. We were driving in my car when I saw a flash in the sky to the northeast of the city.

After stopping the car, there I saw and grabbed my camera. When I opened the camera, however, the film broke and I then went to the top of a fire escape on a school to get a better look at them. I have a picture, but when I took it to the local photo shop to have it developed I was told that the negative was lost.

When I had the film developed a few days later, I was then told that the negative was lost.

If you are still interested in U.F.O reports, you may write to me and I will be happy to give you more information on this sighting, plus the print of the picture since I lost the negative.

Very truly yours,
