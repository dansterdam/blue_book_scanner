Upon sighting and evaluation, this incident appears to be of scientific and technical interest. There is no evidence to indicate that the observed object was an aircraft or that it was a natural phenomenon, such as a meteor or a weather balloon.

The 11 July 1959 sighting resulted from a meteorological observation with radar, and the direction was plan. 

There is no Air Force order or directive in existence which orders directly or indirectly the pursuit of UFOs. All Defense Command will, of course, continue to carry out its primary mission of defending the United States under existing Security procedures. 

The Department of the Air Force has furnished this information since the Air Force has completed this investigation as far as Air Force interest is concerned. No further Air Force action is indicated at this time. They do not intend to take any more action. The Air Force people that I have talked to say this. However, the Air Force cannot over-emphasize the importance of obtaining reliable reports of unidentified aerial phenomena, since scientific investigation of such incidents could provide significant technological and scientific advances to this country.

I must inform you that considerations require that your communication on this matter be treated as confidential.

Sincerely yours,

CARL M. IVERSON
Chief, Directorate of Intelligence
United States Air Force
