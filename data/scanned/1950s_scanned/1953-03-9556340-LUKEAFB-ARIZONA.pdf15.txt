1. Pilot stated in original statement that it was a vapor trail. It is considered significant that he was informed by higher headquarters that it was a positive sighting (supplemented by Project Blue Book, the official identification of March 1953 sighting).
2. Film is negative. If film were returned to positive print, it would show as it actually was.
3. Altitude of object estimated to be extremely difficult to estimate. A rough estimate would be five to ten miles.
4. Local flying training was being conducted during time of sighting. Observers have confirmed that no flights in the area around Luke AFB were noticed and of jet models to have been in operation, none were being flown at the time.

Its color was greenish-blue to slightly bluish-white. It showed no trail or observation. It had direction and motion at the rate of approximately 5000 MPH air speed.
