Sirius has inspired many UFO reports. On December 10, 1952 at 7:35 P.M. PST, civilian pilot and radar observer of an F-51 on routine patrol duty were over the town of Odessa, Washington, at about 6,000 feet when they saw a large white light in the east [1]. Dim reddish-white lights seemed to be coming from "windows," and no trail or exhaust was visible. The pilot attempted to intercept but the object performed amazing feats--did a chandelle in front of the plane, made a steep climb, ramped away, stopped, and then made a straight for the ground at a terrific speed. The pilot climbed to avoid collision, and afterward was not able to locate the object. The radar man then got a brief return but soon lost contact. Although the visual and radar contacts had not coincided, both men assumed that they referred to the same object [S, p. 38]. Investigators suggested at first that the object might have been one of the Tektonic balloons, but this idea had to be discarded and the sighting was listed as Unknown. A review of the evidence by the present authors suggests a highly probable explanation. Above the low cloud cover at 3,000 feet the night was clear and moonless. In the east, Sirius was just rising over the horizon at the azimuth of the sighting. The unknown "object" was just the star Sirius. The atmospheric refraction would have produced exactly the phenomenon described. The same atmospheric conditions that caused the mirage of the star would have caused anomalous radar returns (see Chapter VIII).
