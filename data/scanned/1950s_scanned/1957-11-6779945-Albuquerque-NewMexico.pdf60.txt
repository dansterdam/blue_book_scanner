21 November 1957 
Albuquerque, New Mexico 
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object 
1. On 6 November 1957, at approximately 1845 hours, a yellowish-white light was observed by two officers of the Albuquerque Police Department, while on routine patrol. The light was first sighted in the southwest sky, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. 
2. The object was first observed as a motionless light; however, within a few seconds, it began moving in a northeasterly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. The object then made an abrupt 90-degree turn to the east and continued at a high rate of speed, finally disappearing from view in the eastern sky. 
3. The entire observation lasted approximately 30-40 seconds. The object was observed to be approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length, and no sound was heard during the observation. 
4. Weather conditions at the time were clear, with a few scattered clouds. Visibility was unrestricted. 
5. This office has made a thorough investigation of the incident and is unable to offer a positive identification of the object observed. It is requested that this case be forwarded to Project Blue Book for further evaluation.
