On February 18, the Soviets warned the U.S. that they can now deliver bombs all over the world by either plane or rocket.

On this same date, Paris reported a mystery object in the skies. Described as twice as large as an ordinary commercial airliner, it was tracked on radar screens by Orly Airport officials. Traveling at an estimated 1,500 miles an hour, the object appeared over the Paris region late last evening and seemed to hover for a few minutes before disappearing at high speed.

A Paris reporter writing on February 20 said that some radars had caught the blip, others hadn't. He also wrote that an incoming pilot, "alerted to the UFO", saw only a blinking red fire. The pilot said that the object did not show up on his radar.
