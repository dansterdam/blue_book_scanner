c. Summary of events:
   A weather gunner, on lookout duty at an open waist hatch, sighted a bright light on the starboard bow of the Patrol Plane. The light was estimated to be 15-20 miles distant. It was observed to have a definite pulsating action, varying in intensity as though the light were rotating or oscillating. The Patrol Plane Commander confirmed the contact, described as pulsating, approximately same size as a pocket or small lit light. The size, shape, and color of the flame remained constant during the 15-20 second observation period. It suddenly disappeared, seemingly by going into a reverse or closing action. Evidently the craft turned away, maintaining its distance of 15-20 miles. Radar contact was lost, but visual contact was maintained until the craft disappeared from sight. Maximum speed was estimated at four miles per minute.
