THE CASE INCIDENT: From indefatigable Gene Duplantier, 1957 Brant Clair Avenue, Galt, Ontario, Canada. His report is as follows: On July 30 at approximately 12:30 a.m. we were awakened by a bright light, and as he said, "errors". There were three prints in a circular area as if some object had landed. We could not find any other indications of landing, but when we investigated in the morning as he said, "errors". There were three prints in a circular area as if some object had landed. We could not find any other indications of landing, but when we investigated in the morning the prints were still clearly visible.

"Monster" Theory Discarded in UFO Landing Case Witnessed in Galt, Canada
An NICAP investigation of the Galt, Ontario "monster" story, which was published in a national magazine in 1957, was inconclusive, despite claims that some horrifying "monster" was involved. Stephens said the evidence strongly indicated this was actually a genuine UFO landing, rather than any "monster" theory.

According to his signed statement, Duplantier said the object was about 50 feet in diameter and seemed to have landed on or near the ground. The area where the object landed or rested was found to have an indentation about 4 inches deep and about 10 feet in diameter. Stephens said there were three circular impressions or depressions in the ground, each about 18 inches in diameter and spaced about 3 feet apart, which could have been caused by the landing gear of the object.
