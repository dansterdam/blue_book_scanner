The image does not contain any photographs, but rather sketches or illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and a "B" on it, and the instructions state to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and a "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

The second set of sketches shows three illustrations. The larger sketch appears to depict a person standing on a road or path with buildings or structures in the background. The smaller sketch on the right shows a horizon line with an object or shape in the sky.

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
