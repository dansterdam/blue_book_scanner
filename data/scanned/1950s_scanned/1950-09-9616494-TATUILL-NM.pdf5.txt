This time the object was headed the south.

At no time did the object seem to travel at a very 
rate of speed. All apparent movement was fairly slow 
and very smooth. All the time the observation was 
made it was moving fairly steady to show. The 
observation, as I did not have the Binoculars or the Powerzagon. 

There were no distinct lights on the object
the orange yellow was flush to the night sky and 
was off the millimeters to the south east. At no time did the object seem to be 
shining or reflecting.

There is no doubt I was very excited at the 
time of observation; especially at the time of the second 
and last observation, thought I did not lose my head 
on this observation. After seeing the object disappear that last time 
it started to rain very, very hard.
