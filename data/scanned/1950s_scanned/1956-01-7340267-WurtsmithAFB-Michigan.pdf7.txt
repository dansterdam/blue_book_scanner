III. OBSERVER'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: I WAS ON STANDBY DUTY IN GCA. AT ABOUT 1850 HRS, 5 DEC 55, I OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT COLORED (YELLOWISHORANGE) OBJECT IN THE SKY. IT WAS STATIONARY AND APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON TO THE SOUTHWEST. AS I WATCHED, THE OBJECT BEGAN A RAPID UPWARD CLIMB OF ABOUT 10 TO 15 DEGREES, AND CONTINUED CLIMBING RAPIDLY TO A POINT APPROXIMATELY 40 TO 45 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT THEN STOPPED AND MAINTAINED THIS POSITION UNTIL IT BEGAN A GRADUAL DESCENT AND FINALLY DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. DURING THE ENTIRE OBSERVATION, THE OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY EXCEPT FOR THE CLIMBING AND DESCENDING MANEUVERS. IT DID NOT BLINK OR CHANGE IN INTENSITY OF LIGHT. I COULD NOT DISCERN ANY DEFINITE SHAPE OR OUTLINE. IT APPEARED TO BE A BRIGHT LIGHT ONLY. AS IT CLIMBED IT APPEARED TO INCREASE IN SIZE ALTHOUGH IT REMAINED A POINT SOURCE OF LIGHT. THE TOTAL OBSERVATION LASTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES.
