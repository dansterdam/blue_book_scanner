(12) Capt. James Scott Sutton and Tactical Instructor of 1st Cav. Div.. GEORGIA. Senior pilot with approximately 4,000 hours military flying time. It is my belief that any lights seen below cloud level on the operation of this aircraft normally flown high above the cloud cover, and especially any jets to have been easily heard. The sounds are similarly quite and jets can be easily heard up to 30,000 to 40,000 feet altitude.
