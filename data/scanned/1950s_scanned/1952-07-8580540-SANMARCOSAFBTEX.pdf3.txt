STATEMENT

On 21 July 1952, at approximately 2240 hours, the writer and I were returning Lockhart to San Marcos via colored lights and objects. An object was sighted and approximately 5000 feet. It stopped and appeared white in color and I could identify the object as being round. The color seemed to change to very bright yellow and the object moved off to the south. It was quite fast.
