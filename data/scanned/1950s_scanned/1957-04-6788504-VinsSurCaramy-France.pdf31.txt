Plate 4 - To the left - The view that was taken from the window of Mr. , the deputy who witnessed the incident. It appears from here that the witnesses saw the light of the "small man" and the three "small men". The distance from the window to the arrow does not surprise us motorists. Above the barn, they observed the highway in the direction the arrow indicates. The pasture, fenced and with trees, is on the left. This is where the observers eventually remember the place that this occurs so that they can be recognized.

To the right - Next to our general secretary and the red and white lines of sight, the place of the observation and the surrounding area. These marks were all worn at the time and are currently not quite so noticeable as they have been smoothed out, but one of them still bears a distinct line mark of the position that it formed the observation. The arrow indicates the place where Mr. 's farm is located in the background.

To the right - View that was taken from the highway, but in the opposite direction. One sees the house of Mr. . The arrow indicates that area of the field where the "object" was stopped and Mr. , saw from their windows.
To the right of the arrow, one sees the cafeteria. This all occurred at 3:00 p.m. one night.
