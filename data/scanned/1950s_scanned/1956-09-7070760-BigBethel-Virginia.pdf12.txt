The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the text found in the document:

"Addenda: Chesam: 
1. Wh - Cloudy, winds, may have been some slight rain - the haze.

2. No report of UFO or sighting 
     confirmed from:
     a. Radio units
     b. Gc units
     c. Air Police
     d. Others

3. Calls checked the UFO reports said 9 to have been of some considerable time ago - some fear that case a somewhat distantly similar replied - Nothing no search."
