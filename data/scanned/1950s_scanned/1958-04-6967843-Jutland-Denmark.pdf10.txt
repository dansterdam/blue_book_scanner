"SPACESHIP" OVER DENMARK--Danish officials have appealed for witnesses to corroborate a woman's statement that she saw a "spaceship" on Apr. 15 near Broager, south Jutland. The woman described the spaceship as a big, black, low-flying object bearing on it a white and yellow circle which seemed to move. She said that when it flew over Broager a number of horseshoe-shaped objects with a "glowing light" issued from it. About 20 other witnesses reported seeing "a triangular spaceship" in the vicinity at the same time. One witness said he saw a "sea of flames" in the sky. A member of the Danish interplanetary society said that in the past few days he had been "flooded" with reports of triangular spaceships and other celestial phenomena.
