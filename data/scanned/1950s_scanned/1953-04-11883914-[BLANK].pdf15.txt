By December 10, 1952, all sighting reports dated before June 15, 1952, should be processed and evaluated, ready for IBM analysis. Complete IBM analysis of all sighting reports will not be started until all reports dated previous to 1953 are processed and evaluated. Because of the nature of the work required, and the fact that the number of reports for the last three months of 1952 is not yet known, no estimate can be given as to the time final IBM analysis will begin. It is hoped, if the frequency of sighting reports follows the present decreasing trend, that complete IBM analysis for sightings dated through 1952 may be started by February 1, 1953.
