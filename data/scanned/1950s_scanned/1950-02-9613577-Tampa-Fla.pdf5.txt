STATEMENT

On the night of 8 February 1950 at approximately 1145EST while flying 
as pilot of B-29 letting down into traffic pattern at MacDill AFB on a 
heading of 201 degrees magnetic, nose of plane was pointed at southeast 
side of Tampa, approximately eighteen (18) miles ahead I noticed an apparent 
meteor approaching from left side of airplane. It didn't burn out and 
continued on. When prior to being directly over head I noticed that its 
path had an appearance of a rocket with terrific speed and holding level 
flight altitude and straight heading. I followed it's flight across the 
plane remarking something like: "Look at that damned thing," and moving 
my head to the side of the wheel to see it vanish straight on its course 
to the right of the plane. One (1) pilot passenger got a glimpse of it, 
I feel, by his hearing my remark.

The speed, I would estimate, would be in excess of 2000 mph. The 
flame remained constant behind the nose of the flame for a distance of 
at least 300 feet (this depending on the altitude would vary) and then 
changing into a very dull glow in the sky. The width of the flame com-
pared to the length would be 1 x 10. If flame length was 300 feet the 
width would be 30 feet. Sky was clear at this time with haze in lower 
levels. I don't think this was a meteor. I radioed this information 
to Tampa Approach Control immediately after sighting.
