Summary: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph.)

This report was completed as requested by the 6520th AISS Squadr on on 13 Oct 1951. The reported sighting occurred at 2100 hours, 7 Oct 1951, in the vicinity of St. Paul, Minnesota. The object observed was reported to be approximately 40 feet in diameter, silvery-white in color, and traveling in a horizontal direction at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of 2-3 minutes before disappearing. The pilot, an Air National Guard pilot, was flying his F-51 fighter aircraft at the time of the sighting and immediately reported the encounter to the Minneapolis Control Tower. Considering the intelligence background of the observer and the fact that there were four men to confirm the sighting, this is a very believable report. It is not believed this type of object is known to the Air Force.
