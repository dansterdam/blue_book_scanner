PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ANALYSIS OF THE "MONTANA" FILM TRACKING TWO UFO'S

Two Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) were sighted and photographed at about 11:37 PM on August 15, 1950 at Great Falls, Montana. The film was obtained by the USAF Operations, Air Material Command, Intelligence, through the cooperation of the Anaconda Copper Company, and it is the property of the U.S. Government. 

It was during the inspection of this ball park that the sighting took place. (And his recollection that the lighting conditions were such that he could see the UFO's as silhouettes against the sky line.)

The film was sent to the Kodachrome original, as returned to him, comprised 335 frames. This original film was shown by him before several service clubs and other interested public meetings, indicating the genuineness of the film and the interest created by the objects by which they could be seen to rotate in union while on the film. 

The film as returned by the Air Force, according to Mr. F. was the only copy that had been permitted to have been made. (He had the film closely guarded but would permit viewing to other interested parties.

Eventually, the original film came into the possession of Greenfield Productions, at Sam Goldwyn Studios, 1041 North Formosa Street, Hollywood, Calif when it was loaned and released in 35mm sepiaprint of it was prepared for documentary use.

The photometric analysis was recommended by ATTIC personnel in 1950.
