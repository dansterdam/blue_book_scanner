Transcribing the text in the document:

On Aug. 28, 1951, at approximately 10:45 p.m., a group of about 30 people observed a brilliantly lighted aerial object moving across the sky over Monmouth Beach, New Jersey. 

The object, described as being about 75 to 100 feet long, appeared to be shaped like a cigar and was moving at an estimated speed of 500 to 600 miles per hour. It was witnessed for approximately 4 to 5 minutes before disappearing from sight.

Several of the observers stated that the object emitted a bright white light which seemed to illuminate the surrounding area. Others reported that the object appeared to be surrounded by a reddish glow or aura.

Attempts to identify the object as a conventional aircraft or other known aerial phenomenon were unsuccessful. The description of the object and the speed at which it was traveling do not correspond to any type of man-made or natural aerial vehicle known at that time.
