There does not appear to be a photograph present in the provided image. The image shows a typed document that appears to be an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will extract all the text found in the document:

is strange in view of the fact that it passed almost directly over
Craig. [REDACTED] believes the object was roughly one to two thousand
feet above the ground.
There were three other witnesses to this action. All agree on time,
course and visual characteristics. Object was first sighted at
0155 Zebra time, and was in sight approximately 10 minutes. It
was first sighted at grid coordinates November Lima 2732, and flew
a direct course to November Lima 3031, where it passed out of sight.
The light was still flashing with regularity, seeming to be on top
of, or on the stern section of the object.
Weather was fair, no cloud cover, with thin haze in the east.
No wind, temperature 55-60.
[REDACTED] is 28, employed as a night baker, veteran of the
Navy (Security Dept). Mailing address, Craig.
Other witnesses: Mrs [REDACTED] (wife)
[REDACTED] (father)
[REDACTED] (mother)
This report was first made to James M. Pugh, Moffat by GN
in Craig. Mr Pugh checked with Craig airport. No a/c had taken
off or landed there recently.
A check with GCI posts in this area has been negative as regards
any object of this description.
