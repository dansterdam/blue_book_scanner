STATEMENT

66th FI Thomas C. Heins, 1st Lt, AO 707649, assigned to the 66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, as a fighter pilot.

AT 0025 ON 21 JULY 1952 I WAS FLYING AN F-94 JET INTERCEPT OF AN UNKNOWN OBJECT, WHEN I SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT APPROACHING ME AT 2,900 FEET WHEN I WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES NORTH OF KODIAK. IT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN DIAMETER AND AS I CLOSED ON IT, IT ACCELERATED AND STREAKED OUT OF SIGHT IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AT APPROXIMATELY 0230. MY RADAR OPERATOR LT. KELLY, LATER TOLD ME HE HAD A STRONG ON HAND CONTINUOUSLY WHICH HE HAD LOST JUST PRIOR TO MY VISUAL SIGHTING. WHEN THE RADAR OBSERVER WATCHED THE SHORT RANGE SEARCH IN OPERATION, IT WENT OFF THE SCOPE AT THE SAME TIME I SAW THE BRIGHT LIGHT ABOVE THE OVERCAST TO 7,000 FEET. AFTER 3 MINUTES, I ONCE AGAIN PICKED IT UP BUT BY THEN IT HAD SLOWED TO 6,000 FEET. THE SAME SEQUENCE OCCURRED. AT NO TIME X SIGHT A NORMAL X-CRAFT.
