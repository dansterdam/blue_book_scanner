PAGE THREE RJKDLA 7
AREA AT THE TIME: TWO TOWER OPERATORS REPORTED THEY HAD WITNESSED
WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE FLARE ACTIVITY, IN THE RIDGE WEST OF
THE AIRPORT, SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST, AND THOSE INCIDENTS HAD
BEEN REPORTED TO THE TERRITORIAL POLICE IN FAIRBANKS. A CHECK WITH
THE POLICE CHIEF CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAVE REPORTS OF RESIDENTS
LIVING IN THE RIDGE AREA THAT APPARENTLY HAVE FLARES IN THEIR
POSSESSION AND FIRE THEM FROM TIME TO TIME. THE POLICE HAVE BEEN
UNABLE TO APPREHEND THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUAL TO DATE. THE
SIGHTING CANNOT BE DEFINITELY INENITIFIED, BUT ANALYSIS OF ALL
INFORMATION WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THE OBJECT WAS A FLARE FIRED
BY PERSONS UNKNOWN.
