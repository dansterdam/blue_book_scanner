The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memo or document from the Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

Memo to D/I (GIN-X), (U) UFO Movie, 1 Jun 56

A recent analysis of the ********* film, made by Air Force photo specialists totally unaware of the previous history of this case, yielded the opinion that the bright spots of light on the film were bird reflections in the strong sunlight.

The unusuality of certain air actions presented in all evaluations made in this case leaves little doubt that the UFOs in the ********* film are genuine.

2. Attached is a copy of this memo to be given to Mr. M. A. Monts in the Air Force Press Room in the Pentagon.
