I am to thank you for the additional information which you supplied on 29 March 1952.

Based on the information you have supplied, it is my considered opinion that this case will be unproductive in our intelligence analysis of this problem.

In order to determine whether any further action is warranted, I would like to discuss this case in more detail with you. Can you please contact me at your earliest convenience so that we can arrange a conference to review the details?

Sincerely,

/s/ W. W. OHLSSON
