She described it as being "a flying saucer". Her husband, who was skeptical at first, soon became convinced that it was indeed a "flying saucer" as his wife had described. Mrs. Anthony, terrified by the experience, a Sheffield Lake housewife and her husband watched the object for more than five minutes through the bedroom window. The object glowed a brilliant white color and then disappeared gradually from view, leaving a cloud of white smoke or vapor in its wake.
