The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a radar plotting chart or maneuver board, which is used to track and record the movement of objects in the sky. The chart shows a logarithmic scale along the bottom and various markings and notations, but does not contain any visible photographs or images of UFOs.
