Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a report of an observation of two objects ("lights") seen in the sky on the night of July 19-20 over Lavalete, N. J. Since these lights were very similar to those reported over Washington, D.C., the same night, and since they did not resemble any aircraft known to the observers, either in appearance or in manner of motion and disappearance, I am submitting a complete description for possible correlation with other similar reports. I have purposely delayed this report since I have no intention of allowing my name to be associated in "newsprint" with the so-called "flying saucer scare". Therefore, while I am giving my name and position below, I request that they be used only for your files, or be given only to the Air Force should you judge this report worth passing on to them.

The objects described were witnessed by myself and a companion. We have carefully compared our impressions, and the description given consists of those impressions agreed upon by both.

A TRUE COPY:

Sincerely,
