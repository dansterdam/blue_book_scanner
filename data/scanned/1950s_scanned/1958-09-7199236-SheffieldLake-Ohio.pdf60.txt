UFO Sighting
Mrs. ___ had gone to bed after watching the late movie on television. This was about 3:15 a.m. She was in bed with her eyes closed, when the room was illuminated by a very strong light, causing her to open her eyes. The witness was astonished, because the window curtains were drawn, and the room was "brighter than in the daytime." She then rose, and standing on the bed pulled back the curtains and looked out the window. (see fig. 1)

Looking through the window, the witness saw a round object (see fig. 2) about 20 feet in diameter and ten feet from the house. The object was traveling slowly in a northerly direction across the front yard, and losing altitude. At the time o f it was first sighted the object was about 5 feet off the ground. It proceeded until reaching a point about 50 feet from the witness, in the lot next door (see fig. 3) Here the object stopped for several seconds. It then moved south into the front yard to a point about 25 feet from the witness. The object made two tight clockwise turns, then shot straight up and out of sight.

Close questioning about the motion of the object brought out the following: During its move from a position in front of the window to the position in the lot 50 feet north of the window, the object was descending with a motion "like a feather dropping." The witness explained that this was a slight side to side oscillation. When it returned half way into the front yard, it made two tight turns. The witness thinks that the object was about 50 feet in diameter.
