As of 1930 hrs., Thursday, 29 May 52, I was standing on my front porch in San Antonio, Texas, with my wife and a civilian salesman. Suddenly, my attention was drawn to three brightly illuminated objects approximately 35Â° above the horizon and slightly west of my location. At first they appeared as thin, high stratus layers of clouds, and then gradually became disc-shaped. The objects remained in this position for approximately 3 minutes. Their appearance while a thin stratus layer was disc-shaped and they were giving off a bright bluish-white glare. Upon reaching a position of being slightly higher or traveling very slowly, they disappeared from view. Upon reaching a position of being slightly higher or traveling very slowly, they disappeared from view. They seemed to descend rather slowly, but it seemed to me that they were ascending. I kept this position for eight minutes by the clock and then slowly lifted from my position. The objects which presented themselves to my view were completely silhouetted against the stars, which was for a few seconds only. It then proceeded to complete a gradual disappearance from horizontal to vertical position, which was an extremely smooth maneuver. The objects were under control. It seemed to me to be some kind of aircraft that was denied by the extension and acceleration to a point beyond visible sight. Also during this lateral of observation two very bright red lights appeared from the same direction.
