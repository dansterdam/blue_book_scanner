Private
SSN 3952, Fort Monmouth
They require that as a student must learn how to repair, adjust, and operate
radar equipment. Started radar course 7 May 1951. Previous experience is that of
a radio repair man. Service dates back to Dec 1950. Graduated from radio and
television school (Coyne, in Chicago)

Story as given by Private
One Tuesday (not certain of day of date) morning SCR-584A station #315 having
a maximum range of 70,000 yds and capable of added tracking up to 30,000 yds
picked up an object, altitude 9-(16-20) miles, azimuth range of aircraft was 20,000
yds and elevation of 800 miles. azimuth 16-15 degrees. Had trouble keeping object
on elevation. Object faded intermittingly. The time was approximately 10-10:30.
Time on scope was 5 minutes maximum. Believed this was a good radar day. Blip
looked good - good return. PPI gave good bright spot of approximately 1/3 inch
and was well defined. Subject known somewhat anomolous propagation. Subject stated
that PPI - saw same object that day. 

Remarks:
This set will track up to a speed of approximately 700 mph. A plotting board
is not normally used in this particular training course. Antenna is usually
checked by sighting on Shrewsbury water tower. Prior to sighting instructor
mal-adjusted the radar set, thus setting up a problem for the students. It was
necessary for to adjust the klystron, receiver, magnetrons. Working
schedule was 7:30 to 5:30 and leaves area for chow by 11:20. Believes he went
off this set on the 14th Sept. Operator believes set was in good working order
since commercial aircraft were sighted and tracked prior to sighting of object.
