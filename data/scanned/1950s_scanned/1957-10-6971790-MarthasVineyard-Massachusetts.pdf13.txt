INFORMATION REPORT 
PREPARED BY: District Intelligence Officer, AND
CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED
REPORT NO.: 25-57
DATE: 12 November 1957

Preparing Officer's Comment: This report is forwarded in possible aid in evaluating SUBJECT sighting. The sighting may be more reliably reported than might at first be considered since details concerning the object sighting are more complete than many other reports received. The object apparently was observed in the New England area and other areas.

PRO-STAFF has been requested to interview Michael R. ONUFR in order to obtain a sketch of the object sighted to be forwarded direct to GHI.

Forwarding Officer's Comment: If a lst level sighting at low attitude, there most likely would have been a vapor trail even though this incident occurred before new cold fronts were frequent in New England. Also, any possible jet in the area appears to be unknown. Sighting does not develop into an observation of longer and more identifiable object was possibly/probably not a device with binocular/telescope characteristics. It appears that the unidentified object was possibly/probably not identifiable object.
