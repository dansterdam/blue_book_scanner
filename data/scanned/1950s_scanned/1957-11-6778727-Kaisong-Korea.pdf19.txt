One G November 21 at 0430. had just inspected one guard postdown road about 2 mile in length lookingfor vehicle had got that this period were visibleI was going behind a building. but they were dark watched in the clear night sky. I could see them with the naked eyeclearly silhouetted against the sky. they appeared to be in a horizontal flight. They passed over the building in a north northeasterly directionand disappeared from sight in about 5 to 8 seconds, I called for the Commanding Officer who was walking from his quarters. I pointed out the objects as they passed overhead. but by that time they had disappeared from sight. 

I could observe the objects clearly and I would estimate they were about the size of a dime held at arm's length and they appeared to be brilliant. Then it faded out.
