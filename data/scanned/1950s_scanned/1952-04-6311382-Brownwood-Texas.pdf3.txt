Text in the document:

On 7 April 1952 at approximately 2330 hours on 2 April 12, 1952 the Control Tower operator at Dyess Air Force Base, Abilene, Texas, reported that a Civil Pilot had reported a "strange lighted object" to him while in the air.

The object was described as a spherical or ball-shaped object, larger than a star, white in color, and emitting a constant white light. It was observed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, moving at an estimated speed of 200 to 300 knots. The object was observed by the pilot and control tower operator.

In this estimation the speed of the object was approximately 200 to 300 knots. It was possible to determine the elevation and bearing of the object from the information given. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet and on a course of approximately 040 degrees.
