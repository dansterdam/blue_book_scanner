10. CONCLUSION
Other (Reflection)
Since objects and associated with the A/C in the area, it is probable that they were reflections from this A/C.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The objects consisted of balls breaking through Cirrus clouds through which they were passing. Sighting 350 degrees elevation, 170 degrees azimuth. Two objects in formation with the A/C. This is probably the B-36 type that the witness reported.
