all the G.O. witnessing any fast object to appear and form the sky and seemed to make a landing behind a hill.
It was certainly not a balloon. 
It could have been some unknown fast object that we could not identify.
Other than this, there is nothing further to report. The object soon disappeared and there was no further observation.
This photograph was taken at approximately 10:30 P.M. (EST) on (date censored) 1953.
