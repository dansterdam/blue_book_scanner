TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:
THIS INFORMATION WAS REPORTED THROUGH A PERSONAL LETTER BY AN AGENT AND COVERED BEFORE OR POSSIBLE CROSSING OF THIS OBJECT. A RESIDENT OF SAINT CROIX FALLS, WISCONSIN, STATED HE WAS FLYING AT 10,600 FT. REGARDING THE RAID BAG BALLOON WHEN I SAW A BRIGHT GLOW OBJECT TO THE EAST OF ME. THE OBJECT SUDDENLY STOPPED AND I HAD AN EXCELLENT VIEW OF IT FROM THE SIDE AS I FLEW PAST IT. 

THE OBJECT WAS MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST. IT WAS HIGH AND VERY BRIGHT. WE WERE KEEPING THE SHIP ON A CONSTANT COURSE AND USING BEST SPOTTING MEMBER OF THE WINDSHIELD AS A POINT. THE OBJECT MOVED PAST THIS MEMBER AT ABOUT 30 DEGREES PER SECOND. 

THIS OBJECT WAS PECULIAR IN THAT IT HAD THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A HALO AROUND IT WITH A DARK ENCOMPASSING ZONE. IT CROSSED RAPIDLY AND THEN SLOWED DOWN AND STARTED TO CLIMB IN LAZY CIRCLES SLOWLY. THE PATTERN IT MADE WAS LIKE A FALLING CAR LEAF INVERTED. IT WENT THROUGH THESE GYRATIONS FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND THEN VERY RAPID ACCELERATION DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST. THIS OBJECT WAS A VERY BRIGHT OBJECT AND I WATCHED FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES.

WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE ITS SIZE, BECAUSE AT THE TIME I DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLOON TO SIGHT FOR A COMPARISON.
