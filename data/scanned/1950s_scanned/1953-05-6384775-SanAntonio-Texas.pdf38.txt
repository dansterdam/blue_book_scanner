AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: VISAO INTELLIGENCE OFFICE
23 - 1

SUBJECT: Unidentified objects sighted by Mr. [REDACTED], Drive, San Antonio, Texas, on 27 May 1953 from 2030 to 2045 hours.

On Wednesday night, May 27, 1953, at approximately 8:30 P.M., I was called by your home office to investigate a call which had originated at [REDACTED] which was designated as being very unusual. When I observed the object, it was hovering over a residential area about 1/2 mile to the southwest of my location. The object appeared to be a metallic, star-like object, quite as white as a star but larger. This object had rapid, perpendicular movements and remained in the air for approximately 15 minutes. The object seemed to be very high, that it looked almost stationary. I observed it through binoculars and it was about the size of a baseball at arm's length. It made no sound whatsoever and seemed to be completely under control. I could distinguish no shape or outline as it appeared round. At times it appeared to burst out into a fluorescent glow of yellowish-white. It would remain stationary for a few seconds and then dart off in a straight line at a very high rate of speed and make an abrupt turn and return to its original position. On several occasions it appeared to shoot off a smaller object which would dart out a short distance and return. I continued to watch the object and follow it as it remained in the area for approximately 20 minutes. I then lost sight of it as it seemed to merge into the sky and disappear.
