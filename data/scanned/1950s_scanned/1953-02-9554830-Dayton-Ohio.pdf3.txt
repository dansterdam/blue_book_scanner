UFO SIGHTING
Sighted as far as (illegible) the peak of a (illegible) it appeared very suddenly. The shape appeared to be triangular in form and smaller than an airplane, estimated 100 feet in width. The color appeared to be dark metallic, and it made no sound as it traveled, changing direction from north to south in approximately 3 seconds. The sighting lasted less than 10 seconds. I immediately called my wife and son into the room in an attempt to corroborate my observation, but it had already disappeared. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed, considerably faster than any aircraft I have ever seen, and made no sound. There was a possibility that its appearance was due to some atmospheric condition, but I was unable to confirm that. 

Feb. 9, 1953 - Friday morning - clear sky.
I was sitting at my kitchen table reading a newspaper when the object appeared. It flew over my house traveling south to north. The entire observation time was approximately 6-10 seconds.
