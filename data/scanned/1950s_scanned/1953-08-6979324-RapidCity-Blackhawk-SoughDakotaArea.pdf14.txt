          Commander, ATIC                                    ATIA3-5/Capt Hardin/jos/73117
                                                             5 January 1954

                            MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

PROBLEM:

    1. To request approval for ATIC officer to travel to Rapid City, South
Dakota, and Bismarck, North Dakota, for the purpose of determining the ori-
gin of a reported unidentified flying object.

FACTS AND DISCUSSION:

    2. On 5 Aug 53 a sighting was made in the vicinity of Rapid City,
South Dakota, by numerous reliable military and civilian obverers. Another
rjening was reported from Bismarck, North Dakota, on the same date ard ap-
peared to b the same object. The object was also tracked by radar.
invlstigati on followed but without the aid of an astronomer and the case
remains unsolved.
    
    3. Dr. Hynek of Ohio State University, contract astronomer to Projact
Blue Book, has had this case under study and believes that a satisfactory
conclusion may be reached by a joint on-the-spot investigation.
    
RECOMMENDATIONS:

    b. Project Blue Book believes that this is a significant case and
should be solve for the purpose ef its possible scientific value as well
as to discourage its use by writers who may draw their own conclusions in
lieu of an official solution. It is, therefore, recommended that Capt
Charles M. Hardin (in company with Dr. Hynek) proceed to Rapid City, South
Dakota, and Bismarck, North Dakota, for approximately 5 days TDY.
