23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Slowly drop away.

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct a model or picture of the object as you would think it would appear. Describe in your own words a fundamental aspect or character of the object which you saw.
