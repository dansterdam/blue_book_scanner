Brief Summary and Analysis:
Body, circular, pulsating, glowing object observed with binoculars. Object hovering at high altitude approx 30,000 ft. Object noted is similar to other reports in that it was observed to be circular in shape, pulsating and glowing. However, conclusion could not be drawn as type of object since the maneuver and behavior noted was not sufficient evidence to determine identity of object. This type balloon not common in area.
