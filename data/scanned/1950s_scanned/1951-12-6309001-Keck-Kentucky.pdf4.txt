MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief of Staff, USAF
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting.

1. In reply to your request for information concerning a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object, you are advised that at approximately 19:10 in 23 December 1953, my wife, my son and I were proceeding from my quarters at Earnest Harmon Air Force Base, Stephenville, Newfoundland, to the Officers' Club. It was a clear cloudless night, with a very bright moon, and we noticed a bright light, with a very elongated, cylindrical shape, which was almost directly overhead. The light was approximately 25 to 30 miles distant, and suddenly it began abruptly to change to a thin contrail type cloud appearing from the outer atmosphere. As this cloud form descended the contrail began to widen, then changed to grey and progressed into black. The cloud extended from the vicinity of the moon and disappeared beyond the horizon to the west. It had no visible movement, but apparently appeared all at once. I received no report from the another aircraft control tower where other persons had observed the same phenomena.

2. The gray of the cloud apparently returning from Sunnyvale to Earnest Harmon observed this same phenomenon, with the addition that they saw the contrail pass overhead and disappear to the westward in a flash of white light, apparently in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. A reporting of this sighting has been received.
