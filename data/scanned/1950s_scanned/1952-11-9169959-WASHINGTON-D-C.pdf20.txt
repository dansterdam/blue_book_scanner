ONE SAUCER-LIKE OBJECT OVER WASHINGTON, D.C.  AUGUST 12-13, 1952

A saucer-like object was observed over Washington, D.C. on the nights of August 12-13, 1952. The object was described as round, saucer-like, and very bright. It was observed by radar and visually by both military and civilian personnel. The object moved rapidly and silently. Entire observation lasted for several hours each night.

NOTES
One small monster report at Fairfax, Va to the following MP: An Arligton County, Virginia, Deputy Sheriff of the 2nd District reported by phone about 1:00 AM, August 13-14, 1952, that at about 10:45 PM, August 12, 1952, in the town of Fairfax, Virginia, a bright light ball approximately 75 feet in diameter was observed about 100 feet over the heads of a crowd of people. The light remained stationary for about 10 to 15 minutes and then shot out of sight toward the East at a high rate of speed. This is the same general area and approximately the same time as the previous object over Washington, D.C. HS thought this may be an extension or tie-in with the Washington, D.C. sightings.

(COPY) A.s. has received the following report on the FLORIDA-GEORGIA sightings - Burned clothing incident: The local power company dissese the insulation on wires, causing ground fires. This may be explanation of ball of fire sightings.
