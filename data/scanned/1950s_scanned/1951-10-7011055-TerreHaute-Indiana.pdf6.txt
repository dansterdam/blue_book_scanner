BASIC DATA, VR. DATA - 9 October 1951

On 9 October 1951 at 12:00 CST, a CAA-Chief Aircraft Communicator observed a silvery object pass directly overhead. The object was described as being perfectly round, five miles east of Terre Haute, Indiana. The object passed within 50 feet of the observer and left a vapor trail in its wake. It was further reported that the object passed from directly overhead to the horizon in about 10 seconds. There was no sound or propulsion method visible, and the object could not be seen as it passed over the horizon and out of sight.

Clear, bright sun, no clouds or haze.

Status of Investigation

Further details on the incident will be obtained, but it is doubtful if any further information will indicate the possible identity of the object.
