Text from the document:

Dear Harold Jenkins:
Enclosed you will find one of the projection slides, which we talked about in Columbus, or objects my son saw in the sky on a trip he made to Grenada, Ohio.
This is one of a series that he took. The next part of October, 1952 about the middle part, he started taking more pictures of objects he continued seeing over Toledo, Ohio.
If you would say for more information contact that 51 years a night in flight he witnessed to my son who is stationed at Bolling, in Landry, his address is
Seattle, Washington
It is appreciated greatly, when you are finished with it and will be glad to have duplicates made of the others and send to you if you care for them.
Also over he took a series of night pictures beginning at the time he first sighted the objects until he had used up all his film.
Sincerely,

BIG CAR QUALITY AT LOWEST COST
