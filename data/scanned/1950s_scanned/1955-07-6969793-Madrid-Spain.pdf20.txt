CASTELLANA HILTON
Madrid, Spain

Dear Sirs:

Another long Beam, Calif. phenomenon, may be of interest. 

We are vacationing in Europe for the month of July. During a tour of the city of Madrid on the night of July 10, 1955, at about 10:30 PM, my wife and I along with several others observed a very strange aerial object. This craft was about 15 to 20 feet in diameter, had a bright whitish glow that illuminated the area, and traveled silently across the night sky from west to east. It first appeared in the bright western sky, passed directly over Madrid, and disappeared to the east. It took about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes for the object to cross the sky. Since the sky was unusually clear, we were able to observe the object very closely. It seemed to be entirely self-illuminated, and no navigation or running lights were visible. The glow appeared to be coming from the body of the craft itself. Its speed was phenomenal, unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. 

No sounds were heard, and the object seemed to be under intelligent control. I only wish I had been able to photograph this strange visit. If you have any information on similar sightings, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Sincerely,
D. Milton Hill
