The agreement is adequate to confirm the suggested rocket attitude. It is easily shown that the observed accelerations are not compatible with the body axis and the spin axis parallel.

Such a direct scaling of the theoretical accelerations is not precisely determinable from the observations. However, the air-drag term so the comparisons are probably not misleading. Further, it should be noted that the panige drops too fast in the integration, accounting for the increase in the mean of the theoretical acceleration.
