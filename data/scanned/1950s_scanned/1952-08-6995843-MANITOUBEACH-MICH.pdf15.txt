The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, dated August 7, 1952.

The text in the document is as follows:

At approximately 0615, 3 August 1952, while returning to Adrian, Michigan, a brilliant white light or object flash past traveling in the same direction as I. It was heading east at an estimated speed from Manitou Beach, Mich., to Wamplers Lake, Mich., about thirty (30) miles away. The object was south of me and appeared to be at an altitude of twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) feet and was parallel to the ground for four hundred (400) feet.

During the few seconds, probably not more than two (2), it travelled considerably faster than any jet-propelled aircraft I have ever seen. The light was brilliant white, brilliantly illuminating the ground beneath it. The object did not seem to have any specific shape or outline.

About forty (40) seconds later, another light or object appeared three hundred (300) feet to four hundred (400) feet up the road. It travelled in the same manner and direction as the first object, and was also brilliantly illuminated. Once again, no definite shape or outline could be seen.

I further wish to state that no vegetation, hill, or man-made object was responsible for this sighting, as my vision was unobstructed. The objects appeared to disappear suddenly.

There were no farm houses in the vicinity and no passing motorists for verification of these sightings.
