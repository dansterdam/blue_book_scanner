22 December 1952

STATEMENT

On 22 December 1952 about 0650 hours while awaiting take off call on the 2143 radar scope, Airman Harry A. W. Tobias (Dome Door #2), 1522d Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron, reported seeing an object over the runway (approximately) 1/30 Johnson, Lt. was discussing the UFO called by attention as a "falling star".

When he said "It's gone behind that cloud bank", the object was painting in a southeasterly direction.  

There was an open space in the clouds and Airman Johnson, and Adams, and I157203219, could see the object again. It appeared to be travelling in a very straight line very fast - it was about 270 degrees from compass directions (checked later). The object was travelling about twice as fast as a jet plane. It had a bright silverness trailing from the rear end. There was no trail or vapor trail behind it - I could not hear any noise and there had been no sound that it would have carried the sound away. 

I only saw the object for about 4 seconds, but I don't think it was a meteorite for the following reasons: First, it travelled in too straight a line - meteorites usually have erratic paths; and second, I have observed falling stars before, and have never seen one travel as fast and with such a bright silvery appearance as this object. To me, it appeared to be a man-made object, but I could not identify it.
