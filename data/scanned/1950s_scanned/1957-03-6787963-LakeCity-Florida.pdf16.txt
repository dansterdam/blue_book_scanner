The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an incident that occurred on March 20, 1957 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The text in the document is as follows:

"March 20, 1957 at Charlotte, North Carolina, five small, spherical objects were seen floating 30 feet in the air over the buildings along Central Avenue. As they were returning to the office of the National Guard, about 8:45 p.m., they suddenly stopped and hovered over the buildings. They didn't have any light of their own; they just reflected lights on the ground. One of them broke away from the others and began to change color. It started out red, then brighter than I saw that it was just reflecting red light from the State Farm office windows. The other objects seemed to be glued off and the fifth ship-ped together. The whole thing was like a thin sheet of ice slapping against the ground. When the object had hit, and moisture had spread over a 15-foot area. "It felt slippery to the touch, like an alkaline solution," and was "recalling or numbing" to his fingers. "It have a cold and couldn't smell it, but it seemed to have a smell." This case seems like a border incident. "C-2-a". Charlotte, N.C.â€”."
