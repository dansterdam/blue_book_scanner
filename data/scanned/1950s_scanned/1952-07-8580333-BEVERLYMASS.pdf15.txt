Text from the document:

WASHINGTON, Aug. 1, (UP) - Coast Guard photographer Shell E. Alpert, a Coast Guard station photographer, has taken what he calls "unidentified aerial phenomena" which bear a strong resemblance to the so-called "flying saucers."

The photo clearly shows four round, luminous objects hurtling through the air over Beverly, Mass. It was taken just after sunset on July 16, the Coast Guard says, and was sent to the widespread public interest in aerial phenomena that has made headlines recently. Shell E. Alpert, Salem, Mass., the station photographer who took this photograph told the newspaper this light show was "considerably dimmed down."
