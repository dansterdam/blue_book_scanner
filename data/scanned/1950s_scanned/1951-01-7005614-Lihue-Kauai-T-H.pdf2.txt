FLYING SAUCERS

Special Star-Bulletin Correspondence
Lihue, Kauai, Jan. 24 - People are still seeing flying saucers on Kauai. It's one thing when a group of migratory workers report seeing them, but it's another when Kauai's county officials themselves see the things. Thursday afternoon from the window of the chairman's office, officials spotted a silvery disc at 6:30 p.m. on a clearday.
