The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an "A" marked on the curved line to indicate the point where the observer first saw the object above the horizon. A "B" is also marked on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it.

The second and third sketches show larger scenes. The second sketch depicts a person standing on a road with mountains or hills in the background. The third sketch shows a person standing on a road with a curved horizon line and clouds in the sky.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
