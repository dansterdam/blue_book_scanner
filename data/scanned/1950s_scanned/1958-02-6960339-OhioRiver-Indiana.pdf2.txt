1. This device is a magnetometer for remote measurement of the strength of the earth's magnetic field. The pending elements being supported by a pendulum measured the strength of the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field.

2. It was probably carried to a high altitude by a balloon and then transmitted field strength measurements by telemetry to a ground station.
