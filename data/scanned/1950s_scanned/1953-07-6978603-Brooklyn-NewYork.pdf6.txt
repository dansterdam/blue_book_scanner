The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text on it.

I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe the text from the document:

I would not guess to state that it was faster, as any thing, but as a slattering state. As to what light I again would not guess. But if it was a light as I would now imagine, it would have been enormous.

That is almost exactly as appearance in the original photograph of the object last winter that was sent to Redwood field. When near the ground, they again came flying. But it what time the sky like they said I was there.

It is my personal opinion the Air Force has solved now those they are being, and this was no more than was of them. However, as I stated no written report is in waiting, this is my own impression and I do not also intend to give any further circulation to old yes, the time letter to P.M.

Sincerely yours,
