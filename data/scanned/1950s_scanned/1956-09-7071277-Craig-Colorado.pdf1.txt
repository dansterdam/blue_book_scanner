PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 23 September 1956
2. LOCATION: Craig, Colorado
3. SHAPE OF OBJECTS: Lights
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: [Blank]
5. COURSE: Four to five lights arranged as described in item 10
6. PHOTOS: 0 Yes
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1.1 minutes
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Lights were described as four to five lights arranged as described in item 10, distant lights traveling from northwest to southeast at approximately 5000-6000 feet altitude. Object or objects disappeared from view in direction of northeast to southeast.
11. COMMENTS: Civilian line indicates that aircraft fly over Craig and are familiar sights, but these lights did not behave like typical aircraft. This fact, plus the unusual direction of travel, probably leads to an unaccounted-for situation. Since there was no schedule for any known craft in the area, this case evaluated as probably n/c.
