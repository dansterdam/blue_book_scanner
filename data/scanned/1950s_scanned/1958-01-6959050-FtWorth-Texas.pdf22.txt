The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document dated January 29, 1958, containing a report from Denver, Colorado.

Report from Denver Moonwatch Team, for Denver, Colorado.

During an observing session last night, the team witnessed the unusual behavior of something which seemed to be a satellite. This object passed over the same course as the satellites but it moved in a different pattern, according to the report. The team was unable to make an accurate determination of how many satellites there were, and they were still passing over at the time of phoning. No special information that would help confirm, doubt, or explain this sighting could be determined. If we had any special information that would distinctly identify them, it would certainly be to our advantage to know.
