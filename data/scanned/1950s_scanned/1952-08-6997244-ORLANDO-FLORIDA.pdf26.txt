AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: L.G.33400B Flying Training Wing
SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Object
DATE: 3 August 1952
LOCATION: Orlando Air Force Base

Between 0700 and 1010 hours 3 August 1952, an unidentified object was observed over Orlando, Florida. Rosewald Park, Orlando, Florida.

The object appeared to be a solid silver ball, with no audible sound or visible means of propulsion. It was hovering and then moved at an estimated 5000 feet altitude. Object was in sight approximately ten minutes when it flew off to the northwest and disappeared.

At each sighting the object appeared to hover, with little or no lateral or vertical movement, and then leave the scene at a very high rate of speed.

Just prior to accelerating, the object appeared to slow, as though from intense heat.

On August 3 1952, the object was observed by Orlando, Fla. These observers confirmed the description and location of the object. It was not possible to identify the object.

At the time of sightings visibility was unlimited, with 7/10 coverage of cumulus clouds.

No interceptions were made and no photographs were taken.

The observers have had no previous experience in aircraft observation.

Alternate plans have been made to intercept the object if sighted again. However, no contact has been made and the object has not been seen during this period.
