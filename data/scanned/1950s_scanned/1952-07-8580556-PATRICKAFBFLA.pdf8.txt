REPORT ON FLYING OBJECTS AS OBSERVED AT PATRICK AFB, FLORIDA

On 18 July 1952, flying objects were observed over Patrick AFB, Florida, between the hours of 2145 and 2220. The first object was observed to approach the base from the South at a very high speed, coming to a halt directly over the field, reversed its course, and departed to the East, proceeding to the West at high speed. This was followed by a second object on the same course approximately five seconds later. A fourth object was shortly seen in the West at an angle of approximately 20 degrees above the horizon from the observers' position, proceeded West, made a wide 180 degree turn over the field and returned to the same position as the above objects. This observation lasted approximately five to six minutes.

The above four objects all were sighted within a period of five to six minutes. The objects were reported as appearing like a great star of amber color. The objects did not show any means of propulsion, and the tracking of these objects by the type of radars are not considered to be reliable for such tracking.

Five additional personnel reported the same objects and performance which included the airborne officer on duty at the time, control tower operator, aircraft dispatcher and two transient pilots from Wright Patterson AFB.
