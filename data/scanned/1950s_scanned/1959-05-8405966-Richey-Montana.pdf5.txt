24 June 1959

Dear Mr. [REDACTED]

The Air Force wishes to thank you for your recent report of a
material found in a field near Richey, Montana, which appeared as
strips of aluminum. The sample of the material which you forwarded
with your report has been analyzed and determined to be chaff.

Chaff is a material which is dropped from aircraft in an effort
to make radar detection difficult. In this instance the chaff was
dropped by our planes during a practice mission.

Sincerely

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
