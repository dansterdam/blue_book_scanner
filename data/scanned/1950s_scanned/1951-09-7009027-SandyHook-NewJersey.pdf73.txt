Work continued in Washington and Gen. Gabell wanted to be briefed on Tuesday in detail. We checked with Col Kirkland and learned that he wished us to leave behind in Washington as short and incomplete a record as possible pending our firm commitment to Washington as a power of center commitment in order to study the data in detail. This we were successful in accomplishing. We did have the work in Washington on Tuesday morning and afternoon in order to determine the possibility for balloon and experimental aircraft situations as the incident reported. Balloon results were, until after we left Washington, negative as were experimental aircraft possibilities. Agencies contacted with this respect were Gen Mills, a Mr. Delcin in Minneapolis, Minn., a Mrs. Whiting of the Signal Corps Research Development Center in Washington, Dr. Lincoln La Paz, Head of the Office of Naval Research and others incidental in discovering the identity of these project monitors. The weather bureau was contacted for the weather report. Command Post personnel were contacted to determine whether any reports from the Eastern Air Defense Command might have reported any sightings which we did not have. These results were negative. Persons contacted includes: Col Lamber, Eastern Air Defense Command, ACMI Officer, at the Pentagon; Col Garland, Army Chemical Center Commanding Officer, Lt Col Hubbell, Command 25th Engineers and personnel in the message centers. The following conclusions were left with General Gabell: His staff, Hartford and Jax, and qualified to them as particularly preliminary conclusions. Reference to the telecom message again OSAF Item 2, paragraph 1, we have nothing to the moment. We are attempting to get more.
