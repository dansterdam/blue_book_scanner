22. In the following sketch, imagine your eye at the point shown. Place an 
"A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon 
when you first saw it. Place a "B" to show where it was when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place 
an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

The text is accompanied by three different sketches related to reporting the observation of an object, marking the elevation angle, path, and movement. The text refers to the individual's perspective and the observed motion of the object, indicating directions and referencing the location and wind direction.
