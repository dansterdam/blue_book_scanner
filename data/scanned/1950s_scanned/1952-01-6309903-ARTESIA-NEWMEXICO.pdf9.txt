REPORT

1. This investigation is predicated upon information contained in a basic report submitted by the United States Air Force Base in the area of Artesia, New Mexico on 16 Jan 1952. An interview with the principal witness was made to corroborate, expand and clarify the written report which stated that while on a routine test run with a 600 mcf gas balloon, the object observed appeared to be white or silver in color, larger than the balloon and at a higher altitude. It appeared slightly elliptical in shape and was observed for several minutes as it passed overhead at a speed estimated to be approximately 200 m.p.h. within the vicinity of their test balloon on 13 January 1952.

2. On 21 Jan 1952 a formal technical report was interviewed to the investigation. This report stated that on the above date at approximately 1725 hours (5:25 P.M. MST) the witness, a technical sergeant, was standing near the balloon launch site and observed an object which he described as silvery or metallic appearing in color, approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and elliptical in shape, moving at a very high rate of speed in level flight at an altitude estimated to be about 10,000 feet. The object was observed to be traveling in a southerly direction, making no sound, and leaving no vapor trail. After observing the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, it disappeared from sight. It was stated that the balloon was traveling east to west at an altitude of approximately 800 feet at the time the object was observed.
