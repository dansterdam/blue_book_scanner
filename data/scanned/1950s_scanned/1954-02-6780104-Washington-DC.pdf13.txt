EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE INCIDENT
2 May 1957

At approximately 0800 in the morning two Air Force camera specialists (on their way to a photo-theodolite station) were startled to see, what they described as a disc-shaped object that glinted brightly in the morning sun. Within a matter of minutes they had set up their specialized photographic device, and commenced taking photographs of the object as they tracked it for approximately 25 minutes.

The two men estimated the object to be approximately 150 feet in diameter and was traveling from West to East. 

While a check was being made for all possible aircraft, radar and flight test operators and activities that could provide some data on the probable cause of the sighting, the photos were being carefully analyzed by ATIC. Each photo image was subject to an analysis taking into consideration all the optical characteristics and limitations of the camera, the distances involved, magnification factor of the enlargements, path and characteristics of the object, and the local meteorological conditions in the area.

During this period, radar, aircraft and nearby flight-test units reported nothing was in the area at that time. A reply to a call made to a nearby weather unit had not been received as yet. Meanwhile, screen-sized projections of the 40 odd frames showed that the object went from elliptical in shape as it came across the frame, back to elliptical as it exited the frame, striking the surface, and was definitely a spherical object.
