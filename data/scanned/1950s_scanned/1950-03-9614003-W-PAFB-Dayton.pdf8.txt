Object, Says
It Was Star
"I feel damn foolish about this whole thing..." said Lt. Col. Dale Spaur, USAF, Patrolman, who saw a brilliant flying object yesterday near Ravenna, Ohio. "I'm convinced I took off and went chasing a star or some kind of celestial body."

The object, Spaur said, seemed "very bright" and was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. He said it suddenly appeared to stop and then made a startling burst of speed, moving off toward the horizon.

Spaur said he was having some coffee with another policeman when the object was first sighted. "The object appeared to be about the size of a dime and was tremendously bright. It seemed to be at an altitude of about 5,000 feet and was traveling at an unbelievable rate of speed," Spaur said.

"At first I thought it was a jet aircraft but there was no sound. Then I realized it was much too fast and bright to be an aircraft. I would estimate its speed at approximately 1,000 mph," he continued.

"Spaur said he and the other officer chased the object for 105 miles while it was traveling about one mile every 1.5 or 2 seconds. At one point, Spaur said, the object seemed to come to a complete stop in the sky and then accelerate at a terrific rate of speed.

"They finally lost sight of the object at an altitude of about 10,000 feet over the horizon," Spaur said. "The next morning I still can't believe what I saw. I feel like a fool for chasing it."
