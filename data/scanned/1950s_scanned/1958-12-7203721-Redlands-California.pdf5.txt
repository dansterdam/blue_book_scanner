Report of Unidentified Flying Object
Redlands, California - 7 December 1958

1. On 7 December 1958, at approximately 1830 hours, a bright, round, orange-colored object was observed by Mr. and Mrs. Walter Sanders, 1231 East Citrus Avenue, Redlands, California. The object was first seen to the south of their location, moving in a north-easterly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. Mr. Sanders estimated the object's speed to be from 1500 to 2000 mph.

2. As the object neared their location, it slowed down and made a slight descent, stopping directly over their home. The object hovered for approximately 10-15 minutes, during which time it changed color from orange to bluish-white.

3. During the hovering period, the object appeared to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. No sound was heard and no exhaust trails were visible. After the hovering period, the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared to the northeast.

4. This incident was also reported by other residents of Redlands and the surrounding area. No other details are available.
