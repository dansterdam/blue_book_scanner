The objects were observed to be of a circular configuration, and were flying northward about 2500-3000 feet in the air. The objects appeared to be of metal construction, and were flying high and very fast. The objects would disappear and then reappear in a different position, apparently travelling at a high rate of speed. The objects were viewed through an auto windshield and had a bright orange glow. The entire observation lasted about 2 to 3 minutes. The objects seemed to be hovering or at a standstill at times, and the objects crossed the horizon and disappeared from view.
