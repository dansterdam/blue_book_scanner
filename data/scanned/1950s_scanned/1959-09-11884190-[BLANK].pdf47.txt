Dear Mr. Ruppelt:

I have to bring to your attention the interest of Mr. William Plummer in the sighting of an unidentified flying object which he claims was seen by a number of people on or about 11 September 1959.

Mr. Plummer was disturbed by the fact that apparently no official investigation was made of this incident.

This investigation revealed that a military aircraft had been engaged in a high altitude training flight in the area at the time of the incident. The aircraft was operating at a very high altitude and its appearance may have caused the unidentified sighting.

The investigator was that the confusion and misidentification was understandable under the conditions existing at the time.

Mr. Plummer was advised of the result of the investigation and he indicated that he was satisfied that a reasonable explanation had been provided for the incident.

Respectfully,
A. P. Rambert, Jr.
Chief, Project Coordination Branch
