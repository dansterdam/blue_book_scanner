k. Assistant Passive Defense Officer, although M7 clouds were reported by the watcher group the description of objects resembled thin semi-transparent alto-cumulus in patches (white or greyish-white) possibly changing and/or occurring at more than one level. Paticular patches properly coded as M4 cloud sills as "in lines", at time with clear spaces between.
