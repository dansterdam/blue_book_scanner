20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One): a. Head of a pin, b. Pea, c. Dime, d. Nickel, e. Quarter, f. Silver dollar

1. Cylindrical metal object maneuvering erratically, apparently under intelligent control. It did not resemble any known conventional aircraft.
2. It would be very difficult to determine the exact size or distance, due to the lack of known reference objects in the sky. The object appeared to be a good distance away when it was observed.
3. It would be very difficult to accurately determine the exact speed or altitude of the object, due to lack of known reference points. However, it was moving at a high rate of speed and was at a considerable altitude to be able to be observed for several minutes.
