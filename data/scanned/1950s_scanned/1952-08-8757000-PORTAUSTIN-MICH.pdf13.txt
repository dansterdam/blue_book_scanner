Statement of 1st Lt. Wesley R. Holder

At 0000I, I was scrambled to investigate an unidentified object reported by a central tower operator at Haneda. The object was reported to be in the Tokyo Bay area. It observed nothing at this time. At 0045I the object was estimated to be at an altitude of 5,000 feet, traveling at a speed of 220 degrees and directed to look for. When I reached the object's position, it seemed to disappear from radar contact at 10 degrees port at 6000 yards. The point of view rapidly from port to starboard and disappeared from the scope. I had no visual contact with the target. Soon after this contact the search was abandoned, as it continued to search the Tokyo Bay area indefinitely until 0215 hours. Another Lockheed P-80 was scrambled at this time. The object was observed to be traveling at 660-70 miles an hour. The only known air traffic at the time was a C-54 in the pattern at Haneda and another C-54 over Johnson about 35 minutes later.

State of 1st Lt. Aaron M. Jones

At 0000I, Lt. Holder and I were scrambled to investigate an unidentified target encountered on radar west of Tokyo Bay. As we were approaching the OCCI Hi Junction, we observed a single stationary light at 10 o'clock position. We then started a starboard searching orbit under GCI control south east of Haneda. At 0015, a GCI link gave us a vector of 320 degrees. At this time we observed a stationary radar echo and gave us the vector to intercept the unidentified target which appeared to be at an altitude of 3,000 feet and an approximate distance of 6,000 yards. The target was rapidly moving from port to starboard and a turn was made in an attempt to intercept, but the target disappeared. No definite radar echo and we continued our search over Tokyo Bay. At 0030 Hi link released us from scrambled mission. The only other aircraft interrogated during this mission was a C-54. This aircraft was identified as a C-54 on course of 250 degrees altitude 5,000 feet and look like maintaining a normal traffic pattern. We noticed nothing of unusual nature from this time until we landed at 0120.
