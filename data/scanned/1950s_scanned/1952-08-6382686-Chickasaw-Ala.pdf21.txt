STATEMENT OF: _____, Mobile, Alabama

Last night at approximately 2200 hours, I saw four objects in the sky ranging from one point to the Chickasaw, Alabama. Two of these objects did not move yet were slightly larger and brighter than stars. One of these objects appeared in the form of a blurred light, one above the other, the top light being green and the bottom reddish. These objects remained stationary for about fifteen minutes and then this set of two blurred lights slowly changed to an alternately fiery red and blue-green in color and seemed to blink at regular intervals. This four object remained stationary for about fifteen minutes and then slowly drifted fifteen or twenty degrees and became stationary again. I left Chickasaw, Alabama, for Brookley Air Force Base at approximately 2220 and these objects were still in the same relative position as when I first observed them.

I heard no noise nor saw any exhaust from any of the above objects. From the distance of my observation of these objects, I found it difficult to obtain further identifying characteristics.
