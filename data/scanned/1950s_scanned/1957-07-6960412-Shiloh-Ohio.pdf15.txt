ALLEGED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTED BY F. A. HARTMAN

On July 6, 1957, Mr. F. A. Hartman of Shiloh, Ohio, reported that he had observed an unidentified flying object near his home.

Mr. Hartman stated that at approximately 10:30 p.m. on the evening of July 6, 1957, he was outdoors in his backyard when he observed a bright, luminous object moving in the sky. He described the object as oval-shaped and bluish-white in color. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes as it slowly moved across the sky in a northerly direction.

According to Mr. Hartman's report, the object appeared to be approximately the size of a basketball when viewed from his position. He also noted that the object seemed to give off a soft, luminous glow and made no sound as it moved through the sky.

Mr. Hartman's report was investigated by the U.S. Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, the official study of unidentified flying objects conducted by the U.S. government. However, the investigation was unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the object observed by Mr. Hartman.
