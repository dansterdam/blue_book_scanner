I have kept quiet about it all this time, but now I feel I must write and tell you about it. Signed MRS. _

The New Orleans Item of 17 October 1950, editorially speculated concerning the sighting of an unidentified object in formation by Miami Airlines, Inc., pilots, on the evening of 16 October 1950. The item concluded, "It is possible that the three persons signing the report are sincere and have spent two years investigating such reports." As said, "Definitely, most statements by well-known and reliable observers like these amaze, we hesitate to question the expert opinion of trained aerial observers and air-line pilots." 

ACTION: None contemplated by this Headquarters.
