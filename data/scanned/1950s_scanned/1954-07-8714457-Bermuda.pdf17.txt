The image appears to contain two black and white photographic frames. Each frame shows a grainy image of what seems to be an unidentified flying object (UFO) against a cloudy sky background. The UFOs appear as small, blurry shapes in the center of the frames. There are also handwritten notes and annotations visible in the margins of the image.
