DETAILS OF WITNESS

9/25/ - - - - -  - 170lst Air Traffic Squadron

I, - - - - - -  - - - approximately 1:30 a.m. 29 July 1952 in the - - - -  - - - - - area coming into the Radar Control Office over the squawk box for saying that flying saucers were sighted in the vicinity of the base. He stated he was the non-rated officer on duty at the time and that this observation was made by the radar crew. He said that the objects were so large that the radar operator stated he could not get a true reading on them as they completely blanketed the area scanned. Another non-rated officer stated that four of these objects were picked up and tracked, and they showed on the scope, but suddenly became obscured and apparently gained an enormous speed and climbed at a fantastic rate. I sighted another one at 1625 MST coming from the southwest and departed it was only in sight for four or five seconds. Then there were two others that came over with paths different and shapes that were circular and one that came over as it disappeared I thought it was some sort of satellite as it was changing and spinning rapidly. The course that were is unusual as they were zig-zagging at high speed and sometime hovered and set a sound, The other two followed a more erratic course and seemed to disappear and then reappear, both at a great speed.

This incident was called to the attention of the Squadron Commander and he was notified about it. I had made no previous reports on sightings in this area before, and no other sightings have been made since. 

Captain - - - - 2-733 Quartermaster Corps stated after the above incident, the objects were also picked up on radar at the Radar Station. He said the objects maneuvered in a way that were not consistent with any known aircraft, and that they disappeared from the scope as if they had gained an enormous speed.
