Statement of F-94 Pilot

On 29 Jan 53 I was flying as pilot In a F-94 aircraft on a routine training flight. After making a few intercepts on another F-94, the GCI station vectored us to the Millinocketz area to Intercept B-29 Nicholson Able-6. We stayed In the Millinockets area for approximately fifteen (15) minutes with no contact with the B-29.

Deciding that the B-29 bad passed Millinocket I took up a heading of 670° magnetic, thin course took us directly over Houlton. Just after passing Houlton and approximately over the St John river I spotted an oval and thin shaped object about 10° above and approximately on the name course as my own (070° magnetic). After repeatedly pointing out the object to the Radar Observer, he finally spotted it too.

The object was a dark gray color with a very definite and clearly defined shape. It did not shine, or give off light, nor was there any visible exhaust or contrail.

We were at an altitude of 23000 feet and chased the object at .8 MACH. This chase was continued for approximately 8 minutes with no visible change in the range of the object. According to the maps and dead reckoning, we had chased the object forty (40) miles northeast of the St John River. At this time we broke off and returned to base to land.
