The image does not contain any photographs. The image is a scanned page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book report, that discusses observations of unidentified aerial phenomena. The text in the document is as follows:

It should be noted that Dr. Whipple made a careful study of meteor photographs taken in New Mexico on 25 nights when observations were reported. None of the photographs revealed the presence of unusual phenomena. 

Finally, the overall picture obtained from the year of vigilance and inquiry does not permit a conclusive opinion concerning the aerial phenomena or incidents. The comparatively high incidence of the phenomena since 1948 does not necessarily indicate that the objects are man-made. It is conceivable that the earth may be passing through a region in space of high meteoric populations. Also, the sun-spot maxima in 1948 perhaps in some way may be a contributing factor.

Recommendations
Since the evidence to date cannot be considered conclusive, it appears that the following recommendations would be pertinent:

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
