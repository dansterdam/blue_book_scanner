Transcription of the text:

IN MY OPINION THIS IS A CASE OF AN UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENON
WHICH SEEMS TO A NATURAL PHENOMENON, E.G. AN OBSERVATION
OF A NATURAL OCCURRING METEOROLOGICAL EFFECT OR SOME OTHER
NATURAL PHENOMENON TAKING PLACE IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.
IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS CASE SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS
"UNIDENTIFIED" SINCE THE OBSERVERS WERE UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR
THE PHENOMENON OBSERVED AND SINCE THERE IS INSUFFICIENT
INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THE EXACT NATURE OF THE AERIAL
PHENOMENON.
