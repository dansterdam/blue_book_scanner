REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT(S)

On 7 November 1951 at approximately 1500 hours local time, the undersigned was on patrol in the Mojave Desert near Barstow, California, when he observed two unidentified objects traversing the sky at a high rate of speed. The objects were dark in color, oval in shape, and appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. They were flying in close formation, side-by-side, at an altitude estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. The objects were observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing over the horizon.
