6. The object moved erratically and with great speed. Source compared the object to a jet aircraft, but it moved much faster than any jet aircraft he had ever observed. The object darted back and forth, as if under intelligent control.

7. Both source and his wife observed the object and the cloud through binoculars until the object finally disappeared from sight. The object moved so rapidly that it was difficult to observe clearly, indicating low power or lack of thrust.

8. The object seemed to stop, hover a moment, then move off rapidly in another direction, almost as if under intelligent control.

9. Source and his wife continued to observe the object from their back door in a ranch-type house and saw another moving object high in the sky, which they believed was the same object. This second object exhibited only a slight vertical move upward and then moved off rapidly in a south-southwest direction in a manner that seemed intelligently controlled.

10. No sounds were heard at any time.

13. When the object first appeared, it seemed to have a dull gray color, approximately the size of a baseball at arm's length. Its position was estimated to have been at an angle of approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon, approximately in the east.

14. The object exhibited a rapid, jerky motion, appearing to dart or move in any direction, occasionally appearing to draw closer, then to disappear from sight, only to reappear a short distance away, seemingly as if it was approaching, and seemed to disappear in the southwest.

1. Terrain: Source's property is a ranch-type dwelling.
