1. The Air Technical Intelligence Center is responsible for the Air Force's Unidentified Flying Objects Program. The interest in this case is threefold: to determine if the UFO's constitute a threat to our national security; to determine if there are any aspects of scientific interest; and if there are any aspects of public relations interest.

2. In an effort to improve our method of handling this program the ATIC proposes the formation of an advisory panel composed of persons qualified in the following areas:
     Physics
     Psychology 
     Astronomy
     Public Relations

The personnel for this panel is to be provided on a voluntary basis by Wright-Patterson 
Air Force Base.

3. This panel is to meet one day each month for the purpose of discussing and reviewing the trends in the current UFO reports, to assist the ATIC in the method of operation. Tentatively the panel will meet on the last Monday of each month.

4. It is requested that the UFOB support the Air Technical Intelligence Center with the services of a Physicist to be utilized as stipulated above.
