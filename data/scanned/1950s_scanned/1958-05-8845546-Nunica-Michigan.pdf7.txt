SUBJECT: (U) Request for Evaluation-Radar UFO Report from Atllo, Headquarters USAFE

TO: AFCIN-4E4            FROM: AFCIN-4E1        DATE: 25 Jul 58 COMMENT 2
ATTN: Capt. Gregory                                          AFCIN-4E1A
                                                                  55188/Bldg 828/Rm 241

The general performance of the target, the altitudes concerned, and the speeds noted are all in accord with what would be expected of a balloon. The data furnished is too meager to allow for a firm estimate.
