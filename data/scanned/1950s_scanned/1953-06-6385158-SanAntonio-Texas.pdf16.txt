A few moments later I called Randolph Air Force Base and was connected with the Officer of the Day and informed him of the objects. He returned my call and stated that the objects were being sighted by him at that time and that he was trying to elucidate them more and find out where they were. He stated that the objects very definitely were not planes.

During the two hours that I watched the movement of the objects I called Lackland Air Craft and Warning Unit and reported to the officer in charge of what was being seen by myself, wife, and Capt. --------. The attitude of the officer in charge was certainly not one of very much concern over my report and his whole conversation and manner was one of extreme unimportance to such a report coming from a fellow air force officer. I would think that an officer in such an important position would be more alert to such reports than was exhibited by this officer.

The objects were seen for at least two hours and the last two of the objects were in formation moving in the direction toward Randolph Air Force Base. It was about 12:30 AM, June 3, 1953 when I last sighted the objects and I was getting ready to take more photographs if possible.
