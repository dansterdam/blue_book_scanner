UNCLASSIFIED
SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

Date:   13 Aug. 1957
SUBJECT:   10,000th ARC 
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The information discussed herein was not obtained with the United States Weather Bureau and Weather Service. Andrews AFB, Washington, D.C., plus the characteristics of the object described indicate the possibility that the sighting was actually an atmospheric meteorological or weather phenomena rather than any type of flying vehicle.

2. Information obtained from the United States Naval Aerological Command indicates that weather conditions, cloud cover, and other atmospheric characteristics at the time and place of the sighting were such as to limit the possibility that the object observed by the witness could be described as anything other than a natural atmospheric phenomenon.

3. On the basis of all the facts considered it does not seem probable that the sighting was of an unidentified flying object phenomenon.

4. Taking into consideration the unreliability of the witness, and the obvious similarities this case has to other well-known weather balloon or other atmospheric phenomena reports, it is concluded that the object was a natural atmospheric phenomena and not an unidentified flying object.

LOUIS MONROE
Captain, USAF
