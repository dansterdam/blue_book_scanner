NOTES
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IT TALLH CLAIMS TO HAVE OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR ONLY A VERY SHORT TIME AS IT PASSED VERY RAPIDLY AND HIGH OVERHEAD. HE WAS ABLE TO SEE IT WELL ENOUGH TO OBSERVE THAT IT WAS OVAL SHAPED AND GAVE OFF A BRIGHT BLUE-GREEN LIGHT. HE STATED THAT HE WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT WHAT HE SAW, AND WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE OBJECT. IT APPEARED TO BE VERY LARGE AND HIGH, MOVING AT GREAT SPEED.

NOTES
IN THE EVENT OF SIMILAR TYPE SIGHTINGS, WITNESS DETAILS ARE ADDED AS IN EACH CASE DESCRIBED ABOVE.
IT WOULD BE WELL IF OVER-RUNS COULD BE AVOIDED HOWEVER, THE INDIVIDUAL'S CREDIBILITY AND RELIABILITY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY OFFICER HANDLING CASE.
