Member of the 1942-53 AACS Det., Laredo AFB, Texas was on duty as Shift Supervisor on 19 November 1952 when a bright white-grayish object appeared to be traveling at a very high speed. It did not show the slightest ow of power and was difficult of estimate the height as approximately four (4) thousand feet. The object appeared uncontrolled in its northwest traveling east and when it again appeared it was heading in an easterly direction. An estimated time of 15 seconds elapsed from the time the object was in sight there was a F-23 aircraft that had just turned initial about 12 miles south of the field for landing on Runway 22 R. After the object disappeared a queried the pilot of the F-23 to whether he has seen the object. The pilot of the F-23 had no knowledge of anything - the reason I ask is I am certain that this object was not a known type of aircraft; it did not continue this object with any of the T-28's flying local.
