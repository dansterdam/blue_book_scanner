Object in Sky
Strikes Home

Claude Williams of Glen Arden, Md. complains vehemently that a blue whistled object, which descended out of the blue Wednesday and ripped a three foot hole in the metal porch awning of his home.
Williams said he hadn't the foggiest notion what the object was and when Prince George's County police, firemen and Andrews Air Force men

Base investigators finished and scratched prowling around the home they hadn't any idea either.
Capt. Jack Shea and Lieut. Carl W. Peterson of the Air Force, reported they had completed their investigation, found nothing, and had no theories.
Williams, of 8106 McClain Ave., told police that something made a whistling sound, zipped through the ground and a tree about 50 feet away. Williams, his daughter, Rose; son David, 12, and a playmate, were home at the time.
