APPENDIX II
Fairchild AFB, Washington - 20 January 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:
At about 1430 PST on 20 January 1952, two Wing Intelligence airmen noticed a bright spherical object traveling through the sky. At first it was apparent to be a meteor but then it was noticed that it was traveling beneath a cloud layer. The object was traveling at a speed much faster than a jet aircraft. The object, which made no sound, was traveling in a path horizontal to the earth at an estimated 500 feet and left a blue trail. The trail seemed to dissipate after 5 to 6 seconds.

The two airmen observers, a Tech Sergeant and Master Sergeant are considered reliable observers.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION:
This incident is interesting due to the fact that there was an eight-tenths cloud coverage at 4,700 ft. It is possible that the object was viewed between the clouds and that it was extremely high, indicating that the sighting was a meteor. However, the sources indicated that they believed the object was definitely man-made and below the cloud cover, but it was traveling at an extremely high speed, possibly faster than the speed of sound. The possibility of the object being a conventional aircraft is excluded, since no sound was heard. The tremendous speed of the object, however, was such that information for questioning this analysis was not available.

III. CONCLUSIONS:
If the object was beneath the cloud cover it was not a conventional aircraft or meteor, and no conclusions can be made as to its identity.
