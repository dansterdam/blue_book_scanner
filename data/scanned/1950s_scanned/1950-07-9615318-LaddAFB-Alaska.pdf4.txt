AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Objects
LOCATION: Ladd AFB, Alaska
DATE: 22 July 1950

SUMMARY: This report covers the sighting of unusual aerial objects in the vicinity of Ladd AFB, Alaska, on 22 July 1950. Observers sighted one or more objects which exhibited unusual aerial characteristics. However, due to the circumstances of the sighting and the difficulty in obtaining positive identification, further investigation is considered necessary.

Objects sighted are described as a brownish or reddish color, about the size of a basketball, and traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. The objects were observed for a short period of time and then disappeared from view. Exact measurements and detailed descriptions were not obtained, and identification of the objects is not certain.

According to Headquarters USAF Air Intelligence Requirements Memorandum No. 4, dated 12 September 1952, this report has been prepared in accordance with provisions set forth therein.
