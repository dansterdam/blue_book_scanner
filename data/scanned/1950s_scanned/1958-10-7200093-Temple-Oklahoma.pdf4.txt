COMMENT NO.: 2
AFOIN-4E20/P.G. #4806circ, Jr. /ow;

1. The plastic bag herewith accompanying the basic IR is of ordinary polyethylene of the size, thickness and shape an inflated by weather stations.

2. The small size of the bag completely precludes any possibility that it may have crossed the Pacific ocean on the prevailing westerly winds.

3. The notes, not included herein, described, which was written in Russian and attached to the balloon by a string, was evidently copied from a Russian picture book such as those disseminated by US troops, or which can be purchased at any good book store. Even the juxtaposition of the two rather unsolicited phrases in the foreign language phase book is typical of the contents.

4. The comments of the officer who prepared IR-1-56 are fully concurred in, to wit:
a. This is a grounded weather balloon. 
b. The attachment of the note, written in Russian is a prank.
