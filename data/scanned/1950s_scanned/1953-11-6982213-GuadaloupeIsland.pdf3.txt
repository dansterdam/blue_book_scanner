I was sitting on a ranch with the object overhead over Guadaloupe.

Grand Turks:
I happened to be looking at the sky just when this object appeared. I called attention to it and he said it so. I asked him what he thought it was and he said he didn't know but it was not a reasonable or anything like a usual sort of thing. It was about 5:45 and we watched it for a little while - the object.
