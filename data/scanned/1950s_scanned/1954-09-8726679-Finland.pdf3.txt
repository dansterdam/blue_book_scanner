Netherlands - 4 Aug 54
Two firemen observed two "flying objects" over the airbase of the 18th Tactical Wing of the Royal Netherlands Air Force on 4 Aug 54. They were first noticed at 20:30 as small, red, luminous objects. They were in sight for about 10 minutes at times remaining motionless and at times moving very fast. They moved in a circular pattern and disappeared suddenly. They were observed with a military gray light.

This attributes to the intensity of the sightings and the publicity they have received. UFO sightings which have resulted in influencing a great number of persons for personal publicity.
