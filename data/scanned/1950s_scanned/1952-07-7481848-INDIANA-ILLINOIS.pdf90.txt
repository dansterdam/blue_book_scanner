Project Blue Book Investigation Report, Case 7481848, 1952-07-07, INDIANA-ILLINOIS

May indicate of possible dight and night
ocuur recently - of at least
one or more night - light observers
In general lypee, of light as 
remarked on the comment
Experienced only slight velocity.
Please write report for
Reamrks - While the light observed in
general by the observers of
this report should be - -
reexamined. I would consider
it highly possible that
it was in the nature of
a - natural or man-made
object rather than an 
unidentified flying object.
In view briefly, also I
would say there is hardly
enough in this report to
conclude one way or the other.
So far no analysis could be
made except to say this
report by itself contained
nothing unusual to all.
It might be advisable that 
field interview be conducted
of the observers mentioned
in order to obtain more 
detail concerning this incident.
