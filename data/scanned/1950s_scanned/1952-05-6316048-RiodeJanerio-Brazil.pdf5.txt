NARRATIVE OF INFORMATION:
In May 1952, a report was received of an "air attack" on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An unidentified aerial object was alleged to have been photographed over the city. The informant, a military officer stationed in Brazil, claimed to have obtained copies of the photographs, but they were not available to the evaluators.
The report stated that the object had been observed by many people in Rio de Janeiro, and that a request had been made for the photographs. The evaluators were unable to corroborate the existence of the photographs or substantiate the report.

CONCLUSION:
(1) Insufficient information was available prior to 7 May 52 (the date of the evaluation) to determine if the reported incident was a part of the "air attack" on Rio de Janeiro. The informant who made the report could not be contacted to provide additional details.
(2) The making price won't down to $100.
(3) These events led to a preliminary evaluation of the attached report as follows:
UNRESOLVED - the data is inadequate for a thorough evaluation.
