MEMORANDUM FOR Colonel Eriksen, AFCIN-4-Xl
Mr. Archer
SUBJECT: Special Investigation - 1st Lt J. F. Long, AO-392864O

1. I do not feel that the proposed OSI investigation is necessary for the following reasons:
a. If the OSI determines that the subject's background does not suggest any tendencies toward exaggerations or hoaxes, our present conclusions regarding the sightings are neither strengthened nor weakened.
b. If the OSI determines that the subject's background does contain indications that would suggest a definite tendency toward exaggerations or hoaxes, ATIC is then bound to take some follow-up action. Such action would be detrimental to the individual concerned, and would not positively disprove the alleged sighting.

The final paragraph of the report by Dr. Fitts seems to me to be an entirely acceptable conclusion in regard to this case. I recommend that this conclusion be accepted and that the case be closed.
