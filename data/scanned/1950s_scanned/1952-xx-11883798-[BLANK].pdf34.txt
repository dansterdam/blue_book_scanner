telescope, refraction, grating and radar scope, or carried aloft by aircraft. By limiting its study to only those observations, obtained or correlated by instruments, this plan will distill from the raw information technical data capable of quantitative analysis so that ATIC might determine if any UAC's are of foreign origin. This plan does not preclude consideration of sightings by competent technical observers who make such sightings as part of their regular employment (e.g., astronomers, weather observers, military and civilian pilots, surveyors, etc.). Rather, this plan suggests that such personnel carry photographic equipment and be trained to record the technical data required of such observations so as to improve the quality of their reports.

By requiring the use of instruments for the collaboration of such sightings, the USAF will eliminate unreliabie reports of the unidentitor aircraft (incident near Columbus on 23 July when the UAC was identified as balloon? by ATIC's Consultant Astronomer using the Ohio State University Astronomicaj Observatory's telescope). By designation and instrumentation of specific sources, as the field collection agencies, for data regarding UAC's, the USAF will simply speed and secure the processing of this data.
