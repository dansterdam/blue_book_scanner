Investigators comment's: 
"Sighter confirms - Shape as described was thought to have been a larger than average aircraft. However, thinking it over, it did to appear to move differently and faster than any sighted aircraft in this area at this time. Sighter is definite on large size and 'strange' movement. Could not identify definitely."
