AF FORM 112-PART II AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: T/O 527th AGD GROUP, APO 929
DATE: 11-7-52
SUBJECT: DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS
A star like white object, changing direction in a strange erratic course, was observed by an Air Force radar station watch for 0930-1010 hours. The object appeared suddenly at 0930 and disappeared at 1010 hours. It traveled in an easterly direction at an estimated speed of 300-400 knots. The object was visible to the naked eye and was under observation by radar and optical means during the entire period.

OBSERVATIONS:
a) Visual Phenomena: The object had a star like luster when first observed, then changed to a glowing object. It executed sudden turns, stops, and reverses. It zigzagged over an area of 30-35 miles.
b) Radar Phenomena: The object was picked up by radar and maintained very good contact throughout the observation. The general impression from radar observation was that the object was very small in size, possibly a reflection, as its radar return was much less than that of a B-29 aircraft. However, radar operators estimated its speed in excess of 300 knots.
c) Weather: Sky clear. Visibility to 10-15 miles. Wind direction 270 degrees, 5 knots.
d) Conclusion: Although the exact identity of the object could not be determined, the report suggests that it was probably a natural phenomena, as its behavior, both visually and by radar, is characteristic of a meteor or other type of abnormal celestial object.
