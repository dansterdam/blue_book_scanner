U.S. Shipin Gulf Reports Sighting Mystery Object
Ground was keeping watch along the Gulf with specially qualified radar observers on several nights when a "strange object" which resembled a satellite of some kind was sighted. This happened on several nights for several hours. Air Force observers and Air Defense Command personnel confirmed the sightings. The object was sighted by other observers along the Gulf Coast. It was viewed through binoculars and telescopes and exhibited rapid and erratic maneuvers, according to the report. The object was occasionally picked up on ground radar installations. Persons who saw the object said it resembled a large, round, white sphere which gave off a brilliant light. At times it appeared to be a dark or dull object which gave off little or no light. It was seen over both land and water 

Leonard Stringfield, Chief Engineering Co ordinator of the National Investigations Committee, said that according to the official report, the Air Force was interested in the sighting and would have liked to have scrambled jet fighters to take a closer look, but was unable to do so because of the remoteness of the area and poor weather conditions.

The report also mentioned that some of the citizens, peace officers and other observers believed what they saw and reported as strange objects were probably just bright stars or planets. The witnesses, however, stated they were certain the objects were not normal celestial bodies. The objects appeared to vary in size, shape and brightness. Some of them were said to be as bright as the full moon.
