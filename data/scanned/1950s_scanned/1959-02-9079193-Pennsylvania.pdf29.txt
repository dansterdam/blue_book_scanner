There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old document or article related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document appears to contain handwritten or typed text describing a UFO sighting and investigation.

EXTRACT FROM ARTICLE 95:

"As to the Air Force made call this the most superficial investigation of this incident, an investigation to said incomplete and inaccurately, and open to much question and can be substantiated. The Report, though complete, shows that the investigation was not thorough, neglecting details which might have revealed more significant information. The reason this was so is the great desire on the part of the Investigating Agency to arrive at the conclusion that this incident could readily be explained as a natural phenomena. There is ample evidence that this was not an isolated incident in that in the past scores of intelligent people have reported seeing these 'flying objects' regarding which the Air Force has maintained a continuous attitude of evasion or disbelief. The cases mentioned in this article are only a few of many such incidents which point up the fact that these so-called 'flying saucers' are real, and that the Air Force has failed in its responsibility to the American people to conduct a thorough and objective investigation of the UFO phenomena. There is no doubt in the minds of the persons who saw these objects that they were machines of some kind, intelligently controlled, and undoubtedly not of United States or any other Nation's aircraft. These so-called 'flying saucers' or 'discs' are something more than a figment of the imagination."
