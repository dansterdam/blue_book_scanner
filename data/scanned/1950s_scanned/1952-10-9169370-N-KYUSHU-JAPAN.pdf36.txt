The text in the document is as follows:

NARRATIVE REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ON 27 OCTOBER 1952, BY PILOTS OF F-94C INTERCEPTOR AIRCRAFT 339TH FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON, 51ST FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR WING, KYUSHU, JAPAN.

Confers Green, an F-94C, took off at 1830I on a scramble, 1st Air Division, and about 30 minutes later, Confers Green was airborne.

As soon as he was airborne, the Pilot called SHTOANG-SHMA GCI (Ground Control Intercept) and informed them he was proceeding to intercept the object.

Confers Green reported to Confers Green that the object was then at 2 o'clock high and 10 miles distant. He then closed to within 1 mile of the object but was not able to close any further as the object began rapidly climbing and disappeared from sight. This was reported to CGI who then asked for identification of the object.

Confers Green climbed with all power to 12,000 feet, still in contact with the object, but was unable to gain any further ground. The object was proceeding in a generally southerly direction.

On its way toward BRADY Air Field, Confers Green notified another bright star 2 o'clock from his position.

GCI station instructed Confers Green to follow and continue interception. However, at 2025I Confers Green's fuel state was low and BRADY Air Field cleared him to return. BRADY Air Field received him on a heading of 030 at 12,500 feet.

The object which Confers Green was tracking was last seen through a thick haze layer and was changing color and motion rapidly up to 40,000 feet, but nothing else was reported. Pilot and Radar Observer are of the opinion that the object was a star or other heavenly body.
