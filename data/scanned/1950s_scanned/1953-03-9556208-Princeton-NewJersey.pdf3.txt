SUMMARY: (ENTER CONCISE SUMMARY OF REPORT. USE ADDITIONAL SHEETS AS NECESSARY.)
1. OBJECT: 
Silver, stationary object. Location: Approximately 150 feet from observer at an altitude of 150 feet.  No sound.
2. DESCRIPTION: 
The object was circular in shape, about 30 feet in diameter, and appeared to be made of aluminum or some other silver-colored metal. It hovered silently and motionlessly for a period of approximately 15-30 minutes above a wooded area near Princeton, NJ.
3. OBSERVATION:
The observer, who is a student at Princeton University, was standing in an open field, when he noticed the object in the distance, hovering over the trees. The object did not move during the entire time it was observed.
4. COMMENT: 
The observer stated that the object was definitely an actual aerial vehicle and not any type of conventional aircraft. The size, shape, color, and silent, hovering characteristics of the object eliminate the possibility of it being a conventional aircraft, balloon, or other known aerial object. The observer was certain of his observation, and stated that the object seemed to be intelligently controlled, though no occupants were visible. The report is considered credible.

The text appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report on an unidentified aerial object sighting that occurred on March 31, 1953 in Princeton, New Jersey. The report provides details about the object's appearance, behavior, and the observer's account.
