AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PAGE 1 OF 1
SECR-T
THE OBJECT WITNESSED IS BELIEVED TO BE A NATURAL CELESTIAL PHENOMENON IN ACCORDANCE WITH USAF TR 200-2. ON 29 APRIL 1952, TWO AF RESERVISTS ATTACHED TO THE 117TH FIGHTER BOMBER WING, ALABAMA AIR NATIONAL GUARD, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 MILES ABOVE THEIR POSITION, TRAVELING IN A NORTH TO SOUTH DIRECTION AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 500 KNOTS. THE OBJECT WAS SILVER OR WHITE IN COLOR AND WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES BEFORE DISAPPEARING TO THE SOUTH. THE LIGHTS ON THE OBJECT WERE REPORTED TO BE STEADY AND UNBLINKING.
THE OBSERVERS STATED THAT THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH JET AIRCRAFT, GUIDED MISSILES, AND OTHER CONVENTIONAL TYPES OF AIRCRAFT AND THAT THIS OBJECT APPEARED TO BE NEITHER A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT NOR A MISSILE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS OBJECT WAS OBSERVED IN A CLEAR NIGHT SKY AND APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING IN A NORTH TO SOUTH DIRECTION AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE OBJECT WAS A NATURAL CELESTIAL PHENOMENON SUCH AS A METEOR OR A SATELLITE. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED.
