There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a handwritten questionnaire and a hand-drawn sketch.

The text in the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: no
b. Color: luminous

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[A hand-drawn sketch is present, showing an arrow pointing to the right and two objects or shapes]

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One):
a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like searchlight
c. Sharply outlined

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
