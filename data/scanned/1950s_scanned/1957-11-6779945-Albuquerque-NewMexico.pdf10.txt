The image contains a newspaper clipping from what appears to be a UFO reporting document. The clipping has the title "Grow, Spotter Says" and includes a photograph of some kind of unidentified flying object or "space craft". The text describes the witness's account of seeing a strange object in the sky that seemed to be moving and maneuvering in an unusual way.

Grow, Spotter Says
An Otis Barth - a retired Olden, Minn., bachelor - "was quietly relaxing" Sunday evening at his Huntsville, Texas, ranch home when something in the sky caught his attention.
"I was just gazing at the stars when I saw what I first thought was a shooting star," Barth told the Houston Post which related the story Wednesday.
"But as I watched, it seemed to slow down and grow larger. Then it started maneuvering strangely, darting this way and that, hovering and dipping and circling. I had never seen anything like it before."
Barth said the object appeared to be about 60 to 75 feet in diameter. It was shaped something like a flat disc, he said, and gave off an eerie glow or luminescence. 
"There was no sound at all that I could detect from it," Barth said. "It just sort of hovered there and tossed around like a chip in the wind. Then after 10 or 15 minutes, it suddenly took off straight up and was gone in a flash."
Barth said he had no idea of what the object was, but he is convinced it was not an airplane, a meteor, or any other known aerial device.
"I don't understand it at all," he said. "I'm sure I saw some kind of space craft of some kind. I only wish I could figure out what it was and where it came from."
