South Carolina Area 
9 March 1953

I. DESCRIPTION
At 1245 EST, the Assistant Director of Security at the Savannah River Project observed a silver, saucer-shaped object visually from the ground for a period of 2-3 minutes. This object was at a very high altitude, and very little intrinsic motion was observed through interrogation of the object.

A detachment of the 73rd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Congaree, South Carolina, was notified as a result of the above visual sighting. They picked up this object on radar at 1507 EST that the same day, and tracked it to the northeast. This radar contact was reported to the Air Force officials and a pursuit aircraft was dispatched in an attempt to intercept the object. The pursuit aircraft was airborne within 10 minutes, but the object had disappeared from the radar screen. The F-86 returned to its base.

II. DISCUSSION
A check was made to determine if there were any aircraft in the vicinity with the Assistant Director of Security. There is practically an ALL time an hour between ALL three military installations (Congaree, A.F. Savannah River Project, Shaw A.F.B.). There was one aircraft on the ground at Congaree that morning, a T-33 from Shaw A.F.B., but there is really not enough information contained in the report concerning its flight activities. For the observer to have seen an object that long a period, it would have to be traveling at a very slow speed. Information gathered indicates that the object tracked on radar, and the object observed visually, were considered to be one and the same.

This information was sent to the Intelligence Branch of ATIC for analysis. This branch, after carefully reviewing the reports, evaluated it as possibly coincidental and not necessarily related.
