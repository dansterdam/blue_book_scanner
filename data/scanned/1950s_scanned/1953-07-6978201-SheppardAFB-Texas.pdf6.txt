AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: 375oth Photo Recon Wg 
TO: HQ, USAF

NOTES: The following is a statement of observations from A/2C Sheppard, 375th Radio Sq, upon returning from leave:

"At approx 1205 hours, 9 July 1953, I was returning from a short weekend pass to the 375th Radio Squadron Operations Section, Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. As the bus approached the hospital gate, I observed an object in the sky to my right and pointed it out to the other bus passengers. It was a round, silvery object, unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. It appeared to be traveling very fast, estimated at 800 to 1000 miles per hour, and was losing altitude rapidly. The object disappeared from view in about 10 seconds. It appeared to be circular in shape, between 50 and 100 feet in diameter, and was absolutely silent. There was no trail or exhaust visible. The object did not seem to be affected by the wind, as it maintained a straight course. I am convinced that the object was some type of flying machine, but I have never seen one like it before. I would say it remains in my mind as an unidentified flying object."
