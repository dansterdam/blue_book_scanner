The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a DISPOSITION FORM document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.	SUBJECT	
	(U) Request for Review and Comment--UFO Motion
TO	FROM	DATE	COMMENT NO. 1
ATTN: Maj. Buckmaster	ASTIA-LRSE-1	29 Dec 1957	4741/Capt. Gregory/dn
	69216
1. Reference conversation between Maj. Buckmaster and Capt. Gregory, Saturday night, 21 December 1957, regarding a UFO film that Gen. Watson was informed would be submitted to this office for immediate review and comment.
2. Request study of subject film, with detailed comments as to the nature of the objects purported to be UFO's. The detailed report attendant to this case has not arrived as yet, but a brief IT message regarding the general circumstances surrounding the matter is attached.
3. The fact that the film was submitted directly to the PIO office in Hollywood rather than directly to USAF or ATIC is considered significant. Reference our recent discussions concerning the soon-to-be-released report (SC XRCO) that apparently 65% of UFO cases submitted are from Southern California.
4. Lt. USAF has telephonically requested that it be notified immediately of our findings with regard to this film.
