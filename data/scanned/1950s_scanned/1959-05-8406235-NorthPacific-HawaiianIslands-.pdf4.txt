Jupiter's 'Sissy' Region
There are would seem to be a large of Tupiter's' satellites which exhibit rather strange performances. These are known as the "Siasies', and have been spotted by observers over many years from various parts of the world. Whey they have been dubbed as such would need the reasoning of some astronomy mind to unravel.
The "Sissied" are described as being faster and farther away from Jupiter than the normal satellites, and with changes in speed and also in their orbits not easily explained. Their orbits are described a3 irregular and eratic, with periods of rapidly, then slowly, and then widely distanced from the planet. 
When they appear to be the greatest distance or at apogee from Jupiter, the Wop of the "sissy" ones are as bright as the moons Saturn, and could be easily seen with a small glass, while the next ones, at lesser distances. are hardly visible at all. They give the impression of being attached in some indefinable fashion to the planet. yet having independent motions of their own. This consists of swiftly and erratically, and capriciously dashing in and out, and around the planet, which have been observed by analysts of Jupiter's behavior over many years.
