Frankfurt/Main, Germany, 26 Jan 53, ATIC Document 111619

Air-visual sighting by two USAF pilots flying a C-47 over this locality state that
both pilots sighted a very bright light passing in front of them at an elevation of
about 45° moving from their left to right. Appeared to be moving at a very high
rate of speed. In a few seconds it turned to the North and then turned again in
front of the observers, climbing slightly until it was directly ahead of them, where
it seemed to linger and then go out of sight. The object was sighted for a total of
approximately 1 1/2 minutes. The pilot was on a heading of 0° during the entire
period of sighting. Weather was clear with a slight temperature inversion between
3 to 4,000’. A check with the Frankfurt Flight Service by the pilots revealed the
information that no jet aircraft were operating in the vicinity of Rhein Main at
the time of sighting, However, other C-47’s were flying in the vicinity and might
account for the sighting.
