The following account of the sighting of an unidentified flying object is submitted.

1. The object, sighted in the vicinity of Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, appeared round and about the size of a pencil head. The single object changed colors from white to amber to bright red. There was no trail and no sound coming from the object. When not travelling in a straight line it appeared to be suspended in the air. During the sighting the object made no unusual maneuvers. It disappeared gradually.

2. Object was sighted at approximately 2310 hours (local time) 30 July 1952 and remained in sight ten (10) or twenty (20) minutes.

3. Three of the four observers used field glasses (power 7 x 50) to accomplish the sighting. The fourth observer viewed the object with naked eye.

4. The observers were located in the Maxwell Control Tower (32°23'N 86°22'W), facing west. The object was estimated to be 20 to 25 miles from the observers, travelling SW at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet.

5. The original observer, chief of the tower crew, claims 13 months experience as a tower operator. Two other observers were members of the tower crew, with two months experience apiece. The fourth observer was NCIC of AACS Facilities at Maxwell. All of them disclaim previous sightings of unidentified flying objects.

6. At time of sighting winds at 30,000 feet were 70 to 85 knots, clouds were scattered at 28,000 feet, visibility was 15 miles plus, temperature was 81°, and surface winds were SSW at 7 knots.

7. There was no activity or condition in the area which might be responsible for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence of the sighting was obtained.

9. Interception or identification action was not taken because of the unavailability of necessary resources.

10. At one time during the sighting there was a C-47 aircraft over Maxwell travelling S to W at 5,000 feet. An attempt was made to contact the pilot but the attempt proved unsuccessful.
