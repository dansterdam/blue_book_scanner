AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

2. The observers were: Mrs. XXXXXXXXXX and Mrs. XXXXXXXXXX, electrician's wife.

3. Mrs. XXXXXXXXXX stated that her husband was not one given to balloons or unusual sights, but in this case he was positive that what he saw was unusual.

10. During the world war, Mrs. XXXXXXXXXX was in the Signal Corps at Langley AFB doing code work. She also worked with the CSI.

11. The observers stated that the UFO was in the South at 2115 (EST) and that the image on the radar scope was to the South-Southeastern sector. This accounted for why the radar only picked up sightings for the early attempts at investigation. This accounts for the early attempts at investigations.

Comments of Investigating Officers:
The opinion is that the object was definite and sighting could be real. The observers feel very sure of what they saw. There are some possible things that could account for the sighting, but generally it seems to be an unidentified. If General Order 13 (Est) could be applied, the general color and the disappearance in the cloud point to the possibility of the object being a star or meteor. However, the radar contact does not support this and it must be considered further.
