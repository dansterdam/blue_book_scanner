The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the instructions to imagine that you are at the point shown and place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. It also instructs to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a person standing in the foreground. The instructions indicate that this sketch shows the position of the object when you first saw it and when you last saw it. There is also a smaller inset sketch showing a similar landscape view, with the text "Object did not move" written below it.
