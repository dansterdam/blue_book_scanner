Text from the document:

1. Following is preliminary information concerning MDC 67th test of 24 May 1950:

a. Reference System:
NAA Line of fire: 19052 30.8" west of North 
X: the down range coordinate along the NAA line of fire
Y: the off range coordinate, positive to the right
Z: the vertical coordinate
M: that plane tangent to the earth's surface through 
the M point (0, 0, 0)

b. Station Locations:
Coordinates of station 8: 13549, 20190, 106
Coordinates of station 10: 43309, 23819, 113

c. Frame rate:
Five frames per second

d. Definitions:
Azimuth Angle: the angle the line of sight when projected into the XY plane makes with the X coordinate axis in a clockwise direction.
Elevation Angle: the acute angle the line of sight makes with the XY plane.

e. Discussion of the 24 May 1950 film.
Station 10 followed an object for seventy-four consecutive frames, during which time the azimuth angle changed uniformly from 58째10'30" to 57째26'30". The elevation angle changed uniformly from 14째32'20" to 14째25'50".

Unfortunately, as station 8 and 10 did not follow the same object, no reduction was possible.
