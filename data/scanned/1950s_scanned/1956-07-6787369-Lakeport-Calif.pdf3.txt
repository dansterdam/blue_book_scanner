The image appears to be a photograph or scan of a page from an old UFO report document. The page contains a grainy, low-quality image that appears to show some kind of aerial object in the sky. The image is difficult to make out due to the low quality.

The text on the page discusses the Air Force's readiness to concede that there is scientific evidence that there may be "interplanetary" life. The text is attributed to H.B. Darrach Jr. and Robert Ginna.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

The Air Force is now ready to concede that many saucer and fireball sightings still here life offers some scientific evidence that there is a real case for interplanetary by H. B. DARRACH JR. and ROBERT GINNA
Chandler Inc..............those strange unidentified flying objects, which the Air Force had long scoffed at, may soon be admitted to have a genuine scientific basis. For several years, the Air Force has persistently dismissed such sightings as "hallucinations" or "misidentifications of natural phenomena." But now there are strong indications that the Air Force itself is convinced
something is going on which merits serious scientific investigation. As an important part of this new attitude, the Air Force plans shortly to relieve itself of further responsibility for the investigation of UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects), and to turn this task over to a civilian scientific agency.
