There is no photograph in this image, but there is a hand-sketched illustration depicting multiple lights in the sky, with two darker objects which seem to represent the red lights.

The text from the document reads:

There was no pulsation of any of the lights and they did not move separately or together. This group of lights seemed to be about ½ mile away but could not have been more than 300 feet off the ground. In the area over which it seemed to be suspended there is a wheat or a small creek surrounded by fields, woods and a hill that rises not more than 70 ft high. This may yield a distance as night – not accurate. In the tail a my artist’s rendering of lights resembled this form with the two dark bold representing the red lights.

There was no change in intensity of the lights though the two lights on the end seemed definitely to throw their light down. We were driving near (t) the time we were watching it, and it did not appear to move.
