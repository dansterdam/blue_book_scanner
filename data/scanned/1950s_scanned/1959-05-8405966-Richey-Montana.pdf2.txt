Dear Sir:

I found a strip of aluminum
foil enclosed, while walking in a
field. There has been many strips
of this material found over a large
area.

I would like to know what
this material is, if you know
what it is would you please
write to me and tell me what
it is?

Yours truly,
[Redacted]
Richey, Montana
