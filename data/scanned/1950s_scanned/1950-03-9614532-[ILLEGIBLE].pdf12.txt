The various LATS units forwarded the following items which appeared in the period 29 March and 17 April 1950:

1. Four observers reported seeing three symmetrical spinning objects which they at first thought to be clouds but then the observers noticed that the objects were not clouds but were traveling at a rapid rate. They all agreed that the middle object disappeared and then returned, then disappeared once again and followed.

2. Reports by civilians that they had sighted three objects, presumably flying saucers, at Autaugaville between 5 and 6 PM the same day. They were described as bright light about the size of the full moon and were flying on a level course. They seemed to be circling. They appeared to change their positions, up and down, and then disappeared from view.
