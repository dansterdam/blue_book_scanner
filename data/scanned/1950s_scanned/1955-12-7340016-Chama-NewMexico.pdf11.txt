SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Report

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: AOIN-2a
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

On 26 January 1956 this headquarters was informed by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) that a report of a sighting on 21 January 1956 of an unidentified object over Chama, New Mexico, had come to their attention. This sighting was reported to the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad.

Although this organization felt that the sighting was in the realm of the unusual, it was decided that no further investigation was warranted since it would not lead to any positive identification or information not already available to USAF and to avoid necessity of filtering into governmental agencies other than USAF. Hr. Hinton was informed of the responsibilities of this squadron and of ATIC for the response to the public.

Inclosed herewith are two letters from Mr. *** concerning the sighting and completed ATIC Form 164 for your information and action deemed necessary because of its failure to meet investigative criteria, the lack of a preliminary investigation, and the definite overactive imagination of the source.

JOHN M. WHITE, JR.
Colonel, USAF
Commander
