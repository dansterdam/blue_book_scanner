There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a Memo Routing Slip. The text on the form states: "The object sighted is apparently the same one sighted in the Washington, D.C. area. If this is the case, it will make quite a noise."

The text I have extracted from the document is as follows:

MEMO ROUTING SLIP
MAJOR TASKER: SAF 13-3
REMARKS: The object sighted is apparently the same one sighted in the Washington, D.C. area. If this is the case, it will make quite a noise.
FROM CASE OR TITLE: Major Robert J. Friend
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: AFCIN-4CR
DD Form 95 

This seems to be a summary or report of a UFO sighting, with details about its apparent similarity to a previous sighting in the Washington D.C. area.
