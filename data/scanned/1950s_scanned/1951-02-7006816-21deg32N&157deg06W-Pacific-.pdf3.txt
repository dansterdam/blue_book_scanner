Traveling at a very slow speed, reported as circular in shape, lights seen by pilot of USAF aircraft 23 miles off Oahu, T.H. at 19,000 feet, on 7 February 1951. The object appeared to be about 4 or 5 times the size of a B-29 bomber, was grayish in color, and appeared to be cigar-shaped, with a greenish-blue glow around it. The object remained stationary for approximately 1 minute, then made a very sudden and rapid climb and disappeared. The intelligence officer at Hickam AFB, Hawaii, reports that this sighting may be considered CREDIBLE, as the pilot is an experienced officer and a reliable witness.
