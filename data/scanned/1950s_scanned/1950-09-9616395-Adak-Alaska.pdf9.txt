ADA)(, ALASKA
11 September 1950

On 11 September 1950 at 4:45 pm, a Coast Guard photographer
took four photographs of the total eclipse of the Sun, whose path
of totality crossed the Aleutian Islands near Adak, Alaska. The
photographer noticed nothing at the time when he took the pictures.
It was two years after the photographs had been taken that the
observer noticed the images on the film.
The photographs were examined and the probable cause determined.
A 4” x 5” Speed Graphic Camera with coated lens was pointed toward
the sun, and the image was examined on the ground glass. A pro-
nounced flare spot, in addition to the main image, was noted with the
lens wide open, f/4.7. Any camera movement caused the flare spot to
move, as well as the main image. Inserting a flat glass filter before
the lens in the conventional position produced additional flare spots,
which moved about with slight variations in filter orientation.
Flare images are always encountered in photography when an
unusually bright object is included in the field of view, and when the
exposure is not proportionally reduced. The stated exposure is con-
siderably in excess of normal for an object as bright as the sun, as
shown also by considerable halation of the negatives about the sun
images.
It is probable that the spots in question are nothing more than
flare spots due to overexposure for sun brightness.
