This case is extremely short, and that makes it difficult to draw any conclusions.

In spite of that, CIOVT considers it authentic as the testimony comes from one of its best observer members. 

The main point that we should study is the way it maneuvered and the light it carried. According to the previous data on that kind of luminosity and maneuvers of flying saucers they do give out a whitishbluin light before they disappear when they shift and it disappears when they reappear as a plane, a rocket, or any known phenomenon.

What the observer states is quite true, if it had been an "inert object" which could not have dropped by gravity. The observer thinks, and we do too that the object was controlled and guided.
