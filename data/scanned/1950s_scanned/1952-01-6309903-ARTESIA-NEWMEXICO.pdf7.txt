Dear Sir:
On 1/6/1952, between the hours of 12:30 am and 1:00 am, I observed a bright light moving from east to west in the sky. It was first noticed in the east and as it moved west, it disappeared from view.
I am reporting this unusual observation and would appreciate any information you might find regarding this.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
