Dear Sir:

In 10 July, 1958, at 5:30 p.m., two objects were observed over the air force base in Udine, Italy. The witnesses included Signor Bartolo Salvatore and other civilian personnel.

I would like to know the following:

(a) What is the air force's conclusion in connection with this incident?
(b) What was the exact number of witnesses?
(c) The altitude of the air force officer fell one of the civilian witnesses - what details can you provide on this?

Sincerely yours,

Domila
