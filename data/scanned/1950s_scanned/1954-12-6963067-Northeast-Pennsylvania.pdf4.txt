The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line to represent the horizon, with an "A" mark on the curve. The sketch instructs the viewer to imagine that the object was above the horizon when first seen. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with a person standing in the foreground, and two smaller circular insets showing different perspectives of the landscape.
