Text transcribed from the image:

At approximately 3 a.m. on 13 Oct 57 while driving towards Washington, Georgia a gas tank on a 1953 Volkswagen ran out of gas. While working to repair the leak, my friend and I observed a strange light in the sky. It appeared to be hovering about 300 yards off the ground and seemed to be about 30 feet in diameter. The light was a bright white color. As we continued to observe it, the light began to move towards the east. It moved at a very fast rate of speed and in a straight line. After observing it for a period of approximately 2 minutes, the light simply disappeared.
