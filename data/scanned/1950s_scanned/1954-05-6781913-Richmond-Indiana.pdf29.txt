This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page is handwritten and appears to be a letter or memo addressed "To Whom It May Concern". The text mentions "the attached notes are collection used by the Richmond Police Union in the operation of the 'Richmond-Police Union'".

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

To Whom It may Concern-

The attached notes are collection used by the Richmond Police Union in the operation of the "Richmond-Police Union".
