SECURITY INFORMATION
12 MARCH 1953
"Between 0739 and 0740 hours, 25 February 1953, Captain _____, Medical Service Corps, Chief of Radiological Hygiene Division, Army Chemical Center, Maryland, who was on routine patrol in his personal automobile approximately three (3) miles west of Kingsville, Maryland, observed three (3) bright, round, luminous objects in the northeast sky. The objects appeared to be self-illuminated and about forty degrees above the horizon. The objects appeared to be traveling at the same speed or appeared stationary in relation to one another. The color temperature was about the same as that of the sun which is at that time approximately 900 F. One of the objects appeared to dim and brighten alternately at intervals of about one second. All three of the objects appeared to be at approximately the same altitude and distance. Clouds in the area at the time were scattered and the midsts [sic] or far edges of the clouds. The objects were first observed in the clear sky, between the clouds, and the last time they were observed was behind the clouds, so the midsts or far edges of the clouds. The object was in view for about five minutes."

The foregoing is a summary of the information received in this office, and no further inquiry is recommended at this time.
