SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Sighted in Vicinity of Provo River, Utah

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D.C.

The following information was furnished this office by the 115th CIC Detachment, Intelligence Field Office No. 1, Fort Douglas, Utah:

a. At 1300 hours, 17 October 1950, [REDACTED], address #1, Freeman Avenue, Bingham, Utah, employed as a compressor operator on the Lark Tunnel, Lark, Utah, telephoned this (the 115th CIC Detachment) office and volunteered the following information:

(1) On 21 October 1950, at approximately 0910 hours, while working on the Lark Tunnel and a companion, name unknown, sighted what appeared to be a meteor crossing the sky. However, upon closer observation, it appeared to be a rocket or plane of some sort. The object appeared at first as a long, thin line of fire crossing the sky at high speed. This line of fire seemed to thicken and close in on itself at the front and rear of the object, and the main body of the object seemed to sway in the air and then suddenly faded completely out.

(2) Further stated that this daily incident was occasioned by the fact that, although he felt he should report it to some agency, he did not know which would be the proper agency to report to. Further information to the above can be obtained from [REDACTED] at his residence or at his work at the Lark Tunnel, working from 1600 to 2000 hours daily except Sunday.
