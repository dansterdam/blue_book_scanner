In 1958 the Unidentified Flying Objects Research Committee (UFORC) was formed.  Its birth stemmed from the realization that the public ignorance surrounding the subject of "Flying Saucers" or Unidentified Flying Objects" has commanded the committee's diligent attention throughout the northeast United States.  The committee has worked diligently through the northeast with newspapers, television, and public forums, and has provided speakers on many occasions.  The Akron area has come to accept the UFORC as an active organization in this area and the UFORC is an educational organization for the people, and should continue its performance.

Since the UFORC has gained considerable public recognition, it has been hampered somewhat by the fact that "factual reporting has prevailed".  Many people have been found to listen on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects, Scores of reports have been obtained from industries, universities, hospitals, churches, offices and other business, cultural and social centers, as well as from private sources everywhere.  It is the sincere hope of the UFORC that the people will continue to investigate and report such incidents to the committee, for part of its sense of urgency to the reader and in that way advance the case for UFOs.  

It is the aim of the Committee to explore in the immediate future the hands of the popular press, radio, television, libraries and persons, organizations and institutions where it is believed enough interest and cooperation will be aroused to help bring about an official full-scale UFO investigation.
