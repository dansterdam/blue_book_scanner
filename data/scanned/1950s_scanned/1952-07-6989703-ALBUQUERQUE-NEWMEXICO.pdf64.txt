I, the undersigned, a member of the Security Squad of the 1702d Air Transport Wing, certify the following: 
I found out that the object which I reported sighting at approximately 2235 hours on November 29, 1952, was actually a plate. I found this out upon closer examination of the object. When I first looked at it, it appeared to be some type of aircraft traveling at a high rate of speed. However, upon examining it closer, I discovered that it was merely a plate reflecting light, rather than an aircraft. This plate was reflecting light in such a manner that it gave the impression of an object traveling at a high rate of speed. Therefore, the sighting which I reported was simply a reflection of light on a plate, rather than any type of unidentified aerial object.
