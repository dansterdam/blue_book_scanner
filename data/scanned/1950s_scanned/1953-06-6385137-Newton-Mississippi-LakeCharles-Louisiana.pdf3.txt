AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PLACE REPORTED: Newton, Mississippi to Lake Charles, Louisiana
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 5 June 1953
SUMMARY: Reports the unidentified light's attempts to be a special flying object are by Capt. John V. Grange Jr., pilot of a T-33 type aircraft. The light was observed for about 2.5 hours and was paced by the aircraft for about 30 minutes. The light descended to approximately 2,000 feet, hovered for a short time, then ascended rapidly up out of sight.
CONCLUSIONS: The object was probably a special project aircraft or meteorological device connected with activities at the Barksdale AFB, and the pilot's sighting of it apparently caused no immediate concern to the Air Force.
