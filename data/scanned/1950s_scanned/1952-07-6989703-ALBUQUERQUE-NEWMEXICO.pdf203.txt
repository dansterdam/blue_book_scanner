AF FORM 112 - PART II
SUBJECT: FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SITING
THE SIGHTING: There was an unidentified object reported for the northern part of the city. The object was described as round, luminous and increasing in size. The object remained stationary for a period of time and then began moving in a southerly direction at a rapid rate of speed. The object was observed repeatedly in the sky for a period of approximately 30 minutes. The object was observed to dim and increase in size at different times during the sighting. No sound was associated with the object.
THE OBSERVATION: The observation of this object was both visually and by radar. The radar observer stated that he had the object on his radar screen for a period of approximately 30 seconds. During this time, the object was traveling at a speed of approximately 1300 mph and was observed to make an abrupt turn of 180 degrees. The object then accelerated to an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from the radar scope.
THE CONCLUSION: Based on the available data, it is the opinion of the intelligence officer that the object observed was an unidentified flying object. No conclusive evidence was obtained as to the nature or identity of the object.
