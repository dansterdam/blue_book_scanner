this is in regard to my flying object sighting some time ago. i am located at an ammunition -depot, approximately 7 miles west of missoula, montana. on jan 9, 1957 an object was observed and i would like to call some details to your attention.

the object was circular in shape and bright silver in color. it was observed between 4:35 pm and 4:40 pm. the object appeared to be traveling in a northerly direction at a very high rate of speed. the speed was estimated at about 900 to 1000 miles per hour. i am a reserve officer in the air force and have had considerable experience in observing aircraft.

this object did not resemble any conventional aircraft that i am familiar with. there were no visible wings, tail surfaces, or any sign of propulsion. the object appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. it was not affected by the wind and did not emit any smoke or vapor trails. i would appreciate receiving any information that your office may have regarding this sighting.
