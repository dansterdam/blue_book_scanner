The text indicates that this is a geologist student named Ted Chamberlain who drew a picture of a fireball he saw while riding in a jeep at night. The rest of the text describes various accounts of sightings of "green fireballs" or unusual meteor-like objects in the sky over New Mexico in 1952.

GEOLOGY STUDENT Ted Chamberlain draws picture of fireball he saw while riding in jeep on night
BY WALLACE A. SPRAGUE

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.
WE FACE A MYSTERY of outer space even more astonishing than the unsolved "flying saucers."
It is the mystery of the giant green fireballs.
Nine of them flashed across the skies of the range guided missiles or even space vehicles?
One place to start unraveling the mystery is on a cliff reaching across the New Mexico
desert one Sunday night last November.

Continued, stars glittering in the clear light
air. Along the rutted road thundered a rebuilt
jeep at 55 miles per hour carrying three young
scientists from Los Alamos.

Something similar had almost happened to Lester Miller and his wife, of Palo Alto, Calif., had been driving east on Highway 60
near Globe, Ariz. 

Not long after, they, too, saw a great
bluish-green burst overhead. "It was so intense
that I nearly drove off the highway. I was temporarily blinded," said Mr. Miller.

This was no ordinary meteor display. 
Watchers across a 1,000-mile span from San
Fe, N.M., to Vista, Calif., watched the green
fireball flame in the heavens.

Conductor J. B. Hale of a Santa Fe freight
train was sitting at his desk aboard a caboose
at Flagstaff, Ariz.

"One of the brakemen outside yelled for
me to hurry up, for a terrible looking bluish-green flash had just lit up the sky," he reported.

"I saw a fireball ..."

RAILROAD conductors are not excitable people. Neither are airline pilots. Yet the same night Capts. Grady C. Kelly and Thomas R. Baker of Continental Airlines watched the same fireball on the left wing of their plane as they approached El Paso.

"We both commented at the time that it
was by far the brightest meteor we had seen
in 10 years of flying," Ballard said later.

Elsewhere, a convalescent soldier, Bill Henderson, at Ft. Bayard, N.M., watched the ball
of fire from his hospital window. An observant
12-year-old girl, Lavinia Ann Rule, of Santa Fe,
saw it and described its head as "rounded,
bluish-green, with an orange-red tail."

Scientists at Los Alamos have made the discovery that these green fireballs were not ordinary shooting stars but were something different, something that could be guided missiles or even space vehicles."
