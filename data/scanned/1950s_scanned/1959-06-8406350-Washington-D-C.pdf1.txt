10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING At about 5:00 PM on June 8, 1959, the witness observed a bright, high speed, silvery, circular to saucer-shaped object traveling SE to NW. The object was about 20-30 feet in diameter and was bright and metallic in appearance. It was visible for 15-20 minutes and moved at a very high rate of speed, estimated to be over 1,000 mph. It appeared to accelerate and climb out of sight.
11. COMMENTS It is felt that the object observed was an unidentified flying object of unnatural characteristics, i.e. extremely high speed, metallic or mirror-like appearance, and controlled flight, compared to normal aircraft. Additional data for evaluation would be needed.
