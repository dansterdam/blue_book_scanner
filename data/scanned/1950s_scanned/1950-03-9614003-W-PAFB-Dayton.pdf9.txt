Strange Object Sighted Over City; Pursuit Attempts Futile
What was believed to be an unidentified celestial object was reported to have been seen in the skies here Wednesday morning and to have eluded pursuit by Army and Air National Guard planes. 
The object, which was sighted at about 10 o'clock from the control tower at the Patterson Field Air Base, was described as traveling "extremely fast" and "unconventional" in its movements.
Information received from the Patterson Field Air Base stated that attempts were made to pursue the object but that it eluded the pursuit planes. 
The object was spotted by Capt. William Littlejohn, Maj. Henry T. Sturtevant, Lt. Col. Dale F. Shoob, and Capt. Charles Clarke, all of whom are connected with the Air Materiel Command here.
They reported that the object was sighted first over the downtown area and that it was traveling extremely fast in a northwesterly direction.
Attempts were immediately made to send up pursuit planes from the Patterson Field Air Base to intercept the object but, according to the information received, the object was too fast for the pursuit planes and soon eluded them.
The object was described as appearing to be "about the size of a medium-sized aircraft" and as having a "peculiar shape."
The body is described as oblong or cigar-shaped and as giving off a brilliant light. It was visible for about five minutes, observers said.
