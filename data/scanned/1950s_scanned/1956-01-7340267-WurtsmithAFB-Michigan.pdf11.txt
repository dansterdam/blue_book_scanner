REPORT NO: 30-UFOB-1-56
PART FOUR
PAGES 9 OF 6

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A check with the Wurtsmith Weather Station revealed no significant meteorological data related to the UFOB sighting.
2. Lt Finasse contacted the 725th ACAW Squadron at Fort Austin, Michigan who investigated the possibility of other aircraft being in the Oscoda area during the UFOB sighting. No aircraft were known to be in the area.
3. Contact was later made with Dr. Everett R. Clark, Professor of Physics, Wayne University, Detroit, Michigan. Dr. Clark stated that the UFOB was observed to be of a higher magnitude than the 20-30 degree elevation planets in the southern sky during the UFOB sighting. He also stated that the position of Venus and Saturn, also observed, were as expected for that date and time.
4. The pilot of the F-89 aircraft, 1/Lt Culpepper, could not be contacted due to his participation in a cross-country flight. Sgt. Culpepper was on pass and could not be reached either.
