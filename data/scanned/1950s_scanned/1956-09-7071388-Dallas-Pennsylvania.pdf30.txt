Dear Sir:

Last night at - 7:30 P.M. I came home from work and as I looked out the window I saw a strange object in the sky. It was dark in color and made no noise at all.
It moved slowly and silently at a tremendous speed I would say at least 80 miles per hour. I watched it for two or three minutes and then it disappeared behind the trees.
It was quite close and low, perhaps a couple of hundred feet above the ground. I would be interested to hear if anyone else in the area observed this object. Let me know if you have any idea what it might have been.
I reside at 406 Woodland Drive.
