SCIENTIFIC FILM  YFBSD
About the objects shown in the scientific films received from the Air Force, I wish to report the following:

The films showed various UFOs, saucer-shaped, traveling at high speeds. The objects were clear and distinct in the films, and seemed to change directions and speeds abruptly. Several of the objects appeared to be under intelligent control.

The films showed the objects hovering, and then accelerating to tremendous speeds, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds. The objects appeared to be silvery in color, and seemed to reflect light. In several scenes, the objects were seen in formation, maneuvering in a disciplined manner.

In one sequence, the objects were traveling so fast that they seemed to become almost invisible, leaving a silvery trail. In another sequence, two objects were seen approaching each other, and then one of them suddenly veered off at a sharp angle, accelerating away at fantastic speed.

The films also showed the objects appearing to merge with one another, and then separating again. Towards the end of the films, the objects began to move erratically, making sharp turns and stops. The witnesses stated that the films were the most amazing they had ever seen, and that they had no explanation for the phenomena observed.
