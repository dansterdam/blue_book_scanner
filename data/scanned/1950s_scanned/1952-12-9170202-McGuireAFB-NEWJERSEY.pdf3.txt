CASE # 39
6 December 1952

Off Coast of Louisiana

On the return leg from Florida to Galveston, Texas, training mission, student navigator's celestial, I requested the student's radar to turn on the scope, which had been off from 30 miles W of Tampa, and see if he could pick up the coast where on the 100 mile range. After the set was on for a sufficient time to warm up, I was given permission to turn on the brilliance of the scope, both student radar and mine were checked for coastline returns and found none. At this time the set had not been calibrated. My attention then was attracted from the scope for a period of time.

At 0525 CST Radar called for my attention to the scope and I first noted small bright blips returns, approximately 10 with no specific grouping such as a radar beacon for transmitting. As the brilliance was increased one at a time, the blips moved out across the scope more than one range marker. Radar stated at that time he had 50-mile range on, indicating a movement of 12-14 miles. With each successive revolution, the blips continued 5Â±-20 miles from the ship at a bearing of 70 deg and then out of the scope. At 1:50 deg Radar gave the Instructor Flight Engineer the time and distance which was computed to be over 8000 yards in about 5 minutes and speeds were recomputed. During this period, student navigator and Instructor audio viewed the aux. scope and confirmed my observations. At this time I called for Radar to calibrate his set to eliminate any possibility of malfunction. He did this speedily and when he scanned the scope once more the blips reappeared moving 25 across the scope. I called off two separate blip track and position in relation to the 3/5 by the clock system over interphone of the ship and as they passed at 3 o'clock, the Instructor Engineer visibly saw a blue-white white flare go from front.
