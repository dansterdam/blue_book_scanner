Transcribing the text from the document:

I saw it at approximately 11:00 PM on 29 July. It was observed from the ground and remained visible for approximately 20 minutes. The object was first sighted as a bright light in the western sky, which gradually became larger and more distinct. It appeared to be a disc or saucer-shaped object, much larger than a star or planet, and was aluminum or silver in color. It emitted no sound and made no trail or exhaust. The object hovered for some time, then moved erratically, darting around and occasionally stopping, then moving off rapidly toward the west and disappearing from sight. At times it appeared to tilt at an angle, revealing a distinct saucer or disc-like shape as it turned. The edges were well defined and there appeared to be a row of what seemed to be portholes or lights around the exterior.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 31st day of July 1952.
