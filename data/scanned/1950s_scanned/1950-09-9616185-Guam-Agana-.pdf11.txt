Dear Mr. Boyle,

The 2h January 1958 report by Mr. concerning an unidentified flying object seen on Guam in September 1950 has been referred to this office for reply.

There are no reports from Guam of UFO's in September 1950. Also, no object of this reported size would have been seen by many persons or have been observed by radar. There are no other reports concerning this object.
