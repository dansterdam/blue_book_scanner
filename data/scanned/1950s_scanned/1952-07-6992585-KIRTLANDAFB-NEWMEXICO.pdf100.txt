STATEMENT OF WITNESS

I, Jack T. Keely, 7519 North Fourth street, Albuqurque, New Mexico
do hereby make the following statement.

On 30 July 1952 at approximately 2315 MST I saw a strange object
in the air. It was difficult to tell the altitude as the size was not
known. It was the same color and had the appearance of a star and 
was moving from East to West at a very high rate of speed. There was
no exhaust that could be seen. There was a constant light also to be 
seen. It appeared to be round and moved at different speeds. I observed 
this object for about 30 seconds.
