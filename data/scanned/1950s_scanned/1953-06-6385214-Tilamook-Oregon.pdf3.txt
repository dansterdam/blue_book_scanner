9 June 1953
UNCLASSIFIED Tillamook, Oregon

Description
One unidentified object was reported by two USAF officers stationed with the 120th Fighter Interceptor Squadron detachment, Tillamook, Oregon. This object was seen at 1010 PST 9 June 1953. The object was viewed through 6 binoculars and appeared half-moon in shape and white in color. It appeared to hover and no manner of propulsion was observed. No manner of disappearance was reported.

Discussion
During such a long period of observation, any conventional object known to be on this earth could, under existing conditions, have moved from 120 deg at 25 knots. Project Blue Book's astronomers were contacted and they stated that this sighting was undoubtedly the planet Venus which, under ideal conditions, can be seen during the daylight hours.

Conclusion
Was astronomical (Venus).
