The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a letter from the Eastern Shore Broadcasting Company in Pocomoke City, Maryland to the U.S. Air Force Pentagon in Washington, D.C., dated July 3, 1959.

The text of the letter is as follows:

The U.S. Air Force Pentagon
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

I am not sure to whom I should address this letter, or in fact, whether I should even send it at all. The probable embarrassment to you, and that it can more than likely be readily explained.

At any rate, I write to report the observation at length of strange lights in the sky over the Delmarva Peninsula on the night of Wednesday, July 1.

I did not personally see these lights and have no first hand knowledge of them whatever. The information enclosed herein comes solely from Mr. - of New Church, Va. The details and descriptions of the lights were given to him by a Mr. - who resides in New Church, Va. as a witness.

I repeat, that I am embarrassed to send you this story because I am sure you have a simple explanation for the appearance of these lights. However, I understand that you are processing data of this sort and felt compelled to let you have it for what it's worth.

Assuming that there is some simple explanation for the phenomenon, would you please advise us?

Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
Program Director
