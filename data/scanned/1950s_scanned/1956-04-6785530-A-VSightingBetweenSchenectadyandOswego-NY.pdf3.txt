TRANSCRIPT

Miller: Seated next to Mildred (Mrs. Miller) is Mr. Bruce Foster of the Bell Aircraft. Next to Mr. Foster is First Officer Neff of American Airlines. Now you fellows tell us the real experience. What date was this?
This was a week ago last night, on April 8th.
Miller: Was that a regular flight of American Airlines?
Yes it was.
Miller: From Buffalo to New York?
This flight comes out of New York and lands at Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, and terminates in Buffalo.
Miller: What was your first idea that anything was happening--that you were seeing something?
Neff: This very brilliant white light--like an approaching aircraft with its blinding lights on suddenly seems to move away from it, thinking that's what it was. Then we noticed it was standing still at the same time we got curious.
Miller: Just about what location was this?
This was just about over Schenectady. We were coming out of Albany. We took off north and we noticed this light over Schenectady. It seemed to be standing still.
Miller: A light? Now when you say a light, do you mean a light like a light bulb?
Oh yes, very fluorescent--a very bright light...
Mrs. Miller: A big what?
A large light. It looked more like a light coming into Albany airport.
