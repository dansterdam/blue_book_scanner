The image does not contain any photographs or images, it only shows text that appears to be handwritten on a page. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text found in the image:

of the description seem to be at least, so that some understanding may be obtained as to the nature of the objects in question. However, due to the complexity of the reports and the sketchy nature of some of the information given, it is difficult to arrive at any definite conclusions. There were no witnesses to the landings or takeoffs of the objects, and no tangible evidence was recovered. All the information is based on visual sightings only. 
The cases described here do not lend themselves to any easy explanation, and more information would be needed to attempt a solution. It is hoped that more definite data will be obtained in the future to shed light on these reports.
