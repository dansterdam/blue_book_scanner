The text in the document states:

Mrs. ---- civilian, was in the office and Mrs. - - - -  was also in the office, when I boarded up all the windows because all I heard of the report was "landed - Just west of - - - - went down the Civilian..." Some people saw moving lights in the area a few seconds, the same as we observed, it lasted about 5 seconds. The small smoke round the houses a little way off. They were there probably 15 seconds or longer. I saw about four objects. They moved very fast, as I first saw them they were a light and would appear again. It gave the impression of being a large light, as it would appear and disappear again. It was around 1900 but I cannot say for sure. It was well dark at the time. One of the objects above tower took off to my left at a terrific rate of speed and left a while streak in the sky, probably was the object's exhaust. People in the office were Lt. ---- S/Sgt. ---- and Mrs. -----.
