The path (direction and speed) of the target cannot be resolved to any great degree of accuracy. The sudden appearance of the signal in three beams indicates that the object suddenly appeared at this position in space and didn't gradually move into one beam and then another. The target should be considered as two separate parts, that which lasted for 0.75 seconds and the other, which had a duration of 28 seconds in Beam 2 High. The first target had a range rate of change of about + 25 mm/i per second. The second target had an average range rate of change of 0.2 mm/i per second. 

The accompanying photographs show that the signal died out of Beam 1 Hi before it died out of Beam 2 Hi. This could be explained by the passage of the target from one beam into the other, or by a decrease in the strength of the reflected signal. If the target were closer to the center of Beam 2 Hi, we would expect to get the stronger signal in that beam.

D. ELIMINATION OF POSSIBLE TARGETS
Consideration of the facts available indicates that several of those objects listed as possible targets would not give rise to a signal such as that received.
(a) A rocket launched from the White Sands Proving Ground would have reached an altitude of 4 or 5 low beam about 20 to 40 seconds before it was seen in the high beams, and normally is seen for longer than 28 seconds. No such phenomena as that demonstrated by the early portion of the target has been observed on previous rockets launched at White Sands.
