COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Objy, examine the opinion of the Preparing Officer. The object was probably a small private aircraft or military training plane, when it was first noticed, but later, the heaviness of the metal preclude it being one. Although a check with Base Operations at F-15 indicates no such flights were noted, we feel it could easily have been a small private aircraft or military training plane in the area at the time.
As part of the aircraft, the fact that Mr. ____ heard an aircraft leaving the area at the time of the incident, helps confirm this theory.
Believe all persons mentioned, including Mr. ____ are telling the truth in what they stated about the observation of this unidentified object.
