IR-17-51  
PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The possibility of a naval vessel with radar in the Hudson Straits is ruled out.
2. The frequencies in the 700-1000 and 9000 megacycle ranges are unexplainable since no radar equipment is known in this area capable of operating on these frequencies.
3. There are no aircraft assigned to the NEAG area that have indicated lights as described in item 2.
4. There is no UHF installed in aircraft of this command.
5. 243 mes is a national emergency frequency.
6. It does not appear feasible for an enemy aircraft to make reconnaissance flights in this area.
7. NEAG is unable to furnish further information as this Command has no EOTI equipment.
8. It is understood that NEAG is sending two (2) TB-36 aircraft to Goose Air Base and requesting the information of this incident.
