Dear Major Coleman:

I have long been trying to learn the outcome of Air Force investigations of two UFO sightings in the Chicago area. After unsuccessful attempts to obtain the details by writing to the Air Force Headquarters, I sent a letter on 22 Sep 60, a copy of which is attached.

On 22 Sep 60, I did receive a letter signed by Major Philip Sails, which stated that he had received my letter of 26 Sep 60, a letter from Lt. Col. Tacker stating that he had received the letter and was investigating the Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (UFO) case. He further stated, "When we receive the information, it will be forwarded to you" I have not heard a word since then.

A brief resume of each case follows:

(a) 17 Jul 57 - Elmwood Park, Ill. - Two personnel in a patrol car observed an object that glowed red-orange. The incident was immediately reported to the Air Force.

(b) 19 Jul 58 - Des Plaines, Ill. - Early morning. Three men on patrol observed an object at close range. They reported the incident to Des Plaines Police Department. The Des Plaines Journal also contacted Air Force officials.

I would like to know the official conclusions in these cases in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 9.

In a letter to you which accompanied the July issue of our monthly publication, I requested a comment on our disagreement over the handling of sightings involving only one witness. I would still appreciate comment.

Her letter from DOD news release on the subject has been released (in an early copy of Sat. Eve Post) - I would also like to have a copy.

Director of CUFOR
