DOD DIR 5200.10

19 June 1954

Subject: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object over Coachella, California; Special Inquiry, INS 24-332

TO: Director of Special Investigations 
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

1. REFERENCE: On 27 May 1954, a letter was received by letter from the DISTRICT INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 20TH AIR DIVISION, HAMILTON AFB, CALIFORNIA, that on 15 May 1954, a resident of Coachella, California, had reported a sighting of an unidentified aerial object to the local Sheriff's office. The letter stated that the subject reported sighting an object and requested an evaluation.

2. DETAILS: Squadron Leader HOGAN, in a signed statement, advised that he was on exercise on 15 May 1954. He was on an Air Force exercise in the vicinity of Coachella, California, and was not aware of the incident.

At approximately 1330 hours, HOGAN spotted up the risk with positive intention on W/19 and a descend was commenced on a heading of 240 degrees. HOGAN descended to approximately 3500 feet and observed what appeared to be an aircraft in the eleven o'clock position. HOGAN continued his descent, keeping the object under observation. When he was at approximately 2000 feet, the object and he were at approximately the same altitude. HOGAN attempted to close to within visual range of the object and the W/19 appeared to react as though it were under control and was accelerating. HOGAN was unable to close in on the object and the W/19 and his air-speed were exceeded.

HOGAN stated that he considered the object to be an aircraft, but could not identify it specifically. He submitted this report through channels for what it was worth.
