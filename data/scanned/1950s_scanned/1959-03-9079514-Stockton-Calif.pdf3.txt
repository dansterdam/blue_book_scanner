UNIDENTIFIABLE OBJECT IN THE SKY, 
Vicinity of Stockton, California

1. On 3 March 1959, Mrs. [REDACTED], [REDACTED], California, Stockton, reported the following: On 3 March 1959, at approximately 1730 to 1800 hours, she and her husband observed a strange object in the sky over Stockton. The object was white in color, circular in shape, 3-4 solids, smooth in appearance. The object was in sight for approximately five minutes. The object did not make any noise and did not leave any condensation trail. The sky was clear, blue, broken only by the contrail of an aircraft.

2. On 4 March 1959, at approximately 2200 hours, USAF Air Force Pilots during World War II at Hamilton Field, California, with call signs [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED], observed a strange flying object near Stockton, California. The object was described as a source of bright light, reddish in color, not blinking, and traveling at a high altitude of 25,000 feet or more above the horizon's surface. The position of the object was approximately 10 miles west of Stockton. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and then disappeared. None of the observers could identify the object with any known aircraft. The object was not picked up on any radar scope. This sighting was previously observed by others on land, sea, or in the air. It is possible that the object was an astronomical or meteorological phenomena. However, the witnesses were convinced the object was not an astronomical or meteorological phenomena and were unable to relate it to any known aerial vehicle or natural occurrence.
