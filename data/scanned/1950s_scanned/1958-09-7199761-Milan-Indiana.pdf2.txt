The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with a form filled out by the witness describing a UFO sighting.

Text found in the document:

a. Certain    b. Fairly certain    c. Not very sure    d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Disappeared in the air

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object or objects with some type of material. What kind of material would you use if you wanted it to look the same as what you saw? How large would it be, and what shape would you give it? As I have mentioned, I can not think of anything that would construct it as I saw it. I can not think of anything that would construct anything like it.
