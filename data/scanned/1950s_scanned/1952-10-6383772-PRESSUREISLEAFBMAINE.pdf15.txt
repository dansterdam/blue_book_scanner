The image contains a schematic diagram showing the "world of flying saucers" based on attitudes and bearings reported by two stations. The diagram includes labels such as "PRESQUE ISLE", "LIMESTONE", "ERRONEOUS", "JUPITER", and arrows indicating the directions of the flying objects. There is no photograph present in this image, only the schematic diagram.

Figure 1.a.: The Presque Isle sighting from two stations. Upon the erroneous identification of the object seen as a strategic reconnaissance balloon by the two nations, ATIC was called upon to investigate the sighting. They believed, from the prolonged lines intersected, indicating a group of unknown hovering some 150 miles above the earth, more than 300 miles off the Maine coast, of tremendous size and moving at high speed. Concluding that the object could have come from space, or may be of Russian origin, or that the Air Force had promptly clamped down the security lid. When some science consultants, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, looked at the data, he found the unknown to be the planet Jupiter, which had risen somewhat higher in the eastern sky. The believers in the extraterrestrial theory were then in the majority at ATIC, eventhough they had refused to accept the obvious, and the sighting had no claim to be passed as a prime example of UFO surveillance.
The noted French astronomer carefully disposed of the case. The measured range, 250 miles, was consistent with the planet Jupiter, not a mere 300 feet but millions of miles beyond the earth. If a constant correction was applied to the bearings from Presque Isle to Jupiter, the discrepancies disappeared. To measure the distance, the observer had only to make sure that the theodolite was level, but to measure the bearing he must align with the true north, and he had thus obtained a wrong bearing, schematically in Fig. 1.a. It showed that both pointing squares toward the planet Jupiter at infinity.
