UPON REPORT # 9-5-58

DATE OF INCIDENT: 9 June 1958
LOCATION OF INCIDENT: NW1350 (Position appro, midway between Tacoma and Seattle), Washington
TIME: 1817Z (10:17 A.M. Local)

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: Pilot of F-102 aircraft, while between 40,000 to 50,000 ft., whose diameter was approximately 1/2 times its depth (Comment: believe source meant length, Flight was 6,500 MPH) observed a miniature object, cylindrical in shape, whose diameter was approximately 1/12 times its depth (Comment: again, believe he observed object moving at a very high speed). Pilot observed object moving practically overhead, continued North, then it appeared to climb, slowdown, then do a left turn. Pilot states "object then circled me several times before he descended to lower levels."

It is significant to point out (as a routine "source reliability" check or clue) that the pilot gave figures of 7/12 (diameter) and 1/12 (diameter) for Minon's aircraft size, motion and maneuverability measurements which seem too precise (in view of the great speed) to be other than estimates based on precision rulers, calipers or instruments.

INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
(1) Wind picks for area show winds from SE to NW for 40,000 ft. (consistent with pilot's statement)
(2) With flight path of object at estimated 50,000 feet, estimated speed of 6,500 M.P.H. and above
(consistent with pilots statement) object made large turn at these estimated altitudes
(3) Balloon was released about 20 minutes before sighting, and officially reported to have reached 40,000 feet, U.S. A. F. wx srv. in that area
(4) Pilot states radar units, others in area did not see anything unusual. 
Pilot states he did not make any effort to check if object was on his radar.

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE

FINAL ATIC EVALUATION: PROBABLY BALLOON:
(1) Balloon released 20 minutes before sighting and up in that area.
(2) Up to est. 50,000 feet object on W-NW track. Wind was blowing in that direction. At est. 50,000 wind shifted, blowing from N-NW to N-NE (as bluebird surface balloon would)
(3) Pilot states object oscillated/slowed down/turned itself, these are well-known, proven balloon characteristics.
(4) A word on pilots probable reliability (reporting officer did not evaluate): note estimated measurements given in para. A.C did not report. Most observers from fixed positions on ground cannot estimate within one or two inches.
