Transcription of the text:

"I mean to be completely frank and honest in my report to you concerning the incidents which occurred at this site on the night of 6 July 1952. What I observed was certainly no ordinary aircraft, and the actions of the object only serve to deepen the mystery. My report to the intelligence officers will be a full and complete one, but I feel that I should also apprise you personally of the details. 

Namely, this: The object appeared to be circular in shape, and possessed a number of bright lights which seemed to be flashing or rotating. Its speed of movement was truly astonishing, and the maneuvers it executed were quite beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. I cannot even begin to estimate its altitude, but it was certainly at a considerable height. The duration of the sighting was approximately 15 minutes, and during that time the object carried out a number of very erratic and extraordinary gyrations, first hovering, then accelerating with incredible speed, and then abruptly altering course. I must confess that I am at a complete loss to account for what I observed, and I can only surmise that it was some type of unconventional aerial vehicle of unknown origin. I should be most interested to learn if others have reported similar incidents, and would appreciate any light you can shed on this puzzling occurrence.

Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]"
