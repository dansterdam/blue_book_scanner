I.0-4 PILOT-ED BY D-5 AND 5-6; APPROXIMATELY 15-20 MILES OUT FROM TAMPA, FLORIDA,
THE I-0-4 PILOTED BY 3-5 AND ORBITING TAMPA, FLWAS ATTRACTED BY LIGHT APPROACHING FROM THE-WEST. INVESTIGATION DISCLOSED THAT THE LIGHT WAS A WELL-DEFINED OVAL-SHAPED OBJECT ABOUT 30-40 FEET IN DIAMETER, FLUORESCENT OR PHOSPHORESCENT IN APPEARANCE, TRAVELING at AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 400-500 MPH . AS THE OBJECT APPROACHED THE I-0-4, IT APPEARED TO BE -ON--A-COLLISION COURSE AND THE I-0-4 PILOT TOOK EVASIVE ACTION TO AVOID IT. WHEN THE OBJECT PASSED WITHIN 300-400 YARDS OF THE I-0-4, THE PILOT AND OBSERVER SAW THAT IT WAS OVAL IN SHAPE, EMITTED A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT, AND HAD NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION. AS THE OBJECT PASSED, THE PILOT OBSERVED THAT THERE WERE NO MARKINGS OR APPENDAGES OF ANY KIND, NO FLASHING LIGHTS, AND NO MEANS OF STEERING OR CONTROLLING THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT THEN SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN SLIGHTLY AND CONTINUED ON A STRAIGHT COURSE TO THE NORTHEAST AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 400-500 MPH.
2. THE LIGHT WAS SIGHTED BY THE PILOT AND OBSERVER OF THE I-0-4 AIRCRAFT DISTINCTLY AND FOR A SUFFICIENT LENGTH OF TIME TO BE ACCURATELY OBSERVED AND REPORTED. THE MANEUVERING OF THE OBJECT, PARTICULARLY THE APPARENT ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION, IS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. THE OBJECT WAS UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL AND APPEARED TO BE OF UNCONVENTIONAL DESIGN AND PROPULSION.
3. THE GLOW OF LIGHT ON THE CAP SURFACE WAS RELATED TO THE POWER SOURCE, AND HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE ON SOME PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS. THE ABSENCE OF SOUND-NOISE, VIBRATION, OR FLAME, COUPLED WITH THE APPARENT SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY, STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OF ANY KNOWN TYPE.
4. THE LIGHT DID NOT PULSE, BUT WAS STEADY, AND THE OBJECT DID NOTAPPEAR TO BE AFFECTED BY WIND OR GRAVITY IN THE SAME MANNER AS A NORMAL AIRCRAFT. IN SHORT, THE APPEARANCE, MANEUVERABILITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE OBJECT SUGGEST THAT IT WAS NOT OF CONVENTIONAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
