The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object. The text describes the details of the object observed, including its motion, speed, and other characteristics. There is no human face visible in the image.

Subject: Statement of Unidentified Flying Objectives

Until the object left the vicinity, an approximately uniform position was maintained in relation to the varying speed of our aircraft. At one point the object appeared to be stationary, then it moved away at great speed. As we passed the object, its relative position seemed to change to a point where the object was looking backward at us. It appeared to be approximately circular in shape and gave the impression of uniformly lighted surface except for a dark area near the center side. According to the description, the motion of the object was erratic, with frequent changes in direction and speed. The text suggests that the object's behavior was not consistent with a simple theory of propulsion, and that its motion may have involved acceleration that exceeds the reasonable limits of man-made technology. The document appears to be an official report describing an encounter with an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

Until the object left the vicinity, an approximately uniform position was maintained in relation to the varying speed of our aircraft.  At one point the object appeared to be stationary, then it moved away at great speed.  As we passed the object, its relative position seemed to change to a point where the objeot was looking backward at us.  It appeared to be approximately circular in shape and gave the impression of uniformly lighted surface except for a dark area near the center side.  We brought it back approximately inline with our left wing.  I had detached it all the time with our left wing.  This impression, was confirmed, and this impression was confirmed.
We were apparently at a slightly higher orbibaltitude than the object, which was also confirmed by the change in apparent
size as it significant in regard to its speed.  In order to maintain the same angular velocity in a muoh larger circle, its linear velocity must have been exceeding 700-900 miles per hour which appears to fall within the entirely reasonable range of speeds associated with air craft although the increasing its orbit, therefore, it must have been accelerating rather than merely maintaining a constant velocity.
The motion of the sphere during the entire period of observation was noted for its irregularities.  Frequent changes of direction, speed and duration of these changes were apparently erratic.  Reversing, and there were no irregularities or deflections of travel which are irregularities usually associated with conventional aircraft.  It is impossible for any physical, to act in such a manner without intelligent, artificial control.
Though not a graduate physicist, I am familiar with the general principles of aerodynamics, and nothing in the experience proved otherwise.  A plane closely maneuvering at such a speed would certainly be torn apart, and conventional aircraft are presented static to allow precise and definite changes of position and optical conditions, nor that its motion continued for a relatively long period of time.  It is remarkable that to an obvious theory of propulsive action.
For the record, in this connection, that we saw the object against varying backgrounds of dark mountains in the distance, blue sky, and thin bank of cumulus clouds, which of a brownish material object, contrasting it light against the terrain, relatively dark.
On one previous occasion while flying with another pilot, I had seen what I believe may well have been a fabrication phenomenon (I was unable to point it out to the pilot).  It appeared as a bright spark at a distance and then suddenly took off, on a northerly heading, at a speed of several times the speed of any jet aircraft and suddenly took off, disappears.
