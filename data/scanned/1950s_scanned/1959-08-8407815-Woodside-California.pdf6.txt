Dear Sir:

In the caption to a United Press International (UPI) photo for September 25, 1959, it mentions the probability of indicating the picture. Our Committee would appreciate it if you could give us the official designation of the instruments and some additional information as to the instruments' function and capabilities.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
