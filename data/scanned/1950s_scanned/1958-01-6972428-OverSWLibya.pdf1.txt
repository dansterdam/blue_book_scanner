PROJECT 10u/3 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: January 58
2. LOCATION: Over SW Libya
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 0802-0003Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: 0 Yes
6. SOURCE: Military
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 sec
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: NE
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Bright object streaking across the sky in an extremely brilliant glow. Object stopped suddenly and climbed at a very high acceleration. Very rapid acceleration was noted. About 20-30 sec after disappearance, a radar set approx 10 mins prior to sighting detected a blip on the scope. This blip increased in speed and altitude, and then disappeared. This was thought to be the same object. No further observations of the object when originally sighted.
11. COMMENTS: Does this could be satellite observation of "grutak" which is considered to be associated with hovering or controlled maneuvering of the object. The opinion of the sighting is only on the observation of the object. No fighting or break-up noted, as is normally expected for a satellite decay. It was more probable than not that this was a meteor observation.
