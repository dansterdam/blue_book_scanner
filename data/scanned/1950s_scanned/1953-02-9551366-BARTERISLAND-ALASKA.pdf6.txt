COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. Although the time of sighting and time of movement, course of travel and ascension rate agree with the report, the possibility that the sound reported was a coincidence rather than caused by the object that was sounding is raised. It is considered likely that the exact time of release as reported by the Barter Island Weather Detachment may possibly be the time that the sound started.
2. In regard to the sound reported, Captain Barnes agrees to the possibility that, due to his initial surprise at seeing a strange light, he may have jumped to conclusions in associating the sound with the light.
3. Captain Barnes feels sure that the object was descending when he first noticed it. However, the possibility exists that an illusion of descent may have been created by the light variable surface winds and the resultant changes in direction of travel.
4. The falling-leaf pattern and blinking of the light could have been caused by the oscillations normally associated with PEAL released.
5. Considering all factors, it is the opinion of the preparing officer that the object sighted was probably the light from the PICAL sounding. The observers indicated the proximity of the light would witness certain release from Merrill Field as a PICAL event.
6. It is felt that the importance of this report lies in the fact that a qualified air observer may have mistaken the light on a PICAL for an unconventional flying object.
