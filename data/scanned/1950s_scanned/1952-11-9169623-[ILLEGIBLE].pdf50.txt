Dear Sir,

On April 24, 1953, I received from the Department of Defense a letter concerning certain film which showed several unidentified flying objects. For your convenience, I am enclosing a copy of your letter of April 24, 1953.

In your letter you indicate that a "cursory examination" of the film revealed the objects of interest; however, the film will later be given a thorough analysis and you will be advised of the results to call your attention to the results of your examination of my film, as you promised. I feel that since I gave consideration to your interest that the least that you can do is to fulfill the promise contained in your original letter of April 24, 1953.

Since you have had my film for approximately one year, I feel that you have had ample time in which to examine and evaluate it; therefore, if your use of my film is completed, I shall appreciate your returning it to me at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
[signature]
Pascagoula, Mississippi
