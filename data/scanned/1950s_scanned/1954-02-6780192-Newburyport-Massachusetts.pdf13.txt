The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document or report, describing an incident that occurred on Monday, April 25th, 1954 between 3:30 and 4:00 P.M. in Newburyport, Massachusetts.

The text in the document is as follows:

To whom it may concern:

Date of Occurrence - Monday April 25th, 1954 - between 3:30 & 4:00 P.M.

I, myself, was outside my home in Newburyport, Mass. talking with two people, a Mr. and his wife, when I suddenly heard a loud noise from the sky. At first, it was a roar of rather static-like intensity, but then it seemed to draw nearer, and my wife and I noticed a rather strange craft which descended rapidly and died down rapidly. My first thought was of a rapidly approaching jet. However, upon looking carefully, we saw what appeared to be a round, lens-shaped object, some 25-30 feet in diameter, with a slight blue-green hue, which seemed to stop and hover for a moment, then suddenly shoot upwards again at a terrific speed, disappearing from sight. The object appeared to be metallic, reflecting the sunlight slightly. It seemed to sway and oscillate slightly as it ascended. The entire episode lasted only a matter of seconds, and the object was visible for about 10 seconds.

When I reflect upon the house at the time, I had heard that I had heard the noise louder there. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the object in question was in the close vicinity of the house at the time this occurred. There were no trails of smoke or vapor, and the object was simply silent in its ascent, except for the roar in its approach and departure.
