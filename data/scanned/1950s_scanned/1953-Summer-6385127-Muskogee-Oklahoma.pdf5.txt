The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten note describing the contents of a case file from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969.

The handwritten text states:

"This case includes one (1) 5"x 4" photograph & one (1) 5"x 4" negative magazine."
