VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING, THREE FIGHTER-BOMBERS TOOK OFF FROM THE GREAT FALLS AIR FORCE BASE. SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THEY SIGHTED FOUR UNUSUAL OBJECTS IN THE AIR. ASSIGNED TO A ROUTINE MISSION, BOMBING AND STRAFING A TRUCK CONVOY, THESE OBJECTS FOLLOWED THEM FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES FROM THE YAAK RIVER. THE PILOTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO CONTINUE THEIR MISSION, AND THEY DID SO. THE OBJECTS KEPT PACE WITH THEM SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOOR. RADAR OBSERVERS HAD THEIR EYES ON THESE UNUSUAL OBJECTS.

IT WAS WATCHING THE GROUND BELOW FOR THE CONVOY THEY WERE TO BOMB. THEY REPORTED THAT THESE UNKNOWN OBJECTS KEPT PACE WITH THEM, SOMETIMES PULLING AHEAD, THEN DROPPING BACK, AND ONE OF THEM APPEARED TO BE SURROUNDED ON THE WEST AND EAST BY MOUNTAINS, WITH A HAZY PURPLE GLOW SURROUNDING IT. IT WAS NO TROUBLE FOR THESE OBJECTS TO KEEP PACE WITH THEM, TRAVELING SOME 500 MILES PER HOUR OR FASTER.

THEY WERE ALSO GOING AT A GOOD CLIP OF ABOUT 1000 OR 1200 MILES PER HOUR ACCORDING TO THEIR INSTRUMENTS. WHEN THE OBJECTS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO HALT, BACK UP AND BEGIN A ZOOMING MANEUVER, OF COURSE, IT WAS DECIDED THAT THEY SHOULD FIRE THEIR GUNS. HOWEVER, WHEN THEY TRIED TO SHOOT, THEIR GUNS WOULD NOT FIRE. THEY BELIEVE THEIR GUNS WERE RENDERED USELESS BY TURNING DOWN THE SENSITIVITY, BUT THIS HAD NO EFFECT. REALIZING THAT THEIR RADAR SCREEN SHOWED THAT THE OBJECTS HAD MANEUVERED OR MOVED SOME FOUR OR FIVE TIMES FASTER THAN THEY COULD, THEY GAVE UP THE IDEA OF TRYING TO SHOOT AT THEM.

THEN THE BUZZING SOUND CAME ON AGAIN, AND WHEN THE OBJECTS WERE STILL JITTERING OUT THERE AHEAD OF THEM, THEY DECIDED TO HEAD FOR CARRIER. THE THINGS BEGAN MANEUVERING AROUND OUR PLANES, CIRCLING ABOVE AND BELOW, AND I LEARNED AFTER WE REACHED OUR CARRIER THAT THEY SAW THE OTHER MEN IN THAT FORMATION TRY UNSUCCESSFULLY TO TAKE A SHOT AT THEM, BUT THEIR GUNS WOULDN'T FIRE. THEY WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THEIR SIZES, EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE AT LEAST 600 OR POSSIBLY 700 FEET IN DIAMETER.

WHEN THEY DISAPPEARED, THEY DID SO WITH A REDDISH GLOW SURROUNDING THEM.  THEY WERE SHAPED SOMEWHAT LIKE A COOKIE-CUTTER TYPE HAT, WITH A CONVEX TOP AND CONCAVE BOTTOM.  PORTABLE PASTEL-COLORED LIGHTS AND BACK TO THE COPPER-GREEN AGAIN. ABOVE THE MIDDLE OF THE UNDERSIDE WAS A CIRCULAR AREA OF COAL BLACK AND NON-REFLECTIVE, IT WAS SIMPLY TINY BLACK AND IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR BOTTOM WAS STEADY AND SHOWED NO INDICATION OF MOVEMENT, THE MIDDLE OF THE UNDERSIDE WAS SIMPLY TINY BLACK AND IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR BOTTOM WAS STEADY AND SHOWED NO INDICATION OF MOVEMENT, WHEN THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARED THEY TOOK OFF IN THE SAME DIRECTION FROM WHICH THEY HAD COME, AND DISAPPEARED.
