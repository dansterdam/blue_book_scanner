GULF OF MEXICO, 5 NOVEMBER 1957
COAST GUARD CUTTER SEBAGO

Unidentified Flying Object was observed at 0907, position 25.47° N 90.26° W. The object appeared to be circular, grayish-white in color, and was moving from north to south direction. No visual or audible contacts. At 0935 the object disappeared on the bearings 020 degrees at 0907 bearing 153 degrees true, range 23 miles. The target faded at 0935, 190 degrees true, range 24 miles. The second sighting showed up on the bearings 023 at 0945, range 26 miles. The target faded at 0952, 023 degrees true, range 27 miles. The third sighting showed up on the bearings 015 at 0955, range 17.5 miles - fourth contact (only visual contact). At 1000 the object disappeared on the bearings 020 degrees, range 13 miles. Visual and radar contact held through 270 degrees to 310 degrees for approximately three minutes. High rate of speed.

The impression that there was only one object is erroneous. Each time successive target picked up and it was in almost the direct opposite direction from the previous sighting. Careful radar contacts were observed in a period of about 6 minutes, then disappeared; successive prop agation (false targets) is the most likely cause. The visual target was determined to be a meteor.
