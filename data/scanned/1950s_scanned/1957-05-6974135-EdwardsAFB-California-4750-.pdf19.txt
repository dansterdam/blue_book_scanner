SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Edwards AFB, California

1. At approximately 1750 hours on 6 May 1957, Major XXXXX, USAF, and Captain XXXXX, USAF, were conducting a chase practice mission in F-86D jet aircraft over the Edwards AFB area.

2. While flying at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet, Major XXXXX and Captain XXXXX observed an unidentified object in the sky.
