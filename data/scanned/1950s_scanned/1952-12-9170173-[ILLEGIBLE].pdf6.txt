Lackland Air Force Base, Texas
5 December 1952

I. Description of Incident:
While orbiting over Lackland AFB, a T-33 type aircraft sighted an unusual blue light. The intensity of the light was described as the normal strobe light used for identification of aircraft at night. The light was stationary, and its movements consisted of a counter-clockwise orbit over the air base. The maneuvers consisted of this T-33 and a final disappearance to the south. The pilot of the observing aircraft attempted an interception but was not able to close on the object. The objects was not identified after 2025 CST.

II. Discussion of Incident:
The student flying in a jet type aircraft was in progress at the time of sighting. The observing pilot saw these objects and should not have continued with the training when the sighting occurred. The objects appeared to be approximately 2,000 CST very close to the time of sighting. In addition, the existing glints of the object as well as the general southerly heading (which indicates that the unknown was probably a balloon-intercepting investigating aircraft).

III. Conclusion:
Probably a balloon.
