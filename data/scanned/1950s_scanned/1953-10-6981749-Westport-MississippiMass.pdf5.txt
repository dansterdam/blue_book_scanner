This night I myself and two other 
friends were standing around 2a have some 
wait but). There we saw a roundobject 
which had a tail on the end and it was 
Red. The other colors are yellow and white. 
It came on a slant directly from the mass 
when it moved so lowly and Hoster color were 
beautiful. It wouldnt of been a comet 
or a falling star because it wasn't comic 
to slow. I wrote to the Science Digest 
and they said it seemed like a flying saucer 
They told me to write to you and tell 
what you said: Remember there were 
two others with me and not alone a 
boy who also saw that night in the sky
