Text from the document:

The American Air Force Service Command, whose activities are directed in part on certain phenomena from the standpoint of the national defense (reports of phenomena from a wide number of sources that have in some measure to be investigated -- whether or not the existence of any phenomenon is confirmed, and the natural explanation of which, if any, is of sufficient interest to be desired), has indicated a continued interest in obtaining a comprehensive record of all reported and documented observations of any unusual aerial phenomena.

The various areas over which such phenomena have been reported observed include Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. Similar sightings that vanished without trace were reported on September 28, 1954 (AMS 6-11), October 4, 1952 (AMS 11-32).
