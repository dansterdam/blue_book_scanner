Ventura, California
ROTA DARA'AAJZ a 7' To. 2/21/56 CASE 63-54
On 3/1/56, SIGCo a report from SHULL of VENTURA, CALIFORNIA that
he had observed an unidentified flying object on 2/21/56.
OBJECT OBSERVED: Object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes. object was
round in shape, appeared to be self-luminous, and was white in color. Object was
observed moving in a generally northerly direction at an estimated altitude of
6,000-7,000 feet. At times, object appeared to gain altitude, then descend. Object made
no sound and left no trail.
WITNESSES: SHULL was the only witness. He stated that the object was observed from
his residence located on Ventura Avenue. SHULL is a business man, but no other
biographical data is available.
EVALUATION: The object described could have been a weather balloon or a star/planet.
However, the fact that the object was observed to gain altitude and descend would seem to
rule out the possibility of its being a star or planet. The fact that the object was
self-luminous and maneuverable would seem to rule out the possibility of it being a
weather balloon. Therefore, this case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.
RECOMMENDATION: No further action is recommended.
