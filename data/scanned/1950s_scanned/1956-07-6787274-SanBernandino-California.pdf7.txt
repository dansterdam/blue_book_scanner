The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a cover sheet from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The cover sheet includes the following information:

ORIGIN OF BASIC: 46024 AISS, Ent Air Force Base, Colorado
DATE: 11 December 56
TYPE: Letter
SUBJECT: Negative or UFOS
ROUTING: The routing table shows the flow of the case file through various offices.
TO: AFOIN-X, Lt Col Green
FROM: AFOIN-H4
COMMENTS: 1. Enclosed herewith is complete case file on subject UFO sighting for your information and necessary action.
2. Regarding the statement purported to have been made by PRC, this office was not contacted in relation to report on action taken.
3. Accordingly, it is requested that positive action be taken to bring to the attention of Mr. Tom Towers, that the negative, and prints therefrom, were processed, analyzed, and the results made known to sources, as requested by Mr. Towers on 10 Dec 56.
For your information, it should be pointed out that a documentary film produced by Green Associates "Unidentified Aerial Objects" is not informative, and the implications given by Mr. Towers are therefore obvious.
4. Request case file be returned to AFOIN-H4 for retention in our files.
