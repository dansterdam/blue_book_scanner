STATEMENT

On the 27 February 1953 I saw an unidentified object in the sky. The object seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. It came from the southeast and was traveling in a general northeasterly direction. The object was very bright and seemed to be spinning as it traveled across the sky. That was the last that I saw of the object. There was no sound.
