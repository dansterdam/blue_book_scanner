No Case (Information Only)
21 February 1957
White Plains, New Mexico

February 21, 1957 - On this occasion it was seen from 9:35 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. This time two highly interesting maneuvers were performed by a pair of objects. After it began to rock back and forth like a pendulum again, and following this, the two pairs of smaller red objects were again launched upward. About 10 minutes afterward, the object rose and disappeared, seeming to be "turned off."

The reported incidents were investigated by Bill Blades and John Burton of White Plains. Although the repetitive nature of the phenomenon is perplexing, the reddish objects still remain astronomically unidentifiable; however, they cannot identify it with any star or planet.
