UNCLASSIFIED
PORT MONMOUTH, NJ: WEEKLY - 10-11 September 1951

On 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of incidents occurred in the area of Fort Monmouth. As initial sight ings of an unidentified object was made on a radar set. Soon after the radar sighting, two Air Force officers in a T-33 aircraft unsuccessfully attempted to intercept an unidentified object. Later several more radar sightings were reported.

STATUS INVESTIGATION:
A complete investigation of this incident was carried out and will be reported in Project Grudge Special Report No. 1. It has been tentatively determined that the radar sightings were probably caused by balloons that had been launched from the area. None of the radar sightings were close enough to permit visual identification. The operator who observed this incident returned the object was traveling over 700 mph because the radar set's automatic tracking would not follow the target. It is possible that the inability to track the object was due to his inability to properly operate the set under mental stress.
