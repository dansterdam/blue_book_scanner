MEMORANDUM REPORT to: Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

When I had the first radio watch for the first 7 or 8 hours. After being relieved of this watch at 0800 I 1/2 Hr. AEST I was in the Passenger Compartment and went to sleep. After being asleep for awhile I heard someone saying something to the effect of the sighting of the aircraft. I looked up by head to the window and saw a round object which to my looked like it would be from 20 to 30 ft. in diameter. It didn't seem to only roll but also move from side to side. I didn't see it only for a short while as it was gone.
