AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Date of Sighting: 7 1958
Sighting Location: Duluth, Minnesota
Reporting Officer: JOSEPH E. GRAGLIA 
Commander, USAF
COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:
1. The opinion of the reporting officer is that the unidentified visual sightings probably were the planets Venus.
2. On the basis of information, it is believed that the electronic sightings should be evaluated as "unknown" due to the absence of any reported instrumental data. They cannot be explained otherwise and should be considered as a possibility of unreported and unattended aircraft.
