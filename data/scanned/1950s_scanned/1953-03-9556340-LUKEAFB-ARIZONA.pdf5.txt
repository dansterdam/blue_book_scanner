33009 Flying Type Time
Luke A.F.B. Arizona

Captain Frederick J. Thompson, Intelligence Officer, was leading a 4-aircraft flight squadron in a training session. Captain Thompson described the sighting of an unidentified aerial object which he and his wingmen observed while on the training mission.

The observation by Captain Thompson and other pilots in the flight squadron provided the following information:

- An object was never actually observed. This was a high altitude condensation trail that was observed. The first sighting, controlled visually and on the radar, was at approximately 15,000 - 20,000 feet.
- The object appeared to be about 8-10 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and had an irregular flight pattern. The object exhibited a high rate of climb and speed, approximately 1000 feet per second, ending abruptly.
- The object was observed for approximately 1000 feet, ending abruptly. This was the size of the object observed, and it did not extend across the entire sky. The object moved in level flight at the altitude of the contrail, and did not extend across the entire sky.
- Time of sighting was 1325M hours on 3 March 1955, for a period of 7-10 seconds.

Manner of Observation: Aerial observation at 25,000 - 30,000 feet from the 4-ship type aircraft. Pilot was trailing at 25,000 feet elevation. Sighting was from Capt. Thompson, pilot, as leading officer. Airspeed of aircraft was 500 MPH. Additional pilots of flight observed and passed object for an estimated 4 - 5 seconds.

Observers' position at time of sighting was approximately 8j02 N525 at 25,000 feet, with contrail at 18-20 o'clock high, approximately over Luke A.F.B. 

Sighting was made by Captain Frederick J. Thompson, 4600 Fighter Type pilot. He was leading a flight of three 4-ship type aircraft on a simulated combat mission in the Luke A.F.B. area. The object was leading the flight, and Captain Thompson obtained confirmation from the other pilots. The object was never actually observed; only the condensation trail.

The weather was 3/8 miles, visibility 45 miles. Temperature was -50 degrees centigrade.
