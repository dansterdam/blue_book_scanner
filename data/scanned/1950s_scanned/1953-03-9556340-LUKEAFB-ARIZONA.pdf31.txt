PART I - STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. The factual information contained in this report was obtained through investigation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting in the Luke Air Force Base area, Arizona, during the period of 9 March 1953.

2. On 9 March 1953, at approximately 1015 hours, officers and airmen at the Luke Air Force Base Control Tower observed a bright light object maneuvering in the sky approximately 10 to 15 miles southeast of the base. The object was first seen moving slowly in a northwesterly direction and then assumed a horizontal position. The object then made a rapid climb into the sky, coming to a complete stop, hovering momentarily, and then descending at a rapid rate.

3. Several other witnesses on the base also observed the object. Although it was not possible to determine the altitude, size or exact location of the object, it was clearly visible to all observers. Furthermore, the erratic and extremely rapid movements of the object were confirmed by the witnesses. All agreed that the object did not resemble any known type of aircraft.
