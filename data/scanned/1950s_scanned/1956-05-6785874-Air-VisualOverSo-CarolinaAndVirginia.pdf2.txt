INCL 7. PART TWO, 20 JUL 56CE-1

Statement of 1/Lt Robert D. Anderson

I was flying from Segin AFB, direct to Rolling AFB and at 20,000 ft and 250 knots, I sighted out by 11 degree (wig wig) and object in the daylight sky about 50 yards off my left wing. The object (approximately 10 feet in diameter) appeared silvery in color with dark band around the middle. It had no apparent movement and we saw it until we lost it behind our left wing.

Lt. USAF
