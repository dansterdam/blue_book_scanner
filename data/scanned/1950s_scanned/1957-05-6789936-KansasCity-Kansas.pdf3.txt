The incident was dated on the morning of May 23rd, when five observers in Kansas City saw four silver disc-shaped objects flying in formation at extremely high speed. At one point during their flight two of the objects broke formation and veered off, but soon rejoined. It took the objects only four minutes to clear the sky.
