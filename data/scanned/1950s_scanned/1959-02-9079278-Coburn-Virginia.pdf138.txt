COBURN, VIRGINIA
FEBRUARY 9, 1959

REQUEST FOR MILITARY ASSISTANCE

On February 9, 1959, Mrs. Coburn, of 28 North Broadway, Coburn, Virginia, telephoned the local police department and requested military assistance. Mrs. Coburn stated that an unidentified flying object had been hovering over her home and that she and her family were frightened. The police department contacted the nearest Air Force base, which in turn notified this office.

Capt. John J. Leber and 1st Lt. Richard W. Thurston were dispatched to the scene to investigate. Upon arrival, they interviewed Mrs. Coburn and learned the following:

At approximately 8:15 p.m., Mrs. Coburn and her family were watching television in their home when they observed a bright light hovering over their house. The object appeared to be round in shape and emitted a pulsating glow. It remained in the area for about 15 minutes before slowly moving away to the southwest. 

Mrs. Coburn stated that she was very frightened and requested military assistance. Capt. Leber and Lt. Thurston conducted a thorough search of the area but were unable to locate the object. They did, however, find numerous neighbors who had also witnessed the strange light.

The case was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation.
