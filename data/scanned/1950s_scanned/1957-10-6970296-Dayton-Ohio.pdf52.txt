Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the west and will soon be lost to view.

By JAMES STOKLEY

What is generally considered to be the most prominent heavenly object in the evening sky at present? The answer is Venus, the brightest star-like object visible. It outshines all other celestial bodies and can easily be seen during the evening twilight as the sun goes down.

Venus is now at what is known as its greatest brilliancy, meaning that it appears brighter than at any other time during its cycle. This condition results from the fact that the planet is now 21 degrees east of the sun, with the solar illuminated portion of its globe turned most directly toward the earth.

Venus was at its greatest brilliancy on April 11, when it reached an apparent magnitude of -4.7. Now, a month and a half later, it is still quite brilliant, having an apparent magnitude of -4.3. This value makes it about 16 times as bright as the brightest star, Sirius. It outshines Jupiter, which is now just beginning to be seen in the eastern sky after sunset.

At present, Venus sets about 2 hours and 15 minutes after the sun. On the 13th and 14th of this month, it will set about 2 hours after the sun. This is the longest period of visibility for the planet during its current cycle. After that, it will begin to set earlier and earlier each evening and gradually move closer to the sun until it passes between the earth and the sun, known as inferior conjunction. This will occur on Dec. 18.

The accompanying star map shows the position of Venus and other prominent objects in the sky at 7:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the evening of Oct. 6. At that time, the brilliant planet was about 21 degrees above the west-southwest horizon. The map also indicates the relative positions of the planets Mars and Jupiter, as well as the stellar configurations of the Pleiades, Aldebaran and other bright stars.
