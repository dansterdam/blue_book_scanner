HOWARD L. BEVIS, PRESIDENT
EMERSON McHILLIN OBSERVATORY 
25 June 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC -- Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Of the last batch of 14 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is anything additional to her mentioned in my previous letter is the one with the duration of sighting. A few details on this:

Regarding the Detroit 11 June case is there anything in this that a good landing didn't occur and no signals? In the Ontario Canada AFB 1 June case there are probable explanations of faulty radar. I assume that the OCR had radar available.

And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and unequivocally Venus.

Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.

Anything new on:
5 March Shaw AFB
3 April Lake AFB
27 April Fort Austin
12 April Stead AFB

I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's clearance so we can get organized in a more business-like manner. I know you can't do anything about this but I'm mentioning it anyway. I hope it eases through before your successor is appointed.

Cordially,
Allen Hynek
