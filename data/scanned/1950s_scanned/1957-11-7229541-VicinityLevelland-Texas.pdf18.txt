"The three glowing and pulsating objects first appeared in the southwestern sky near Levelland, Texas at 9:00 PM, November 2, 1957. They were observed by several persons for approximately 3 - 5 minutes. The objects maneuvered low over the highway, appearing to be about a hundred feet in diameter. As the objects approached, the automobile engines of several witnesses stalled and the headlights went out. When the objects moved away, the engines and lights were restored to normal operation. The objects finally disappeared from view in the southwestern sky. The above account represents a summary of the testimony of the various witnesses interviewed by the Air Force personnel conducting the investigation of this incident."
