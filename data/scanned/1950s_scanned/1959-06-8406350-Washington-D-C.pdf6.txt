Attention: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) Division

Dear Sirs:

My wife and I wish to report an unusual "sighting" made last evening by 
...
The object descended when we had gone up on the roof about 11 p.m. and were about to 
...
disappearance over the horizon to the west. Just before disappearance, the object appeared to slow down and performed a very sharp 90 degree turn to the west.
...
My wife and I did watch this object for about 15 minutes, and although it traveled in the direction of a star in the sky, it appeared much larger and brighter than any star-we watched a satellite go by a few minutes later, and this object was much larger and brighter than the satellite.
...
I send you this report and hope that it will be of some value to your study of this matter.

Sincerely yours,
