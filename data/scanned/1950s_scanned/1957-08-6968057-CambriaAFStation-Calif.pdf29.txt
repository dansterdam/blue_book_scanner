As intensive land and sea search for this unidentified obj.ct sontinues, Deep Air Force Base personnel report the following:

The plane, an F-97 interceptor, was airborne at 14,500 feet conducting a routine night training flight. The pilot reported by radio-telephone that he observed a silvery object at a very high altitude, approximately 35,000 feet. The object appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed and had a pronounced glow. The pilot broadcast a description of the object over the radio network and several other pilots in the area observed the same object. The object disappeared from view of the aircraft and parachuted to the ground.

The plane's pilot, 1/Lt Robert E. Holden, age 27, of Elmory, Alabama, is still missing.

The intensive search by Coast Guard ships and planes, the Navy, Air Force and Civil Air Patrol is being concentrated along the western shore of southern New Jersey. The search area is being narrowed down as signs of debris believed to have come from the missing aircraft was discovered late Thursday afternoon about midway between Cape May and Cape Henlopen. However, it is believed that this debris was not part of the plane.

The ground procedure for jet takeoffs at Cape May calls for a climb to 4,000 feet over Force Area before proceeding on course. Thus, the concentration of the search in the area north and slightly west of Cape May.

The search is being controlled by the 33 Coast Guard District from control points at Cape May and New York.
