I. PURPOSE:
Determine nature of material for use in analyzing U.F.O. Cases.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
1. A dark brown amorphous material was submitted and assigned Materials Laboratory Project No. 5737.
2. The solubility of the material was examined. It was found to be insoluble in the usual organic solvents (chloroform, ether, benzene, etc.). The material was soluble in water and methanol.
3. Infrared spectra of the methanol extract and of a pyrolyate of the sample were obtained. The spectra were compared with a spectrum of a pyrolyate of sucrose and found to be similar. The submitted sample appeared to be sucrose.
4. To confirm this, a small quantity of the sample was dissolved in water and some 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent added. A crystalline precipitate formed on standing.
5. A water solution of the submitted sample was found to reduce Felling's solution. If the sample was pure sucrose, it would not reduce Fehling's solution, but in the partially oxidized state of the sample, some hydrolysis products would be present.
6. An analysis of the sample submitted showed between 0.1 to 0.5 silicon plus a trace of magnesium, iron and calcium.
