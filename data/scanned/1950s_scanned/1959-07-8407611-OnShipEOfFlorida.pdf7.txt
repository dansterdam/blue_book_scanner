Text from the document:

Aug. 5, 1959
Dear S-to:
I have just recently completed a cruise with the Moral Reserve. It was placed on the destroyer, U.S.S. Robinson, DD 562. We left Charleston, S.C. on Tuesday, July 21, 1959.

While standing quarantines, watch on the Robinson's bridge, I witnessed a very strange spectacle. I hope your can give me a truthful explanation.

It was standing the 2400 watch on July 25, 1959, when I noticed this light. Our position was about 650 miles east of Florida.
