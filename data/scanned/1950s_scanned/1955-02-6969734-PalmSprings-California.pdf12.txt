AN AEROPOST AIRLINER* PILOTED BY CAPTAIN DOUGLAS FARQUHARSCON, A FAMOUS VENEZUELAN WHO FLEW IT WAS A CLEAR DAY, WITH VISIBILITY UNLIMITED, UNTIL 11:15 A.M. THE FLIGHT WAS NORMAL. SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY A STRANGE ROUND APPARATUS WAS FLYING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE PLANE. ROTATING COUNTERCLOCKWISE, THE MYSTERIOUS MACHINE SHONE WITH A GREENISH LIGHT. AROUND ITS CENTER WAS A RED RING OR BAND WHICH EMITTED FLASHES OF BRILLIANT LIGHT. ABOVE AND BELOW THIS BAND WERE WHAT APPEARED TO BE LIGHTED PORTHOLES.
HURDLING CAPTAIN FARQUHARSCON AND HIS MIKE TO CALL THE BARQUISIMETO RADIO STATION, *HE REPORTED THE OBJECT. HE WAITED FOR AN ANSWER. BUT THE RECEIVER HAD GONE DEAD. (LATER THE BARQUISIMETO RADIO OPERATORS STATED THAT JUST AS CAPTAIN FARQUHARSCON HAD BEGUN HIS REPORT, COMMUNICATION WAS CUT OFF.)
AS CAPTAIN FARQUHARSCON WENT BACK TO ALERT THE PASSENGERS, THE ROTATING UFO. INSTANTLY THE OBJECT VANISHED, THEN LEVELING OFF, IT RACED AWAY AT TREMENDOUS SPEED.
WHEN THE PLANE LANDED, THE PILOTS LEARNED OF THE SUDDEN BREAK IN RADIO COMMUNICATION -- NOT ONLY AT BARQUISIMETO BUT AT VALERA, WHICH WAS ALSO RECEIVING THE INFORMATION. NOT UNTIL THE PLANE REACHED VALERA AIRPORT HAD THE RADIO RESUMED NORMAL OPERATION.
BUT NOW, SAID CAPTAIN FARQUHARSCON, *NOT ONLY ARE WE CONVINCED OF THEIR EXISTENCE, BUT ALSO THAT THEY ARE CONTROLLED...*THIS WAS THE MOST SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF MY CAREER AS A PILOT, AND I WILL REMEMBER THE INCIDENT FOREVER.*
THE PILOTS' DETAILED REPORT, WHICH MADE FRONT PAGE HEADLINES, WAS FULLY CONFIRMED BY THE PASSENGERS.*
