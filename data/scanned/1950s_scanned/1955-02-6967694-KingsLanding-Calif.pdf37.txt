MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
Subj: Telephone conversation with [REDACTED]
On 2 August 1968 at approximately 1505 hours, Sgt. Harold T. Jones received a telephone call from a Mr. [REDACTED] who said he was an instructor (S-F) and wanted to know how long it would take him to get to the UFO office at Wright-Patterson AFB, what time we quit work, because he wanted to come to our office and give us some information on an old sighting he had. Sgt. Jones informed Mr. [REDACTED] it would take about 15 - 20 minutes to get to the base but Colonel Quintanilla was gone for the rest of the afternoon and that Lt. Marano (Col Quintanilla's assistant) was here and could give him the information. He stated he didn't care who he talked to, that he wouldn't take up too much of anybody's time.

In between portions of the conversation there appeared to be trouble in the telephone lines, such as a poor connection, so every time there was an interruption he used foul language (damn, shit). The trouble in the line was somewhere between the office phone and the phone from where Mr. [REDACTED] was calling.

Mr. [REDACTED] then spoke with Lt. Marano. Mr. [REDACTED] was very upset and said the Air Force is always evasive. Lt Marano asked Mr. [REDACTED] if he wanted to make a report on a 1959 - 1955 case, said yes it was an old report and this is about the ninth time I have called over the past years and you always have telephone trouble. "I don't think anybody could really report anything if they had to." Mr. [REDACTED] said his report was in 1955. Lt Marano informed Mr. [REDACTED] if he wanted to visit the UFO office at Wright-Patterson in regards to his old sighting.
