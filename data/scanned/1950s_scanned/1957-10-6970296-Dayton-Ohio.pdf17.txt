The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The larger sketch on the top shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above it. The smaller sketches below show a person standing in a landscape and a person standing on a hill or ridge overlooking a landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
