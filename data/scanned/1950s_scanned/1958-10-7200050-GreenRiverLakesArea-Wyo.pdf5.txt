On October 9, 1958 at 7:40 P.M., Mountain Standard Time, on the Moose Creek road 13 miles north of Pinedale, Wyoming an unusual object was observed. This was the relative clear with a slight haze, visibility at about the same instance, we were sitting in a pick-up truck facing northeast when the object was observed with the naked eye (with eyeglasses) and then with X35 binoculars. We got out of the truck and watched for a period of 10 to 17 minutes which the object faded and could no longer be seen. The color, at first was a bright blush-green to light green color of varying intensity and quick sometimes. It remained the brightest object in the sky, much like a very bright star, until it disappeared. At times, a second object seemed to be present directly to the left but I believe this was a positive after-image.
