While watching several jets and their vapor trails, motion that looked like a star at a greater altitude. By watching it for a while it seemed to move back and forth. As I went to the 5-0R 5-5 and told them to try and track the jet. While they were getting them on the r. radar, they watched until they lost it. They went to move they radar and lost the jet. After that they wasn't able to move they had them. Upon having the beam of radiation as the jet. seemed to know they was going to try and track them so he took off at a very high rate of speed.
