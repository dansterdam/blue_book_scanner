The image does not contain a photograph. It consists of two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and a "B" marked on it, and illustrates how high an object was above the horizon when it was first seen. The second sketch shows a larger scene with a person on a road, and two smaller sketches that are examples of how to complete the larger sketch.
