Major L. J. Tucker
SAFIS-3 - OSAF
Today I'm in line with what Major Friend told you March 4 that the Pennsylvania sightings of 24 February were caused by observing a C-47 drop flares and distress signals is too simple an explanation.

Ohio 38 14' and March should have had me report on that. Concerning the TV antenna quizzed by ATIC personnel is totally false. It might be a good idea to ask him to furnish the names of those who did the quizzing.
