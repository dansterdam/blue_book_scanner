The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

1. DATE
2. PLACE
3. SHAPE OF OBJECT
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
5. HOW OBJECT WAS OBSERVED
6. TIME OF OBSERVATION
7. DURATION OF OBSERVATION
8. DIRECTION FROM WHICH OBSERVED
9. ANGLE OF OBSERVATION
10. DISTANCE OF OBJECT
