COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER: 
As stated by the two military observers on duty at the scope, this phenomenon may have been interference from another radar set in the area. The approximate bearing to the other station is 252 degrees. The appearance appears to be similar to that of the 767th ACRS Squadron. It is believed this sighting cannot be explained as interference from another radar, since it is not uncommon and all observers have had considerable experience with radar interference. It is not believed this sighting can be explained as interference.
