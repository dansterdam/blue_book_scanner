RE: Flyi ng Cases, 13 Ceval ry Division On 6 November 55, 0500 --------- I looked at an object which was brilliant, evenly luminous, light cast a hazy glow. It appeared to be at an altitude of approx. 270 magnetic azimuth. It looked like a large star, glowing constantly without any variation in light. After about 3-5 seconds the light gradually went down and went out. The whole incident did not take more than 10 seconds. It has never happened before or since. About 2-3 weeks later I saw another similar light at about 10 degrees higher in the sky, but it lasted only about 2-3 seconds and disappeared. The magnetic azimuth was about 270 degrees. No sound was heard. No picture could be taken as the incident was so brief. I am willing to verify the above report about this incident.
