On 7 July 1952, at about 11:14 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. Howard Schaeffer of Osceola, Wisconsin, reported seeing a brilliant light in the sky near their home. They stated that the light appeared to be hovering and changing colors, going from white to orange to blue. At one point, the light seemed to split into two separate lights.

According to their report, the lights were observed for approximately 45 minutes. The Schaeffers said the lights were brighter than any stars or planets in the sky, and that they seemed to be at an altitude of around 2,000 feet. No sound was heard coming from the lights.

The case was investigated by the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, the official government program for investigating UFO reports. The Air Force concluded that the lights observed by the Schaeffers were likely the planet Venus and some unidentified aircraft, possibly military planes.

However, the Schaeffers remained convinced that what they saw was not Venus or conventional aircraft, but rather some kind of unknown aerial phenomenon. The case was never fully resolved and remains one of the many unidentified sightings from the files of Project Blue Book.
