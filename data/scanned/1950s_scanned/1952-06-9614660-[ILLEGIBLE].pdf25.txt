STATEMENT

On the morning of 23 June at 1104, I drove home from the club, but my car the garage and I walked out to see how the weather was in the morning for golfing.

The sky immediately above was clear. There were stars visible and there was no moon. To the north and the north east there was a sudden bright flash which was a 'lightening' flash. As I was looking up, I noticed this blue light moving across the sky from southwest to northeast. My first impression was that it was a meteor. But upon closer examination, I say [sic] that the speed was much too slow and that it was not the usual trail of a shooting star. As I continued to watch the object, a blue light appeared to pulsate around the object. The object continued in a straight line at an apparent constant altitude to the northeast. As the object reached the horizon, the light went out and no sound could be heard. I would estimate the altitude at between 15 and 25 thousand feet, and the speed somewhat faster than a jet. The object disappeared behind a cloud and could not be the reappearment.
