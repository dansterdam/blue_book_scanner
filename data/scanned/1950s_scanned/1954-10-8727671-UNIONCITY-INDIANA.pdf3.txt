The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document.

But this was an actual visual observation by a businessman and his wife, who saw the object pass through the sky while driving along a highway near Union City, Indiana on October 8, 1954.

The object was described as oval-shaped, dark in color, and maneuvering rapidly through the sky. It was observed for about ten minutes before disappearing from view.
