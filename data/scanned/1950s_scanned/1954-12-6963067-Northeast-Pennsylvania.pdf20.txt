The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

15. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - No sound
b. Color - A hazy silver or grey

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details that you can observe such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically mention trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[The response includes a hand-drawn sketch with the text: "The object appeared to be oval in shape and moved in a horizontal direction. There appeared to be a part or structure attached to the main body, but this part seemed to project outward, rather than trailing behind."]

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred  b. Like a bright star  c. Sharply outlined  d. Don't remember
e. Other - The outline was slightly irregular or blurred

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
[No response provided, as the witness reported only observing a single object.]
