STATEMENT
At approximately 1710 hours, Central Standard Time, 9 January 1952, I was riding home from work with two other persons. We were heading North on Zaragoza Street and had just passed the intersection of Monterrey and Zaragoza Streets when a strange object in the sky caught my attention. I was riding in the back seat and had to stoop down to see the object so I would estimate the angle between the object and myself to be somewhere between sixty and seventy degrees. The object looked round to me and gave the appearance of being of aluminum construction. I would estimate the size of the object to be comparable to a six inch diameter ball held at arm's length. I did not notice any sound nor did I observe any trail or exhaust. I cannot even begin to estimate the altitude of the object but it was much higher than any plane I have ever seen. The object was in the fast sky diving but at a tremendous rate of speed. It was much faster than any jet plane I have ever seen and must have been many times as large as any planes because of the comparative sizes. The object did not dip, dive, or perform any type of maneuvers. However, it gave me the impression of steadily gaining altitude until it passed in front of us and continued towards the East, getting smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible.
