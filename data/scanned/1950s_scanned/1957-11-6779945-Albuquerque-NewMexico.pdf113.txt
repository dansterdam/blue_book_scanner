The image contains three sketches. The first sketch is a curved line with the instructions to "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

The second sketch shows a larger scene with a road and buildings in the foreground, and a curved line in the background along with instructions to "In the following larger sketch place an 'A' at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a 'B' at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch."

The third sketch is a smaller image in the bottom right corner that appears to show a person looking at an object or landscape in the distance.
