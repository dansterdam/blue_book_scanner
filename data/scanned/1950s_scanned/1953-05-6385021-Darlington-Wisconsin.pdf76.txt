The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows two larger images - one appears to be a road with buildings and trees on either side, while the other is a smaller landscape scene depicting a person standing in a field.
