The text on the image is as follows:

At a tremendous speed the object seemed to disappear as it traveled in an erratic manner with the horizon as a background. This was a vivid moving light, a bright luminous object, the size of an automobile, which appeared and disappeared. The object was not larger than the size of a man's head when viewed against the horizon. The object was very high and moved extremely fast, much faster than any known aircraft.

I have seen many comets and I'm familiar with the stars, but this was no comet or star. This was unlike anything I have ever seen before. It was not reflecting sunlight. It seemed to have a power source of its own and there was no exhaust trail. The trajectory was so erratic, much different from that of a meteor or satellite, and the speed unbelievable. I would estimate it to have been traveling at a minimum of 2,000 mph.
