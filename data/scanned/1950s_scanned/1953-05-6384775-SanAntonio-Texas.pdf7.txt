The image appears to contain a handwritten document, but does not appear to contain any photographs. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text found in the document:

29. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
(Girard ca.): No.
29.1 If yes, describe who, etc. and the object too.
(Girard cont.): No.
29.2 Please indicate any other witnesses.
(Girard cont.): No.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional pages if necessary.
The object appeared to be very large - it appeared to be the size of a 4-engine airliner, but it had no wings. It was illuminated as though by a spotlight, but there was no visible source of illumination. It moved rapidly and silently. There were small round objects with lights on them, moving around the large object, and these lights appeared to be blinking. At one point, the large object appeared to split into two, but they reunited after a short time. The object then descended rapidly in a slightly spiral motion, and I could see it for at least 10 minutes. I had a feeling of awe and wonder rather than fear.
