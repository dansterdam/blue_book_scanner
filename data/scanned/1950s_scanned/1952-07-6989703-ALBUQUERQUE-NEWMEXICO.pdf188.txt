APPROVED 1 JUNE 1950

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

SUBJECT: Flying Oblong Transport (U)

1. Mrs. ------ , 3310 N. Bayshore Dr., Miami, Florida reported an object sighted on 29 July 1952.

It appeared to be as large as a four-engine transport. The object was circular in shape, was brilliant white in color, and gave off considerable brilliance, although no trail was observed. It hovered over the Keys, Florida about 75,000 feet for about 10 minutes.

The object turned spontaneously red to green about every two seconds; while it was green a white aura was observed around the object. When the object started to turn red, it disappeared almost instantly. No sound was observed. There was no trail. Stones and stars were sudden.

Mrs. ------ is the wife of a Naval officer. In 1950 she and her daughter were observing a flying object which she described as a "wrapped balloon". She reports that this incident lasted for about an hour. She claims she thought to have made a report on this observation to Naval authorities.

The flashing - burst - surge of light from red to green would appear to be approximately every two seconds would indicate the possibility of a conventional aircraft, with rotating beacon and definite stop and start actions weakening the aircraft hypothesis, and strengthening the possibility of some phenomenon less susceptible to the limitations of machine performance, and more akin to the characteristics of a powered device of an unconventional nature or origin. The phenomenon is not readily explainable and is therefore open to speculation.
