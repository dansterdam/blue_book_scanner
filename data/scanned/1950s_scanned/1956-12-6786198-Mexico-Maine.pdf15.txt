The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document on "United States Senate" letterhead from Washington, D.C. The document describes a personal account of observing a "saucer-shaped object" through a kitchen window, as well as mentioning the author's TV and other details.

"Last Friday nite the Friday before Christmas i was in my kitchen putting up my husbands lunch, for the next day and I went over to my kitchen sink to rinse out a bottle, when I looked out my kitchen window (I have 3 large windows, up over the sink all along it is now that I have a good view of the yard) I saw a saucer shape object about 3 ft in diameter that glow a beautiful shade of green that I have never seen, blowing saucer shape shaped like the cover on my Easy Spin Washing Machine (it came down on an angle to the children swing (they are metal type ones) must have been maybe 15 feet coming down on a angle and then flew up immediately. The light disappeared I thought for sure that it was going to land. It might have and then took off immediately. The swings are about 75 ft from the house. That was my actual seeing of one. They have them so perfect that they can land in your back yard. This was a few minutes before 1 oclock because my clock is directly over the kitchen sink.

That was my actual seeing of one. But we have pieced this together. It was on a sunday nite and we believe it was 2 weeks it could have been 3 weeks before this object appeared that I actually saw. I was watching dishes but when 5, 6 oclock and my boy friend wanted to go to the first show at the movies and we take him down and get it when they invited us out. I want to add that we live about 2 miles from town, there are no street lights and open spaces on both sides of the house the only house near me is across the street. This was the conversation the boy and I had while we were doing dishes."
