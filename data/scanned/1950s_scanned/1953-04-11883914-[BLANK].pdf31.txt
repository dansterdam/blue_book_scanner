The image appears to contain a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated reported UFO sightings. The page is titled "SECRET SECURITY INFORMATION" and is marked as "UNCLASSIFIED". 

The document contains a table titled "EXHIBIT II. CODES (Continued)" which lists various codes and their corresponding variables related to UFO sightings, such as visual characteristics, motion, and other attributes.

As an OCR system, I will now output the full text found in the document:
