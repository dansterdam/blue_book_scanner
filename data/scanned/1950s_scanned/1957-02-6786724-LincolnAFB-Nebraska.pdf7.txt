The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing the sighting of maneuver lights by a police officer and others in Burbank, California on February 13, 1957. The text details the officer's observations of the lights, including their speed, course, and sudden changes in direction. The document also mentions information that was included in letters to the U.S. Air Force and the L.A. Mirror-News.

POLICE OFFICER AND OTHERS WATCH MANEUVERING NIGHT LIGHTS
February 13, 1957

On the evening of February 13, 1957 the information in this case obtained directly from the observer, Mr. ____ of Burbank, California, who reported the details to us.

Officer ____ of the Burbank, California Police Force, was dispatched at 6:30 P.M. to investigate a report of an object over Lockheed property in the San Fernando Valley. As he was told to look up toward the horizon to the north where he observed an extremely bright light which was slowly descending toward his location. As the light came closer, it began to accelerate at a high rate of speed toward his right. In motion, the light blinked on and off several times, and seemed to be rotating. It reversed its course, sweeping back toward the area from whence it had come. As it neared the observer, the light appeared to be a very large brilliant white light which illuminated a large bird-like shape which he could not identify.

Then the second light made a sudden right-angle turn. Following this, the two objects turned so that they were receding away from each other. Finally Officer ____ could watch only one object at a time; first he would watch one light, then the other. Both lights had been too far above the horizon - 60 to 70 degrees - to have been conventional aircraft. The display lasted about 15 minutes. Besides the information contained in Mr. ____'s letters to the U.S. Air Force, and the L.A. Mirror-News, 2/14/57, no other details were gleaned from the information at hand.
