The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter from the Director of Civil Defense of Tuscarawas County to Sgt. Drappery.

The text in the document says:

Dear Sgt. Drappery,

Enclosed you will find questionnaire and four pictures requested in your letter of July 11th. Also a section of UFO showing location.

If my son can be of further help to you in this matter please contact him at Sampson AFB where he will be stationed after today.

Sincerely yours,
Director of Civil Defense
Tuscarawas County
