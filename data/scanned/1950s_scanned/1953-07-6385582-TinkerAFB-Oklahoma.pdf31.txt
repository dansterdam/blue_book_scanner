In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may report information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

BASE OPERATIONS CALLED AS IN TO REPORT THAT ONE OF THEIR MEN ON A ROUTINE CHECK OF THE FIELD AT ABOUT 2:30 AM OBSERVED SOMETHING IN THE SKY THEY COULD NOT IDENTIFY. 

VITAL STATISTICS CANNOT BE TAKEN DUE TO THE BRIEFNESS OF THE OBSERVATION. AFTER TAKING AN OBSERVATION OF THE OBJECT I BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS TWO SEPARATE OBJECTS TRAVELLING IN PARALLEL AND AT ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE.
