Gentlemen:

Last Friday night an object was spotted in the southeastern sky about 5:30 p.m. It continued to be visible until about 7 p.m. when it was no longer possible to see it because of the darkness. People who saw it described it as having a red or ruddy colored base with a shiny, silvery-type appearance that appeared to be miles away. From your base, do you have any record of it having been seen from other points? We would appreciate any information you can give concerning what it was. The object was first spotted by youngsters. They thought it was a new planet--their own discovery.

P.S. It's got my curiosity aroused -- I couldn't see it, although I tried. Too many obstacles -- buildings, trees etc. in my vision.
