UNCLASSIFIED
Albuquerque, New Mexico 28 December 1952

I. Description of Incident: 
At 2309 CST a military pilot sighted an elongated cigar-like object about the size of a medium transport plane. It traveled from east to west over Albuquerque, New Mexico. All sightings were visual from a period of 10 to 15 seconds. There were broken high clouds.

II. Discussion of Incident:
All air traffic in the area was identified by Kirtland AFB. The object had no trail, common to some meteors. However, it was not enough contrast, color, size, or speed to be a meteor. I1 addition, the aircraft was, as reported, operating normally and there was no distress or evasive action. ANDC in its final report stated an answer might be found here.

III. Conclusion: Insufficient information.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
