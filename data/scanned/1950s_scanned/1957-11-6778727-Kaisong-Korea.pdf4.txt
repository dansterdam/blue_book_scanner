The image appears to be a page from an old report document related to Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this page. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

1. The reported phenomenon cannot be re-established. Consequently the case is classed as "In-Sufficient Information".

2. The visual sighting which took place at Taegu, Korea on November 6, 1957 reported in your letter dated Nov. 7, 1957 has been investigated and the following information obtained:

The object was observed near Taegu, Korea at approximately 1800 hours local time on November 6, 1957. It was seen by a number of people and was described as a bright luminous object which appeared to be in flight. The object was observed for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes. No aircraft or other conventional objects were observed in the area at the time. The object appeared to change direction and altitude during the sighting.

3. Based on the precipitation, it is assumed that this is an observation of a meteor or other natural phenomenon. It is not known if a vapor trail would be left behind unless sufficient information is available regarding the characteristics of the object observed.

The case is filed and closed as "Insufficient Information" since additional details are not available to conclusively identify the reported object.
