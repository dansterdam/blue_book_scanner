The event occurred at LAD ARMY-LANGLEY AFB, VA
On 6 OCTOBER 1959. The witness, a military person, was on duty at LAD ARMY-LANGLEY AFB, VA when he observed two bright lights in the sky. The lights were traveling in a straight line at a very high rate of speed. As the lights approached, they stopped and hovered directly overhead. The witness estimated the lights to be approximately 300 feet in diameter and 50 feet thick. The lights remained stationary for approximately 2 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. No sound was heard. The entire incident lasted approximately 3 minutes. The report was forwarded to Project Blue Book at ATIC.
