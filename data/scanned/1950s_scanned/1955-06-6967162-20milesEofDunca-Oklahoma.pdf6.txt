The image appears to contain a diagram or sketch rather than a photograph. The diagram shows an oblong shape labeled "LIGHT" and an annotation that says "EDGES APPEAR TO BE FUZZY". There is also a label that says "SIZE OF MOON" and an annotation indicating an "ABRUPT CUT OF TRAIL".

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

ABRUPT CUT
OF TRAIL

SIZE OF MOON

LIGHT
EDGES APPEAR
