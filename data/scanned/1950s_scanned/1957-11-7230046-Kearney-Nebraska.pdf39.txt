Flying Saucer 'Rider' Lands in Prison Cell
Reinhold O. Schmidt, 63-year-old window in Bakersfield, Calif, who claimed he had contact with a flying saucer and its crew, is now serving a 1-10 year prison sentence for grand theft, it was announced here. Schmidt, considered by authorities to be mentally deranged, was convicted in Bakersfield of obtaining $3,000 from a woman by persuading her he was going to use it to finance a trip in a flying saucer to the planet Venus. Schmidt previously had been sentenced to 1-10 years in a state prison on a charge of grand theft. Upon completing this sentence, he was returned to Kern County to face the new charge.

Schmidt also claimed that he had talked with the occupants of a flying saucer which landed near Bakersfield on Nov. 20, 1957. He said he had been taken aboard the craft and shown maps of the earth and other planets. Schmidt said the occupants told him events would happen before they occurred. He was awaiting trial on this charge when he was sentenced on the grand theft conviction.
