(HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF THESE AND THEY USUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE AND HOVER IN THE SKY WHICH INDICATES TO MYSELF THAT THEY COULD POSSIBLY BE MAN MADE CRAFT DESIGNED IN SECRET BY THE U.S. GOVT. OR SOME OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRY AND THIS MIGHT BE SOME TYPE OF EXPERIMENTAL TEST FLIGHT. HOWEVER I HESITATE TO VENTURE ANY GUESS AS TO EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE).
