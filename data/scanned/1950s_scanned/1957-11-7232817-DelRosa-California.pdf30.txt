VENUS MOST PROMINENT

A brilliant object in the sky, Venus, soon be joined by the Pleiades, is becoming more prominent.

By JAMES STOKLEY

THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the 
evening sky is the planet Venus, which 
will be at its best for the year in the 
coming months. This is the brightest of all the planets and one of the most brilliant objects in the sky.

Venus, you probably know, is the earth's nearest neighbor in space - but just how near she is may come as a surprise. At its closest, she approaches to within 26,000,000 miles, while at her farthest she is 160,000,000 miles away. That's a wide range, but even at the maximum, Venus is still a mere stone's throw in astronomical terms.

ACCORDING TO mythology, Venus was the daughter of Jupiter and the goddess Dione, and she was beautiful beyond compare. As the evening star, she was especially prominent in the spring, when she rose shortly after the sun set. That's why the ancients associated her with the spring.

This year, Venus promises to be extremely prominent in the evening sky. As April 14 approaches, she will be low in the west after sunset, shining brilliantly. For several weeks following, she will remain visible in the west for nearly three hours after the sun goes down. 

After that, she will start moving higher in the sky, reaching maximum elevation above the horizon about the middle of June. At that time, she will be seen during the evening hours almost until midnight. Her elevation above the horizon - and consequently her brilliance - will then start to decrease.

By the last of September, she will have moved sufficiently far from the sun to be visible again in the morning sky, rising shortly before the sun. This pattern will be repeated, with Venus being prominent both in the evening and morning sky at different times of the year.

DURING THE MONTH of November, when Venus is most prominent in the morning sky, she will rise more than two hours before the sun. Then, in December, Venus will rise less than an hour before the sun. Thus, the planet will have a very brief appearance in the morning sky during that month.

November is the month bringing one of the most famous phenomena associated with Venus - the appearance of the "horns" or crescent form of the planet. From about the 15th to the 20th, Venus will appear as a thin crescent, shortly after midnight.

They are most noticeable on the mornings of November 17 and 18. So the month of November is an especially good time to watch for Venus.

Compared with the more distant planets, such as Jupiter or Saturn, the orbit of Venus is actually much nearer the sun. That is why, as we see Venus move in its orbit, the configuration of the illuminated portion that we see changes so rapidly.

When Venus is on the far side of the sun, we see her fully illuminated, like a full moon. As she moves around in her orbit and comes closer to the earth, the illuminated portion shrinks to a crescent.

THIS IS KNOWN as the phase of Venus, similar to the phases of the moon. The changes in the appearance of Venus are caused by the changing angle at which sunlight strikes the planet and is reflected to the earth.

In the next few years, Venus will be very prominent in the evening sky. Her beautiful silver-white light will be a joy to behold for all who gaze at the heavens. In December, 1957, the evening star will reach her highest position above the southwestern horizon, making her truly outstanding.

So watch for Venus in the evening sky during the coming months. You'll be seeing one of the most brilliant and fascinating objects in all the universe.
