The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, with handwritten text.

Looking carefully at the text, I will attempt to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the output of all the text found in the document, without any additional commentary:

Locating an area to the west, which appeared to be about 4 to 6 miles distant, a grayish white object, luminous in appearance, was observed moving through the sky at a high rate of speed. The object was circular in shape and about the size of a basketball. It appeared to make a soft humming sound. After about 15 seconds the object suddenly went out, leaving a trail of white smoke or exhaust in its wake. The incident was reported to the authorities. Weather conditions at the time were clear and calm.
