AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: 
8. There was no physical evidence, such as fragments, photographs and the like, of the sighting. 
9. No interpretation or identification action was taken.
10. There was no air traffic in the general area of the sighting.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:
1. I have had an interview with the officer who observed the phenomenon described in this report. This officer had been working for the Air Materiel Command at Muroc, California. He was working for this Command on a flying saucer project and by reason of his experience along that line, he expressed an opinion as to what he considered the object to be. However, I would be impressed by the fact that some of his statements later proved to be mass hallucinations and distorted versions of actual facts, rather than a true report of what he saw. I hesitated before turning in a record of my observation.
"The Captain" as he is known to the section of Air Materiel Command handling the flying saucer project, is an individual full of enthusiasm and optimism.
2. This Directorate checked with the Control Tower of Pope AFB, with the Headquarters of the 507th Tac Control Group, G-2 2nd Airborne Division, and the Weather Squadron at Pope AFB. The weather conditions, meteorological or otherwise, taking place at the time of sighting.
4. Captain ___ impressed me as a conservative individual and not given to exaggerated statements. He stressed the fact that he had this flying object in view for only a few seconds and had no real point of reference from which to check its size or altitude. He inferred it may have been at a considerable altitude.
