There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

We have this case on three distinct data: 1) solid appearance; 2) round and splashed shape; 3) the affirmation that it was a metallic object.

Also it had something unusual: the sound, it was described as a "long sound, continuously hitting the previous data, on this is very unique, irregular".

Mrs. Amalia Laconceguy de Becares, who said that she saw something that had a loud high frequency vibration: probably the object was very high.

According to Juan Ram√≥n Mera, who describes it as the humming of a bee (see case nr 30 January 1958).

According to all this data we must conclude it was a flying saucer.
