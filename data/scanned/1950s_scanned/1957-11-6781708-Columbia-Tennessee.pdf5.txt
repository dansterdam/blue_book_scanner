SAFTS-3/Maj Tacker/jma/7h966

8 January 1958

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

Your letter of 11 November 1957 concerning an unidentified flying object, addressed to the Commander of the 25th Air Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has been referred to this office for reply.

A thorough check reveals this sighting of an unidentified flying object has never been reported to Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson.

Would you please identify the Air Force filter center which received this report and the name of the individual officer or person who received the report?

When we have this information we will check further on this matter.

The suggestion that the sighting may have been a plane or missile from another country is entirely unfounded. There is no evidence to support such a conclusion.

For your information I am enclosing the latest Air Force fact sheet on unidentified flying objects, dated 5 November 1957.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
