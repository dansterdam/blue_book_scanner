There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. The page appears to contain only text, which I will proceed to extract and output:

It has been pointed out that there would possibly be a lag in the public information before it would be made public. However, it should be immediately obvious that reports which originate from intelligence sources would remain primarily in intelligence channels. The reports so far received indicate the necessity due to their relation with the Aerial Phenomena Program, necessitated on the reports which remain primarily in intelligence channels. This places a scientific and technical capability. The office within SAFOP which handles the processing of any agency or activity's capability, for assistance in the evaluation of these reports.
The above considerations are indicating the program for ATIC is available for transfer along with the project. This officer is capable of performing the functions of this document.
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Astrophysicist and Director of the Observatory Northwest University, should be informed as Liaison on scientific matters. He apparently spans the entire 15 years that the Air Force has conducted this experience would be invaluable to the program.
It is believed that this method of operating the Aerial Phenomena Program would be more beneficial to the USAF. The long range plans are to eliminate this costly program completely as an Air Force responsibility. The Air Force has made the determination that responsibility for the primary investigation of most UFO reports should be assigned to the agency of Intelligence.
If you concur with the recommendations of this letter, it is suggested that the necessary steps be taken to effect the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to SAFOX.
