TO ATIA5-5 FROM ATIA5-2 DATE 1 OCT 55 COMMENT NO. 2:
1. The enclosed report has been reviewed as requested in comment No. 1.
2. Based on the available information and the fact that two radar operators have advanced conflicting evaluations of the phenomenon, it is considered that further handling by ATIAS would be pure conjecture.
