The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report documenting a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in Cleveland, Ohio on October 22, 1955.

Sound: No sound. Altitude: Was it 200 feet high? No, hell, no. Just as high as any plane.
Lights: Only wing or tail lights? No, just the yellow lights.
We all watched out and watched it and we did not get excited about it. (Though it had something to do with the football game, (he thought looked like a comet high up, south to north - seemed to be chased it, went east, with ends south to north - pushed it to east, to show how the lights moved.)
Note: .... sighting was near this location.
