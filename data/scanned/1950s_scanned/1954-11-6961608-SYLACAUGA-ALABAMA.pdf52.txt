1. Reference report AF Form 112, P2-C-UFO8-1, dated 2 December 1954, from Robbins Air Force Base, Georgia. Enclosed for your information are two duplicate sets of prints of photographs taken on 9 December 1954 at the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

2. The object was received at the Air Technical Intelligence Center 1000 hours 3 December 1954, and was forwarded to ATIC-3-5 at 1200 hours 3 December 1954, where it has been loaned to the Smithsonian Institution for study.

3. The following is the preliminary analysis of the object by the Smithsonian Institute's examination:

Glasses and meteorities may be divided roughly into three classes. One category includes those fragments which are completely vitrified, often called aerolites. This category (called the iron meteorites or nickol-iron alloys) appears to be an aerolite, weighing 3 pounds, 8 ounces.

Most meteors and meteorites are quite frequent. Explosions of very large meteors are quite frequent. Some showers have been known to produce hundreds or even thousands of separate meteors moving with high speeds, that therefore explode. The Alabama meteors were seen to explode. Some other fragments were distributed over a very large area that remain to be recovered.

The average limits of altitudes of meteor paths are known. They select appear at greater heights than 50 miles, for as greater heights there is insufficient air to cause one to burn, and generally they burn up before getting as low as 10 miles. Only those large ones reach the ground as aerolites.
