Once the Air Force is in that case, either on a Navy, an Army general, nor even a ranking member of the Air Force, authorised staff can prove that he has been without interviewed. From the foregoing, it appears that the 0%?!Â° information, it appears that highly important facts about the March 23 Collision at Oxnard AEB are still being suppressed by NICAP. This case is still being investigated by NICAP, and a complete critique by NICAP's Special Advisors is not yet possible without the report of the 602 CIC Squadron.

On April 25, NICAP wrote to the Sheriff of Ventura County, California, and requested that the details concerning the return of certain material that had been taken from the Oxnard AFB be furnished. To date, there has been no reply.

AF Sheriffs also state: On the same date, NICAP also wrote to the Sheriff of Ventura County, California, and requested that the details concerning the return of certain material that had been taken from the Oxnard AFB be furnished. To date, there has been no reply.
