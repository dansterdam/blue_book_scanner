Big Fireball Traverses Western U.S. Sky

Denver, Oct. 6 - A brilliant fiery object flashed across the sky from Colorado to Utah last night, the National Air Defense Command reported yesterday. It whirred so swiftly southward that it appeared to be a guided missile, but it was believed to have been a natural phenomenon, possibly a meteor.

The 15-man crew of the Transport plane said the fiery object came from the north, flashed through the sky, and disappeared over the horizon to the south, some 15 minutes later. The craft was flying at 30,000 feet when the fireball first was sighted. In addition to the crew, a number of persons on the ground also reported seeing the object.

Lt. Col. Paul Anderson, public information officer at Lowry Air Force Base, east of Denver, said observers described the object as being "as bright as magnesium flares." It was a bluish green in color and left a trail of orange sparks, he said.

Anderson said the object flashed by the Transport plane so swiftly that it appeared to have burned out about 1 second after being sighted.
