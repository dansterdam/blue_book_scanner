AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED
AF FORM 112 - PART II

15 Oct 51
1. ATTN: 0/I SPAS
At 2215, 7 Oct 1951 the object was first sighted at an altitude and increasing range towards the object was estimated at 2500 miles per hour. In other words, the object was traveling at a terrific rate of speed, the blip on the radar screen being instantaneously checked. The object was tracked at this speed for 18-23 minutes. The object then appeared to slow down to approximately 1200 miles per hour, the blip on the scope became more solid and distinct. This appeared to be a gradual maneuver, the object gradually decelerating. The object then appeared to make a 270 degree turn to the left and increased his speed again to approximately 2500 miles per hour and disappeared off the scope. The calibration charts from the scopes also calibration indicate the speed pattern observed.

2. Other radar operators in the area did not independently track the object. Radar sites at or near 127.2 did track the object. Get UL and have the initial calibration check made on or about 5/10/51. 

3. Radar site #51 located southwest of site #51 also failed to intercept the object.

4. A search was made among the instruments personnel in an attempt to find someone who could have been in contact with the object. No one was found who could have been in contact with the object.

5. The supplementary report by Mr. A of PGAS mentions that several times the object was tracked by the GCA and the object was picked up on the GCA scope. In this report it is stated that the GCA had a continuous tracking of the object as it came in, passed over, and then went back through the system causing the unusual brilliant display of the blip on the GCA scope.
