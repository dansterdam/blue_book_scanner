greatly improved reporting and it emphasized the importance of cooperation by all Air Force units. Next, the use of Videon cameras, while not wholly successful, due to the lack of operating personnel, produced no results to indicate anything but conventional airborne objects. Finally, the Battelle effort produced Project BLUE BOOK, Report No. 14 which in October 1955 was declassified by the Secretary of the Air Force and released in summary by the Department of Defense. This study, which covered 8 years of sightings concluded that: 

First, there is a total lack of evidence that these unknowns were inimical or hostile or a threat to the security of the country.

Second, there is a total lack of evidence that these unknowns were interplanetary space ships.

Third, there is a total lack of evidence that these unknowns represented technological developments or principles outside the range of our present-day scientific knowledge.

Fourth, there is a total lack of any physical or material evidence -- not a piece - scrap - or a minute fragment of these so-called "flying saucers" was ever found. It is our belief that if more immediate, detailed objective observational data could have been obtained on the "unknowns" most of these too,would have been satisfactorily explained.
