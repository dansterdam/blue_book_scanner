The image appears to be a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book document. There is no photograph present on this page, only handwritten text describing a UFO sighting.

The text reads:
"This object was sighted Aug #3'55 - About 11-15 pm. It was seen for about 15 min. like a factory type object, moved very slow & at a great speed at times. It would hardly seem to move then all of a sudden it would move very fast. The light on it would shine and seem to flicker on and off & could be turned off for a minute or so at a time. It seemed to be wheeling or doing barrel rolls at a great speed. The light on it seemed to illuminate the sky and ground at different times."

The text goes on to describe the appearance of the UFO and how it moved, including that it seemed to "turn off" the light for periods of time. The last part mentions that this incident occurred in Platte County, Missouri.
