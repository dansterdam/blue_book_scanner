"MAKING BALL FALLS FROM SKY, HAS EXPERTS WONDERING WHY"

A big ball of smoking bubbles descended on South Baltimore yesterday. A crowd of people saw it, and although it was only a few yards in diameter, it created quite a stir.

The only a few yellow stains about the color of sulphur were left, and although the police were called, the bubble had disappeared when they arrived.

The guess - - from an adult - - was that the bubbly phenomenon, one of the two seen simultaneously, came from the planes. Their height was estimated that it came from the planes "higher".

Mrs. Catherine Enright, South Paca Street, said she saw the strange mass of milky matter drifting slowly down at about 11:30 A.M.

She said it was about 25 feet in diameter, and it looked "like a big ball". It fell on the ground across from the Standard Oil and Steel Corporation, and immediately to the nearby lot, smashing through the fence.

Part of it clung to the automobile and was a yellowish stain, and it smelled like sulphur. The ground was scorched by the "heat" and "smoke" came from it, she said, and people could not get near it as it was "too hot".

Captain Arvillas said shortly after the object arrived, two young Negroes G. C. Connell and Edmund Ward arrived from the Southern police station.

Almost immediately from the time it arrived, Captain Arvillas said, "SMOKING BUBBLY PROVES A PUZZLE" (Continued from Page 2).

Captain Arvillas Wallace of the 545th Ordnance Detachment, arrived. He said he had been notified of the incident and made an investigation. He said it was "decidedly strange".

Captain Wallace scraped some of the residue off the car and took it to the police laboratory for examination. He said little of the material left when he got there, he said, that he wasn't sure what he got was the stuff that came down.
