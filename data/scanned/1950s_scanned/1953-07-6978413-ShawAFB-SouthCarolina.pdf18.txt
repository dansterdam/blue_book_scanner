There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically from a report dated 1953-07-6978413 from Shaw AFB in South Carolina.

The text on the page is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. 

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One):
a. Hand of a pin  
b. Pea
c. Dime 
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you constructed the objects that you actually saw. Of what type material would it be made, and what things would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object or objects which you saw.

Without any photographs or images present, I have simply extracted all the text content from the document page.
