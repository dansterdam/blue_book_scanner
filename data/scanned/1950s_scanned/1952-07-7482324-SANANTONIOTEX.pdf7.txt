The image appears to contain a photograph showing a bright white object, not unlike a burning magnesium flare, at the center of the frame. The object is described as appearing to be surrounded by a parachute-like apparatus. The text indicates that the object was observed flying beneath a jet aircraft, and that it appeared to be much larger than the plane. No humans are directly identified in the image.
