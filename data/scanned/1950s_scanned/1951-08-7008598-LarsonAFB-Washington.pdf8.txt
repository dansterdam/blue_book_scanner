LARSON AFB, WASHINGTON - 26 AUGUST 1951

On 26 August 1951 at 0226 AST, an unidentified flying object was detected by an Air Force radar operator. The object moved at a speed estimated to be 900 to 1,000 mph. The object was observed on radar for approximately 5 to 6 minutes.

The F-86 aircraft were scrambled but radar contact with the object was lost. The object was first tracked between 17,000 to 20,000 feet with a rapid descent to 15,000 feet.

The operator of the radar set, an Air Force Captain, is considered to be an expert operator.

Weather conditions at the time of sighting were not favorable for anomalous microwave propagation.

Status of Investigation:
Review of this incident by the Electronics Division of ATIC concludes that the return was positive, meaning that the object was real. This conclusion is based on the precision of the radar tracking and the fact that the target was observed on only the low beam of the APS-31 radar set.
