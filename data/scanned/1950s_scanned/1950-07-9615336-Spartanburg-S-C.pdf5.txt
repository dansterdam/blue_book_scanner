Mr, his wife, and the other 2 observers all agreed that it's structural appearance was inconsistent with any aircraft known to the 4 of them, or that it could be a planet, and that it was very distinctly by all 4 observers and a discussion as to what it was and how to describe it better went on for approximately an hour after it had disappeared the last time. Mr. stated that he did not try to bring the object to anyone else's attention, other than the two men in the car next to him. The first and second time the object appeared to him, it was slightly visible and it was possibly a planet. The third time it appeared it was so large and looked so weird that his attention was called to the others as they were afraid that it would be best not bring it to the attention of the others as they were afraid that it would cause a disturbance.
