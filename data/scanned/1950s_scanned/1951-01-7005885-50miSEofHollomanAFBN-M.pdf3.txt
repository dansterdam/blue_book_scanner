ROUTING AND RECORD SHEET

FROM: WCEFE-2

1. The following information is submitted per request from Lt Ruppert.
   On 22 January 1951 the undersigned, ___ and Mr. ___, Project engineers for General Mills Corp., were tracking a balloon on Project Mogul. We had taken off from Holloman A.F.B. on C-57 type aircraft in a north-westerly direction. About half way between Holloman and Salt Flat Texas, we noticed an object near our balloon. The balloon was at 70 thousand plus feet and we were flying at approximately 11 thousand feet.
   The object was above and to the side of our balloon. How far above and to the side I cannot say with any degree of accuracy. The object was round and silvery in color. It seemed to be stationary, and remained in sight for approximately 10 minutes. As long as I saw the object, which was approximately 10 minutes, it maintained its relative position to the balloon. We flew under the balloon and lost sight of the object.
   A short time thereafter our balloon started to descend and landed near Salt Flat Texas.
   After landing at Holloman, we made a verbal report to the officials there.
