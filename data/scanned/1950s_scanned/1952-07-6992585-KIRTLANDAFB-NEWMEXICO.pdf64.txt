5220710/61, Your Pg.5, #1.1. The movement appeared to go down into
or behind a large cloud beneath it and I wondered if it would appear
again in the blue sky beneath it as I watched but instead it came out
but leaving a much narrower appearing trail out from the south east
end of the cloud.

#20. 1 Though the trail was many feet above the earth, yet I am not
able to judge how many hundreds of feet high.

I felt hesitant to report the movement for possibly our
Government authorities might be fully aware of this & I would not
want to hinder or trouble with a trifle and yet I reasoned that if
they knew all about it there should not be any harm done in reporting
and so I immediately 'phoned last no one in authority could have seen
it from where they were and, therefore, might be wisdom to follow it up
to determine if it were something that was, or was not, according the
regulations.
