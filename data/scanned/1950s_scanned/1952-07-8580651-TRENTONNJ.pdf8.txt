CIVILIAN OBSERVATION OF A SINGULAR AIR OBJECT
1. Location: TRENTON, NEW JERSEY
2. Date-Time Group: 7/14/52 - 2225
3. Description of Object(s):
The object was described as a bright light, sharply outlined and lighted in the center, appearing to be about the size of "half the moon" and giving the impression of great distance. It approached from the northeast, passing overhead and continuing on out to the southwest in a very high speed of flight. It was accompanied by a single, smaller object which was illuminated but not as brightly as the large one.
4. Action Taken: Reported to the Air Force.
5. Additional Information: The person who reported this sighting states that he was watching the sky and saw this object appear without warning. He says that it was of sufficient size, brilliance and speed to definitely attract his attention. He feels quite certain that this was no conventional aircraft. 
6. Evaluation: This sighting has been investigated and appears to be of a highly unusual nature which cannot be readily explained on the basis of known aerial phenomena. The size, speed, and unusual mode of illumination of the object sighted would seem to preclude the possibility of its being an ordinary aircraft, meteor or other natural phenomena.
