AS 16200 on 25 MAY 1952 I was on duty as Asst DCO at this control and warning station. About 11:20 PM a weather radar contact was made at approximately 140 miles SE of station on a heading of 290Â° (T). This contact was tracked on radar for approximately 3 minutes, during which time it maintained a constant speed of approximately 700 mph. It then disappeared from the scope. This target was not plotted as known air traffic at this time and it is requested that all available information concerning this incident be forwarded to this organization for further study and records. Nothing further was seen of this target. I am informing the controller: This target did not paint again.
