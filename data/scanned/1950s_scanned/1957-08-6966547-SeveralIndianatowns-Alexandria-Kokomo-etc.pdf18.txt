ALFC 500 (?) - Two round white objects were sighted
1. The objects were disc shaped and approximately 30 ft. in diameter. 
2. The objects were observed for approximately 45 minutes.
3. The objects were observed moving in an oscillating or weaving motion, during which time a white light, similar to a flash from a camera was emitted from the objects.
4. Several persons in the vicinity observed the objects which appeared to be at an estimated height of 500 ft. or higher.
5. No sound was observed emanating from the objects.
6. The direction of flight was from the southwest to the northeast.
7. Sunset occurred approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes prior to the sighting.
