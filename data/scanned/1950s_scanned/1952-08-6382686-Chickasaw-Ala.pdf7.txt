Several other witnesses also observed the object, which was first sighted in the southeast traveling in a northwesterly direction. It was observed for approximately 5 minutes and then suddenly disappeared from view. 
The object appeared as a blinking light, changing in color from white to red and back to white, and seemed to oscillate or pulsate. It was observed to slowly move northward and then suddenly accelerate and move in a rapid zig-zag pattern to the south and southwest, finally disappearing.
Only aircraft reports operating in the vicinity at the time of sighting was a F-84 jet performing a routine training mission in the area. There was no report as to the object finally disappearing.
Weather at 22000 feet/70000 mile high stratus clouds with winds from 120-14 knots. The altitude of the object was estimated to be between 10,000 - 12,000 feet.
