STATEMENT BY 
OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED JULY 25, 1953 - JULY 25, 1953 - THREE OBJECTIVES AND BRIGHT LIGHT IN CENTER, OBSERVED FROM PERRIN AFB, TEXAS AT APPROXIMATELY 2020 TO 2030 HOURS. OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO MOVE IN CIRCULAR MOTION FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AND THEN MOVED AWAY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND DISAPPEARED.

THESE OBJECTS GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF FLYING IN A MANNER OF UNCONVENTIONAL FLIGHT PATTERN. THEIR MOVEMENTS SEEMED LOGICAL AND CONTROLLED. THE FIRST TWO OBJECTS CHANGED POSITION RAPIDLY WHILE THE THIRD OR CENTER OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY. AS THE TWO OBJECTS MOVED OUTWARD THE CENTER OBJECT APPEARED TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY IN SIZE, THEN DIMINISHED UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED. THESE OBJECTS SEEMED TO MOVE SLOWLY AT FIRST, THEN INCREASED SPEED AND LEFT THE AREA RAPIDLY.

AT THIS TIME GREEN OR AMBER COLORED LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED LARGER THAN THE SIZE OF THE OBJECTS. THESE LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3-5 SECONDS THEN DISAPPEARED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF SPEED OR SIZE SINCE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE OBSERVED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE.

A AIRCRAFT APPEARED IN THE SKY AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME AS THE OBJECTS. THIS AIRCRAFT WAS HEADING IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION AS THE OBJECTS AND SEEMED TO BE IN PURSUIT OF THEM. THE AIRCRAFT COULD BE EASILY IDENTIFIED AS A T-33 TRAINER.
