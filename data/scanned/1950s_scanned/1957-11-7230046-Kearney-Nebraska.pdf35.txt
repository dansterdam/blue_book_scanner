Ya, Das Was Eine Grosse Space Ship by the United Press.

A traveler in- Nebraska says he saw and talked last night with the ordinary-appearing occupants of an apparent space ship.
Reinhold O. Schmidt, 48, of Bakersfield, Calif., came into Kearney, Nebr., white faced and shaken and asked to see a minister.

He told of talking with six "occupants" of a transparent space ship," parked for repairs outside town, and stuck to the story through repeated questioning by authorities.

Many other sightings of unidentified flying objects were attributed by scientists to tricks of vision in persons who actually saw the brightest planet - Venus and other stars. The associate director of Harvard University's observatory, Dr. Donald A. Menzel, said many seeming "flying saucers" were due to mirage causes and that scientists who had been shown some sighters appeared to deny all such explanations.

In Kearney, Mr. Schmidt, a grain buyer who once served a prison term for embezzlement, said he had been inside the ship with its four men and two woman passengers who appeared to be ordinary mortals in ordinary clothes. They spoke to each other in German and to him in English, Mr. Schmidt said.
