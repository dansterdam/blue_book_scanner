TEXT OUTPUT:

6. Possibility of delay of reports with intelligence value getting into proper channels and the resulting delay of evaluation and dissemination of intelligence information.

4. The necessity for familiarizing sub-units of the Air Force with a new method of operating the Aerial Phenomena Program. 

5. It has been pointed out that there would possibly be a lag in intelligence information finding its way into the proper channels. However, it should be immediately obvious that reports which originate from intelligence sources would remain primarily in intelligence channels with information copies of these reports, when deemed necessary due to their relation with the Aerial Phenomena Program, forwarded to the offices which handles the project.

The program should suffer little from being severed from an organization with a scientific and technical capability. The office within SAFOI responsible for this program could request the services of any agency within the government complex, which has a scientific and/or technical capability, for assistance in the evaluation of these reports.

6. It is believed that this method of operating the Aerial Phenomena Program would be the most beneficial to the USAF. The long-range aims are to eliminate this costly program completely as an Air Force responsibility. The first step, however, is to establish the proper procedures for this program (i.e. have a standard method for obtaining, processing, and reporting UPO reports) as a responsibility of intelligence.

7. If you concur with the recommendations of this letter, it is suggested that the necessary steps be taken to effect the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to SAFOI. (Draft of letter to HQ USAF recommending the transfer is attached.)
