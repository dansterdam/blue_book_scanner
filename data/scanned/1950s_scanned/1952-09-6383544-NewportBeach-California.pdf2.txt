The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains a photograph that depicts three different UFO-like objects in the sky. The objects are shown as silhouettes against a landscape. However, since the image does not contain any human faces, I will not identify or name any individuals in the response.

Regarding the text in the document, the OCR output is as follows:

FLYING SAUCERS FROM OUTER SPACE

The document appears to be discussing or providing information about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or "flying saucers" from outer space.
