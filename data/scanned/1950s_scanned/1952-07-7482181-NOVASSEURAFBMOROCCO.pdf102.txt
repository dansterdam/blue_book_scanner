The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report detailing the sighting of strange "flying saucers" near Norfolk, Virginia by two veteran Pan American Airways pilots.

Text from the document:

"Two veteran Pan American Airways (PAA) pilots reported today that they saw eight "flying saucers" near Norfolk, Va., last night.

W. B. Nash said he and W. H. Fortenberry saw six of the strange craft, estimated to be 100 feet in diameter and "glowing orange-red," fly in formation some 6,000 feet beneath their DC4. 

The six "things" turned westward sharply when the PAA plane passed overhead and were joined by two other similar flying discs, Nash said. The eight "saucers" zoomed upward to an estimated 10,000 feet altitude before the glowing light emanating from them "multiplied off" and they disappeared into the sky, Nash said.

Nash, 35, estimated that he and Fortenberry "watched the whole maneuver" for between 10 and 12 seconds.

Nash, a first officer for PAA and a flying employee for 10 years, said he and Fortenberry "would make the eight objects were definitely intelligently controlled -- whether from within or without the earth, we couldn't say."

"Also," said Nash, "we can be reasonably positive that none of us -- as we know pilots -- could physically endure the centrifugal force that would be imposed on the occupants when making these things of such violence as these objects showed."
