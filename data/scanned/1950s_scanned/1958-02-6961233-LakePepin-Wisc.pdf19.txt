DISCOVERY OF THE OBJECT. MR. HAS BOTH A DRAWING FROM
ITS OBSERVER AT LAKE PEPIN IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL REPORTS. THIS
INCLUDES A LIST OF WITNESSES WHO APPARENTLY BELONG TOO THE

OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN A METEORITE OR SOME OTHER OBJECT PUT INTO
THE SKY BY MAN. THE AISS DET 19, 1958TH SQUADRON LOCATED AT
MINNEAPOLIS HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO INVESTIGATE AND PICK UP THE
DRAWING AND RE PORTS FROM MR. I WOULD STATE THAT THIS IS
ACTUAL SIGHTING OF SOME OBJECT KNOWN OR UNKNOWN. RECOVERY
PROCEDURES SHOULD GIVE AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT IT WAS. THERE
IS NO RECOVERY PROCEDURES STARTED.
