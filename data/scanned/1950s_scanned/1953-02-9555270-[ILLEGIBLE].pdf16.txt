STATEMEHT

At 1105/1, 29 Feb 53, I was standing outside the operations building at Ft. Leonard wood, Mo. when I observed a round silvery object at about 2,000 feet in altitude moving from north to south at a rapid rate of speed. The object appeared to be about 25 degrees from the vertical, reflecting sunlight, and had no visible tail or exhaust. It was followed by a similar object about 15 degrees behind the first one. Both objects moved at a constant speed without any variation in altitude and disappeared from sight in a southerly direction.
