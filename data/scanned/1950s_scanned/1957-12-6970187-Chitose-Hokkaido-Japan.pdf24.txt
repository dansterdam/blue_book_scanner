STATEMENT
16 December 1957

On the 12th of December 1957 at approximately 1815 hours I witnessed an object in the sky. An object to which I have never seen before. The size of my knowledge can best be described as a ball, so to speak, of a luminous and also dull light of the color white.
The appearance of the object was there and there for a definite purpose and it seemed to be hovering and undulating slowly may be approximately 175 yards 12 December 1957 the object appeared to gin and I witnessed this same object from the same site and once again it made the same appearance.
My opinion of the object is definitely controlled by man due to the technical approach and disappearance.
