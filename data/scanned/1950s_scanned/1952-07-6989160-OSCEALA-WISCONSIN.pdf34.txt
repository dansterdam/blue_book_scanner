FROM: Air Technical Intelligence Center 

1. In the reports referred to, it is believed that no connection actually exists between the visual and radar sightings; therefore, they would fall in the same category as many other simultaneous reports.
2. Paragraph 3 of the radar summary could logically be expanded with the following statements:’- The large amount of ground clutter on the radar indicator is consistent with anomalous (temperature and humidity conditions) weather conditions. Aircraft reported on photos marked ‘Incloure 1’ most likely are different individual stationary ground targets. The signal amplitude of ground targets that are detected due to temperature inversion and/or moisture lapse may only paint occasionally or at a random rate. When several individual targets are painting in this random manner, it is quite easy to assume that a particular stationary target has moved from one location to another, resulting in apparent speed variations from zero to several thousand miles per hour.
3. There is no new data that will allow a more complete analysis.
