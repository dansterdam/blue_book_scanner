The image appears to contain a black and white illustration of an artist's concept of an actual meteor procession. The illustration depicts a night sky with a celestial object or spacecraft in the foreground and a mountain or structure in the background. The text below the illustration discusses the phenomenon of "sundogs and moondogs," which is the reflection of the sun or moon in a layer of flat ice crystals, creating an optical illusion.

SUNDOGS AND MOONDOGS
The reflection of the sun in a layer of flat ice crystals can cause a phenomenon known as a sub-sun, commonly called a "sundog". This apparition will appear at a point adjacent to the real sun and can be brilliant as the sun itself. The sub-sun can develop a pattern of other sub-suns, causing a further complicated illusion. At night, the moon will reflect in the same manner under like meteorological conditions. This type of apparition is particularly discernible at higher altitudes.
The size and brilliance of sundogs and moondogs, and their behavior in relation to the observer's aircraft, will depend upon the location and density of the reflecting source, i.e., ice or frost-crystal formations, upon the position and movement of the aircraft. The sundog or moondog may appear to chase the aircraft or fly in formation with it. If the aircraft turns toward the illusion, it may appear to slow down, speed up, and even come toward the aircraft head-on.
Cirrus cloud formations are effective viewing screens for illusions resulting from reflected or refracted light, as they contain ice crystals. These clouds exist in the upper atmosphere, so that conditions are favorable throughout the year for sundog and moondog apparitions. However, such phenomena usually are discernible at lower levels only during winter months in temperate zones.
