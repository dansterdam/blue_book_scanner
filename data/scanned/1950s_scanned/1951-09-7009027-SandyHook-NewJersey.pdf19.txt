The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with the classification "UNCLASSIFIED" printed at the top and bottom of the page. The text on the page reads:

"This is a partial report of the investigation of the sighting of an unidentified flying object near Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on 7 September 1951. The report will be supplemented by further information as it becomes available."
