There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page of the Project Blue Book document. The document contains handwritten text that provides information about a UFO sighting in Chama, New Mexico.

The text states the following:

a. The "dude" who came to depot in Chama, New Mexico, "had accent like a Dutchman" and drove away in a Chrysler car. "Dude" had "mysterious air about him".
b. "Thousands of dollars spent on logging road in this area but road never used."
c. "Rich Texans bought up land in this area and closed it to fishing: 'No trespassing enforced.'"
d. "I see strange lights, like flash lights, moving in Los Tinos Canyon, sometimes."
e. Source impressed with fact that "Los Alamos is only 70-75 miles away".
