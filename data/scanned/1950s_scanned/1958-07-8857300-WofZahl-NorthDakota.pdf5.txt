HERALD
Dayton-on-the OHIO. MONDAY. DECEMBER 2, 1957
"VENUS--SO BRIGHT--CAUSING QUITE A STIR"
U.M.D. THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND THE POLICE STATION IN HILLSBORO RECEIVED A NUMBER OF CALLS ABOUT 7:30 P.M. LAST NIGHT (AS WELL) ASKING WHAT THE BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY MIGHT BE. MANY SAID THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRE OR THAT SOMETHING HAD CRASHED. DEPUTY SHERIFF FRANK WALTERS AND CHIEF OF POLICE ROY JONES SAID THEY KNEW IT WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL, ONLY THE PLANET VENUS, WHICH IS UNUSUALLY BRIGHT THESE DAYS.
