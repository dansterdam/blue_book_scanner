STATEMENT

At approximately 17:15 hours, 9 January 1953, I was driving home from Kelly AFB airbase where I am employed. I was driving North on Castroville Street and had just passed the intersection of Monterey and Castroville Streets when Miss [REDACTED] called our attention to something in the sky. As previously stated, I was driving so I could not give my complete attention to the object. However, I did notice that it had a rather oblong shape and had a dull whitish-gray color. Its size appeared approximately equal to that of a small bicycle wheel from about three feet distance. The object was first sighted to the West of us and was heading East at a very rapid rate of speed, faster than any ordinary aircraft I have seen. The object flew in a straight line and I could not say how it disappeared because of the difficulty of observation from my position in the car.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:
