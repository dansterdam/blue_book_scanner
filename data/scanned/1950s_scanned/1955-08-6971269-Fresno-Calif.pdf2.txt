SUMMARY (Clamp noness mitmary of report, Give significants in final one-inchelm paragraph. List deences at owners left. Begin text of report on AIR Form Ils.)
1. The following report was submitted through channels to the Chief, U. S. Weather Bureau, by I of the Weather Bureau Airport at Fresno, California:
2. On 2 August 1955, was taking the 2100Z pibai observation when a bright circular object was noted crossing the theodolite field of view. It was silver in color, such as a metallic surface would appear when reflecting sunlight. It was brighter than the white balloon. No shadows or markings were distinguishable on the object, but it was sharply outlined against the blue sky background. At the time, about 1300 PST, the balloon was in its twenty-ninth minute and approximate1y 27,000 feet above the surface. The object had an apparent diameter of about: one fourth or one-fifth of that of the five foot balloon at that height. ppeared that although he realized that size and height of such an object are interdependent and very difficult, if not impossible to judge, his impression at the time of the observation was that the object was far above the balloon and therefore would have been larger than the balloon. The object moved at a steady rate of speed and was tracked with the theodolite for about a half anute so as to get a better look at it. This resulted in losing the balloon from the field of view, so he had to return to the balloon to continue the pibal. The movement of the object across the line of sight was r d so very fast, although much faster than the slowly moving balloon, and in a different direction. Later calculations (assuming horizontal flight) of the estimated movement indicated that the object moved from the northeast at a speed of 80-130 knots if at 40,000 feet MSL, or 120-200 knots if it is 6,000 feet MSL.
CONCLUSIONS:
3. further stated that he had seen airplanes cross the the od ne d o y or below the balloon's height, or even for some distance above the balloon, and that an airplane's propeller at found have left on
