"The Unidentified Flying Objects Research Committee

March 6, 1959

Major Lawrence J. Tacker
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
Directorate of Information Services
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker:

On the evening of 24 February 1959 an American Airlines DC 6 was followed by many miles across northern Ohio and finally to Detroit by three unidentified flying objects. The pilot maintained visual contact with these objects and kept changing position relative to each other. The captain of the American DC 6 stated that the UFOs unidentified were not the ball stars in the constellation Orion.

Mention a few details in this sighting because a few AERON radio stations have announced that the Air Force has explained the objects seen in this incident. Has the Air Force released a definite explanation for this sighting?

Our committee has on file the facts that two other commercial aircraft lines flights, and both aircraft were in radio communication with each other concerning the sighting. We do not have a number of credible observers for this incident.

IF the Air Force has explained these sightings as the belt stars in the constellation Orion, I ask you for an explanation of how this is possible. Because of the facts mentioned above, which have been verified, the three lights could not have been stars. If the Air Force insists that the objects were stars and will not believe the pilots, then I suggest that the proper authorities to see that the Air Force explanation is investigated.
