Whereas the ordinary meteors are cometary fragments. There is a further discussion of this point later with reference to La Paz.

Astronomer G, whose professional rating is only moderate, has seen none.

Astronomer E, whose professional rating also is only moderate, has seen none and does not consider the problem very important. (See footnote.)

Astronomer G, with an excellent professional rating, has seen no unidentified objects but says that reports come in occasionally from the Fraser River valley northwest of Vancouver. Apparently these sightings have been concerned with lights similar to the Lubbook lights.

Astronomer H has personally sighted an unidentified object, a light which loomed across his range of vision, which was obstructed by an observatory dome, much faster than a plane and much slower than a meteor. If it had been a plane, then its rapid motion could be accounted for only by closeness, but since no motion were heard, this explanation was essentially ruled out. Light was steadier than that of a meteor and was observed for about three seconds.

Astronomer R does not ascribe any particular significance to this sighting, except as it constitutes one of the many incomplete and unexplained sightings.

Astronomer R was not reluctant to talk about the subject of flying saucers and pointed out that we must not fall into the error of believing that we understand all physical phenomena. As late as the year 1800, it was thought im-
