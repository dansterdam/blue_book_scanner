II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE WAS A NERVOUS, BUT COOPERATIVE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS PERFORMING HIS CIVIC DUTY. HE MADE NO MENTION OF THE SIGHTING TO HIS NEIGHBORS, RELATIVES OR FRIENDS. THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOT A PUBLICITY SEEKER WAS EVIDENCED BY HIS REQUEST OVER THE PHONE THAT THE INVESTIGATOR CALL AT HIS HOME IN CIVILIAN CLOTHING IN ORDER TO PREVENT ANY PUBLICITY CONCERNING THE INCIDENT.

3. THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY (30) MINUTES BEFORE DISAPPEARING. THE SKY WAS CLOUDY WITH NO MOON OR STARS VISIBLE.
4. SOURCE DESCRIBED THE OBJECTS AS BEING "THE COLOR OF A LIGHT BULB" AND THAT THEY RESEMBLED HIS CONCEPTION THAT "THERE WERE NO VISIBLE SHAFTS OF LIGHT SUPPORTING THEM." AT ALL TIMES THE OBJECTS REMAINED CONSTANT NEITHER BEING OBSTRUCTED FROM VIEW NOR FADING FROM SIGHT.
5. THE OBJECTS WERE ESTIMATED BY THE SOURCE TO BE APPROXIMATELY FIVE (5) MILES FROM HIS LOCATION (APPROXIMATELY 3,15 MILES).
6. SOURCE STATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PEA HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH.
