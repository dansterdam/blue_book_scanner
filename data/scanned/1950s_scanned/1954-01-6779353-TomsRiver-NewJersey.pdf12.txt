Report to Bluebook
on the investigation of Unidentified Aerial Objects
in the New Jersey area, night of 1 Jan 54.

J. R. Gluck 
Project Henry, PPS-161

18 February 1954 I made a phone call from New York to the
Intelligence Officer of the 558th Air Defense Group, McGuire AFB, New
Jersey, from whom ATIC had received the Form A3 on this case. A Capt.
Peterson was contacted, advised of my status on this project and of the
incident in question. He was familiar with the situation, provided full
cooperation, and asked if I would like to come down the next day.

19 February, arrived via train and bus from New York, found Capt.
Peterson, who turned me over to a Sgt. Alkire, of the 1402 AISS. A
staff car and driver were obtained and we drove to Toms River, N. J. 
Upon arrival at Toms River we went first to the police station. 
Alkire had established contact with these people before, when the initial
investigation and been conducted. The chief of police and one officer had
been among the observers. Then we proceeded to the home of Mr. & Mrs.
___, who live on ___ in Toms River, and a police car, with
the officer who had been an observer, came to meet us.

These sets of observers are neighbors, whom I would
call a better than average observer, took us across the street to the
backyard of the ___ residence, from where she had made her observations.
She pointed out the beginning and end points of the visual sightings and
two photos were taken with a Polaroid camera I had rented in New York. These
photos are Fiq. A and B. The first one, looking directly south, shows three
objects which were observed by seven people on ___. Photo B
shows the direction of flight of the objects.
