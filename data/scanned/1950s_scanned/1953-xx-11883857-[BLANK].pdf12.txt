**SUBJECT:** Briefing of ADC Forces and Divisions on Project Blue Book (Uncl)

**To:**
Commanding General  
Air Defense Command  
ATTN: LCS/I  
Ent Air Force Base  
Colorado Springs, Colorado  

1. During a visit to Headquarters Air Defense Command on 16 October 1952, Capt Edward J. Ruppelt of ATIC discussed with Col Burgess the feasibility of briefing all Air Defense Forces and divisions on Project Blue Book. Since this visit the subject has been given more study and it is believed that such a series of briefings would be highly advantageous. Similar briefings have been given to various Air Force units and have resulted in a better understanding of the objectives and operations of the project and in more efficient, accurate reporting. By presenting such briefings, many insignificant, nebulous reports can be eliminated while the significant reports will be more complete and contain more usable data.

2. The proposed plan for the briefings would be first to present the briefing to Hq ADC, if this is desired. A tour would then be made through each Air Defense Force area, briefing first the Air Division and then the separate Air Divisions. At the division level, selected personnel from each unit subordinate to the division (i.e. ADC squadrons, fighter interceptor squadrons, etc.) would be called in for the briefing; if the division is a tenant organization on the base, persons other than ADC personnel with official interest could be cleared by the division commander and invited to attend. The number of people to be briefed would be limited only by the available space and security. The classification of the briefing will be Secret. The briefing in general will consist of:

a. A brief history of Project Blue Book.  
b. The philosophy of the project.  
c. Methods of quickly gathering data using available facilities at an air base.  
d. How a preliminary analysis of reports can be made in the field.  
e. Preparation of a report for forwarding to ATIC and Hq USAF.  
f. How ATIC processes FLYOBRPTS.
