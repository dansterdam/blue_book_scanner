No case (Information Only)
10 July 1956
Washington, Indiana

Case 172. Washington, Indiana, July 10, 1956 - Frank Edwards of WTTV, Indianapolis sent CRIFO the following information which appeared in the Washington Daily Times:

"A Washington, Indiana man reported he saw a bright, shiny, disc-like object hover above the trees near his home about 10:35 PM. He said the object was about 20 feet in diameter, emitting a bright red light. It hovered for a few seconds and then shot straight up and disappeared. No sound was heard."

We quote this as a good case because: 1) It was seen by a man when awake and looking out of the window; 2) It showed the characteristic hovering and then rapid ascent typical of many UFO reports; 3) The sighting lasted for a few seconds only, eliminating the possibility of misidentification.

The witness was sober, the night clear, no clouds and the object was under close observation through binoculars. Its size, shape, color and speed of departure clearly indicate a technological device and not a natural phenomenon. There were two or three smaller lights beside the main object and these were reported to move erratically. The direction of departure was to the northeast and the angle of ascent was higher and faster than any known aircraft.
