The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Analysis of Photographic Material

No details can be recognized on the images of the objects, i.e. no structure of any kind, no color fringes, no shapes, even under a high power microscope. (The images are definitely round white dots, except a few which were self-luminous). This is likely as a result of camera motion blur. The sun is known to have been to the left of the objects, as evidenced by shadows on the film.

There is no conclusive evidence that they were self-luminous because at no time were they seen against the prevailing sunlight.

Several additional pertinent pieces of information were learned from Mr. X in telephone conversations on March 17 and March 28, 1955, to wit:

The reverse bearing types employed were equipped with a telephonic lens of 3 1/2 inches in focal length and operated at 16 frames/second. He noticed no surface wind to speak of at the time, presumably due to the meteorological conditions.

An aerial photograph of the ball park showing the grain elevation was obtained, but it was of indifferent quality (Figure 2).

With the knowledge of the focal length and frame spread, the transverse components of the distance and velocity of the objects can be computed to their altitude and distance from the observer (for the objects at the start of filming). Assuming the altitude to be 1,745 the total velocity can be similarly correlated. Since only angular distance from one station are available for measurements, the actual range at any one time cannot be determined.

If the objects' initial distance was_____________, their altitude was _______________, their transverse velocity was ______________, and their total velocity was _______________ (assuming 1,745 heading).

Incidental information presently available comprises the following: Great Falls, Montana is situated on the Upper Missouri River, just east of the Rocky Mountains at latitude 47° 30' and longitude 111° 18'. Altitude is 3,357 feet.

Azimuth and altitude of the sun were computed utilizing references (1) and (2) listed at the end of this report.
