INCIDENT NO 6â€”On the night of January 25, 1953, a group of Civil Aeronautics Administration employees and security guards at the Continental Divide radar station, New Mexico, observed a very bright, reddish-white object moving erratically over the area. The object was first picked up on radar and then visually sighted. As the object moved behind a hill and then reappeared, radar showed it was traveling at a speed of 1,200 miles per hour to a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet. The object then stopped, hovered for a while, and then moved steadily almost directly into the wind.
