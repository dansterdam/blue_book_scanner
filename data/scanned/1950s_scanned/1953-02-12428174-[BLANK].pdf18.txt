There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text found in the document is as follows:

to attempt to determine whether or not there is any common pattern in the sightings but we have had no success in finding any such pattern. The statistical study made by ATIC was made on cross-index cards with 16 items, such as a reported shape, a reported direction, color, etc., being cross-indexed in an attempt to find a pattern, but we found none. In order to make a more detailed study, and since it is very difficult to handle 2,000 reports on cross-index cards, an IBM study is now being made on this same cross-indexed material. 50 items will be placed on the IBM cards. These items will be cross-correlated and any patterns should be apparent. This has not yet been completed. The results we will obtain will possibly help us in the future planning for the project.

Why Continue the Project
Two points that are of interest but are not in themselves greatly significant are plots of the distribution of our unknown sightings and a plot of the frequency of reports. A definition of the term "unknown" will be given later.

(Slide of Location of Unknowns)
You will notice that the unknown reports do tend to cluster around critical areas in the United States. One explanation might be that the people in these areas are aware of the fact that they are in a critical area and are more aware of unusual things.

(Slide on Frequency of Reports)
A plot of the frequency of reports shows a series of peaks in July of each year. We cannot account for this. Some people have offered the explanation that there is better weather in July, more clear skies. We have checked this and there seems to be no correlation.

The question arises then, why does the Air Force continue this project? I might state now that the Air Force is continuing this project, is taking a great
