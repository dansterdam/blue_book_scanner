I have served as Chief Observer of a Civilian Defense Aircraft Observation Post in Penbrook, Pa. from 1943 to 1955. During this time there were many aircraft reported by other observers. The object I observed became a separate problem to investigate. It did not become lost in the many other aircraft I have observed over the years. The speeds, directions of flight, and altitudes were not the normal air traffic that I am used to seeing. This object was highly maneuverable, alternating between hovering and rapid motion. The light of the object was highly intense and brillant, but not the steady glow of any known aircraft. The color was a brilliant white with some blue-green around the edges. The observations lasted several minutes and the object finally disappeared very rapidly. The experience left me quite shaken and disturbed by what I had witnessed, as this was no normal aircraft.
