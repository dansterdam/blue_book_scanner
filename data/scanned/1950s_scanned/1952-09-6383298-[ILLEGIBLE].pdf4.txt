Bukiting. Sat.	

	Membere of an operatic concert audience near Bukiting last night reported seeing a brightly illuminated semi-circular object travelling at great speed and high altitude from west to east at about 19.15 hours.

     The object was visible for about 10 seconds. It was preceded by a screeching noise which lasted three seconds.

     This is the second occasion that a phenomenon of this type has been seen in recent weeks.
