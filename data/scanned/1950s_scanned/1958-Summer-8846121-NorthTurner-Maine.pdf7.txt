The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in North Turner, Maine.

Place: Irish Street, Turner, Maine

Night: The moon was almost overhead and bright - no clouds that I can recall.

After: It was over, and we had settled down - a few days later - it was decided to keep the whole thing and not talk to anyone about it. People who have ever seen such things will understand, but those who have not, are very quick to ridicule.

My sister had gone out to her car for something - I can't remember if I went with her or if my step-father went with her. She noticed the low-flying lights first. We then saw a plane was in trouble, but could hear no motor. After watching a minute or so, and making sure they were not going away, I naturally thought the plane was gliding in and about to crash. The phone was right inside the front door - I called the operator and asked for the Air Force. They told me there was no plane reported in that area - while we were talking, my sister and step-father were shouting to me the direction the lights were moving. They changed directions several times. I was connected with the Civil Defense and they made a note of it.

While my sister had the field glasses most of the time, I could not see as clearly as she. I did think it odd that the lights moved as erratically as they did. They moved from the right side of the field and moved to the left - very unevenly. We thought they had gone away, but still watched. Soon other lights came and those we saw the lights - now two rows of lights move off.

The lot of the lights - a kind of bluish white that penetrated a long way. A "row" of something red was in the first lights. The lights did not blink - they pulsated. (Movement reminds me of the way a squid moves in water).
