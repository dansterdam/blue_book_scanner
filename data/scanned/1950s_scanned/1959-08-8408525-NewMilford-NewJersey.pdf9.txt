OFFICER, HQ, NEW YORK ADS, MCGUIRE AFB, N.J. A CHECK OF AIR FORCE
BASES IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING INDICATED THAT NO WEATHER BALLONS 
HAD BEEN RELEASED IN THE AREA AND TIME UNDER QUEST ION. HOWEVER,
SINCE THE WINDS WERE FROM 290 TO 310 DEGREES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A
BALOON FROM SOME OTHER BASE TO THE WEST OF THE SITELOCAITION MAY
HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE.
