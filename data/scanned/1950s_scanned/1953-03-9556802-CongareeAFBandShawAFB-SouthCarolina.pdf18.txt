Dear First Lieutenant:

Thank you for your letter and comments. I too think that we are getting some genuinely interesting data on various types of unidentified flying objects. The truly unknown cases with their peculiar behavior are of course principal interest. We should in time be able to separate the wheat from the chaff as unimportant or natural phenomena are more definitely identified and eliminated.

We should in time be able to set up some important tests to demonstrate these phenomena with their real properties. This can only be done by selecting proper cases and having the necessary cooperation of those who are in contact with the actual occurrences. 

I note that you will continue with your work and that we can have occasional meetings.

Well, here, we are on this watch of 16 March. Of the 12 cases in this report, Bacon, J. has a few that are distinctly different. Two show a rise and sudden disappearance and reporting to the same instant. One shows the Venua case as nearly so (Second Centralia). And the rest of the cases seem most probable to have been some natural phenomenon such as St. Elmo's fire, and 7 March seem most probable to have been some unusual natural phenomenon at Shaw AFB.

I am sending you a copy of this report. As you may be interested in some of the more important cases, the most important at present seem to be the data and reports from Congaree AFB and Shaw AFB on the night of 7 March.

I will be looking forward to our next meeting.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
J. Allen Hynek
Director
