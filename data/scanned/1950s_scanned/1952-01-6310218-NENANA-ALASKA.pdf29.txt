At approximately 10202Z, 22 January 1952, Radar site P-2 made an original contact with an unidentified aircraft in the vicinity of Nenana, Alaska. The target clearly but on a plan of 183° at a distance of approx 3700 yards instead of P-2's normal radar scope and disappearance of target, the normal radar contact of 10,000 to 15,000 knots was lost.

At 10302Z an F-94 (pilot, Lt G.S. Garrett) radar operator, Capt V.D. Rainey was airborne and vectored to intercept. For a short time the aircraft was visible to the pilot, but because of the existing conditions no attack was made. The aircraft was a patrol mission along the Alaskan Range.

At approximately 10202Z when the aircraft was acquired by radar contact, it then commenced a violent evasive action and disappeared from the radar scope. After a chase of 1 1/2 minutes to aircraft and moving at a high rate of speed, no attempt was made to vector the aircraft.

At approximately 10202Z while the aircraft was en route to Ladd Air Force Base, the radar operator acquired an additional radar target ahead and low (approximately 24,000 feet altitude), the pilot made an intercept with this 20,000 yards the target at a good radar scope. During the tracking the target's speed was better than 1000 knots.

At 200 yards the pilot reported on visual over the apparent target location. Aircraft speed to the run was approximately 250 knots indicated. After passing over the target, without seeing anything further, radar contact or visual sighting, the pilot could not close on the target and the mission was abandoned.

During this time the F-94 had no other target visible. The F-94 landed at 12252Z. The weather in the Fairbanks area during this period was extremely cold, with the possibility of light visibility as much as 30°.

A pilot and a ground observer reported that appeared to be a comet or meteor to the immediate east of their position at approximately 10202Z.

On 23 January 1952, from 10202Z to 11102, the same F-94 (pilot, Lt R.R. Dement) made two separate intercept attempts but was unsuccessful to gain visual or radar contact. It was indicated that on 22 January 1952 radar contact was made to at approximately 10202Z, but because of the high speed (over 1700 knots) at which time the target disappeared. The overriding speed was more than 100 knots.

After radar contact was lost, a further search was made in this area. Contact was not made, either by radar or visual. The weather conditions unlimited; the pilot reports that the Aurora Borealis was very active and in his opinion hampered the tracking.

At approximately 10202Z, 23 January 1952, a test check on the aircraft utilizing its radar equipment, but with negative results, indicated that the radar set functioned normally. The failure of the radar contact cannot be explained or evaluated.

The pilot's comment that the speed of the aircraft he observed appears to be unusual and that in his opinion it was unlikely that a present time aircraft could obtain such a high rate of speed for any worthwhile purpose. UNCLASSIFIED.
