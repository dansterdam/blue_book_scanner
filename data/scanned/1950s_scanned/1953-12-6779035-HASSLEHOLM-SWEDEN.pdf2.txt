"The unknown object observed this afternoon in the air in the neighborhood of Hassleholm, and which appeared and disappeared, Captain C. Johnson of the Trans Air Sweden Company told the Swedish telegraph service tonight. The first message which indicated the strange object described by the Defense Staff in a communique this evening. The object was also observed by his mechanism, Ole Johannson.
"It was something new I saw. Of that there is no doubt," he said, "who served in the BAF during the war of a career about 30 years from North Africa and Italy. "Suddenly, on my right, I saw something which I first thought was a narrow silhouette approaching with tremendous speed. I immediately warned my only passenger, Johansson, the mechanism. I had only four seconds in which to make my observations. Then the strange body came nearer I could see it was a metallic, silvery round or oblong celestial body. It proceeded below our aircraft without leaving any trace of gas or condensation. It was definitely not a meteor or other celestial body." It was about 60 to 70 meters below our aircraft at a height of 1,600 meters at the most.
"When I had seen the thing for about four seconds it disappeared under the none of our plane. But it had a better downward and rear-spoiled, could follow it for a further five seconds," Captain ------.
It was erroneously reported in our 1800 news bulletin that the object was observed for six to seven minutes. It should have been six to seven seconds.
