Report of a UTO (Unidentified Technical Object)
at 11:20 P.M. on May 13, 1959. it was walking near the
south side of the town. It was about 6 to 7 feet tall. 
and saw a rounded shape on it and it started making
a noise and then going up in the sky. I would estimate it
was about 15 to 25 feet across and 10 to 15 feet high. 
It was a luminous white-green color and it was hovering
about 15 feet above the ground when it took off.

Major Maund, AISS
Dear Major,
Thank you for indicating the above as the report sent to 
me. Also I agree that this is the writer's statement as it
correlates with my interview. I would appreciate if the
report is classified and not consider it a request,  as I
do not wish any publicity or being referred as a witness.

Sincerely,
