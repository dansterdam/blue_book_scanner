Spot Intelligence Report - 7 Nov 50. subject: Reports of Unconventional Aircraft.

The Peyton said he got a pocket telescope and watched the saucer-like object hover over the railroad tracks. The object did not hurry, it took its time and disappeared from sight in about five minutes. After it had disappeared, the vapor trail appeared to be red and then bluish.

The Peyton said that there were two of them things over the tractor shed and they were long and round like a cigar.

The following letter was printed in the New Orleans Times-Picayune of 18 October 1950:
"Editor, The Times-Picayune - I read again this morning of these pilots who didn't believe in "flying saucers" but who actually saw them and now believe.
"Some time ago a soldier in Arizona said he saw a rocket ship 75 to 100 feet long that solidier that he wasn't seeing things because I believe I saw it too.
"You see it was this way. Back in 1947 we were out on the landing strip. It was just before midnite. I was lying on my back on the top step of the sidewall when I had the feeling that somebody was staring at me. I looked over and saw a strange object pass over me, but nobody was looking at me, but they were all gazing up at the sky and they couldn't have seen me there.
"All of a sudden I looked up at the sky and there was this object. It looked to me at the moment like a star. What was strange it kept my eyes on it and called to the others to look at it. But all of a sudden it made a darting movement and then another and they were saying "Did you see that" and we could hardly believe our eyes. Each time it took a darting movement it traveled a little way with the first puff, but with the second puff it traveled quite a distance."
