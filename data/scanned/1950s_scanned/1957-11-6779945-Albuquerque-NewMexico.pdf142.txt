On the night of November 6, 1957, at about 11:20 p.m., a citizen residing near the Albuquerque, New Mexico, International Airport observed a bright light moving across the sky. This light appeared to be round in shape and seemed to be emitting a reddish glow. The object was estimated to be about thirty miles east of Albuquerque. This incident occurred on November 6, 1957. When the object was first observed it was moving at a very high rate of speed. It then descended rapidly and hovered over the airport area for a few seconds. The object then moved rapidly to the northeast and was lost from sight. The witness stated this was definitely not an aircraft or helicopter, and that he had observed airplanes and satellites on many occasions. The witness was a well-known and respected member of the local community. The object was observed by a Sergeant stationed at the 1608th Air Police Squadron at the Kirtland Air Force Base. Radar tracking indicated the presence of a target in the vicinity of the Albuquerque International Airport, at the time the object was observed visually. No explanation has been determined for this sighting and it is considered a valid unidentified flying object incident.
