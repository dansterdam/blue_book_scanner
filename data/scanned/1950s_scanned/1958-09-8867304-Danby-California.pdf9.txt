STATEMENT

        Around the end of September two other men and I were standing at Richelieu's Mill talking about prospecting when we noticed a glow in the direction of Clipper Kent. We watched the glow for a while and then it disappeared. Later that night we talked about it and decided to watch for it the next day. The next day it appeared again at the same time. We knew there was nothing metallic in that area and thought it might be an airplane because of its metallic glow. Mr. __ took his telescope and looked at it, and spotted it on the hillside. We drove as far as possible and walked for three or four hours in the general area. The exact spot was on a line from RR Danby northwest over Route 66 Danby. We aligned ourselves with two fixed places and searched but could not find evidence of the objects. I remembered a few days later that the objects were visible almost every day in the same area so a friend and I investigated further. We used a powerful pair of binoculars and watched the glow. We noticed guy wires coming from it and looked closer and saw rods radiating from the guy wires. We remembered that mill radio antennas of the California Highway Patrol were at Route 66 Danby and determined that the sun cast a reflection on the antennas and that that was what we were looking at all the time and that was why we could find no evidence in the foothills. We did not report this information and thought the whole thing had been solved.
