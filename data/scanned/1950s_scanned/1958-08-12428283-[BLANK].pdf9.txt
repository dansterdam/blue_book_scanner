The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

As requested, here is the text from the document:

17. In early 1955, five books written on "Flying saucers" were published. To date, over 30 have been published and have received wide circulation here and abroad.

18. Up to now, six motion pictures in circulation having "flying saucers" as their theme have been produced. One such motion picture was released in May 1956 and is still receiving some publicity. The main plot of this movie is centered around two colored film strips of so-called "flying saucers." These film strips were previously submitted to the Air Force for examination, and consist primarily of moving spots of light against a blue sky. Our conclusions were that the objects in one film were aircraft and in the other, see galls. These conclusions were corroborated by an independent study made by the research organization of an aircraft manufacturer of very high standing, as well as by the CIA scientific panel which I previously mentioned.

19. With very few exceptions, both these self-appointed organizations and the books published, have been highly critical of the Air Force's handling of the UFO matter. They all exhibit a tendency to misconstrue and exaggerate.
