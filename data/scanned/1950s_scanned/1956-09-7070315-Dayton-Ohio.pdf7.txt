Memo for Record 
Subject: UFO Report for Mr. Oscar G. Adams
Dayton, Ohio

1. Telephoned Mr. Campene in Dayton whether Burnet became. Was informed that a balloon was launched at about the same time as Mr. Adams observed.

2. Further, and most important, Mr. Coy stated that they had trouble with the instrument. He believes quite strongly that the noise was nothing more than a sure 15,000 feet, and the radio sonde died out unexpectedly, something they lost it completely, something about 45 release.

3. Mr. Campene added that it could have some down in the Dayton area, so this seems to clarify minutely.
