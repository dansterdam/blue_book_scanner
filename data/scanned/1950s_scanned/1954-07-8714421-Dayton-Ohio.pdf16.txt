This interpreter, Headquarters 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, Sixteenth years Air Force Service, ten years experience as a Radar-Photo Interpreter, seven years as a Bombing Range Director, and other duties in Radar Operations. On 8 July 1954 Captain Spahn's sighting, a five aircraft cell of B-36 aircraft passed within 40 NM of the reported sighting and saw nothing. Two of these five aircraft were doing radar weather search. We have conducted typhoon radar reconnaissance both as a photo-interperter and photo interpreter and have not observed any unusual scope returns. However, until now I have not observed a return such as presented here. Sometimes interference presents unexplainable patterns, likewise the detected signals showed. This persistent number is of the same type as presented by a radar reflector target such as target 35 at Eglin Air Force Base Bombing Range. The symmetry of the seven individual returns and the stability of the target over the minutes would indicate a good radar-reflective substance and eliminate the possibility of a saturated cloud formation. The shape of the individual returns are not common to clouds. However, it does resemble in general pattern cover echo returns on the scope.

The outside diameter of the circle is approximately 150 nautical miles, using the 10 NM range markers as a base. The size of the individual returns is difficult to determine because a metallic object 20 feet to 200 feet in diameter would give the same scope return.
