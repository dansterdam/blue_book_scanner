The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document dated July 24, 1951, providing information about a UFO sighting that occurred at White Sands, New Mexico on July 7, 1951. The document discusses a letter from an unnamed "UFO reporter" requesting information, as well as a quote from Major Keyhoe concerning the sighting.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
24 July 1951
White Sands, New Mexico

[Redacted]

1. Attached is a copy of a letter from Mr. [Redacted] requesting information on two UFO reports.

2. Mr. [Redacted] is quoting Major Keyhoe concerning a sighting which was supposed to have occurred at White Sands, New Mexico, on 14 July 1951. A thorough search of the Project Blue Book files indicates that such a sighting was not reported to the Air Force by the Military Intelligence Service.

The remaining text appears to discuss the lack of a file on the reported sighting mentioned by Major Keyhoe and the intent to provide any such information that may exist to the Air Force.
