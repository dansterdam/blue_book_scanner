AIR FORM 112 - PART II 
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DATE: 8 September 1952
PLACE: Norwalk, Conn.
TIME: 1900 (EST) 

1. On 8 September 1952, Mr. T. P. (full name deleted), a resident of Norwalk, Conn., reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object. Mr. T. P. stated to this investigator that on the evening of 8 September 1952, at approximately 1900 (EST), he and his wife observed a lighted object in the sky which he could not identify. Mr. T. P. stated that the object appeared to be oval in shape and was traveling at a high rate of speed. He stated that the object was at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet and was traveling in a northeasterly direction. Mr. T. P. said that the object was visible for approximately 15 seconds and that it appeared to change color from white to orange as it proceeded on its course. He stated that the object made no sound and that he was unable to determine the size of the object.

2. On 8 September 1952, the reporting officer contacted the Federal Aviation Administration and was advised that there were no scheduled flights or known air traffic in the Norwalk area at the time of the reported sighting. The FAA was unable to offer any explanation for the reported object.

3. This case is of interest due to the fact that the witness is a reliable person and the description of the object is similar to many other unidentified flying object reports. However, due to the lack of physical evidence and the inability to determine the size, altitude, and speed of the object, no conclusive determination can be made as to the nature of the reported sighting.
