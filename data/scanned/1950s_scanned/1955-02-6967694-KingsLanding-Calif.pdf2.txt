"Pissa, as witness statement or interrogation of a witness' statement of a communication reported from Otis Air Force Base.

The witness stated that on February 16, 1955 while on duty on the radar scope at Kings Landing, California, he observed an unidentified flying object on the radar screen. The object was traveling at a speed of approximately 2,000 miles per hour and was traveling in a northeasterly direction. The object was approximately 15 miles off the coast and was observed for approximately 1 minute and 15 seconds. The object was observed to make a 90 degree turn and travel in a southwesterly direction at the same speed. The object then made another 90 degree turn and traveled in a northeasterly direction at the same high rate of speed. The object then disappeared from the radar scope. The weather at the time was clear and visibility was good. There was no known aircraft in the area at the time which could have accounted for the object observed.

On February 17, 1955 the witness was interviewed by an Intelligence Officer of the U.S. Air Force and a written statement was obtained. The witness was considered to be a reliable and competent observer. The object was estimated to be approximately the size of a small aircraft. There was no sound or trail associated with the object. The observer stated that the object made three 90 degree turns which he considered unusual for a normal aircraft. He further stated that the object's speed was far in excess of any known aircraft at that time."
