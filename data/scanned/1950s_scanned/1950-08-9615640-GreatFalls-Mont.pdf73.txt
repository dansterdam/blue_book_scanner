9. Personal opinion expressed by interrogators: "This is the third or fourth time I have interviewed Mr. -------. At all times he was polite and completely cooperative. His only objective was to report what he believed to be a fact. He appeared sincere in his statement and actions. He was removed when the film was originally sent the Air Force. Despite this, he has been most cooperative and all reports on him appear to be honest and sincere beliefs."
