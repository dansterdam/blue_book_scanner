On the 8th of August 1952, an unknown target appeared on radar for about 7 minutes. It was tracked on visual observation also, and it traveled at a speed of 700 to 800 miles per hour. Two subsequent plots established a track on a heading of 200 degrees, with a speed estimated at 900 to 1200 knots. This track did not have the appearance of a track normally plotted by this station. USAF was notified and the information was passed on to ATIC.

The target found it a course of 25 to 30 miles, and maneuvered on a heading of 20 degrees. The operators plotted the track to confirm range, on the same heading, and at the same speed mentioned above.

The entire maintenance crew on duty at the time witnessed the incident, and did not believe the target to be interference from any other station.
