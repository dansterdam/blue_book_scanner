The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with text describing an evaluation of a lens or object.

WAIKIKI, HAWAII
JUNE 15, 1959

Evaluation: Sun striking the lens, possibly with water droplets on the lens element, is the most reasonable explanation for the image. The series of lenslike spots ranging across the frame is an additional reason to support sun flares.
