21. HAS ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION (DUCTING EFFECTS) BEEN OBSERVED TO EXTEND THE RANGE OF THE GROUND CLUTTER OF THIS RADAR AT THIS SITE? YES NO
COMMENTS: 

22. WAS ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION (DUCTING EFFECT) EXTENDING THE RANGE OF THE GROUND CLUTTER AT THE TIME THE TARGET WAS OBSERVED? YES NO
COMMENTS:

23. HOW DID THE TARGET APPEAR IN SIZE AND SHAPE AS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT TARGETS? IT WAS MUCH LARGER

24. PERFORMANCE OF TARGET:
a. REMAINED CONSTANT IN SIZE
