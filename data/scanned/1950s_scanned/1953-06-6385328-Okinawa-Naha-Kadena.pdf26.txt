DECODED

FROM: AFOIN-ATTA-7-3-53

Reference basic FLYOBJECT A99871 on unidentified object seen through theodolite Okinawa 211900I June 1953. Several questions arise in the analysis by ATIC on subject sighting. 1) Request estimate of azimuth and elevation readings from theodolite, including azimuth and elevation readings from both Naha and Kadena for possible triangulation. 2) Was theodolite at Naha or Kadena? 3) How many observers were at each place? 4) Your message states the object was 'viewed overhead, but from which point?'

ATIC believes that local helicopter activity may account for the sighting. Request you investigate this possibility.

In reply cite Project Blue Book.
