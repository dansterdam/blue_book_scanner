Text transcribed from the image:

I felt inside the road, & got the impression it was someone coming along. It seemed to me they were trying to blind me with a light. Something huge, light (like a big spotlight light) directly in my face. I am not sure if it actually came. I felt the vibration from the obstacle and sensible to find my voice, I ducked down near a snowbank. I felt the warmth pass over me more than I noticed up terminal and saw the string of its glow as it went over the woods on the other side of the road in a northerly direction. The light was mostly white to expect one when it about.
