AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE: 2 4605D AKS 02-OCt-o-55
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, that 21 . son was possibly caused by a radiosonde type weather balloon. This recovery of the balloon flight was definitely established.
The recovery of the flight was accomplished seconds ahead of the parachute and radiosonde equipment still attached. When the balloon reached its highest altitude and started descending again with the parachute and radiosonde equipment still attached, the air was still escaping from balloon and was probably descended again. This may account for the additional sighting observed prior to the final disappearance.

If the above hypothesis may render some explanation of the initial sighting, it is difficult to determine or explain how this target was observed again and then abruptly disappeared into obscurity in the NW.
A definite factor to be remembered is the size and characteristics of the observers. The idea of having seen the initial sighting and subsequent release of the parachute may possibly have stimulated imaginations, resulting in reporting more than was actually there.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the recovery of the parachute and radiosonde equipment definitely established that the first sighting was generated by a radiosonde type weather balloon. Subsequent sightings can conceivably be attributed to the same of the sighting and the still attached parachute and radiosonde equipment on the descending balloon.
