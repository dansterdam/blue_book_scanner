The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book with text discussing the visible portion of a satellite's passage. I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

The visible portion of each passage is shown as a solid line, and its dashed extension represents the non-visible portion of general visibility. Each of the cross bars on the satellite path represent a minimum or a maximum of travel, so that the time of the satellite's passage over any point can be readily determined.
The visible path departs the station at a certain altitude and reappears at the horizon at a lesser altitude. In addition to the twilight boundary, the complete area within which the satellite may be seen, as a function of its height.
In spite of the relative simplicity of the diagram, its constructions incorporates the following factors, which give it a reasonably good degree of accuracy:
(1) Inclination of the orbit.
(2) Period or speed of the satellite - this affects the time markings on the satellite path.
(3) Eccentricity and true anomaly. Corrections for these factors further refine the time intervals.
(4) Height of the satellite. Distances of visibility and location of the earth's shadow depend on this factor.
(5) Rotation of the earth. This affects the long-side or the sub-satellite points.
(6) Regression of the ascending node. This correction further locates the points over which the satellite will pass.
(7) Changes in the coordinates of perigee. Correction for side to the accuracy of the height and period adjustments.
(8) Changes in the declination of the sun. This revision updates the twilight time limits and position of the earth's shadow.
