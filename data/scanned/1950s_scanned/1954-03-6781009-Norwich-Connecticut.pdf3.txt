SOME OBSERVERS SAW WHAT RESEMBLED 'JET BLAST' COMING FROM THE OBJECT
COMMENTS: 'The observers, 4 in number, observed an object which they described as a 'blast or discharge or exhaust from the object, resembling a jet blast.' This object was not a balloon, and the object was seen at the same time.

The last witness to contact me was one of a group of men in communications connections who witnessed the sighting. AMONG THESE MEN WERE SOME WHO WERE PILOTS, FORMER PILOTS AND ENGINEERS of some kind. This group was sure the object was not a balloon.
IT CONCLUSION FROM ABOVE FACTS NOTED IS THAT OBJECT WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT A BALLOON. THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS A MISSILE.
