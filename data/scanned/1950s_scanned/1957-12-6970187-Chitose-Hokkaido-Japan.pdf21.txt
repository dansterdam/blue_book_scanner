TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

STATEMENT

16 December 1957

At approximately 1310I, 12 December 1957, MSgt. Dickerson called me by telephone informing me of the existence of "something" in the sky and requesting I attempt to get a picture of the object. I apparently sighted the object a few minutes after while standing in front of the mess hall. At my first observation I noted a light which appeared to be stationary. Shortly, the object started to move in a northerly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. The object appeared to have the same intensity as that of a burning magnesium. I felt that I could discern a slight movement of a large pendulum, however I was unable to time a definite pendulum swing. The object approached the size of a large streetlight. There appeared to be the area of the object and a luminous glow surrounding the object extending over the Sea of Japan across Tsugaru Strait. I observed the object from behind Building T-25, and in the POL area on receiver hill. During these observations I noted that the object was becoming lower on the horizon and that the intensity of the object was not so great as when I originally sighted the object. I was unable to draw any realistic conclusions from my observations as to what or where the object was.
