STATEMENT

On approximately 27 February 1953 at approximately 2000I an object was observed in the sky outside a medium sized city. The object appeared too large and too close to the earth to be a star. Two policemen observed the object which appeared to be metallic and somewhat elliptical in shape. The object hovered stationary for some time and then began to move in an erratic manner, sometimes appearing to move rapidly, then stopping and even reversing its course. The object would also make sharp turns and change direction unexpectedly. The object gradually moved up and away until it was out of sight. After watching the object for some time, the witnesses could not determine its nature or what it might be.
