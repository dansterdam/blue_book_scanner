The image appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image contains two maps depicting the polar areas, as well as a legend with various aeronautical symbols.

However, the image does not contain any photographs. It is composed entirely of text and maps.
