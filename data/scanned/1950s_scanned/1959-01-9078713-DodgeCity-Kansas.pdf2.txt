The image contains two sketches. The first one shows a curved line and instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer last saw it.

The second sketch shows two smaller scenes. The one on the left depicts a road leading towards a town or city in the distance. The one on the right shows a silhouetted figure standing in front of a curved landscape.
