The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Extracted text from the document:

"If a local area chart is not available, roughly sketch in the area of the incident showing latitude and longitude. Then plot the flight path of your aircraft and the flight path of the object. Put in prominent landmarks as necessary."
