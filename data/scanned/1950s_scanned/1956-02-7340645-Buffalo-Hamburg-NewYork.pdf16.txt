III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
The SOURCE was working at Ben Otto Motors on the corner of Clark and McKinley Parkway, Hamburg, New York. On Mar 56, he noticed a bright, silver colored object in the sky. He immediately observed the object for some time, as it appeared to be a "circular" shaped object with no visible means of propulsion, and hovering in a stationary position in the sky.
The night was clear with scattered clouds and a slight breeze. The object was observed to be oscillating or swinging with a pendulum-like motion due west from the observer's location. Object appeared to be approximately 100 yards in diameter, and was described as being without any details, except for a slight flatness on the bottom.
The object appeared to stand still to him, but never suddenly accelerated in any direction. After being observed for several seconds, the object began slowly accelerating to the north and disappeared from observation.
Observation was made over a period of one and one-quarters hours, but was actually seen for only thirty minutes due to cloud obstructions at various times. Similar observations had been made by others during the past.
