There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was an investigation conducted by the United States Air Force into unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
Can't describe the motion

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and viewed from the same distance?
(Circle One): a. Head of a pin, b. Pea, c. Dime, d. Nickel, e. Quarter, f. Silver dollar, g. Baseball, h. Grapefruit, i. Basketball, j. Other

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.)
a. Certain, b. Fairly certain, c. Not very sure, d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, of what you see, or of what you would like for you to imagine, describe in your own words a seen object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as what you observed.

The witness was unable to describe the motion of the object, and the other questions indicate the witness was asked to provide details about the size and appearance of the observed object, as well as how it disappeared from view, and to describe a hypothetical object that would have a similar appearance.
