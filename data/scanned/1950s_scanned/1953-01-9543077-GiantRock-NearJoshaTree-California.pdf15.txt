It is convenient, it would be appreciated if you would send us the name and address of any other people who reported the same observation to you. In order to make the best evaluation of the incident, it is desirable to obtain such additional information regarding the sightings.

Your action in reporting your observation is greatly appreciated.

Yours very truly,
