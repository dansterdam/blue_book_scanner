MAY EXPLAIN CRATER
'Shooting Stars' Seen
By Two Men At Dillon
DILLON, S. C. Aug. 1 (/P) â€” The reports were made by two persons that they had seen two objects falling from the sky about 9 p.m. Thursday.
These objects, the reports said, resembled "shooting stars" and were observed as they fell to the ground near Dillon. One witness said his attention was attracted by a "huge crater" found near Dillon shortly after the incident.
Sheriff Pete Rogers has speculated that the objects may have been caused by lightning, but stated that an analysis would be made by Clemson College.
