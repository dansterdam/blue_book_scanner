Dear
Reference is made to your further expression of interest as to the Secretary of the Air Force letter of 21 April 1950 in behalf of Mr. --------- Paragraph 1 concerning the investigation of unidentified flying objects. In view of your further interest in this matter and the affidavit under date of 19 October 1959, Langley, Virginia, lighting of 28 October 1959, information received on this matter from ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio who purportedly sighted the unidentified objects, it was however, determined by the Air Force that the object sighted on 28 October 1959 did not constitute a threat to the security of this country.

This information is offered to clarify paragraph 3 of Colonel Carl M. Hathaway's letter of 18 March 1960.

It was advised that the information contained in the affidavit concerning the sighting-on 28 October 1959 at Langley, Virginia was not considered of sufficient significance to warrant further investigation, and since the reports are not considered of sufficient significance, the matter was dropped. No one else in the area reported this sighting, the matter was dropped.

NOTE: The Air Force does not deny that unidentified objects have been sighted. During the past twelve-year period, the Air Force contends that when the verifications of these sightings have been established, they have been fully explained, identified, and did not constitute a threat to the security of this country.
