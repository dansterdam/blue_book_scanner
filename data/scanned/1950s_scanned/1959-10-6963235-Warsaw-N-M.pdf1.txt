    Four star-shaped bright lights, size of a half                                   
    dollar, white & red. Two formed as a pair,
    the other two scattered. Red color appeared 
    as a tail appearing & disappearing.                  

    COMMENTS
    Atmospheric conditions were such as
    to cause a superior mirage. Soundings
    indicated that there was a sharp inv
    at the 4,000 ft level. Source unknown 
    however lights attributed to a superior
    mirage due to the inversion.
