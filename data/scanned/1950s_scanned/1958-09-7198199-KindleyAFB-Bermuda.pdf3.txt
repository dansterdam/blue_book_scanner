Transcribing the text in the document:

There is insufficient information in this report to make an evaluation. It is noted that the saucer observed was going over a period of 2 to 3 minutes, but the visual pattern only lasted one minute.

During other sightings with a duration of 5 to 10 minutes at longer ranges, it is estimated that the object or objects sighted would pass out of an area at a rate of approximately 5300 yards per minute.
