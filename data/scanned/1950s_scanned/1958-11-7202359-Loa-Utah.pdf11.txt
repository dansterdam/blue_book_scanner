RAREST INVITATION
YOU MAY RECEIVE
...to see and photograph beautiful, gentle and gorgeous Glen Canyon of the Colorado River.

MAY AND JUNE, 1959
* This opportunity will never come again. Why? Because during the winter of 1958-59 the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will close normal river flow with a cofferdam at Glen Canyon damsite. This will begin the forming of Glen Canyon Lake and back the waters above the mouth of the San Juan River, making a lake more than 50 miles in length. That portion of Glen Canyon will forever be buried beneath water and dead silt.
* Come and see the final 100 miles of Gentle Glen Canyon in 1959. We offer the lowest boat fares in our 21 years of guiding on Western Rivers.
* To all of you who pay your full fare before December 31, 1958, the full fare will be $50.00. The same short-trip fares after January 1 will be $60.00.
* For 20 years we have offered river trips on Western Rivers in U. S., Canada and Alaska- "down north" to the Arctic. Our small craft have traveled to within 1400 miles of the North Pole.
* To all of you who identify within one -half topographic mile, the camera spot of the above photo we will give a $5 credit on any booking fare. For particulars, write or wire:
