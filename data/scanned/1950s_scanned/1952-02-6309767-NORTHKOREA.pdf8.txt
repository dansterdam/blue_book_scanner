AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object
DATE: 12-1-52
PLACE: Near Chosan, North Korea

At 12/341, a pilot of the 4th Fighter Wing was on a routine training mission in the vicinity of Chosan, North Korea, when he sighted an unusual object in the sky. The pilot stated that the object, which appeared to be elliptical in shape, was traveling at a speed estimated to be approximately 500 knots and at an altitude of 36,000 ft.  

The object was observed for approximately three to five minutes. It appeared to be silver in color and object appeared to approach and then move away from the pilot's aircraft. The pilot stated that the object was traveling at a much higher rate of speed than his own aircraft which was traveling at 600 knots. Four light flashes were observed coming from the object. The pilot was unable to close within firing range of the object.

Navigator who observed object is a captain. Served in WWII as a pilot and is considered a competent and reliable observer. He is the only witness of this incident.

Comments of Interrogating Officer: Bright blue-flame exhaust suggests possibility of electronic guidance and possibility of electronic guiding device.
