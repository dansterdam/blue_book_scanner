Q. Why couldn't you?
A. Under the circumstances, it was high and we were suffering from natural oxygen depletion. This object maneuvered in a southerly direction during your attempt to intercept it.
Q. What happened when you attempted to intercept?
A. We had maneuvered into position to attempt to intercept but this object seemed to sense our proximity and took evasive action by accelerating to an extremely high speed and altitude which prevented our intercepting it.
Q. What area and what altitude?
A. In the vicinity of SAN ANTONIO PEAK, ALT: 13,500FT.
Q. Do you know if there were any other interceptors air borne at the same time?
A. Yes. Two others from George A.F.B.
Q. Separate flights?
A. Yes, separate flights.
Q. Do you know if they were aware of the proximity of this object?
A. No. However, they had sighted it at Long Beach and they had also attempted to intercept.
Q. Can you give us the sequences of vectors if any given you by AGC or any other such agencies?
A. There were no vectors given by Ground Control because this object was not reflected in the radar scope.
Q. Do you know if your flight was observer kildar's scope?
A. I don't know. But it is my opinion they did.
Q. Have you ever pursued a UFO before?
A. Yes, and they have given us a position fix.
Q. What do you think your object at sight could have been, bearing and its behavior?
A. It is my opinion it was a free weather balloon, influenced by upper air currents.
