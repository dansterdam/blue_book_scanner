Dear Sirs:
Due to the recent information being released by magazines and such, this is to relate that 
ago. I realize that this might be just another case of UFO reportage, as in the past, and there

. more to give me confidence in what I saw. The objects 1 saw were about 1955. They were not exactly sure, but I think it was in April.
of two or three round objects in the sky, having a pale blue, grayish color, and a peculiar oval shape. They appeared to be moving steadily in a northwesterly direction, without any intermittent motion or flashing lights, and at a relatively high altitude. They were sighted over a period of approximately 5 minutes, as they crossed the southern part of the sky at an estimated speed of 400-500 mph. The objects did not vary in altitude or speed during this time, and their shape and color remained consistent. All of this was observed from the car on a highway near this town. I was not alone, but with my wife, and we have been trying to figure out just what it was we observed.
Sometime with quite objects up in the clear sky, unidentified, that perhaps has been the case in the past, and something like this could easily have been dismissed in that manner. But on this occassion, I am quite sure of what I saw, and I felt that I should make some kind of report of it, if you are interested.
We were deeply impressed by this unusual sight, and it was so strange and different from anything we had ever seen before, that we have been talking about it ever since. Hoping this might be of some interest, I remain

Yours truly,
