Dear Mr. Pickering:

I am enclosing a draft copy of a report together with three small sketches which relate to the sighting of an unidentified object on 12 October 1957. This object was sighted from the Collins Cedar Rapids plant and appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed.

Through our Technology Information Service, we have made this information available to the Air Technical Intelligence Center and the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. It is our understanding that they are interested in any reports of this nature.

We hope that the information contained in this report will be of interest to you. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

Very truly yours,
COLLINS RADIO COMPANY

R.C. Leedom
R.L. Secretary
Assistant Vice President
Cedar Rapids Division
