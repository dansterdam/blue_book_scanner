-18-
THE PRESS: Material, vehicles, and missiles directed
against the United States.
THE PRESS: The question whether these are hostile
or not makes very little difference. What we're trying to get
at is nre you eliminating excluding from any consideration a
missile, a vehicle, or any other material object that might:
be flying through the air other than sound or light or some
other intanglible?
THE PRESS: Somebody from this planet or some other
planet violating our air space. (Laughter)
MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: The. astronomers are our best
advisers, of course, in this business of visitors from else-
where. The astronomers photograph the sky continuously per-
haps with the most adequate photography in existence and the
complete absence of things which would have to be in their
appearance for many days and months to come from somewhere
else.  It doesn't cause them to have any enthusiasm whatsoever
in thinking about this other side of it.
THE   PRESS: Have any astronomical laboratories re-
ported any slghtings whatsoever or any astronomers?
MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I don't recall. Captain
Ruppelt, do you know whether we've had reports from astronomical
laboratories or observatories?
CAPTAIN RUPPELT: No, sir. None have ever had any
real bearing.
THE PRESS: General, does that --- tho kind of in-
volved explanation you just give us --- does that apply to the
recent Washington sightings or upon your observations over the
past years since 1946 based on all your experience with it?
MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Well, our reaction to the
recent Washington sightings is related to the past experience
in terms of --- we have dealt with radar blips before.
THE PRESS: General, if these were vehicles or
materials of our own making, they wouldn't be a menace to
the United States. Do you exclude that?
MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I'd exclude that, definitely.
