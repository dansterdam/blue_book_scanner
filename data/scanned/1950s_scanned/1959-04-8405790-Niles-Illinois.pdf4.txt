The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) with an object above it. The instructions ask to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows two larger sketches of the object's position when the observer first saw it ("A") and when they last saw it ("B"), as well as a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
