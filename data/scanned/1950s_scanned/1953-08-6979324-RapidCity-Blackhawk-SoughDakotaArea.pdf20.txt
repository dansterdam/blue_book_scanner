Despite, therefore, the coincidence between Rapid City and
Bismarck, in view of the disparity in quality of observers in the two
places, I think we shall probably proceed by discounting the Rapid City
incident altogether and concentrate on the Bismarck incident.

I note that you never did get around to telling me specifically
whether Needham was the pilot who became unnerved when the jet crashed.

Thanks again for your very real help in this. I hope the next
time we meet will be under less unusual circumstances.

Sincerely,
