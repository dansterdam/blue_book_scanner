The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document related to Project Blue Book. There is no visible photograph in the image, only handwritten notes and text. 

As an OCR system, I will transcribe the text found in the document:

UNABLE TO GET INFORMATION BECAUSE WEATHER WAS VFR.
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: THE PEOPLE SEEMED TO BE VERY ERNEST IN THEIR CONVICTIONS HOWEVER THEY SEEM TO THINK IT POSSIBLY BE A USED BY A PLANET OR BY A TEMPERATURE INVERSION. I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT WAS A TEMPERATURE INVERSION BECAUSE THEY EXPLAINED IT TO BE GOING TOO FAST FOR A PLANET.
