The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scan of an old report from Project Blue Book, a historical US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

SWORN STATEMENT
20 November 1952

1. Frederick Cavil's radar observed on the 221 scope of the AW/FPS-3 radar station at Hanscom Field (Bedford), Massachusetts, on 30 November 1952, at approximately 0100 hours, as follows:

It was a target about fifteen degrees in width appeared southeast of this station. 
It moved away from the station at a speed approximately 600 knots, where the above mentioned scope is located. Into the operations room to find out if the target was the same as that observed and reported by the Weather Observation Section. After observing the target on the scope at the operations room, it was found that the target was picking up signals unrelated to air travel or four aspect of the antenna. It returned to the maintenance room.
There is no indication that the operator has corrected this target as an unidentified object. At the maintenance room, it was decided to change the frequency to determine whether or not this target was a result of interference from one of the other units. After the frequency was changed, the target was still there, the same as before the frequency was changed.
When F/Sgt Cavil arrived at the maintenance room, I was concentrating on determining whether what I saw was actually a target or interference. I am convinced that it was not interference from another radar.

Sworn and Subscribed before me this 10th day of November 1952.
