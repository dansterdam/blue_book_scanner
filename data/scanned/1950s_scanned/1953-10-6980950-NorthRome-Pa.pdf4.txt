Meteors in the Records
The American Meteorites Society, whose members specialize in the study of meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a given meteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant and direction of movement. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an AMS number. The data were published in Meteorites, the journal of the society, and thus made available for future research.
The records of the society for the years 1950 to 1955 list dozens of fireballs, many of them green, that were somehow overlooked by meteor enthusiasts. On August 11, 1950, during the maximum of the Perseid shower, a blue-green fireball (AMS 239-50) appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It was observed by more than 1000 witnesses, and it is brilliant that it showed a noticeable disk. It flew in a horizontal path, silently broke into pieces, and disappeared (R. p. 373).
September 20, the same year, was a big day for meteors. At 1:32 A.M. a giant fireball (AMS 296-50) roared over southwestern Illinois from north to south, leaving a luminous train visible in five states and illuminating the sky and countryside from St. Louis to Louisville and from Memphis to Knoxville. The first full descriptions, over a month later, were heard over an area 300 miles square, proving the ball must have been of considerable size. Fragments showered farms over a twenty-five mile area, struck five buildings, and shattered a plate-glass window in Murray, Calloway County, Kentucky, and are now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. That same night, over Kentucky and Tennessee, dozens of fireballs were reported by plane crews flying over a six-state area - Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico to p. 115. Similar fireballs that vanished without trace were reported on September 27, 1953 (AMS 321-53), October 4, 1953 (AMS 330), May 15, 1954, and October 27, 1954 (AMS 3337).
