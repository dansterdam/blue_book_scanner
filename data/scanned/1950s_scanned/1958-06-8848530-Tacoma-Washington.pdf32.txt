The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text, diagrams, and questions related to the observation of an unidentified object.

The text in the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. The object travelled forward and danae forward and disappeared. 

21. If possible, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One): a. Head of a pin b. Pea c. Dime d. Nickel e. Quarter f. Silver dollar g. Basketball h. Other 
22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.) Very sure Fairly certain Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Suddenly disappeared into space without sound or trace.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. (If the object were large enough to be, and what shape and size would it have to be, and what other characteristics do you think it would have?) The object or objects seemed almost to disappear or vanish in the same way they appeared, very suddenly and with no evidence or sound or trace.
