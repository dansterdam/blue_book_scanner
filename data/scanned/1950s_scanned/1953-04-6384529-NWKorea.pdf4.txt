AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
3d Bombardment Wing (L), APO 970 IR-6-53
1. On 6 April 1953 at approximately 1730 hours local time, 1/Lt Frederick J. Vermillion, navigator, and 2/Lt William F. Smith, co-pilot, on a routine training mission at 7,500 feet, 1,500 feet above an 8-10/10 overcast, observed an unidentified flying object.
2. 1/Lt Terry observed a white light descending from very high altitude to approximately 15,000 feet at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to be cigar-shaped. The distance of the object from the aircraft was estimated to be approximately 4 miles. The object appeared to be white in color and then turned green. It then disappeared.
3. The 2/Lt Vermillion's statements were the same as the above with the exception that he observed the object grow in size as it approached, and then turned red and disappeared. He observed the object for approximately ten (10) seconds.
4. AFO Commander commented that there appears to be nothing unusual about this observation and that it does not warrant any further investigation as the object could not be positively identified and rapidly disappeared from view.

COMMENT of the approving officer:
This case is a routine report of an unusual sighting which is becoming more common. At the time of this sighting the moon was in a crescent stage and its position, the scattered clouds, and the time of day would provide a natural phenomenon from atmospheric effects and observation angles. The reflection of light from the moon on scattered moisture or light from the sun's rays diffraction through clouds could well account for the apparent sighting of a strange object.
