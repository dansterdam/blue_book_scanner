CONTENT OF MESSAGE:
REFER TO PRESS REPORT, FROM OFFICER DATA REPORT. REF MESSAGE OUR 82. COULD YOUR HEADQUARTER'S. FOLLOWING CONSIDERED OUR TENTATIVE CONCLUSION:
A. IMPRESSION THAT ONLY ONE OBJECT OBSERVED APPEARS ERRONEOUS. FOUR SEPARATE TARGETS INDICATED, 2 ON RADAR, ONE VISUAL, EACH TIME SUCCEEDING TARGET PICKED UP IT WAS IN ALMOST DIRECT OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM PRECEDING TARGET AND SOME DISTANCE AWAY.
B. A TIME-DISTANCE PLUS INDICATES ONE TARGET RETURN HAD SPEED APPROXIMATELY 250 MPH, ANOTHER 450 MPH, SUGGESTIVE OF PROPELLER TYPE AND JET AIRCRAFT RESPECTIVELY. 
C. UNUSUAL SPEEDS INDICATING ONLY 3 SECONDS. BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT. MOVING WITH HIGH SPEED, BUT HORIZONTALLY, REPEAT HORIZONTALLY, AGAIN SUGGESTIVE OF AIRCRAFT.
D. AREA OF INCIDENT LS ASIDE UP MANY FLIGHTS AND OPERATIONS OF NAVY AND AIR FORCE. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT CHECK COUNTLESS POSSIBLE ORIGIN OF AIRCRAFT AND THEIR FLIGHT PLANS.
E. ON BASIS OF ABOVE, MANEUVERS AND SPEEDS SUGGESTIVE OF CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT FOR MOST PART. HOWEVER, THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE UP THE TARGETS COULD BE INDICATIVE OF SPURIOUS RETURNS (RADAR GHOSTS). IN ANY EVENT, THEY WERE MORE THAN ONE RETURN FOR WHICH NO READY EXPLANATION IS AVAILABLE.
