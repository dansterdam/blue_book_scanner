Called 3/8/59 at 7:30 P.M. At that time observed a very bright light in the northwest sky. At first thought it to be an aircraft but as I watched it, the light suddenly split into two lights. These lights then faded and went out. I could see nothing further. The whole observation last approximately 1 minute.
