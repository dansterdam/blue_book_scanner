Dear Mr. ***,

Your letter of August 8, 1960, addressed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was referred to this office.

The Air Force is assigned the responsibility for investigating all reports of unusual aerial objects over the U.S., including those that have been labeled unidentified flying objects.

TO insure adequate evaluation of these sightings it is necessary that complete information be included. Since the sighting made by you occurred in 1959 it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to render an evaluation that would lead to a conclusion. However, I am enclosing AFSC Form 14, for you to complete if you so desire. This form should be forwarded to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, ATTN: AFOIH-4ZZ2.

For your information, I am also enclosing a copy of the latest Department of Defense fact sheet, Air Force UFO Report.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Very truly yours,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
