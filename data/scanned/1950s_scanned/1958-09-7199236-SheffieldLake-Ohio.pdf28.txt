I had just gone to bed when I this incident when I was light turned on in the window. As the light went out I looked out and saw this object moving northwest across the front yard. The object crossed the clearing and left sight behind the trees. The light crossed the doorway becoming dimmer as it moved and brighter as it came toward it. The object moved at a terrific rate of speed. As it moved across the clearing I could see the outline of the object, dark against the sky. The lights were not glowing as it moved away. The object made no noise. The lights on it were a pale reddish-white color, about the size of a 10-watt light bulb. If some sort - anil as it move.
