The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a form with questions about the observed object, and a space for the witness to draw a picture of what they saw. However, the image does not contain any actual photograph or drawing, only the blank form.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can extract the following text from the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Shape __________
b. Color __________

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and specifically indicate size in relation to power lines, trees or other nearby objects. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were: 
(Circle One): Sharply outlined, Blurred, Other _____ a distant star _____

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
