At 0645 hours 7 April 1952, under VHR subject, a bright light was observed over the Kendrick Hotel, Memphis, Tenn. The object had a "brilliant hazy glow" and was in a hovering position. Although distance was indetermined, observer estimated the object to be approximately one mile distant. The object remained in the same general area for about 5 minutes, then accelerated at a terrific rate and disappeared in a northerly direction.

The weather was clear and warm, and the morning of the sighting was otherwise uneventful. The object made no sound and left no trail. It is the opinion of the observer that this sighting was of an unidentified flying object. The observer is a 38 year old male, has 15 years of air intelligence experience, and is consider by all indications, reliable and responsible.

It is highly probable that this observer sighted some unconventional material object.
