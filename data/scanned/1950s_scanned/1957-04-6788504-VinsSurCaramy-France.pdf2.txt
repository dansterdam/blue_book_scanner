On May 19, 1957 my wife and I were in the company of some neighbours (Mr.&Mrs. XXX) who had come to pay us a visit. We were in the kitchen, my wife left and went to the bedroom where our son lay ill. At approximately 10:45 P.M. we heard someone tap on the kitchen windows and so we opened the window and there we saw Mr. XXX, a Hungarian refugee who has been here since 1942, all panting and puffing, he kept repeating "They attacked me","They attacked me!" At the time of all this commotion we asked him to please come in and we dimmed the lights. In very whispered words he told us what had happened and why he was so frightened and we listened attentively then we looked out the window......
