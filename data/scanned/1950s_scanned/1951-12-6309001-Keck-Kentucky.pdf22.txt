MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJ: Reference Investigation of UFO Report 12 December 1951

1. I called General Witten at Olmstead who was away on a trip, no contact.
2. I called Colonel Hughes, RM 3253, Pentagon, Tel 25661, National Guard Bureau, explained to Colonel Hughes the purpose of the call and he gave me the following information:
The incident was observed the incident at about 1930 hours Christmas Eve, 1951 at Harmon. I had personally reported to General Witten and in the next day or so two days I had corresponded to prepare a complete report which involved getting statements from some 20 people who had observed the incident. It was his impression that this report had been forwarded to the USAF. As I discontinued the distribution of the incident.

3. The incident was of a glowing object with a full moon (greater than 30 miles) at about 1930. He and his family were on the way to the club when they observed the object. His attention was drawn to it having the consistency of a football which started very high to the right of the moon. It turned black, at one point in the control there was lateral displacement. A later check with the weather station indicated a wind shift of 120 degrees toward the object. Those outside the atmosphere saw it come down to the earth, the opening was about 750 feet in diameter. Two officers, Colonels Rombeau and Mitchell were flying a routine flight at the time and confirmed the object. They indicated that it disappeared into a white flash into the Gulf.
