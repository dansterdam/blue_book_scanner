There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Conclusions: On the basis of the above data, and the fact that nothing unusual has been photographed or reported by any competent or reliable observer, there is no compelling reason to conclude that the object was other than a balloon, or a balloon-supported device.

(It appears the rest of the text has been written by hand and is difficult to make out clearly. I will do my best to transcribe it accurately.)
