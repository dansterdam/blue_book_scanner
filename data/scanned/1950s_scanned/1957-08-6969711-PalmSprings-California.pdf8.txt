Text extracted from the document:

They are indebted to CSI-members Idabel Epperson and Jackie Sanders, who obtained the original details directly from the two families interviewed at the site. In addition, they interviewed who spotted the object as she was watering her lawn.

Mrs. Eugene Jones, who was in the back yard of her home, a mile away, when she noticed three round objects in the sky. According to her statement, she was having a barbecue supper when they saw what they thought "were three airplanes but upon closer examination they apparently sighted three round objects, as described in detail by other observers, that were hovering at 10,000 feet or less.

Mr. Don L. Rogers, who lives in Riverside--6 miles away. He was with his little daughter watching planes in the sky when they beheld the aerial maneuver. 

One intriguing aspect of this affair--and perplexing as well--is the reported abrupt disappearance of the object. The examination scene described in detail by the observers indicates no evidence of landing, departure or unorthodox behavior.

The first-seen sighting--took place near LaFayette, New York in May, when a group of persona saw a large, metallic cylinder with sharply pointed ends, poised motion-less in the air for several minutes. After watching the phenomenon--it suddenly made a sharp noise and disappeared from view--for several minutes, it reappeared, hesitately moving away.
