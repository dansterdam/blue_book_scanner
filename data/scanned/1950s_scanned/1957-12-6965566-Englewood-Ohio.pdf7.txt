Report of Interview with Mr. [Redacted]
4 February 1958
On 31 January 1958 Mr. and Mrs. [Redacted] called at my home to pick up the 8mm film which they had loaned this office. We had finished duplication of the film at a local color film lab and the original 8mm film was returned to Mr. Benn.
I examined his camera, an 8mm Keystone Capri I-28 1 3/4" f3.5 telephoto lens Tiffen Photar 85 series 21.5mm. 
The film used was Kodachrome Indoor Type 4 shot outdoors with a type-A filter. The distance focusing was on infinity and shot at 16 frames per second.
I asked Mr. [Redacted] the following questions:
Q. What is your estimate of the altitude of the objects which you photographed?
A. About the same height as the light airplanes which frequently fly over the house, between 3000 and 4000 feet.
Q. Were they at any time as high as jet aircraft which make vapor trails?
A. No, definitely not.
Q. Did you see any smoke trail or any kind of trail from the objects?
A. No, there was no visible trail of any sort.
