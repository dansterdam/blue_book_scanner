The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with instructions to place a mark "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and a mark "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer last saw it.

The second and third sketches show two different landscape scenes, with instructions to place an "A" at the position where the object was first seen, and a "B" at the position where it was last seen.
