There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains two sketches or drawings. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved horizon line with an object above it, while the smaller sketch on the right shows a person standing on a road with a curved landscape in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point marked "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show where the object was first seen.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
