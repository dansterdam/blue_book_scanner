REPORT NO.:

DATE OF INFORMATION:
13 August 1952
INTELLIGENCE SECTION. CHANUTE Af8, ILL.
B-1

SUMMARY: On 13 August 1952 at 2150 hours, a non-rated Air Force officer and a non-rated civilian observer were interviewed in the Base Operations Office, Chanute AFB and stated in substance:
Theater is 4 miles north of GOODMOTIONS, Illinois, on the evening of 13 August 1952.
The witness, a civilian, and the witness, a non-rated Air Force officer, were driving along U. S. Route 45, approximately 4 miles north of GOODMOTIONS, Illinois, when they first observed the object. The object was first observed at an acute angle of approximately 70 to 75 degrees above the horizon. The object moved in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed, displaying a flashing light near the object. The object appeared to be oval or circular in shape and was estimated to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter. The object proceeded north, stopped abruptly, and appeared to be several times larger. It then proceeded to move in an erratic, zig-zag manner, and appeared to be several times smaller. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes and was last seen moving rapidly to the north.
A check at Base Operations, CHANUTE AFB revealed that 2 B-25 aircraft were flying locally between CHANUTE AFB and BLOOMINGTON, Illinois during the interval when the observation was made. This does not conform to the B-22 described.
