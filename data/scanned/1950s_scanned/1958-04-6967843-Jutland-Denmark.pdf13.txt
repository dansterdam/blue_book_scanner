No Case (Information Only)                                     1 April 1958
Willoughby, Ohio

Cited as seeing a UFO; Frank -------- of Willoughby, Ohio, made a very special report. At 6:30 PM, April 1st, he was reluctant to report it, as no one would probably believe him or would think he was an April Fool; but an odd driving noise drew Frank's attention away from his car that seemed to be about 60 feet high, 20 to 25 feet from him and 40 to 50 feet from his bumpers, and shaped like an ice cream cone. It was an unknown color, between orange and red, and glowed as though it had wires on the inside. It remained in the road and the air, a mild noise was heard as if a bubble burst down and around it. Confused, more very twisted, it flew back to where it originally stood without changing its position. By this time, the object was quite a bit smaller, now luminous, a lunar white color shining from back to the spot, so the whole scene was disturbed, but the car engine ran rugged and constant.
