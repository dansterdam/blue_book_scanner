PRESENT STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION
  
The original special project for the investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena was discontinued, as has been stated. However, public interest in the matter did not entirely disappear, and incidents themselves didnâ€™t stop occurring, either.
So the investigation has been continued, no longer on an accelerated special project basis, but as a normal and routine part of the technical intelligence function.

This is its status today.
