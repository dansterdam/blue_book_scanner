Statement of Capt. A.F.P. D.I.D. WOOMERA, made at 1910 hours, 29th September, 1952, and taken by Assistant Security Officer, WOOMERA.
I was with during the WOOMERA "West Open Air Theatre" on Saturday, 27th September. 
At between 2045 and 2130 hours I happened to look up and my arm and said, "Look at the rocket!" I looked and directly right from my seat on the left front under the projector and objects objected directly in line with each other. The rocket-shaped object was traveling at a tremendous speed and the object next to it had a chain-shaped object attached to it. The colour of the objects was whitish and the exhaust of flames to the back were yellowish or orange. 
I have had three or four ideas of the object since the incidents. I will summarized it, the object was fuming or emitting a flame and the object seemed to float along with the rocket. The time elapsed would be three seconds.
I have observed fast acrobatics and shooting stars. This object was travelling on an even steady course, faster than any shooting star I have seen, and the trail of flame seemed to be wider than any shooting star trailing behind it. This object was travelling horizontally south-west.
