III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE had been observing stars through his friend's telescope when he noticed a light in the sky which he at first thought to be a star. However, this light appeared to be moving at such a speed that he observed the motion to be definite. As the light continued to move, two other similar lights appeared in the sky, each appearing to be moving in a different direction from the other two.
The objects seemed to be pulsating in a bright orange color and had a disk-like shape. SOURCE further estimated their speed in "thousands of miles per hour". SOURCE said the lights were traveling "so rapidly that they were high enough to reflect the sun's light."
IV. SOURCE'S ESTIMATE: SOURCE states that the sightings were "a phenomenon of material devices that appear to be propelled by an unknown force but that they were apparently controlling their speed and direction". SOURCE believes earth-made devices would be capable of travelling that high and that fast.
