DIF OCT, Subj: Sighting of Unidentified Arial Object on 15 May 1954
OVER GERNADA, California, sightings from Elsinore, California.

This report states that the aerial object was descending at an angle of about 24 to 30 degrees, and was observed for several minutes. The object appeared to be "very high," as least the 25,000 foot level.

The report indicates that this series of events took place with great rapidity, and the object had vanished to his view.

The observer concludes that this had been struck, and immediately virtually checked and concluded that it appeared to be a "very high" altitude "jet" fighter, as the object had vanished to his view.

Neither major observing radar, nor Weather Observer, nor Squadron Leader identified the object. Squadron Leader HECTOR concluded that the altitude of all three aircraft at the time of this incident was approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet, and the people did not see this object.

In a signed statement, Ronald W. PATTEN, Flight Lieutenant, Royal Air Force, flying as Under Observer for "Squadron Leader HECTOR" at the time, corroborated the circumstances of the incident, and stated that it appeared to him that the object observed did not conform to any known type of aircraft.

The statement is co-executed by HECTOR and PATTEN, along with a sketch of the object as it appeared to them.
