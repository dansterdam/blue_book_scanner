"Gulf Gawks High in Sky
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 26 - Citizens here report sighting a strange flying object 'high in the sky' which 'resembles the planet Venus in size and color' but 'has a rapid oscillating motion,' it was reported here today. The sightings, which began at 6:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, continued for about two hours, with the object remaining stationary for long periods of time. Dozens of citizens of New Orleans called the local Civil Defense Office to report the strange phenomena. The object was described as 'round' and 'luminous,' changing colors from 'red to blue-green.' The area was checked by representatives of the Air Force, who could offer no explanation for the sightings. Citizens of New Orleans were reported to be 'somewhat excited' over the incident."
