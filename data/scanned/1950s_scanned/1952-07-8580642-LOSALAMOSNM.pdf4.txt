On 29 July 1952, a civilian pilot, Lewis, then a Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, observed several objects in the sky which appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed in the vicinity of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As there was only one pair or triangular, all other the observers took turns in watching the objects through binoculars. The objects appeared to be circular in shape. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and appeared to be maneuvering in a manner which the observer considered unusual. There was no sound, trail, or tail observed. It was observed for several minutes until it disappeared from view over the horizon. The reliability of the observer is considered excellent.
