The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line to represent the horizon, with an object drawn above it to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a wider view, with a person standing on a road and two curved lines representing the horizon. There is a smaller sketch in the corner that appears to be a more distant view.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
