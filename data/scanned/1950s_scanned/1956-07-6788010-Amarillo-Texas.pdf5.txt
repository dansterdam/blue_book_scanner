No Case (Information Only)
24 July 1956
Sierra, California

Case 17-A. Sierra Peaks, Cal. July 23, 1956 - Air Part and I were on a trip in the Sierra Nevada Mountains fishing for trout. On the morning of July 23, Miss Cook and I were camping out at Lake Majave in the same area that we had been fishing in the. Around 2:45 a.m. Miss Cook awakened me and pointed out a peculiar light in the sky to the east. It appeared to be 3-4 miles away and was approximately 3-4 miles in size. It remained stationary for the first 5-10 minutes then started to move to the northeast at a very rapid speed, accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight in a few seconds. Miss Cook and I were amazed at the performance of this object and after discussing it decided to report it to the nearest Air Force Base which was March AFB. We were assigned in the following manner: First the blue ball was noticed which faded into a red glow, then into a green light, then went out completely. The object appeared to be lighted from the inside giving the effect of transparency. When it accelerated the whole object glowed a brilliant white. It made no sound at all during the time we observed it.
