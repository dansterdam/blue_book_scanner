STATEMENT

On about 2200 hours, 2nd March 1953, an object, red in color, appeared in the sky over Cambria, California. This object was about the size of a man's hand held at arm's length. It was reported to the Air Defense Filter Center by a Deputy Sheriff from the Cambria area. No other witnesses were available at this time. The object moved very slowly and disappeared from sight after about 15 seconds. The object moved in a very peculiar manner, however, it was not that of a shooting star or meteorite. According to the report, the object appeared to be round or elliptical in shape and was a definite red color. It traveled slowly towards the north and upwards.
