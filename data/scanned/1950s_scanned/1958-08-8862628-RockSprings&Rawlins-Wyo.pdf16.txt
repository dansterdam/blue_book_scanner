Gentlemen -
I saw an object that appeared to be circular in shape and hovered over the town of Greenwood, South Carolina for about 10-15 minutes on the night of August 8, 1958.
This object was luminous and seemed to have a light source within it. It made no sound and did not appear to move, just hovered in the same spot.
I was coming home from work that night around 10:30 p.m. and happened to glance up and saw this unusual object in the sky. It was clearly visible and I watched it for the entire time it was in sight.
It seemed to be about the size of a car and was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air. The weather was clear and there was no moon that night.
I have never seen anything like this before and was quite startled by it. I would be interested in any information you may have concerning this incident.
Yours truly,
(Signature)
