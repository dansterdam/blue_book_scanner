DATA ON TEXAS - 21 August 1951

I. SIGHTING OF AN OBJECT:
On 21 August 1951 at approximately 1:25 CST two ladies were driving in an automobile several miles north of Matador, Texas. The object was described as a flat, round object, bluish-white or silver in color, which readily reflects the sunlight. The object was about the size of one type of balloon and moved without a guiding form. There was no sign of any exhaust and no noise was heard.

II. WEATHER:
A. 1:30 CST - Range AST 31 August 1951
Estimated ceiling 6,000 ft., broken clouds, with thin scattered clouds at 6,000 ft. Visibility 15 miles.
B. 1:30 CST - DALLAS, TEXAS - 31 August 1951
Estimated ceiling 9,000 ft. overcast. Visibility 15 miles. Wind ENE at 7 knots. Weather cirrus clouds in 6 oktas.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION:
It has been reported that a road repair crew saw the same object later on the same day. Attempts will be made by Project Grudge to contact members of this road crew and obtain their statements. There were also reports of crop dusting activity in the area, so attempts will be made to determine whether or not the ladies could have seen this activity.
