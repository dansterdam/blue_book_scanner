Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft, Sioux City, Iowa
IOWA
23 Jan 51

1. Reference is made to Teletyp. no. 13 OSI 87, dated 22 Jan 51, from OSRNT R-4, regarding sighting of an unidentified object.
2. The subject sighting can be classed as confirmed information since two power contrellers have observed the object as 5:45 on 23 Jan 51, and their observations confirm the earlier report.
3. The general trend of the reported sighting is similar to previous sightings which indicate that the unidentified object had the characteristics of an aircraft but behaved in an erratic, unconventional manner with a speed and performance exceeding that of contemporary airplanes. The pilot of the transport airplane then concludes to give a fairly detailed description of the color, size, shape, maneuvering, and above-normal performance capability.
4. On the basis of the above analysis, it is desired to point out that an interpretation of certain local reports indicates that this incident could be easily discredited.
5. The reported final conclusions are difficult to state at this time. However, revealed information gives rise to a belief that the identity or nature of this object might be more closely related to some unusual celestial phenomenon rather than an aerial vehicle of this world. The unusual lights observed in the sky in colors varying from yellowish-white to red seems to verify this.
6. Action has been taken to have the CIC-3D forward the additional data as soon as available. It may be necessary to institute additional measures on the subject sighting until the additional data is received.
7. The responsibilities of the Air Defense Command in connection with visitations of this kind should be more firmly established than currently appears to be the case.
