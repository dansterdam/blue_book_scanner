AIR FORCE RELEASES NEW INFORMATION SHEET: In their latest "fact sheet", the Air Force states that 863 out of 4,997 U.F.O. cases investigated by the Air Force since 1947 remain unidentified. In connection with these approximately 863 unknown cases, there is no proof of inter-and furthermore, the U.F.O.'s whatever they are, do not represent a threat to national security. It is indicated that the Air Force as no films, photographs, maps, charts, or records of unidentified airborne objects that have been submitted for evaluation in conjunction with reports. All such reports have been determined to be misidentifications of natural phenomena or conventional aircraft. These unidentified cases have been referred by the Air Force's own pilots to as "unknowns." A case in point is the film taken on March 1, 1953, near Luke AFB, Arizona, an described in detail in Project Blue Book case no. 333, which has been judged to be the sighting of a conventional jet aircraft. Several other similar films or movies of so-called "unknowns" have also been judged to be identifiable. Two of these film strips were included a few years ago in the documentary motion picture called "UFO." See James P. Liddell's letter in the middle of Page 8 for more information on this subject.
