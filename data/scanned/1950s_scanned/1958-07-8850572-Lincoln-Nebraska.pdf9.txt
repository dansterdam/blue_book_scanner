Gentlemen:

1. The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center received from a member of the public on 11 March 1960, film of an unidentified flying object taken 11 July 1959, which could possibly be the same as the one shown to members of the FA in Indianapolis and passed this information to him.

2. The Air Force is presently investigating the incident reported by Mrs. ---------. 

Sincerely,
