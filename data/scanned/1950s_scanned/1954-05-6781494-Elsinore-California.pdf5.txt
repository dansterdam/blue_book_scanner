SIGHTING REPORT---UNUSUAL OBJECT

At approximately 2235 I was alerted by one of the USAF pilots under my command of a UFO. The object was first sighted in the southeast and was observed for approximately 30 minutes. It appeared to be metallic in nature, oval in shape, and had a red light at the top and a white light at the bottom. The object seemed to be oscillating and changing colors from red to white to blue-green. Its speed was approximately 500 knots and the altitude was estimated at 30,000 feet. As it passed overhead, the object stopped its oscillating motion and appeared to be a single steady, bright white light. After passing overhead, the object then accelerated to an estimated speed of 1,000 knots and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction. The total duration of the sighting was approximately 30 minutes. The attitude of all three aircraft was approximately 13,000 feet and the position was fixed as Elsinore, California.
