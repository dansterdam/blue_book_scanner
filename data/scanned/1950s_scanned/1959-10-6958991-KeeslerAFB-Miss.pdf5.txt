Keesler A.F.B., Miss. 

1. Reference to paragraph 3 of your letter dtd 1 Sept. 1959. 

The following is a report of the incident concerning the object sighted by Capt. [redacted] and Lt. [redacted] on the night of 6 October 1958 while on duty at Keesler A.F.B.:

This incident occurred about 2245 hrs on the night of 6 October 1958. Capt. [redacted] and Lt. [redacted] were on flying safety patrol in a vehicle on the flight line when they observed an extremely bright light in the sky approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. This light was observed for approximately 5 minutes and was estimated to be about the size of a grapefruit held at arm's length. The light was described as being elliptical in shape, bright white in color, and pulsing or flashing at a rate of about 2-3 flashes per second. The light seemed to be stationary and did not appear to move during the observation. There were no navigation lights or other identifying lights visible on the object. After the 5 minute observation, the light suddenly went out, leaving an after-image on the observers' eyes. 

Very truly yours, 

[redacted]
