III. SOURCE DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
"We had just finished dinner and had begun watching television on the neighbor's TV which we had picked up at the new high power station. All of a sudden, we noticed a bright light in the sky which looked like a star at first but suddenly started moving rapidly. It moved from right to left, up and down, and all around so fast that it was impossible to keep track of it. 
It seemed to be about the size of a small plane and it would disappear and reappear many times. On one occasion, it seemed to divide into two objects, one larger than the other, and the smaller one seemed to chase the larger one for a while. 
During the sighting, the light was a brilliant white and at times seemed to change colors, going from white to orange, blue and red. As suddenly as it started, the light disappeared and we could not locate it again. The sighting lasted approximately 45 minutes."
