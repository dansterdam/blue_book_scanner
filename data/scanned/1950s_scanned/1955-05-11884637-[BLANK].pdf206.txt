The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line to represent the horizon (skyline) and an object above it, illustrating how high the object was above the horizon when the viewer first saw it. The second sketch shows two different perspectives of the same scene - one a wider view of a road or path with trees on the sides, and the other a smaller view of a horizon with what appears to be mountains or hills.

Now, acting as an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
