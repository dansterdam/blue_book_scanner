There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

assurred the reporter of my story and he later stated that he thought the contents of the story would be in the Sunday, May 4th issue. However, for some unknown reason it never appeared.

I have no personal desire to give publicity in print but I believe it is about the that the authorities, as well as the citizens, be openly informed of a dramatic happening as important as this instance. I firmly believe that this saucer was making a normal landing.  while over the scene and if my report has been builded scientifically, we would be in a more investigant position to know more clearly what occurred. 

I contacted you with the request to the Army that "someone was slopping at the switch", or if it is being kept "hush, hush", that the public reaction will be make contact with us (as has been proven in the past) experience has taught us that unidentification toward events to cause a lapse of phenomena. and scope with what has been.

Misted here are the names and addresses of witnesses mentioned above.  I can also present an article from the Birmingham Economic, that the police furnished the newspaper edition concerning my reports to them stating "that could the police do if we had intruders from the sky". This proves that the Air Force officers are not briefed as short to the possibility of future events.
