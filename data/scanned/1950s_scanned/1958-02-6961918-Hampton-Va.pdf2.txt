TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

On the 22 February 1958, around 8:30 p.m. eastern standard time, I was walking by my house after having had a few drinks, and I observed in the sky three lights which appeared to be moving quite fast. These lights appeared to be very high up, maybe 20,000 feet or more. They were moving in a southerly direction from my location. I watched them for five to ten minutes, and then they disappeared over the horizon.

Later on, at approximately 9:00 o'clock that night, I was in my house and noticed the moon in the sky. It was about a two-thirds phase. I went to the door to take a look and noticed that there was a group of lights flying about. They would stop, hover for a while, and then move off again. All this is very strange to me, because I have no way of really knowing how high they were or the speed at which they were traveling. Rather than being a source of light, they appeared to be emitting light. At first, I paid little attention to them, thinking that they might be a group of planes flying along a common course, but after watching them for some time, I decided that they were not like any planes I have ever seen before. They would normally follow a straight line, and then all of a sudden, they would move down sideways. This action was very strange to me. I then passed it off from my mind.

I did not see them again.
