"This is my reply to your letter of October 6th, in which you request information concerning an unidentified flying object sighting which was reported to have occurred near Marysville, Ohio, on September 11, 1954.

On September 14, 1954, this office received a report from Mr. [REDACTED], 326 Riverside Drive, Marysville, Ohio, stating that at approximately 9:30 p.m. on September 11, 1954, he and several other persons observed an unidentified object in the sky near Marysville, Ohio. According to the report, the object was described as a bright light that appeared to be circular in shape and was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes. The light was reported to have changed in color from white to yellowish-orange and then back to white again. No further details concerning the sighting were provided.

In view of the limited information available, this office has been unable to determine the nature or identity of the object observed. It is possible that the object may have been a conventional aircraft, astronomical phenomenon, or some other natural occurrence. Without additional details, however, a definite identification cannot be made.

If you have any further information concerning this sighting, or if you are able to provide the names and addresses of any other witnesses, I would appreciate receiving such data. Any additional information that you can furnish would be most helpful in our effort to identify the nature of the reported object.

Yours sincerely,
[REDACTED]"
