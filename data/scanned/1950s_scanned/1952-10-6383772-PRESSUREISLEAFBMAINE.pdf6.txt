The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a typed document describing an upper air research balloon released from Minneapolis, Minnesota on 9 October 1952. The document discusses the balloon's location, speed, and the potential reasons for the discrepancy between the reported distance and the actual distance covered by the balloon. The text of the document is as follows:

10 October 1952  
Presque Isle Theodolite Signings  

Upper air research balloon released from Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 9 Oct- ober 1952, was lost 25 miles west of Toronto but was traveling in an easterly direction at 25 mph.

22302 9 Oct - 25 miles west of Toronto 
03032 10 Oct - first sighted at Presque Isle 1950

If the balloon and the object are one in the same, it took the balloon 19.5 hrs to cover the 600 air miles from Toronto to Presque Isle. A check on this can be made since the wind speed at Toronto was 25 mph and taking the speed of the object at Presque Isle which was 27 mph, by multiplying 26 mph by 19.5 hrs:

19.5
26
507 (or the distance covered of 507 miles).

The discrepancy of the 93 miles necessary to put the balloon in the imme- diate vicinity of Presque Isle and Limestone could be due to altitude fluctua- tions in the balloon's flight.  It is quite possible that the average speed was over 26 mph, as the balloon alternately gained and lost altitude and entered different air streams of higher speeds.  At 31 mph, for example, the distance covered would be 604.5 miles.
