MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: A-54-T-23 

1. I prepare a Memorandum for the Secretary of the Air Force. 

FACTS AND DISCUSSION

2. In a cover sheet comment from ATIC/T-3 this office was asked to prepare an appendix to a report from the Intelligence Office of the 21st Air Division regarding the radar/visual sightings or an unidentified aircraft over Marrakech, French Morocco.

3. The report stated that at 1030 G.M.T., above date, an unidentified target was picked up on an AN/APQ-13 radar set and a course recorde as 307 degrees, 142 miles per hour and altitude above 30,000 feet, a distance of approximately 1,127 miles from the radar site. An unidentified aircraft was observed visually to corroborate the radar contact.

4. The originator of the report determined that a USAF A7-1 aircraft was airborne in the area at the time.

5. The attached memorandum states the evaluation by this office was that the aircraft in question was the A-57-1 aircraft observed visually and correlated with the radar contacts.
