There appears to be no photograph present on this page of the Project Blue Book report document. The page contains a questionnaire with various questions about the sighting of an unidentified object, including instructions to draw a picture showing the motion of the object. The respondent has provided handwritten answers to the questions.

The text from the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Moving up - Slowing velocity

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. feet

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Quarter
e. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Faded out

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine what you could construct the object out of what type material would you use? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Material similar to stainless steel or aluminum. The size would be about 4 or 5 feet in diameter and would appear disc-shaped. Its peculiar characteristics - maneuvering ability, velocity, and ability to disappear could have been achieved by some means of repelling gravity, using a method of propulsion not presently known. The object could have been utilizing an energy source as yet undiscovered by man.
