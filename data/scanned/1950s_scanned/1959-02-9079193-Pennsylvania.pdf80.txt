FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 26-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Island Daily Press he stated that the things he saw could not have been farriers, what he knew as "B-47 bombers and RC-97 tankers looked like, and how they looked in operation at night. (Original statement to Airforce, Never having witnessed refueling operations at night. I am not aware of the lighting of jet tankers.") Also, he told the Daily Press, the objects he saw were at least triple the size of any known tanker or bomber. (Original statement to American Airlines: "Due to the dark and strong lights I was not able to ascertain any size or shape.") Furthermore, the unknown had been far too fast to be any fast bomber known. (Original statement to American Airlines: ". . . it was difficult for me to believe they were jet bombers.")
In rejecting the Air Force explanation of this incident, flying-saucer addicts tendered several embarrassing questions: If Captain Killian actually saw interplanetary craft, how did he fail to see the earthly aircraft operating at the same time and place? If the unknowns moved at a speed of 3,000 miles an hour, how did Captain Killian and the crews of several other planes, flying at less than 300 miles an hour, keep the unknowns in sight for forty minutes? In that length of time the UFOs should have covered most of the distance to the Pacific.
Few persons given the facts by responsible officials would persist in the enthusiasm of the tamers and continue in a belief of flying saucers to occupy the relevant cubic area of space. To the true enthusiast, however, these refuting plans remain inconvertible proof that "spacecraft" are among us.
