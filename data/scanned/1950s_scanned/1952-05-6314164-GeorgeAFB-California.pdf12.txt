OBSERVER SIGHTED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS ON THREE SEPARATE
OCCASIONS. FIRST OBSERVATION WAS OF AN OBJECT DESCRIBED AS
"MOTIONLESS AND SHIMMERING". THE OBSERVER REPORTED THAT THE SIZE OF
THE OBJECT WAS SMALL, ALTHOUGH ITS MINUTENESS PREVENTED ANY ACCURATE
ESTIMATE OF SIZE AND SHAPE. THE SECOND OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO BE
TRAVELING AT GREAT SPEED, COVERING HALF THE LENGTH OF THE SKY FROM
WHERE THE OBSERVER WAS STANDING TO THE HORIZON IN TEN SECONDS.
ESTIMATED SPEED WAS 1529 MILES PER HOUR. THE THIRD OBJECT WAS
DESCRIBED AS LOOKING "LIKE A WHITE PAPER PLATE, FLIPPING END OVER
END".
