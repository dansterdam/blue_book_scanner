STATEMENT                         MAJOR _____________USAAF, YR-393, RAD_LA.

During the evening of 12 June 1954, I was indoors at my residence, located at _____, Miami Beach, Fla. At approximately 2130 hours, I was outside on the patio, called in by a excited voice to come outside. I stepped outside and was astonished to see a strange light in the sky above us, and I seal that it was intelligibility controlled from the beach area, approximately 350 to 500 yards from the beach, and between the beach and our location.

At one instance I thought I could see a a closer observation point somewhere below the light,
so that while it was almost directly overhead it was gradually seemingly to cade out from our sight.

After observing it for some time, it seered to be gradually descending, slowly until it 
suddenly seemed to vanish from sight. It could have landed in the water, but I would
estimate it to have been about 2500 to 3000 feet above the beach area. It was a most 
interesting and amazing sight, and something I would definitely wish to remember
for possible future reference.

It seemed to be rather like a star at first, perhaps a bit larger, but gradually it seemd to
increase in size until it was quite sizeable, although it did not seem to increase beyond a
certain point. The light remained steady and constant, and did not blink or fluctuate in any
way that I could detect. As it seemed to gradually descend, it also seemed to be gradually increasing in size, as well, until it suddenly disappeared from sight.

I would be happy to furnish any additional information that may be desired, and would
be glad to cooperate in any way possible.
