"About 2300 hours on 7 July 1952, the undersigned received a telephone call from the Master Sgt at the Aircraft Control & Warning Station at Nouassseur Air Force Base, Morocco, reporting a sighting of unidentified flying objects.

The Master Sgt stated that approximately 8-10 lights were observed traveling at a very high rate of speed. The lights appeared to be traveling at an altitude of approximately 10,000 ft and were heading in a generally northeasterly direction. The lights were observed for a period of about 30 minutes and then disappeared from view.

It is possible for a HEAVY layer of stratosphere haze to conceal the upper layers of the atmosphere. This could account for the observed lights being visible at approximately 10,000 ft. The lights were observed through binoculars and the unaided eye. The Master Sgt described the lights as being round, about the size of a basketball, and about the brightness of a "bright star".

1. The side window of a B-24 is inclinated approximately 10 degrees from the vertical. On the night of 7 July 1952, a B-24 crew on a training flight from Nouasseur reported sighting several unidentified objects. The objects were visible through the side window, traveling at an estimated speed of approximately 300-400 knots.

2. Our weather reports show no unusual phenomena on the night of 7 July 1952."
