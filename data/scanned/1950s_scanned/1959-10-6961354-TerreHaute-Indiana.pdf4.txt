On 15 October 1959, at Terre Haute, Ind., at 6:10 p.m., President of Research and Studies Committee on Aerial Phenomena, known as "RICAP", observed a light about the size of a star, and about the size of a pea at arm's length. 

About 6:45 every night since then, he and two big, green balls of fire appeared at Terre Haute, Ind. He manoeuvred them from place to place, and they appeared to go out of sight.

At 7:00 a pilot saw two orange balls of fire ahead of him. Seconds later he saw a white flash.
