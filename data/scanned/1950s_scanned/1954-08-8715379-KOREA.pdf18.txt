AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT 
REFERENCES: NONE

1. On 20 July 1953, at 0600 hours local time, a USAF C-47 aircraft, call sign AATO, was airborne on a routine administrative flight from Suwon Air Base, Korea, to Taejon. 

2. At approximately 0630 hours, when the aircraft was in the vicinity of Suwon, the pilot and copilot observed a bright light in the sky which they estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000 feet in altitude. The light appeared to be stationary, and no definite shape could be discerned. The light gradually faded and disappeared from view after about 2 minutes.

3. The pilot immediately reported the incident to the control tower at Suwon Air Base. However, no other aircraft in the area reported observing the light. The weather conditions at the time were clear, and visibility was approximately 10 miles.

4. The pilot and copilot were both career officers with extensive flying experience. They were unable to identify the light as any known type of aircraft, celestial body, or other explainable phenomenon. 

5. The incident was reported to proper authorities in accordance with existing regulations.
