Other UFOs in "Stack" Formation
A correspondent has reported a UFO sighting very similar to the Norfolk case, almost certainly produced by the mechanism just described.
In the late spring of 1955 a physicist, A.F.Z. was driving west on the highway between Dayton and Yolkima, Washington, in a region of low-lying hills. The time was shortly after dark, the sun had set but there was still a suggestion of light in the west. Suddenly a line of five lights was observed in the western sky, apparently traveling at a distance of four or five miles away, traveling east at high speed, and accelerating as they approached. Flying in a "stack" with the leading saucer on top, the individual saucers were oriented in horizontal planes, but each was tilted somewhat, with the leading edge slightly higher than the trailing edge.
