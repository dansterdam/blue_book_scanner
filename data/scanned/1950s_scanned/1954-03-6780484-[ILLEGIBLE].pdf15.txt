UNCLASSIFIED
4 March 1954
Statement of ---
Progress, Vermont

1. I am a service employee at ---ed Air Force Base and work in the flight "maintenance" section. I have served in this capacity for some time.

2. On the morning of 4 March 1954, at about 10 o'clock (a.m.), I went out on the line to take a look at some work that was being done on one of the planes. As I approached the area, I noticed that the runway lights were on, and they seemed very bright. I looked up and saw a strange light hovering over the area. It was a large, oval-shaped object, and it appeared to be about 200 feet in diameter. It was completely silent and seemed to be about 500 feet in the air. I watched it for several minutes, and it made no sound and showed no signs of propulsion. It just hovered there, motionless.

3. I called the fellow who was with me, that is, --- who also saw the object. We both watched it for some time, and we were both amazed by what we saw. The object then started to move slowly, and it gained altitude as it moved. It moved in a straight line and disappeared from sight. I have no idea what this object was, but I can assure you that it was not an aircraft or anything I have ever seen before.

4. To the best of my knowledge and belief, this statement is true.
