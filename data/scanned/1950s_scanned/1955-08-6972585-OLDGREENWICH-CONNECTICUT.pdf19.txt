AUTHORITIES WERE NOTIFIED OF A UFO SIGHTING OVER THE GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT AREA. THEY RECEIVED A CALL FROM A MRS. SUTTON, WHO STATED SHE AND TWO OTHER WOMEN WITNESSED A LARGE LUMINOUS OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER THEIR HOME IN OLD GREENWICH. MRS. SUTTON SAID THE OBJECT WAS APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET IN DIAMETER, SHAPED LIKE A DISC, AND APPEARED TO BE SURROUNDED BY A LUMINOUS GLOW. IT HOVERED IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

MRS. SUTTON SAID THAT IS SHE CAUSED THEY USED LIGHTS ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY WERE VERY SCARED AND KEPT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW TO SEE THE OBJECT.  MRS. SUTTON SAID WHAT'S WHAT IT APPEARS (CCC) TO US THAT IT WAS A VERY HIGH UP.

A RELATIVE OF MRS. SUTTON, MRS. TAYLOR, ALSO RETURNED FROM A TRIP AND CALLED TO SAY SHE SAW THE SAME OBJECT FROM HER CAR ON THE MERRITT PARKWAY. SHE SAID IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BUS AND HAD A BRIGHT LIGHT UNDERNEATH. SHE WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE IT ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED.

THE SIGHTINGS SAID THAT A LITTLE LATER, THE OBJECT RETURNED AND HOVERED OVER THEIR HOME FOR ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS BEFORE. THEY SAID IT APPEARED TO HAVE SEVERAL SMALLER LIGHTS OR PORTHOLES AROUND THE EDGE. THE SUTTONS SAY ABOUT SIX SMALLER LIGHTS WERE VISIBLE ALONG WITH THE BRIGHT LIGHT UNDERNEATH. 

WHEN THE OBJECT LEFT, IT ACCELERATED STRAIGHT UP AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY. MRS. SUTTON SAID HER HUSBAND WAS OUTSIDE AND SAW THE OBJECT TOO. HE RETURNED HOME LATER VERY SHAKEN AND DISTURBED BY WHAT HE SAW.

THE SIGHTING LASTED ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES TOTAL. THE SUTTONS SAY THAT'S ALL THEY CAN TELL YOU. THEY ARE NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS, BUT THEY KNOW THEY SAW SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL IN THE SKY THAT NIGHT. THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANY TRACE OF THE OBJECT AFTER IT LEFT.
