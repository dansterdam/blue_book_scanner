The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the image, the output is as follows:

Civilian man and young daughter were
observed where a rocket-shaped object was seen.
They watched the object as it seemed to hover
over them and then it shot off at a high rate of speed and out of sight. But it was brighter.
