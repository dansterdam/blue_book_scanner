ESMR ROUTING SLIP
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: GARY GEDRWY
SUBJECT: REQUEST STUDY OF TECHNICAL DATA ON UFO
REMARKS: Gerry's This is a toughie. I have approached it from every scientific and logical angle - with preliminary checks and analysis - and all have shown it to be NEGATIVE.
Since Dr. Hynek (to whom I sent only the very complex cases) is in Moscow, respectfully request that you make this data available personally possib,e. 
If no resolution, this will be one that I must place in the UNSOLVABLE category or "UNKNOWN".
Have provided you with copies of all pertinent material. Note that the source is a UFO "expert" with over 20 years experience...and for once precise data were accorded with a theodol1 te.
Thanks
