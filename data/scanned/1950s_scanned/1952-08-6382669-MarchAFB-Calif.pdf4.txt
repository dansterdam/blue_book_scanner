The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a written account of a UFO sighting. Here is the text from the document:

28 August 1952

When the object was disappearing was about the only time you could determine that it was oval shaped. There was only one object, and it did leave a vapor trail.

What I noticed mostly was the unusual light and the speed. It looked liked a shooting star except that it was about 25 thousand feet and was moving in a straight flight southwest. As soon as it got out of the rays of the sun it disappeared. I would say it was about 30 seconds after I had first seen it. I was in amazement at the time at a refueling.

The weather was very clear at the time. About 5 minutes later there was a jet aircraft flying west and one to the east. At the speed of the two jet aircraft I would say the object was travelling 2 to 3 times as fast.
