There is no photograph present in this image from the Project Blue Book document. Instead, the image contains two sketches/illustrations:

1. A sketch showing a curved line and an "A" point on the line, along with instructions to imagine that the viewer is at the "A" point and the object was seen above the horizon (skyline).

2. A larger sketch showing a person standing on a road in the middle of a landscape with buildings and trees. There is also a small inset sketch showing a tree-lined horizon.

Text Output:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
