3,000 feet, 270 degrees, 22 miles per hour 
5,000 foot, 270 degrees, 22 miles per hour
7,000 foot, 270 degrees, 22 miles per hour
9,000 feet, 270 degrees, 21 miles per hour
11,000 feet, 270 degrees, 19 miles per hour
13,000 feet, 270 degrees, 17 miles per hour
15,000 feet, 270 degrees, 15 miles per hour
17,000 feet, 270 degrees, 14 miles per hour 
19,000 feet, 270 degrees, 13 miles per hour 
21,000 feet, 270 degrees, 11 miles per hour 
23,000 feet, 270 degrees, 9 miles per hour
25,000 feet, 270 degrees, 8 miles per hour

At 11,00 hours, same date, "wlnde aloft readings wore:
1,000 feet, 230 degrees, 24 miles per hour
3,000 feet, 230 degrees, 25 miles per hour
5,000 feet, 250 degrees, 15 miles per hour
7,000 feet, 250 degrees, 10 miles per hour
9,000 feet, 250 degrees, 35 miles per hour
11,000 feet, 260 degrees, 37 miles per hour
13,000 feet, 260 degrees, 34 miles per hour
15,000 feet, 260 degrees, 31 miles per hour
17,000 feet, 260 degrees, 32 miles per hour
19,000 feet, 260 degrees, 32 miles per hour 
21,000 feet, 260 degrees, 34 miles per hour
23,000 feet, 260 degrees, 32 miles per hour
25,000 feet, 260 degrees, 32 miles per hour

There were no testing devices nor radiosondes radio sent aloft between the hours of 0600 and 1200 hours, 15 August 1950, therefore, the wind aloft reading given between those hours represent probable instrument errors.
The further recordings of winds aloft on 15 August 1950 from 1200 to 1800 hours, were: wind 250 degrees, 15 knots oa surface, and continued to the highest altitude 25,000 feet, 260 degrees, 32 miles per hour.
