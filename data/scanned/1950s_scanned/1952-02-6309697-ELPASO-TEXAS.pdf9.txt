The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, describing the evaluation of 35 mm negatives.

SUBJECT: Evaluation of 35 mm negatives
DETERMINATION OF THE SIZE OF 35 MM NEGATIVES: The determination of the size of 35 mm negatives was made under magnification, and the following specifications were established:

The film of each picture that the negatives contain is of standard 35 mm motion picture film, being 0.975 inches in width. When viewed under reflected light, the frames measure 0.945 inches on the long side and 0.630 inches on the short side.

THE CENTER OF THE FILM IS IN PERFECT FOCUS, so much so that should be caused by sticking of the film during the processing and enlargement, but the fault seems to be inherent in the original negatives.
