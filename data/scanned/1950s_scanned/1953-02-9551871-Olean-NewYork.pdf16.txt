BASIC DATA

FROM: CAPT J. BYRNE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, INVESTIGATION SECTION, DIRECTORATE OF AIR INTELLIGENCE, HEADQUARTERS USAF
TO: COMMANDING GENERAL, AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB,
DAYTON, OHIO
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AIR OBJECT

Object, Olean, New York.
OBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED AIR OBJECT

1. Investigations conducted by the air Force relative to this sighting indicate the following:

a. Incident due to delay in transmission of report by the reporting agency. Activity was observed at 2330I, 29 Jan 53 and the report was not received at ATIC until 2 Feb 53.

b. It is believed the object sighted was a regular aircraft. This opinion is based on the fact that a report from a reliable source (oil company employee) stated he observed the object passing over his place of employment at the same time as the reported sighting. He described it as an aircraft with flashing rotating lights.

c. Apparently the aircraft was observed under unusual atmospheric conditions, probably an
inversion, which would distort the appearance of the aircraft.

d. All necessary reports and statements have been reviewed and it is considered that no further action is required. This office is closing its file on this incident.
