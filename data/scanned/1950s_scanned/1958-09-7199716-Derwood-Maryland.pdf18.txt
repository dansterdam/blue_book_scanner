The light from the same vantage point as Sgt Ferris and Pvt Scanloh for about 10 minutes, also maneuvering and fluctuating. It was also along the plotted azimuth. It appeared to come from a point low on the horizon, climb up to the right back down again. From the main gate it could not be seen.
A little after this a light, apparently the same as that earlier, was seen moving to the left (south) of the single white light. This light was observed through binoculars and its intensity was fluctuating. At times it appeared quite bright and at others very dim, almost fading out. All lights, however, had a fluctuating quality.
As daylight saturated the area, details became harder to make out. The same object was still seen through binoculars but its fluctuations made it difficult to obtain a good look at it.
At 2230 hours - After checking the intensity of the lights I now observed that the lights intensity had faded considerably. The object was still there but much harder to observe due to the high degree of illumination from the rising sun. Shortly after 2300 hours, the object disappeared completely.
At 2330 hours - The object reappeared and its intensity was again fluctuating. It appeared to be about 30 degrees northeast of our position. At times it would glow brightly and then fade almost completely out. This fluctuating continued up until about 0330 hours.
At times during the night the object appeared to be as bright as the brightest star in the sky.
