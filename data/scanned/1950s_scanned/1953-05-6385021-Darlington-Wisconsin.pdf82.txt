The image contains a photograph or diagram that appears to be related to the report. It shows a diagram with various labeled locations, including "Darlington", "D. Monroe", and "Chicago". There is also some handwritten text at the top and bottom of the image.

It was determined that the path of the object in question across the sky, its position at appearance and disappearance, very closely paralleled the path of the planet Venus on 31 May 1953. Venus on this day rose at 0310 CST and was at its approximate maximum brilliancy. Under ideal weather conditions it can be seen in the daytime, although this is rare. The fact that GCI personnel sighted it at night and that the object participated for daylight observation allowed them to keep it under constant surveillance. 

Reports that the object maneuvered radically usually came from persons driving in cars while observing the object. If Venus is stared at for any length of time without any balancing reference point, it can appear to perform erratic maneuvers.

GCI personnel alerted the Chicago filter center and jets were scrambled to investigate. This was during daylight observation and the jets, although vectored toward the object by visual directions from Darlington, were unable to locate the unknown.
