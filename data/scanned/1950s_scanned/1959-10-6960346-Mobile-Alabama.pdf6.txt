The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text describing a sighting of a satellite passing over the crater Copernicus on the moon. The key details provided in the text are:

- The satellite passed over the crater Copernicus on the way around. It was impossible to determine whether the object or its shadow was being observed.
- The average time of orbit was 6 minutes, and the object was seen every night.
- On November 9, the satellite either greatly increased its speed or was pursued by another object of similar likeness as a "double image" was seen. The object has not been seen since.
- A letter of inquiry to the Smithsonian Institute revealed they had not seen the object, but said such an object was reported.
