SUMMARY: (Unidentified Flying Object (FLYOBJECT): Project Blue Book. 
a. Collected for evidence and details evaluation. See through the rhodolite. 
b. Neither the small nor the object could be seen by the naked eye at 20,000 feet and 20,000 feet with visibility as twenty-five miles.
c. A one hundred green fireball would not be expected to burst below 30,000 feet and possibly not until 40,000 feet or higher, depending upon the pressure. There was no associated sound or blast effect. In his opinion the only possibility of a phenomena would be an optical illusion or possible in the land of the iceodlite.
