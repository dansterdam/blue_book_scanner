UFO Sighting. Mrs. (Sheffield Lake, Ohio)

1. Is in evident to the only explanation available to the so-called private UFO investigators, is that she saw a "space ship".  To these individuals, including Mrs. , she saw a "flying saucer" and nothing we can say will change their way of thinking.  

2. According to the Lorain Coast Guard Station log, the weather throughout the early morning of 21 September 1958 was alternately misting and raining.

Just prior to, or after, her sighting she decided to check with her neighbors to see if they had observed a similar object.  It was determined a train did pass in the neighborhood at about the time of her sighting, having a headlight that made a figure eight oscillation.

4. AUTO retains its original position to stand on the conclusions in this case. Mrs. 's story is not accepted and the victim or on the failure.
