The photograph displays a large metal tower, possibly an electricity pylon, with a curved ladder structure visible along its side. Beneath the tower and slightly shadowed, there appears to be a parked truck. In the sky to the left of the tower, there are small artifacts that might be interpreted as aerial objects or anomalies. The sky around these objects has a textured appearance typical of old or degraded film.
