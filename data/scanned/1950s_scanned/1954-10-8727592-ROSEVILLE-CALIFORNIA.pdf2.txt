The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a UFO index card that provides details about a UFO sighting. The card includes information such as the date, location, type of observation, source, number of objects, and conclusions of the sighting. The final comment states that analysis by Colorado college indicated the substance to be spider webs.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:
