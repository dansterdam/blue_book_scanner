I first saw this object while making my last round, around 4:30 a.m., as I might normally expect to see a satellite during the morning hours. It seemed to be hovering or just moving very slowly. I watched it for several minutes and it seemed to be illuminated, somewhat round in shape, and metallic looking. It seemed to be larger than a normal satellite and was traveling from the northwest to the southeast. It appeared to be at an altitude of about 20,000 to 30,000 feet. I could not determine the size, but it seemed big enough that I should have been able to see some detail on it if it was closer. After watching it for 3 or 4 minutes, it suddenly accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared from my sight. I think it must have been a vehicle of some kind, but I have no idea what it was. I am familiar with many types of aircraft, satellites, and other objects that I might see in the sky, but this did not seem to be any of those things. It was a very strange and unexplained observation.
