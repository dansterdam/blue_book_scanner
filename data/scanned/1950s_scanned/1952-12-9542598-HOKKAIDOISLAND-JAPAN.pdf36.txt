ATIC SUMMARY OF THIS INCIDENT:
On December 7, 1952, the Air Force radar station in northern Japan received a call stating that a flying saucer had been sighted. An Air Force pilot was immediately scrambled to investigate. After searching the area, the pilot was unable to visually establish contact with the object. However, the radar station had tracked the object for a considerable period of time, indicating that it was a genuine aerial phenomenon.

The Director of Intelligence of the Far East Air Force, Brigadier General John A. Samford, stated in an official report that the object was definite and under positive radar control and was asked to try an interception. Attempts to make visual contact through two fighter aircraft failed, as the object apparently accelerated rapidly and disappeared from both radar and visual observation. Pilots state they were "unable to close within 20 miles" of the object.

This sighting was corroborated by other radar stations in the vicinity and by aircrews flying at the time. The official conclusion of the investigating Air Force officers was that this incident involved a genuine unidentified flying object and was worthy of detailed investigation.
