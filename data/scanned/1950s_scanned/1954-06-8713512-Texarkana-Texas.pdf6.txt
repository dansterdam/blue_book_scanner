Statement: Mr. Lloyd T. Prewitt, 3 June 1954.

Q. What was the weather condition at the time you saw the object coming over?
A. It was cloudy overhead with a heavy dark cloud in the northeast that had passed north of us, trailing some out of it.

Q. You have been in the service?
A. No, I was called out. I was not up ready to go, but I did not go.

Q. Exactly what type of noise was it that the object made?
A. Similar to those sky rockets that go up and make a shriek, only it was more prominent and had more buzz to it.

Q. Did anything else see the object?
A. My wife only saw the light. She became frightened from the light and the explosion that followed.

Q. Did you mention this to anyone else in the morning?
A. I mentioned it to the man next door who resides with me. Mr. White. He spoke of hearing the explosion and it jarred his house, but he thought it was lightning that struck. I believe he said his wife had noticed a light just before the explosion. He also mentioned it to a dispatcher who works at the air base. He has been in the service. And to a dispatcher who works at his residence. He thought it was lightning.

Q. When did you know of the explosion on the Arsenal?
A. Definitely, I did not know until I returned in my insurance papers this morning, other than hearing a rumor of a small explosion and knew something had blown up.
