PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 14 February 1957
2. LOCATION: Stead AFB, Nevada
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1:42/0932
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: 
Ground-Radar 
D Air-Visual
5. COURSE: Control Tower Cp
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Two hours
8. DESCRIPTION: One object shape flat plane, oval, size of dime at arm's length, ring of orbit with red flashing light flashing at 2 or 3 seconds interval. Object appeared to be two starred shapes placed face to face. Object stationary about 5 minutes then shot off towards horizon extremely fast.
9. CONCLUSIONS: 
Was Probably Balloon
Possibly Aircraft
Possibly Astronomical
Other: The fact that the object did not appear to move for 2 minutes and served through binoculars (which would make a star ARCTURUS out of focus) and AFIT's check that bright star ARCTURUS was in the position and as the object faded, the movement of the clouds between the object and star would give an appearance of flashing & odd colors.
