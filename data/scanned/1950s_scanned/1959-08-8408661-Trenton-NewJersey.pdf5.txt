The shared image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed letter from the Air Technical Intelligence Center of the United States Air Force regarding a UFO report. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

1. Reference your letter, dated 10 September 1959, subject: "Report of Unidentified Flying Objects". The source states objects traveled two or three minutes, apparently to the north. More than 50 degrees for a short time, eight to ten times in the first 25 minutes. What type of turn did the objects perform? What was the elevation of the objects above the surrounding terrain? Was the object observed continuously without a break for the full 50 minutes? In what part of Trenton was source located?

2. Request any other pertinent information relative to this sighting, not already reported, be included in your report.
