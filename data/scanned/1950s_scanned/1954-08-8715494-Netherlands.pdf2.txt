RE: RICHARD.M.H.

The text on the document reads:
WE DID GET THIS INFORMATION FROM REV. RICHARD M.H. ON H AUGUST 54 - HE HAD BROUGHT OUT PICTURES BUT WE 
WERE UNABLE TO GET THEM DUE TO THE FOLLOWING REASON: WHEN THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED IT PASSED AT TREMENDOUS SPEED 
AND WAS GONE, SO QUICKLY THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET A PICTURE. POSSIBLE WEATHER BALLOON, BUT INVESTIGATOR THINKS NOT.
