There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document, possibly a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

10 minutes. Then, all of a sudden, it turned on one edge, like a plate on a wall, and VANISHED!
I say "vanished" because never, in all my life, have I seen anything more so fast. My husband and I have mentioned this many times, and agree that the speed with which this object disappeared into the distance was indescribable, inconceivable, if not actually impossible!
It reminded me a little, but only a little, of the movie cartoon which shows one person chasing another up a road. Suddenly...what!....both are out of sight. But even this, which seems funny to audiences because it is such an exaggeration, would seem slow by comparison with our UFO.
As it vanished, it held the position I have mentioned, turned on one edge like a plate on a wall, or on a sideboard. We could no longer see the aperture, or the smoke (?) wisps.
More than once we have tried to estimate the size of the UFO and its distance from us. This is hard to do, since events moved so rapidly, and we can only agree that it was "quite close" to us and that it was "very, VERY large." I have read many journalistic ideas about little green men flying around in little saucer-machines, but had no such impression of this "saucer machine."
Most accounts say the witnesses were "terrified"......."transfixed with horror"........."speechless with fear"......and so on. (For a journalistic Esperanto, perhaps.) It does seem natural to feel frightened by such an "abnormal" sight, but my husband and I felt no fear whatever, nor any apprehension whatever. We didn't see any.
