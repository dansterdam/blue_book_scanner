Strange Lights Flash, Dance Over 11 Towns In Indiana
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug, 7—(Special)—Strange flying objects were reported in the skies over at least 11 Indiana towns between 12:10 a.m. and 2:40 a.m. this morning. according to Area Police and monitoring stations.
The objects were reportedly seen and reports came from Anderson, Alexandria, Elwood, Kokomo, Greenwood, Muncie, Pendleton, Fortville, Columbus, and Shelbyville. 
In between these were sighted in various towns, including Hartford City, Tipton, Alexandria, Elwood, Kokomo, Greenwood, Shelbyville, Muncie, Pendleton, Fortville and Columbus. 
Observers reported the objects were traveling at high speeds, varying from "hovering" to "darting away" at tremendous speeds. They were described as brightly lighted objects varying in color from white to orange which would blaze a trail and then suddenly disappear and reappear at another location.
An Anderson policeman, Don Anderson, said he saw an object at 1:45 a.m. which was "perfectly round and had a small red light in the center" which traveled at an estimated speed of 500 m.p.h.  
The Greenwood police car reported having a close encounter with one of the objects at about 2:15 a.m.  The object hovered close to the police car and emitted a bright blinding light that made it impossible for the officer to see. The object then raced away at tremendous speed.
As yet, no agency had an explanation for the phenomena.
