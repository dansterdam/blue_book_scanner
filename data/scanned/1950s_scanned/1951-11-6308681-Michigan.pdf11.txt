STATUS REPORT #2

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:

On 7 November 1951, two military observers saw an unidentified aerial object from four separate locations in southern Michigan. The object was observed traveling at a relatively low altitude (2,000 to 3,000 feet). The object was observed for approximately five minutes and during this time was tracked by radar. No sound was heard by any of the observers. In each case the observers lost sight of the object when it disappeared behind trees or buildings. 

Additional information is given below and is indicated with more data on location of sightings. It will be noted that these are only the incidents tracked.

Location  |  Time  |  Shape  |  Color  |  Trail  |  Source  |  Altitude (ft)  |  Duration (min)

Selfridge AFB  |  12:20 B  |  Egg  |  White  |  Red  |  USAF  |  2,000  |  1

Chelsea AFB  |  13:30 B  |  Toothpick  |  White  |  Orange  |  USAF  |  1-30  |  1

Battle Creek  |  13:4 B  |  Oval  |  White  |  -  |  USAF  |  2,000  |  1-30

Grand Rapids  |  13.4 B  |  Round  |  White  |  None  |  USAF  |  2,000  |  - 

Coopersville  |  13.4 B  |  Round  |  Multilite  |  None  |  USAF  |  30-40  |  Operator

II. DETAILS
CASE EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR AT ALL POINTS OF OBSERVATION.

III. ANALYSIS OF INVESTIGATION:
The possibility of jet aircraft in the area, identified radar returns, and the nature of the sightings indicates that all the observers observed the same object. Where and how this object was tracked and observed is consistent with an unidentified aerial craft or flying object.
