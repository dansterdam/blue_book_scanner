The image does not contain any photographs, but rather contains sketches and illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and "B" marked on it, and instructs the viewer to imagine that the object was above the horizon when first seen, and then below the horizon when last seen. The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with an "A" and "B" marked to indicate the positions of the object when first and last seen. There is also a smaller inset sketch showing a more simplified version of the landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
