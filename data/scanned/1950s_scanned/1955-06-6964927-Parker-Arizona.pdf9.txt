UNUSUAL. HOWEVER, THE EXTREME DISTURBANCE OF AIRCRAFT MAGNETIC AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION. TWO OTHER INCIDENTS SIMILAR TO THAT EXPERIENCED BY THE T-33 HAVE OCCURRED TWICE IN THE PAST CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS IN THE SAME LOCATION. EACH TIME, THIS RAPID FLUCTUATION HAS BEEN ABLE TO SERIOUSLY INTERRUPT HEADINGS OF THE AIRCRAFT AND POSSIBLE TRAGEDY HAS BEEN AVOIDED. THE T-33 (AF 51652-2) MENTIONED HEREIN CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE GREAT ERROR IN HIS INSTRUMENT READINGS THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE FLIGHT. CONTINUAL NEW READINGS WERE GIVEN THE PILOT FROM THIS RADAR STATION UNTIL THE DESTINATION, NORTON AFB SAN BERNARDINO, CALIF. WAS REACHED. THE PILOT OF THE T-33 STATED THAT HE HAD HAD NO OTHER NAVIGATIONAL DIFFICULTY PRIOR TO APPROACHING THE TOWN OF VIDAL, CALIF.

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS SOME ELECTRO-MAGNETIC OR MAGNETIC ATTRACTION IN THE VICINITY OF VIDAL, CALIF. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT IT IS NOT A NATURAL ATTRACTION, BUT A COINCIDENCE OF AN UNUSUAL SIGHTING (AS CONFIRMED BOTH GROUND AND AIRBORNE PERSONNEL) SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE PILOTS EXPERIENCING GROSSLY ERRATIC INSTRUMENT READINGS, IS TOO GREAT TO BE JUST A MERE COINCIDENCE.
