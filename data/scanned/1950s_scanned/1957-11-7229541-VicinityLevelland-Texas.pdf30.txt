The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing the results of investigations related to "intensive investigations" and information about "lightning or flashes of light". The text discusses details about the investigations, including that the source of the lightning or flashes of light could not be identified by the investigators.

a. Intensive investigations produced information not generally given by such items, and other media previously. For example: certain physical evidence indicating definite objects in the sky were found. Traces of substances, unusual markings, and impressions were found on the ground at points where sightings took place.

b. At the time of certain sightings, a distance and direction from the observer of the lightning or flashes of light. The time source could not be determined by the investigators.

c. After extensive studies and analyses by the Air Force, and other scientific organizations and agencies, it was concluded that the sightings were due to a very rare and undoubtedly natural phenomena or combinations of phenomena, such as the interaction of peculiar and hitherto unknown electrical or electronic field disturbances or associated ionization effects. It was indicated that the electromagnetic reactions and disturbances may have interfered or blanketed normal electrical and electronic systems (in all areas) for a short period during the investigations.
