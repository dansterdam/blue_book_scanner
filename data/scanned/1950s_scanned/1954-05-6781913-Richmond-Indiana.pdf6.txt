The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

ORIGIN-AGENCY
UFO SIGHTING (24 MAY 1954)
SAFOJ-34 (MAJOR TRACKER)

1. The sighting referred to in the attached letter from Mr. Taylor is carried in the ATIC file as a reflection.
2. The object was very distinctive overhead and the witness was sure enough to get a photograph (the aircraft from which this sighting took place had photography equipment).
3. While there are certain errors in the reporting, which can probably be attributed to the first excitement of the observer, the photograph, when compared with the data and the position of the B-17, leaves no doubt that the object is a reflection of the airplane.
