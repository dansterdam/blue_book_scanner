But when someone claims to have made contact with beings from other worlds, then things become quite different and serious, even if ostensibly so, get first page treatment.

On August 15, 1957, practically all newspapers in Sao Paulo published the story of a Mr. Amadeu Guilherme da Silva, a farmer living near Bauru, Brazil, who claimed to have been in contact with beings from another world. The incident happened as follows:

On that date, Guilherme was working in his cornfield when he noticed a strange object descending from the sky nearby. It was metallic, about 4 meters in diameter and 3 meters high, resting on three "telescopic-like" landing gears. Guilherme approached the object and saw two human-like beings, about 1.50 meters high, with yellowish skin, dressed in tight-fitting silvery outfits. They seemed to be making adjustments on the exterior of the object. Guilherma tried to speak to them, but they did not answer. Instead, one of the beings raised his hand and Guilherme felt a strange sensation, as though he was paralyzed. Suddenly, the beings re-entered the object, the landing gears retracted, and the object took off rapidly, disappearing into the sky.

Soon afterwards, Guilherme's story was confirmed by two other witnesses, who claimed to have seen the same object and the two beings. The incident received wide publicity in the Brazilian press and was reported in many parts of the world. Guilherme was interviewed by various newspapers and his story was considered credible by most of the reporters.

The trip lasted for 40 minutes and the craft landed about 60 meters from the witnesses. The author started vibrating and Guilherme rather afraid asked one of the witnesses if he had felt the same thing. The author got out of the craft and approached the witnesses, and Guilherme could see that they had passed a very dark zone "cloudy" with stars and flaming clouds and were now approaching a dome-like object in the distance. When the author returned to the craft, the dome-like object began to emit a bluish light, which according to the witnesses meant that the author had been in communication with those inside. When the author re-entered the craft, the craft took off rapidly, disappearing in the distance.

Analyzing reporters' questions, Guilherme said that these were five people watching the scene. The craft's outer surface seemed very fragile, and the witnesses were afraid to get too close. It was difficult to say whether they were men or women.
