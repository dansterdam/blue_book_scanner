On 6 Nov. 57 at about 1900 hours (7:00 p.m.) local time, Major D.H. and Capt. H.W. while on an aerial reconnaissance over North Korea in an F-84 aircraft, observed a bright white light in the sky. The light appeared to be approximately 15-20 miles distant hovering or suspended motionless at about 5,000 to 10,000 feet altitude. The light was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes. 
During the time of observation, the light appeared to give off a pulsating or flashing effect. No sound was heard and no trail or exhaust was visible. The light then suddenly accelerated and rapidly climbed out of sight, disappearing from view.
