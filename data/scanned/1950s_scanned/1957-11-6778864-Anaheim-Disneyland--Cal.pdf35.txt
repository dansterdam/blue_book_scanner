The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying object (UFO) reports. The document is a "Joint Messageform" that describes a review and analysis of an Anaheim UFO case, which was passed on to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense and then to the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) on Saturday morning, November 9, 1957. The message indicates that an extensive search by a UFO unit on Saturday morning disclosed no knowledge or receipt of the incident, and that the photos of the incident were shown on both Friday and Saturday nights on nationwide TV hook-up.
