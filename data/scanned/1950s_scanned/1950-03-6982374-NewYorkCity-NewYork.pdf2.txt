The image appears to be a black-and-white photograph of a nighttime cityscape. The scene shows a bright cloud or smoke-like formation in the sky over a city skyline. The cityscape below is dark, but the lights of the buildings can be seen reflecting off the water. The image has a somewhat grainy, vintage appearance.

REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. On the evening of 27 March 1956, at approxi-
mately 20:30 Eastern Standard Time, the under-
signed and several other persons observed an un-
identified flying object over the city of New York.
2. The object was first observed in the southwest
sky, moving in a northeasterly direction. It ap-
peared as a bright, glowing light, brighter than the
surrounding stars. The object was observed for ap-
proximately 5 minutes, during which time it main-
tained a steady course and speed, and did not change
in appearance or size. At the end of this period, the
object disappeared from view, seeming to ascend
rapidly into the upper atmosphere.
3. The weather at the time of the observation was
clear, with scattered clouds and a half moon. Visi-
bility was generally good.
4. No sound was heard from the object, and it
appeared to be at a high altitude, estimated to be
between 10,000 and 20,000 feet.
5. In the opinion of the undersigned, the object
observed was an unidentified flying object, the
nature of which could not be determined. It did
not resemble any conventional aircraft or other
known object in the sky.
