There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old report document related to Project Blue Book, containing text describing a sighting of lights in the sky.

This X-formation, disappearing from view, without sound, over the horizon. This was a semi-circle form as well to the north of the observer, of lights, which appeared to be located on the east side of the horizon. The lights seem to have followed around the curve of the horizon, without a break in the line of lights, as the observer turned off as advance of travel occurred. At the time, September 15, 1952, the object 7-1-1952- was a semi-circle form as well, on the north side of observer, of lights, which seemed to be located on the east side of the horizon. The movement of the individual lights in the manner reported seems to indicate a central movement of the semi-circle, rather than individual flight of the lights. At its time, it gave the impression of a group of satellite lights revolving around a common center. There were no additional flights or lights, either before or after the incident, as observed by the observer. This flight of lights was observed in the southern sky, following the course of flight and did not disappear over the horizon, but simply vanished from view at a point indicating elevation and passed from view without passing over the horizon.
