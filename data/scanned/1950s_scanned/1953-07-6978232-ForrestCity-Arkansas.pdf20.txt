The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten report from the U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet. The text in the report describes a sighting of a small light in the sky that seemed to change in size and distance as the observer watched it. The report notes that the light was difficult to estimate the distance of, but it was observed for some time.

The text in the document is as follows:

Could still if was travelling as it only had a lead way to give a definite as it wandless
looked like as he continued the distance as to what it with the distance
of the time of day
