The image provided does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The document is titled "Trinidade Island" and lists the date as "16 Jan 1958" and the source as "Almirante S.Galhane Areco".

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the full text found in the document:

16 Jan 1958 Trinidade Island
