No Case (Information Only)

4 April 1957
West Freugh, Wigtownshire
Scotland

April 4, 1957. At an RAF station near West Freugh, Wigtownshire, in southwestern Scotland, three radar operators at two posts independently tracked an "unidentified object" which "flashed across their screens traveling at 60,000 feet. The operators said the object suddenly dived to a height of 14,000 feet, made two whirls, then vanished to the south. It was last reported seen heading toward the Isle of Man." (UP declared that "officials refused to say in which direction and at what speed it was traveling.") "We do not know what the object was," an Air Ministry spokesman said. "Intelligence experts are studying the report and a detailed statement may be made next week." (UP also stated that "a mystery object spotted on radar screens in Scotland may have been a Soviet reconnaissance plane.") Royal Air Force officials said no planes were in the area at the time. Unofficial sources described it as "too fast, too big, and too manoeuverable for a plane." Full reports of the incident were turned in to the Air Ministry in London. It was stated officially that "their experts take a serious view" of such reports. No further details have been forthcoming. -- N.Y. Journal-American, Apr. 6 (INS); N.Y.
