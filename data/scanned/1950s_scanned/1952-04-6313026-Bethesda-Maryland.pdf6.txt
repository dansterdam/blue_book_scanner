There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a typed document containing text related to a UFO report. I will now provide the text found in the document:

ALL OBJECTS UNIFORM IN SIZE AND COLOR. 
DESCRIBED AS ORANGE YELLOW - COLOR LIKE SOURCES. 
CLOSER TO ORANGE THAN YELLOW - DISC SHAPED IN 
LATERAL PLANE BUT COULD NOT ASCERTAIN SHAPE.
