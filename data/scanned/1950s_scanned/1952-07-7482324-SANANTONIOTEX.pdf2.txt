which this letter was received and in regard to the sight of a formation of so-called discs of lights which were seen hovering over the same field. I understand that this matter was quite unusual and I would appreciate for one to investigate in every way possible just what was behind it. The details were that three or four of the discs of light were seen hovering for several minutes and then quickly disappeared. The sequence of the lights seemed to be somewhat irregular and had no pattern that could be discerned. Of course. The sequence and maneuverability to the discs has long been a subject of interest as well as considerable speculation in circles interested in the phenomenon. Indeed the information contained in your letter seems to be quite typical of many sightings reported over the years. There are no apparent inconsistencies and the report appears to be straightforward and objective. I would of course appreciate any further details that you might be able to provide regarding this sighting just what was observed in your own words and an indication of the reliability of the witness or witnesses. This would be of great value in evaluating the report. There was no indication of any photographic evidence being available. If you have any such evidence I would certainly be interested in examining it. In any event. I appreciate your calling this to my attention and I will be glad to pursue the matter further with you if you care to provide any additional information.
