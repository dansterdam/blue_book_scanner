Statement of . . .
Date: Ol Anted Air Force Base, Middletown, Penna.

On 9 March 1954, while on duty in the Operations Building at Olmsted Air Force Base, Middletown, Penna., the operator on duty in the control tower reported to him that he had observed a target which appeared to be a flying object. The operator stated that he had tracked the target on the radat scope for approximately 15 minutes. 
The target was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet and traveling at an estimated speed of 700 miles per hour. The target would disappear from the radar scope and then reappear. While the target was visible, it was observed to make an abrupt 90 degree turn.

At 2330 hours the target disappeared from the radar scope and was not picked up again. An entry of this sighting was entered in the air traffic control log.

If we consider the authenticity of this report, we must take into account the military background and training of the observer, the technical capabilities of the radar equipment involved, and the nature of the reported object's maneuvers, all of which appear to be beyond the performance characteristics of any known aircraft. However, this report must be considered in conjunction with other similar reports, if any, in order to determine whether or not it represents reliable evidence of an unidentified flying object.
