The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page includes a narrative of events relating to a UFO sighting in Sylacauga, Alabama on November 6, 1954.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"Radio Station WCOH in Neunan reported numerous calls from persons who said they saw an unidentified flaming object in the sky.

"A Civil Aeronautics Adm'r. employee in Montgomery saw the falling meteor. He described it as 'a bright light like the trailing end of a meteor's tail which fell across the horizon from a great height.'

"A Maxwell Air Force pilot who was flying at high altitude also sighted it and gave a similar description.

"National Guard Sgt. Joe Clark of Elba was with the Guard in Phenix City.

"In Sylacauga, the descriptions of the explosions were as varied as the persons who heard it.

"No come, it was just loud 'boom, boom, boom'.

"Others heard small crackling noises and popping sounds between the big explosions.

"A Sylacauga city councilman, B. J. Phillips said it sounded like thunder to him. 'He said the sights during the explosion occurred.'

"Being the first person to be hit by a falling meteorite was of almost no moment to her when asked how she felt about the dubious honor, she said: 'I feel bruised.'

"It was only when the stars fell on Alabama at last."
