On August 27, 1958 - while vacationing at our summer home located in East 10 Way, N.H. - my family and I decided to go to an auction to be held in Deerfield, N.H. - on our return trip - this is when the incident is said to have occurred. As we came home the elevation of the hill seemed quite high - around 1100 ft. as we drew on the side and along the edge of the valley - then the noise started - it seemed to be a sharp whistling sound - that kept getting louder and louder - finally it seemed as if a tremendous force were right over our car - shook the car violently - then the noise went away to the east - after about 150 yards - all that seemed to happen in about 30 seconds - my wife and I felt something brushed the side of the car - as if a strong wind or something had - the whole family was terrified - as soon as we got home we reported this to the Air Force base at Pease - N.H. - One Sunday after Mass we sighted what we believe was the same object - it was larger, circular in shape, and a very steady light - about as big as a car headlight and about 30 ft. above the ground - and then as we watched it just took off at a tremendous rate of speed.
