AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: CLEVELAND
REPORT NO.: 2253
DATE: 9 JUNE 1952

1. On 22 June 1952, the Air Intelligence officer was notified that a flight of jet aircraft had received a visual sighting of an unidentified object on 20 June 1952. The object was sighted in the vicinity of Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, at approximately 1500 hours local time. 

The object was first observed at an approximate altitude of 20,000 feet. It was traveling in an easterly direction at an estimated speed of 500 knots. The object passed under the flight of jet aircraft at an estimated distance of 3 to 5 miles. No unusual maneuvers were observed and the object appeared a bright red or orange in color.

No confirmation can be made as to the origin or identity of the object. Its speed and reported altitude are considered beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. It is believed that the object was not a natural phenomenon such as a meteor or a reflection from some surface. At the present time, no conclusive evidence can be established as to the nature of this sighting.

No other sightings of a similar nature were reported in the area at the time of this incident.
