While on routine patrol and disc-like in shape. The objects were in a circular formation. The pilots and visual observers down each described seeing a group of similar formations, about 8 to 10 in number, approximately 3 miles in diameter and flying at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. The objects moved in a counterclockwise pattern but the speed between each object appeared to be a constant with no irregularity in formation.

The objects were observed for about 15 minutes. At one point they were lost from view due to cloud coverage but reappeared shortly thereafter. When first observed the objects gave off a bluish-white glow which seemed illuminated from within. This glow diminished somewhat after the first few minutes but the objects still appeared illuminated. The motion of the objects was described as smooth and even, with no change in altitude or speed noted.

The report indicates that the objects were sighted by 4 pilots and 3 visual observers, all of whom are considered reliable and experienced personnel. No explanation is given for the sighting, and the report concludes by stating that "the objects could not be identified as any known type of aircraft." The report is dated April 3, 1952.
