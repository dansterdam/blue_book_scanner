The image appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, specifically a memo routing slip dated November 6, 1957. The document does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Text from the document:

1. This subject is directly by MCPD, ADC, regarding the flying saucer sighted over the Gulfport area and any immediate action taken.
2. The memo has been routed as indicated on the routing slip and appears to recommend further investigation and analysis of this sighting.
3. A further explanation and analysis would appear to be warranted by the Air Forces D.I.C.
