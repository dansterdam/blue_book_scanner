SAUCER MARGINALIA... A Review of Significant Sightings Collected by CRIFÃ’
March 9, 1954, 3:57 A.M. Sighter: John H. Stewart of Cincinnati, Ohio. Owns pilot's license; 6,500 hours military flying time. 
While driving north on Paddock Road under a dark, moonless sky, Stewart saw a bright, white, circular object moving slowly in a straight line. It was moving slightly erratically and appeared to be definitely solid, looking much like a conventional aircraft. 
The object hovered for seven or eight minutes over Cincinnati's General Electric plant, stopping at times and then continuing its uniform motion. It would sometimes appear to be larger than a DC-6.
While trying in vain to find someone to verify his sighting, Stewart said the brilliant white object suddenly changed color and "rapidly shot eastward" and disappeared in seconds - apparently in an upward, almost vertical climb. No sound was heard, no vapor trail visible.
