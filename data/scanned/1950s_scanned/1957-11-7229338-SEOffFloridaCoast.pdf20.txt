COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that SOURCE possibly witnessed an optical phenomenon for the following reasons:

a. The object does not remotely meet identification criteria for aircraft, balloons, meteors, stars or planets.

b. Although the reported color of the object is consonant with that of ball lightning, the fantastic speed of the unidentified object rules out that possibility.

 c. The reported shape, lack of trail and sound, incredible speed and other reported conditions are in harmony with the theory of an optical illusion.

2. It would be manifestly impossible for SOURCE to have observed the object for as long as he stated if it were traveling at the estimated speed.

3. Due to the flat white sandy terrain, mirages cannot be considered unusual occurrences.
