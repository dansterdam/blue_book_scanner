(Unclassified) UNKNOWN SUBJECT: Balloon-shaped Object Reported at Stockton Naval Supply Annex, Stockton, California, 7 January 1951 - 5.40 AM.
Director of Intelligence, Dept. of Intelligence, Collection and Dissemination Branch.
Counter Intelligence Division, Directorate of Special Investigations, The Inspector General.

1. Reference is made to R2t dated 8 February 1951 in the above captioned matter.
2. The Air Material Command at Wright Field, Ohio, has made an analysis of the data submitted and reflects that the "balloon-shaped" object was probably a home-made "toy air" balloon. No fingerprints of value for comparison purposes were found on the bamboo ring and nothing of particular significance was noted with respect to the wires and other materials of construction which would indicate a probable source for these materials.
3. The Air Material Command has been informed of this matter.
