The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or drawing of an object. The sketch appears to be an outline or shape of an object, possibly a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. There is no arrow indicating the direction of movement.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound ______________
b. Color __Transparent & blurred___________

17. Draw a picture that will show the shapes of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
a. Circle or oval b. Fuzzy or blurred 
c. Like a bright star d. Sharply outlined e. Other ____________________________

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
