The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this page, which appears to be a Disposition Form. 

The text from the document is as follows:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.:  
SUBJECT: Continuation - Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object Photo
TO: AFOIIL-HSI
FROM: AFOIIL-HSF  
DATE: 9 Oct 57
COMMENT NO. 1:
1. The negatives mentioned in paragraph 3 of DD Form 96 have been examined and the following conclusions reached:
a. No evidence of exposure, which could mean that a time exposure was made.
b. The business does not signify that object was moving, but was caused by camera movement.
c. The negatives do not show enough detail to permit an accurate estimate of the size of the object. Full moon or its suggestion, was not identified.
