The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or report form, likely filled out by an observer of a UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It was in sight continuously from the time I had been looking at it as a star, then began to move across the sky. It took about two or three minutes to completely disappear, going off into the distance from me like a small dot, trailing off from the back.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):     Yes     No     Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):     Yes     No     Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - No sound - it moved very silently.
b. Color - White

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Since I saw it first as a star, I think it would have been entirely covered by a match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please be as precise as you can in indicating the direction in which the object was moving.
There is nothing I can draw - concerning its shape. I saw it first for a considerable length of time as a bright star - then as it approached nearer, it appeared to lose some of its brightness becoming more like a small impish light speeding by.
