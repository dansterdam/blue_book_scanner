AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
ITEM: 920 AGGP-52
DATE: 27 OCT 1952
PAGE: 5 OF 4

On the night of October 27, 1952, at approximately 19:47/I, an unidentified object was observed in the vicinity of Kyushu, Japan. The object appeared briefly before its disappearance. It was a self-illuminated body, spherical in shape, and approached rapidly from the south, emitting blue and yellow lights. The object appeared to be gliding and not powered by any visible means of propulsion. It remained visible for approximately one minute, then suddenly disappeared toward the northeast. It was impossible to judge its size or distance from the observer, but based on its rate of speed and apparent size, the object was estimated to be approximately 50 meters in diameter.
