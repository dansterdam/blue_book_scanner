INITIAL INQUIRY: This is an initial report.

A person at 0120 to 0125 hours, 23 February 1953, observed a yellow-orange tinged brilliant light at an altitude between 10-15 degrees above the horizon, approximately the size of a star. Its apparent motion indicated a downward path descending in angle from about 20 degrees to approximately 10 degrees, remaining in view for approximately 15 seconds. It apparently instantaneously disappeared. Maneuver, during travel, appeared to be accelerating descent, and there was no sound.
