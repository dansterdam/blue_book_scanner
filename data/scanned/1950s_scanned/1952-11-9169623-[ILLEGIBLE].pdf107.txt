The document appears to be a statement dated 15 November 1952, describing the sighting of an unidentified flying object by a pilot on that date.

The text in the document is as follows:

STATEMENT
15 November 1952

On 15 November 1952, I was pilot in a T-33 fighter jet of the 33rd FIS at Castle AFB, California, when at approximately 6:52 PM, I sighted an unidentified object at a distance of approximately 5 to 7 miles at my altitude of 30,000 feet. The object flew in a Southwesterly direction, directly into the sun and estimated to be at approximately 18,000 feet. The object was observed by the naked eye. I was not wearing sun glasses. Object was observed for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.
