SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
SUMMARY: AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED ON 12/03/00Z APPROXIMATELY OVER PARKERSBURG, OHIO. AIRBORNE FIGHTING WAS BY AVENGER WHITE FLIGHT. 3 P-61'S INTERCEPTED AT 28,000 FT. ROUND LIGHTING WAS ON SEARCH RADAR. REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS ALMOST CIRCULAR AND WAS OF ORANGE COLOR. THE PILOTS REPORT THAT THE OBJECT DID NOT MOVE AND ONLY CHANGE APPEARED TO BE IN RANGE. HOWEVER, THE OBJECT MOVED ERRATICALLY ON THE RADAR SCOPE AND WAS ESTIMATED AT A SPEED OF MUCH 1.5. IT REMAINED IN SIGHT FROM 20 TO 30 MINUTES. THE PILOT'S SIGHTING WAS THAT THE MOON AND THAT RADAR RESULTS WERE NOT THAT THE AIRCRAFT OR RADAR NOISE. CORRELATION BETWEEN RADAR OBSERVED POSITION AND PILOT SIGHTING INDICATE OTHERWISE.
