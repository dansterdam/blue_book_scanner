The image contains a black and white photograph of what appears to be an unidentified flying object in the sky. The object has a distinct shape, with a long, cylindrical body and what seems to be a tail or protrusion extending from it. The sky appears to be dark, with a few stars visible. The text below the image reads "Hadzeon ? Is up 8 feet View can see this" and "C-8" in the bottom right corner.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

Hadzeon ? Is up 8 feet View can see this
C-8
