(10) Appeared to be over barracks area of Little Rock AFB travelling in southeasterly direction. Only altitude estimate was that it was "extremely high up.‚Äù Does not recall seeing or hearing any planes in the area at the time and the unidentified object did not make any audible noise.

(11) Observations of the observer by the investigating officer indicated that he is a Negro, 44 years of age, who appeared conservative in his reporting of the incident and stated he hesitated to report it lest he be considered ready for a psychiatric analysis. His estimate of the size of the unidentified object is the only point when investigating officer felt observer was in doubt and although comparison was made of a star or a quarter or a dollar, he still persisted that it was about the length of a B-47 though traveling much too fast for any plane. The observer stressed that he saw no object but that the lights indicated a continuous bright white light followed immediately at the rear by a red light but this did not appear as a tail stream.
