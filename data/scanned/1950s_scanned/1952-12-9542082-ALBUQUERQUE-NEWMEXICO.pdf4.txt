The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with text and instructions for the observer.

Text from the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None
b. Color - The color that I could describe, gave off some light that a "bright landing light" does.

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and particularly adjust trails or vapor trails. Place a question mark (?) where any detail is uncertain.

When first came, while moving slowly, there was a no visible trail. But after 15 seconds it started to climb very rapidly. The trail was bright and steady. It remained on the scene for approximately 12 - 15 seconds on the northeast horizon.

18. The edges of the object were:
a. Clearly outlined b. Fuzzy or blurred c. Shimmering d. Sharply outlined e. Don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
