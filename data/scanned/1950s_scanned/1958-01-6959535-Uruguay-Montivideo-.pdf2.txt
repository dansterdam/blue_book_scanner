There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing text only.

Transcribed text:

There is only one observer in this case and for that reason we have to be very careful, especially if we take in account the characteristics of it.

The observer says he clearly saw (when the object reached its minimum altitude) a series of sparks or sparks from the "edge" or the circular fluorescence. This is the only doubtful detail in the whole report, as all the other ones are characteristic of a flying saucer.

This is one record in Uruguay as regards the saucer ring. In 1955 in the Department of Cerro Largo, Mr. BOCK a snapshot of a flying saucer with the same characteristics.

We would like to point out that the authenticity of that photo has been questioned and denied by many, as we think it worth while mentioning it.
