VOICE OF THE MILITARY
General Gordon W. Curry, U.S.A.F. (Ret.), former Navy missile chief, "Reliable reports seem to indicate that UFO's move and maneuver with such speeds as to indicate their motion is directed, not that of some freak within this natural law."
Colonel "FLYING SAUCERS" Albert M. Chop, former Air Force official who handled UFO information, "One thing is absolutely certain. UFOs are not imaginary..."
General George C. Kenney, former chief of the Strategic Air Command, "We're completed mystified. We have nothing concrete."
Commander R. W. Percy, U.S.N.R. Ret., electronics engineer for the Federal Communications Commission, "I believe that 1973 and subsequently are space ships from other advanced planets."
Carl Sandburg to say, the Tribune article author is quite aware of the prestige in the name. UFOs, it should also be stated that from this same document came the words, "I do not possess sufficient evidence which would enable me to draw definite conclusions." The evidence available, however, is convincing enough to assure a scientifically responsible investigation. "Such a scientific investigation, carried on with typical American energy, may be the means of changing stupid policy and one could invent. The public ought to be told the truth."
