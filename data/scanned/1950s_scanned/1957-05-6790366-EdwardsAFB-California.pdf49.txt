At 0755 hours we were traveling south in a pickup truck to Atlanta Genera Station to investigate a UFO sighting. As we approached the Georgia coast at about 1517 hours we sighted the object over the ocean. It was heading eastward at high speed and was not visible to the naked eye. By the time we got the binoculars on it, it disappeared from our view. It was estimated to be between 40 to 50 miles per hour in speed, and it disappeared in further easterly direction. It was estimated to be 50,000 feet in altitude. I further observed it was egg-shaped, silver in color, and about the size of a dime held at arm's length. There were some more falls of it. It was estimated to be 30 to 50 miles away when it disappeared. It was observed only for about 60 miles when it disappeared from sight.
