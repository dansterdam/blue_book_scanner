This agent was unable to make a definite attempt to get a definite fix on the object, due to the fact that it was not reported until after the sighting. Checks were made with the Base Weather Squadron, the Operations and Projects Sections, Holloman AFB, and the Research Branch at White Sands Proving Ground, and it was determined that no testing devices had been released which would account for the sighting.
