AT 1120 hours, 29 March 1952,an unidentified object was observed approximately 20 miles north of Misawa AFB. This sighting was made by an Air Force Pilot flying a T-6 type aircraft. This T-6 was traveling at 6,000' altitude, one heading of 0 degrees, at 130 knots. At the time of sighting, two F-84 type A/C were making practice runs on the T-Cgama maneuvering range. This object was first noticed by the pilot of the T-6 aircraft when it pulled abreast of him and reflected the sunlight. The object that had reflected the sunlight was a small, shiny disc-shaped object, and it appeared to make a pass at the F-84 at an estimated 40 to 50 MPH in excess of the F-84's airspeed. It closed rapidly and just before filing into his fuselage it decelerated rapidly to his airspeed almost instantaneously. In doing so, it flipped on its edge at approximately a 90 degree bank. It then fluttered within 20 feet of his fuselage for two or three seconds, and pulled away and around his starboard wing where it was caught in the slipstream behind the aircraft and flipped once. Then it passed him and flipped over. Then it passed him and flipped over. Then it passed him and flipped over. This maneuver crossed in front of him, and pulled away abruptly, appearing to accelerate and shot out of sight in a steep, almost vertical climb. The pilot of the F-84 didn't observe the object.

COMMENT: No further information has been forthcoming. No explanation for this sighting can be proposed other than the possible reflection and correction of light through the canopy of the observers aircraft.

CONCLUSION: UNSOLVED
