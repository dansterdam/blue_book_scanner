11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was travelling very fast. It moved in a straight line and I watched it for about 10 seconds. It was dark and all I could see was the light portion. It appeared as a small round light, very bright, but made no reflection on the clouds. No sound. Object broke into two distinct pieces and each became a dull colored light, then they disappeared. When it broke, the pieces kept going for a short distance on the level before they dropped slightly and went out without leaving sparks or any other visible trace.
