UFO Report from Mr. [REDACTED]

SAFIS-3, Major Tracker                               24 March 1958
AFCIN-EE

1. - Subject report has been reviewed. There appears to be three unrelated incidents involved.

2. Suggestions upon which to base a reply:
a. Air Force Science employees a number of reports from amateur astronomers or persons having telescopes who ask the Air Force to explain or identify objects observed in the sky.
b. These requests for assistance, if not impossible, is handled by contact with our national astronomical observatories etc., complete with exact time, location and identification based on the observer's data. Scientific and professional astronomers and sky observers almost invariably provide data without private communication.
c. January 3 sightings: We believe object was a bolide - a number were reported during that period.
