1. The Commander has just approved establishment of a volunteer force of 18-20 UFO investigators from personnel resources presently available to ATIC. This group will be locally trained and equipped, and will be used to perform primary or supplementary investigation of UFO sightings or the greatest scientific or public interest.
2. Due to remoteness of many areas of UFO sightings, tentative arrangements have been made to employ CAT aircraft and crews to move these people to and from the AF installation nearest to the point of sighting. Further support required will be provided by that installation as outlined in AFR 200-2 dated 5 February 1958.
3. It has been determined that TDY costs to support this investigative force will run in the order of $5000.00 per annum. (See basis for estimate attached hereto). These funds should be programmed and allocated as a separate entity to the Aerial Phenomena Group in support of the UFO Program. In this regard the Aerial Phenomena Group is attempting to compile valid cost data pertaining to overall USAF support of the UFO Program as stipulated in AFR 200-2. Such cost data obtained from all participating agencies plus ATIC will be used to force a decision on just how far the Air Force should go in the UFO Program when compared to all other programs essential to Air Force defense of the nation.
4. It is desired that you advise on the amount of TDY funds which could be made available in support of this program during the 3rd and 4th quarters of FY1959 and what if any problems you envision in allocating $5000.00 for support of this program during FY1960.
