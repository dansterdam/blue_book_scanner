SUBJECT: Information regarding Board of Inquiry, Washington D.C. 19 July 1957

Dear Sire: 

The Air Force is invited to a copy of a "telescope press release" concerning unidentified flying objects which were recently observed, and which were investigated in accordance with the standard investigative procedures. 

It is the further position of this office, that as a matter of current policy, this investigation was conducted in the light of informed opinions and not on the basis of hasty or ill-considered action. The confidentiality of the investigation and of the persons involved has been carefully guarded and it is not intended that this case be submitted to public discussion at this time except through the regular channels. 

However, should there be a desired complement to existing Air Force files involving unidentified aerial phenomena, it is suggested that the agency representing the Air Force contact this office, and arrange for examination of the file maintained by this Center. The cooperation of this office would be to the mutual benefit of all concerned.

Sincerely,

S/ Teel
