11. COMMENTS
This MOON was approaching 1/4 (first quarter) on 14th, sighting on 11th. Direction of obj and moon coincided. No witness indicated seeing obj drop out of moon. There was no meteorological condition, which could have distorted obj. Visual observation would not indicate radar interception of this moon. The radar persistency would be doubtful in direction of this moon. They radar point to prob unlikely visual observation of moon.
