UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
MISSION 10-6-51 A155  
A155-UFOB-387-57
SUBJECT: SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
1. On 25 June 1957 at 10:50 PM Pacific Standard Time, two observers, the Deputy Sheriff of Los Angeles County, California, and a private citizen, reported observing a bright light in the sky which appeared to be descending.
2. The object was observed for approximately 20 minutes. It appeared to be round or circular in shape and emitted a bright white light. The light pulsated at irregular intervals. The object hovered over the Griffith Park area of Los Angeles, California, for several minutes. It then moved in a northerly direction at high speed, and disappeared.
3. The observers stated that the object appeared to vary in size during the observation, as if it were expanding and contracting. It appeared to be at an estimated altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The observers estimated the size of the object to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter.
4. It is the opinion of the undersigned that the object observed was not a known aerial vehicle, and that its characteristics and behavior are unexplainable by any presently known aeronautical or astronomical phenomena.
