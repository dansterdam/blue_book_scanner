One of the TOW's on local flight missions was equipped with a searchlight, however, it
was not used during this particular operation. 
1. Observer and his wife did not return to Key West until 20 June and, since he
was on leave at the time, he did not report the incident until this date. According to
his statement, the sighting was reported to the base legal officer at the time it
occurred. This was approximately 2230 hours 19 June 1953, when the observer and his
wife observed an unidentified object at approximately 2,000 feet altitude hovering
in the air and the base legal officer was immediately notified. The object departed
in a north-northwesterly direction at a very fast speed, leaving no visible trail.
2. An interview was arranged at Key West on 1 July and it was decided that due to the
lack of any additional information or details to substantiate the observer's report,
this case could not be satisfactorily explained and must be classified as an
UNIDENTIFIED.
