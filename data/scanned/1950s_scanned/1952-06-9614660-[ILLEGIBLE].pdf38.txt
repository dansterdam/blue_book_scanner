SUMMARY: The sight ing occurred a t approx 0100L, 13 JUNE 1952. The officer, Major - and I can't identify the name of the other witness.
THE INFORMATION: Major - and an unidentified witness were on the flight line of an airbase in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area on the morning of 13 JUNE 1952. At approximately 0100L they observed an unidentified object which appeared to be hovering over the southeast quadrant of the base. The object was described as round, about the size of a B-36. It had a bluish-white glow and seemed to be descending slowly. After 5-10 minutes of observation, the object accelerated and departed at a high rate of speed, going out of sight in 5-10 seconds. During the time of observation, the object did not appear to make any sound.
EVALUATION: This incident is being reported as an UNIDENTIFIED flying object. The observers could not determine what the object was, and there is no logical explanation apparent at this time. The detailed description of the object and its observed movements indicate that it was not likely an aircraft, balloon, meteor, or any other natural phenomenon. There is an apparent inconsistency in the time of observation (5-10 minutes) and the high speed departure (5-10 seconds). Additional information may be available which could clarify this point.
CONCLUSION: IN ACCORDANCE WITH AR 380-5, THIS DOCUMENT IS CLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED.
