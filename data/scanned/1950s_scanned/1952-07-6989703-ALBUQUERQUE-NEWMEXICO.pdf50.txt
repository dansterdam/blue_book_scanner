17 Sist Air Traffic Sq

Space Control office at approximately 1220 EWT 29 July 1952 in the vicinity of Sandia Base. Two flying discs were observed at approximately 1250 EWT hovering over the Sandia Base area. The objects were identified in the vicinity of Sandia Base for about two minutes and then gained speed and climbed at a high rate of speed and disappeared. The objects were oblong in shape and were visible to the naked eye. The control tower also observed them and made a written record of the sighting. They advised and alerted the information to the 3520th Air Base Group who came to the control tower and also saw the objects. Two stationary objects were about 1500 feet in the air. The third object hovered and descended in a matter of four seconds. The other two followed and disappeared in the east. 

I sighted another one at 1225 EST coming from the northwest and disappearing to the southeast. It appeared to be about the size of a small aircraft and was visible for about 30 seconds. There appeared to be a blue-green glow emanating from the exterior. The glow was suddenly extinguished and the object disappeared, leaving no trail. 

The written record I have which I gave the Air Force investigator can be supplied is limited and I would suggest contacting the 17th Air Traffic Squadron for more complete details on these sightings.
