The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and "B" to illustrate how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen. The second sketch shows two larger illustrations. The one on the left depicts a person standing on a road with trees and buildings in the background, while the one on the right shows a landscape with a road leading to the horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
