six minutes period listed above to a 123Â°, 37 miles 31,000 feet where
is faded for the night from the OPS-4.

The OPS-5 was very accurate on its particular night which was
apparent to the pilots in the vicinity. They could follow it through two
passes off the OPS-5. The GPA-1/OPS-4, which is amore erratic piece
of equipment, would not follow through any positive manner for position
or altitude. I want over all possible error with which could be included
by AT/OPS-4 error equisively to be excluded.

We are continuing investigation at this station.
I have been a radar pilot since 12 Apr 43, and have been assigned
to controller duties for approximately 2 years.
