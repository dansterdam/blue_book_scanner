3 September 1956
Norwood, Ohio

Case 208, Norwood, Ohio, Sept. 3, 1956 - Eugene Kingman, a radio operator in the Air Force during World War II, was coming down a ladder outside his home. Looking up he saw the sun and to his surprise, another object, bluish white, came into view and passed near the same object. With Kingman were two other observers, one a former skeptic of saucers. Together they watched the bluish white objects. These were joined in a triangular formation - the two in rear less intense in luminosity than the leader and according to Kingman, "appeared to be larger than the others." After an immeasurable minutes stranger passed by and joined in watching the spectacle and immediately pointed out two more luminous objects, looking like primitive battle. Said Kingman, "the outstanding feature about these two objects was the 'streak of lightning' which seemed to connect them in their flight. The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes, during which time, no sound was heard."
