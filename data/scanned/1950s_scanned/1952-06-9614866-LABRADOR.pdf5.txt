SHORT STATEMENT

June 25, 1952

This is a report concerning an observation made on June 26, 1952, approximately 100 miles northwest of Goose Bay, Labrador. At about 22:00 hours, local time, the Regional Filter Center at Goose Bay received reports of an unidentified flying object. The object was described as being oval-shaped, about the size of a C-47 aircraft, and emitting a bright light. This object was tracked on radar for over an hour and was observed visually by several people on the ground. The object at times appeared to be a very bright light, and at other times appeared to be blotting out the stars behind it. It made abrupt changes in direction and speed. At one point, the object appeared to split into two parts briefly before rejoining. The report states that this is a well-documented case and that the persons involved are considered reliable observers.
