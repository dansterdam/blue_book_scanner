Portent of the aerial phenomena over Western Washington early Sunday. At the same glance, reports from several cities, received from south to north, indicated that an unidentified phenomenon was observed traveling from south to north and had been detected by several observers. After bursting, fragments of the phenomenon were carried across an area covered by the map. Several beams of light were reported by observers, who established approximately positions of the beams.

Col. T. Allan Bennet, commanding officer of the 25th Air Force Defense Division, McCord Air Force Base, also leaned toward the theory that the object which exploded at 1:25 a.m. was actually some kind of aircraft or guided missile. However, he said his office is making a thorough check of eyewitness reports and is anxious to receive them.
Bennett said he doubted that the object could have been an aircraft or guided missile. None of the radar installations in the Pacific Northwest network picked up the object on their screens, he said.
ANGLE-
Asked if the speed of the object may have eluded the radar, Bennett said that the object, whatever speed, probably would have shown up on the radar scope. He said it was not to show a "blip" on the radar screens.
"If it was a meteor, it was probably coming nearly straight down. That would make it very difficult to track. The indications might be so insignificant that radar wouldn't pick it up," he said.
"If it was an aircraft or a guided missile, we would have picked it up," he continued.
REQUEST-
Bennett asked that anyone finding a "strange" piece of material report it to his organization at McCord. 
Bennett said that the ground observers phase of the air defense setup is not at present on a 24-hour basis, and said no ground observers had reported seeing the flash.
The two-second blast, a tremendous blue-white flare, caused no ascertainable damage, but police, fire department and newspaper switchboards were jammed by hundreds of anxious calls from suddenly-awakened persons. 
Many believed, after the blast, that it was a crash of some kind.
