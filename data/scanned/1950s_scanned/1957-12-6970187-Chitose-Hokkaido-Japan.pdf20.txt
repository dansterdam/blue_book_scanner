STATEMENT

16 December 1957

At approximately 1930, 12 December, my attention was called to an illuminated object, something like a landing light of an aircraft, except it seemed distant and extremely bright. The object illuminating seemed to fluctuate. I observed the phenomenon until approximately 1930 as varying in intensity to be moving West Southwest and illuminating in intensity.
