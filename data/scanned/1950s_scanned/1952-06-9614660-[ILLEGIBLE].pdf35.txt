INFORMATION OF AN UNIDENT UFLYING OBJECT

2/22% Witnesses: The object was first seen at approximately 5:30 pm on 2/21/52 by the ground observer corps personnel stationed at Keesler Air Force Base, Miss...

2/23% Witnesses: The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes and then lost to sight. It reappeared a few minutes later and was observed for another 3 or 4 minutes before being lost again. The object moved in an erratic and unconventional manner, rapidly changing direction and altitude. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and emitted no trails or exhaust...

2/24% Witnesses: The object appeared to me to be larger than any known aircraft and was traveling at a very high rate of speed.

2/25% Witnesses: This object could have been a balloon of some kind, but its maneuvers were not characteristic of a balloon.

2/26% Witnesses: I would judge the time to be from these sightings however, I would judge the time to be from three to five minutes.

2/27% Witnesses: You should make a further check on this as the object appeared to be maneuvering or at least changing in altitude and position as viewed.

The report contains no photographs, only descriptive text from various witnesses about an unidentified flying object observed near Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi on February 21-22, 1952.
