Chauvont--A road worker near here reported today having seen one of the occupants of a "flying saucer" dressed in a "hair-covered cloak."

Andre Marcy, 48, of Merteu, Haute-Marne, sa-.-d he was walking along a road yesterday morning when he saw an orange-colored "thing" which he at first took to be a tree whose leaves were turning for the fall. As he approached, Marcy said he saw next to the "thing" a small 'being,' less than 4 feet 'tall, dressed in tire coat. Marcy said that when he called, the 'being' turned and entered the "machine" which rose vertically in the air.

Marcy said the machine was spherical in form, and about 30 feet in diameter. Underneath the machine was a sort of spindle, Marcy said, and between the spindle and the body of the machine was a "port hole" by which the "being" entered. A flame shot from the spindle as the machine took off, Marcy said. Marcy said he told his fellow workmen about the incident, and two of them returned with him to the site. All three said they found that the grass had turned slightly milk-colored, ar.d there were round imprints of small legs where the machine had stood.
