The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, and asks the viewer to imagine how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it. The second sketch shows two larger images, with a person shown at "A" and "B" to depict the positions where the object was first seen. There are no photographs present in this image.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
