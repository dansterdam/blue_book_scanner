Hawthorne, Navada 1105 P. M. 
Washington 2:25 A. M. 6.
Limitation of flight

As seen from earth, the objects reported could have been reflections of the sun upon the surface of such objects as would simulate "bright objects". 
Limitation of flight

As seen in both views, could possibly have been Pam Jab shaped rather than large, no horns and with a slight trail, containing no hazards and obvious possibilities of collaboration with other observers.

Las Vegas, Nevada, 1- to 2 hour after above, includes:
Tonopah Air Base, CAA and Radio Technician at Salt Lake City

By vision when last tested, I saw at 30 feet the 30 feet basket.
