HQ ARS Subject: Aerial Sighting of Unidentified Objects 12 Sep 1951
After landing at Andrews at approximately 2230 hours, this information was given to the Officer of the Day. No attempt was made at that time to describe the sighting and I am unaware even at the present time as to what it may have been. I have seen jet aircraft at night and other objects used extensively. This object could not be placed in either category.
Captain, USAF
