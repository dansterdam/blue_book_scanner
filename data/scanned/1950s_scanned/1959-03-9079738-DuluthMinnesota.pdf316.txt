II. THE DETAILS: The source was very friendly, cooperative, and sincere during the interview. He described the incident which occurred on 23 April 1959 (0340) as follows: On the evening in question he was on duty at the radar control station at Duluth AFB, Minnesota. At approximately 0340 hours he was observing the radar scope when he noticed a very fast moving, unidentified target in the vicinity of the Duluth area. He immediately notified the controller on duty, who in turn reported it to the Captain of the Guard. The Captain and Controller observed the target on the scope for a period of approximately 35-40 seconds. The target was observed to be traveling at an estimated speed of 1700-1800 mph and made a sharp turn of approximately 40-45 degrees. The target then slowed and hovered for a period of about 15 seconds at an altitude estimated to be 18-20,000 feet. The target then accelerated and traveled a distance of approximately 8-10 miles in about 2-3 seconds, and was lost from the radar scope. Source states that he has logged hundreds of hours on the radar equipment and has never observed any known aircraft capable of the maneuvers described. He stated that the target appeared as a very bright, solid return and that no interference or malfunction of the equipment was noted during the time of the sighting. The Captain of the Guard and Controller corroborated the source's statement.
