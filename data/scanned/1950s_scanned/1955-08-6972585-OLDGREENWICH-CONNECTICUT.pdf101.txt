THE HOUSE WAS LIT UP LIKE A ROMAN CANDLE. LOCAL AND STATE OFFICERS STAYED ON THE SCENE FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS...AND DID NOT SEE ANYTHING ELSE OF THE CURIOUS PHENOMENON. POLICE SAID IT APPEARS HOW SOMETHING WAS AMISS...AS THE FAMILY WERE TO POSITIVE THEY HAD SEEN SOMETHING, AND WERE VERY BADLY FRIGHTENED. 
THE POLICE LEFT AROUND ONE O'CLOCK, AND THE FAMILY TRIED TO SETTLE DOWN FOR THE NIGHT. THE ELDEST OF THE GROUP, A MRS.     , WAS RESTING IN HER BED SITUATED NEAR THE     WINDOW. AGAIN...ALL THE LIGHTS WERE OFF...AND SHE BECAME AWARE OF SOMETHING GLOWING IN THE WINDOW. SHE LOOKED...AND SAW THE ENTIRE WATCHING THEIR HANDS WERE LIT IN FAIRY FASHION WITH THE LIGHT. IT IS SAID THAT NO MOTION. MRS.     CALLED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW...SHOOK HER HEAD IN DISBELIEF, AND TURNED AGAIN TO THE OPENING. NOTHING HAD CHANGED...AND ONCE AGAIN SHE TURNED HER HEAD AWAY AND BLINKED HER EYES. AGAIN THE SAME SIGHT WAS THERE TO SEE WHEN SHE LOOKED. SHE SOFTLY CALLED TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY TO COME AND LOOK. THIS SHOTGUN WAS AGAIN BROUGHT TO PLAY ON THE LIGHT, MAN FROM THIS PORCH, HAVING BASCULE AS BEFORE SECONDS AS BEFORE THIS OBJECT DISAPPEARED. WE MIGHT CONJECTURE AGAIN WERE THIS WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT THEIR SENSITIVE EYES. THE HOUSEHOLD, NEEDLESS TO SAY, DIDN'T SLEEP THE ENTIRE NIGHT, AND SHORTLY AFTER DAY BREAK...THE GROUNDS WERE CRAWLING WITH THE CURIOUS. THE FOREGOING IS THE NEAREST THING TO CHRONOLOGICAL HAPPENINGS OF THAT NIGHT, PIECED TOGETHER FROM THE INTERVIEWS I HAD WITH EACH OF THE SEVEN ADULTS INVOLVED.
