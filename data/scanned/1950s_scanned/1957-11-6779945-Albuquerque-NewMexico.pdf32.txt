The image contains a sketch of a UFO or unidentified flying object. The sketch shows a triangular or saucer-shaped object in the sky over what appears to be a landscape.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

return to the spot with witnesses, as no one would believe his otherwise. He would at first not identify it, However, he went home to get his wire, and returned to the spot with her, but by that time about 20 minutes had elapsed. 

The object made that this spot in diameter, had a slant toward the top, and was about 15 feet 30 feet. It was saucer-shaped, like a plate, was surrounded by a white "glow", and as it hovered there was no sound, similar to this description that might, and, it was the moonlight. The UFO had a definite outline.

The area itself was not suitable for landing, being rocky. County officials were notified of the sighting the following day.

and Lake County U.D. Defense Director Gleeson Finney reported the following: That night officers traced the object to a higher field one mile away. There they found two oblong holes in the ground like those made by displaced soil. Area Civil Defense returned to headquarters to get a Geiger counter. When we made readings on the soil in the field, the count was slightly higher than normal background readings in the vicinity. Waiting a few hours, Looks and Reeves took another reading in the same spot, and the count had lowered to normal, indicating that the reaction on the Geiger counter was not caused by radioactivity.

This incident indicated that the reaction on the Geiger counter was not caused by radioactivity. And were widely published at the time. The sketch below, however, is Moore's own original artistic drawing, which he save to me.
