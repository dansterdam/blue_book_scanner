DATE: 25 JUNE 1954

On 24 June 1954 at approximately 10:15 p.m., while on routine patrol, I saw a very bright light pass overhead from east to west, traveling at a high rate of speed estimated to be about 1,000 mph. The light was described as round in shape, bright white in color, and appeared to be self-luminous. It was observed for approximately 3-4 seconds. The weather was clear, and visibility was excellent. There were no clouds, and the night sky was dark. I have had previous experience in observing aircraft at night, and this object was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. Sgt. Garcia, when asked by the undersigned, stated that Canton Sauer at Municipal Airport called at 17:14. Dayton Power & Light were advised of a sighting as a very unusual object approximately 4-5 miles NE of Dayton, and they have the exact time of the sighting.
