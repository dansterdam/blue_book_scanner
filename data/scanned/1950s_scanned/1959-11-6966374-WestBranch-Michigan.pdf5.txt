Gobshite and I were on our monthly fly home hunting trip. Some snoozing around this morning. Some red glowing around 10 got up took a walk out in a field in front of house, saw unidentified object hovering about 25 ft above ground about 300 yds south it made no sound seemed to hover for 2 to 3 minutes then just took off and disappeared. It seemed to have lights around edge and a light underneath in the center and seemed to be moving very fast when it took off. It seemed to take off up and back toward the east at a high rate of speed. When it took off it seemed to wobble or rock as it moved and noticed no exhaust. It was dark out and hard to make out exact shape but seemed to be round or oblong in shape. No other witnesses as far as I know.
