Unidentified Flying Object Report (FLYOBJET)
Florida
26 March 1953 Intell. Off. Tyndall AFB, Florida

AF LTR. 200-5 (FLYOBJET) D/ADG-9348 (FLYOBJET)
On Wednesday, 25 March 1953, Mrs. of Panama City area observed one (1) unidentified flying object which was circular and giving off flashing strobe and level sounds. Mrs. was the only one who reported this event, and her observation was made from inside her house looking out the window. Since the object was quite far away, it could not determine the distance or the altitude.

COMMENT BY THE PREPARING OFFICER: Since there were a minimum of thirty (30) jet aircraft airborne in the general vicinity of Panama City at the time of the observation, this object could have been the reflection of a jet for observer stated that possibility.
