MEMORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF, INTELLIGENCE 
ATTN: COLONEL PATTERSON, AFCIN-X

SUBJECT: (C) Review and Comment - UFO Rpt, Adana, Turkey 12 Mar 53

a. Further to the request from your office regarding the sighting reported from Adana, Turkey, during March 1953, our records indicate the following:

1. The incident was submitted as a CIRVIS report under provision of JANAP 146, March 1954, and not as an Air Force UFO report.

b. The report is very meager and lacks essential data necessary for more detailed analysis or positive conclusions.

c. The object (a fast-moving, orange colored light) is not considered a "UFO" within the definitions of AFR 200-2, 5 Feb 58, but rather an "unidentified aircraft".

d. The description, characteristics, flight pattern and maneuvers rule out rockets or missiles.

e. There have been reported overflights into Turkey from the Soviet and Arab Bloc countries. It should be noted that Adana is just outside the Northwest border of Syria. (Secret)

2. A word of explanation regarding source's statements that the light appeared to stand still for a brief period; and that there was an apparent absence of sound. Based on the many similar UFO incidents investigated and analyzed by the Center over the last 12 years:

a. Jet exhausts, and particularly after-burners in operation, when viewed from a zero-angle of sighting on the ground, e.g., when the aircraft is at a climb and viewed directly from the rear at night and from a distance, often appears to remain motionless in space until the pilot goes into a well-known illusion and reported quite often.
