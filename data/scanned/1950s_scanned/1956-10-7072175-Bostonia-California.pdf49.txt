STATEMENT OF______________________________________________________ DATE__10 Jan '57 and must into the church, that was near, to wait for the exposure. It didn't make to much difference as to how long the exposure should be, so I didn't keep tracks of the time. I know that it was there nor shorter than ten mins and, no longer than 20 mins. Within this time, I went out again & clicked the camera and turned the picture for the next exposure.
