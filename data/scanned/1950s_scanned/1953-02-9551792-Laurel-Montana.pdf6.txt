The object I saw felt to me 9:10 P.M. was tangible, thinking, silent, green, and slightly to the southwest of Laurel what had seen. It was nothing like an airplane directly west and was the height of a hanger at near 9:30 P.M. I could hear no sound. It was moving very slightly in an up and down motion and it seemed to be lit. I drove about 1 mile to the west to a hill and observed the light for about 15 minutes. It was in sight. The glow for my own satisfaction that it was something very eerie and out of the ordinary.
