The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Sighting: 29 August 1955
Object: "Cylindrical flying object" in diurnes. Thirty feet across.
Dome on top. A ball of green light struck the ground in front of the object and went out. The object made no sound. The door slid open, and a man came out. He informed the witnesses he had come from another planet.

In view of the possibility that these people may, again, be contacted, the report suggests the President be informed so as to give them some suitable reply (which we can later back up by official paper work), if it is the opinion of the proper authorities that individual cases, some section should be instituted, if for no other reason than for our records to indicate something was done in the matter.

Two courses of action are contemplated:
a. A reply to the UFO Council that no firm conclusion can be reached because of the insufficient data of information given.
b. Request a brief, informal investigation in accordance with AFR 200-2. A reply to the UFO Council would then be that "investigative action has been initiated; results unknown as of this date."

The letter recommendation above is considered the best approach. Any reply to this effect "insufficient information" "no firm conclusion" is still under study may only produce a large mass of additional data from this organization which undoubtedly will further confuse the course of hand.

Your comments and/or recommendations with respect to this matter would be appreciated.
