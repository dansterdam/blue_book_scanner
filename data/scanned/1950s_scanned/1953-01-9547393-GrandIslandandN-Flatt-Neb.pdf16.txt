AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

UNCLASSIFIED 

25 Apr 53, Colo. Springs, Colo.

Grand Island watched to contact Commercial Flight 603, westbound, they would like to talk to him on certain Grand Island also told us that a B-47 from their base was nearby their airspace. Grand Island lost contact with the B-47 at the same time it lost contact with the Commercial flight. 

We lost sight of it about 2:43 CST. It was my impression that it was looking through any haze at the The engineers. Cpl Wanyer, repeated that the target had been seen to get lower and lower until it disappeared completely and very dim.

The object was found at Grand Island. They marked on the phenomena of the lights changing any manner. The object remained in view through the operation and was losing altitude, finally it could no longer be seen. 

I asked Grand Island if they could contact the cadets to see if they could verify flight. They said he could not contact the cadets - they were apparently all alright at Lowry.
