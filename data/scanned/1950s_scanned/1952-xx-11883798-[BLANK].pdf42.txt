FACTUAL DATA

There is a definite need for the contractual aid of a qualified group to assist in a scientific analysis of the reports that appear to involve astronomical phenomena and to correlate, summarize, and establish their aid in making possible voluntary observations.

II. DISCUSSION
A. HANDLING ATIC IN THE EVALUATION OF REPORTS

Many of the observations of unidentified aerial objects that are reported to ATIC possibly involve astronomical phenomena. Such reports would be strengthened if they were compared to the data collected by astronomers and scientists who are skilled in analyzing astronomical phenomena. Arriving at a conclusion solely from the data included in the report is difficult.

B. Contacting Other Observers, Astronomers, and Astrological Societies

The largest and most qualified group of observers of the sky are the professional and amateur astronomers. It is believed that it is necessary to enlist the aid of members of their own professional societies in order to obtain all possible observations and immediately report those observations to those people and enlist their aid to establish communication channels and handle all correspondence with those people.

III. RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES

1. It is recommended that the following steps be taken as soon as possible:
Dr. Joseph Kaplan be contacted by wire as soon as possible to participate and assist in the operation of obtaining contracts on already suggested contractors. Dr. Wyle of the University of Texas and others of the University have been suggested as possible contractors.
2. Contract Observatories and Astronomy Departments suggested by Dr. Kaplan and determine whether or not they would accept such a contract.
3. Obtain a contract with selected contractors.
