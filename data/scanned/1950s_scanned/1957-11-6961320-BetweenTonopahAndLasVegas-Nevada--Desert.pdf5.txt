The image shared does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a typed document. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document using optical character recognition (OCR):

TO CAPT. G. GREGORY
SUBJECT: SIGHTINGS REPORTED BY CIVILIAN J. MCMAHAN AS
RYM/1/5-54

UNCLASSIFIED

DID YOUR HUSBAND (WHO, AS YOU RECALL, LAST WEEK AND PREVIOUSLY REPORTED HE WOULD REVISE HIS STORY OF THIS INCIDENT) CALL YOU BACK WITH FURTHER DETAILS WITH REGARD TO THIS MATTER - PLUS HIS REACTIONS TO THE ALREADY STICKY SITUATION ON THIS MATTER - PLUS HIS DESIRE TO GET TO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AT THAT TIME? IF HE GETS TO IT AT ALL, THIS COULD BE MERELY A RELUCTANCE ON HIS PART TO BECOME FURTHER INVOLVED ENOUGH TO THE OVER-ALL PROBLEM TO BE EFFECTIVE.
