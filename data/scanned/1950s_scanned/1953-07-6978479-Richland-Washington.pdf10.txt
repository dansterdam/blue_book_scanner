ABNORMAL RETRACTION
NORTH ATLANTIC
Second Officer Piero Baistricchi of the Italian SS. Eugenio C, Capt. F. Pieroni, left Genoa for Baltimore, sun nights were affected by an abnormal horizon depression. On the 15th and 20th July 1953, the phenomena, known by at least 16 different observers, was apparently in error, and has been brought to the attention of the authorities for explanation.
Mr. Bajtric sates that no other explanation can be made for the phenomenon depression of the horizon than the run from the bottom of the ship to the horizon, observations and evening star. 
On both occasions the calculated speed during the morning period was more than the speed during the evening period.
