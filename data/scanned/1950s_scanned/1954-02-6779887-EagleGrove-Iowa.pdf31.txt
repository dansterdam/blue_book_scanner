DES MOINES FILTER CENTER--- DES MOINES, IOWA 

Major Strawn, Commander reported no other sightings had been called into the Center on 7 April 1954.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF PREPARING OFFICER: In view of the fact that this particular sighting has viewed the object with regularity and the object has been seen by other individuals as well, it is suggested that all Ground Observer Corps posts (70-80 mile radius) be alerted to watch for the object. The basis for this recommendation is that in view of the fact that in the past and in the present this object has been seen consistently by several observers, it is believed that continued and intensified observation by the Ground Observer Corps may result in obtaining additional data regarding the sighting. According to the SUSPES the object appeared with the same regularity as before in this instance no report was made or time of sighting was kept by the SUSPES.
