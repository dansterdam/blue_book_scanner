Dear Allen,

In the process of reviewing June 1954 cases I ran across three sightings: photographic, Mooresville, Indiana; Oologah, Oklahoma and Lincolnwood, Illinois. 

I do not have cases for New Mooresville and Muncie, and the only information I have are the two letters and copies of the Photographic Lincolnwood case.

A note on the Project Card indicates that you evaluated the Mooresville, Indiana case. Could you check these out for me and see if the cases are with your files. Please?

Sincerely,

DAVID N. MOODY
