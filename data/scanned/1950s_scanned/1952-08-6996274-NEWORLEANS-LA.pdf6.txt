(Circle one): YES NO
26.1 If you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions
did you see other cases?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have
caused it? If do not know, please indicate that. It may have seemed anything like it, nor
had any of the others. Everyone was seeing the object and felt it was unliike anything they had ever seen. I have no idea what it was. There was considerable discussion from those around about what the objects could have been, there was no agreement. During the time it was visible, there was a feeling that something unusual was happening, but nothing dramatic happened, except the feeling generated while watching.

28. Give the following information about yourself:
