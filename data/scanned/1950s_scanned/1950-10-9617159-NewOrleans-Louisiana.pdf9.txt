How 7 have kept quiet about it all this time, but MISS ... must notify and tell you about it. Spend...
1. The New Orleans Item of 17 October 1950, editorially, speculated concerning the sighting on the preceding Sunday, of four "saucer" formations by WILLIAM PARDSLEY, the editorial commented on the probability that the Air Force had kept such sightings quiet.
2. Comment is possible that these sightings could have been mistaken about seeing them. The Air Force which claims that most UFOs have some simple, earthly explanation, was said to have denied that these sightings occurred. We hesitate to call the Air Force investigators hiatus
3. ACTION: None contemplated by this headquarters.
