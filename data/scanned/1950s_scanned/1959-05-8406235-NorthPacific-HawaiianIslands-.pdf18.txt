Captain rockwell c. smith, us army, air force, received a report of a sighting from a major of the 8th army flight test section from fort shafter, honolulu, t.h. concerning observations made by himself and a captain, also of the 8th army flight test section, on 8 may 1959. the report states:

1. on 8 may 1959, at approximately 1520 hours, the undersigned (major, 8th army flight test section) and captain x (also of the 8th army flight test section) were conducting a visual search for a radio controlled model airplane which had crashed near kaneohe bay, oahu, t.h. 

2. during the course of this search, both the undersigned and captain x observed an unidentified aerial object at an approximate altitude of 10,000 feet. the object was estimated to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter and oval shaped. the object was traveling in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 500-600 knots. the object was observed for approximately 30-45 seconds before it disappeared from view.

3. no known aircraft or missiles in use at the time.

as the object was sighted, it appeared to be bright and luminous. the object did not appear to be reflecting sunlight, but rather seemed to be generating its own light. there were no exhaust trails or sounds associated with the object. the weather at the time was clear with unlimited visibility.

the object was sighted by two reliable and experienced observers, both of whom are officers in the united states army. the object observed could not be readily identified as any known aircraft or satellite in use at the time.
