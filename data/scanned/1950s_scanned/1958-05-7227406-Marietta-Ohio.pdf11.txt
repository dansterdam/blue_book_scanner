AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

DATE 29. 1006th AISS

V. COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER. The information presented by S UNCK originated properly from a sighting of an unknown object observed by several persons. The details of their descriptions are in keeping with the usual pattern of eye-witness accounts. There is no information to indicate that the reported UFOS are probably not a normal phenomena, and the description bears little if any credibility.
