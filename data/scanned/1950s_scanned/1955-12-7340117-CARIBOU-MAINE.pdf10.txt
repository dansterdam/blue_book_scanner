24. In an attempt to estimate the size, distance, and speed of the object that you saw, of what parameters would you make use? How large would it be, and what shape would the same appearance as the object which you saw?
Well, as close as I could tell, the object which I observed was a metallic disc, brightly reflective, and somewhat larger than a half moon in the sky. I feel that I have seen this type of object on a number of occasions, and it is my belief that such craft are visitors from outer space. I would judge that the craft was at least several hundred feet in diameter, and it moved with incredible speed, disappearing rapidly into the sky.
