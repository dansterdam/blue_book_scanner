The object was reported to be round in shape, and emitting a bright light. It was observed to make rapid maneuvers, such as sudden stops, starts, and changes in direction. The object was reported to be visible to the naked eye, and was also observed through 7 x 50 binoculars.

The report further states that the Coast Guard was notified of the sighting, and that no aircraft were detected in the area at the time. No radio disturbances or other unusual phenomena were reported.
