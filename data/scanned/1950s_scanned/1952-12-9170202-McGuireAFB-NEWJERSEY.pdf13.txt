AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO.: A-3336-52
PAGE: 1 OF 2 PAGES

1. Report did not reach Intelligence Agencies until 9 December 1952. At this time additional information was lacking concerning details of sighting.

2. Information received indicates the objects to be of strangely shaped and about 3 inches in length on radar scope and visually as blue-white flashes of light with no discernible trail.

3. No characteristic features were noted in the flight sightings. Visual sightings confirm radar contacts. The objects were irregular in shape, giving off a blue-white light, which was observed from the ground for a period of about 10 minutes and was not tracked on radar. 
Radar contacts were obtained at 25,000 feet indicating a speed of approximately 1,800 mph and of an easterly heading. However, the objects were observed to make abrupt turns and changes in direction.

4. Sighting was on 6 December 1952.

5. Observers were men from both main and air crews and visually from flight. We was [sic] at coordinates 39'30" N, 74 '20" W on a true heading 213°.

6. Their various positions of all are positive in their sightings and this confirms the speed and direction of the objects.

7. Weather was CAVOK. No wind. Temperature 10° C. It is not known whether there was any meteorological or conditions remarkable or otherwise, which would account for sightings.

8. There is no physical evidence of sighting.

9. No attempt was made to intercept/track or otherwise interrupt object.

10. No other aircraft were observed in area at time of sighting.

11. Conclusions of reporting officer and of such duration are to preclude any other interpretation. However, as visual sightings are indecisive and of little confirmatory value.
