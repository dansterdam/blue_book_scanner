"Flying Discs - Continent

This gives very complete accounts as to how the government agency of this country was taken into consideration and observation of this object of great interest and curiosity, which was seen on 7 March 1952 in the sky over Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The observation lasted about 3 minutes and the object appeared to stop and remain stationary for a certain time before continuing its course. Its size was estimated as about 50 meters in diameter, and it was moving at an estimated speed of about 600 miles per hour. All the conditions of this observation seem to indicate a true, physical, objective phenomenon, and with such characteristics as to exclude any possibility of illusion or hoax."
