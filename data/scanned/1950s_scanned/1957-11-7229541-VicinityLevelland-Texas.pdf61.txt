STATEMENT

I was driving home from Lubbock on state highway 116 at approximately 12:30 a.m. and suddenly noticed a very bright light in the sky to the west of me. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it started coming closer and closer, going from west to east, and then it appeared to stop in midair. It was a brilliant blue-white in color and was about twice as big as a car. It seemed to be hovering or standing still in the air, and then started moving in an easterly direction, gathering great speed. In a matter of a few seconds, it had disappeared completely. It was at this time that I saw this object, and I pulled off the highway and tried to start my car, but it would not start. After I had quite a struggle starting it, I finally got it started and continued on my way home. I had no more trouble than under normal circumstances.

I then proceeded to tell my wife about the incident, and she was quite upset over it, but she told me not to say anything to anyone, so I did not. However, I feel that I should report this and did so to the sheriff around 1:30 p.m. Sunday November 3rd.
