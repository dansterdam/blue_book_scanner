The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed text describing a UFO sighting. The text appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report, dated March 1957.

The text states the following:

4. As stated, I was driving my automobile when I suddenly detected the objects from the far corner of my eyes. As I looked to the White at first I sight objects and then instinctively and automatically I looked up for a clearer view. They were just a split second or so from the first time I saw them to the time they disappeared from the firmament.

I watched as they passed almost a vertical course when I immediately spotted them. They were disappearing suddenly and nothing more was seen.

As related, I was driving my automobile When first sighting the objects. From the objects - I had no perspective from which to judge its distance from me and had no means by which to determine its size or it's, alhough as stated it appeared to be 6-8 feet in diameter. The flight was clear.
