The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the topic of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over the United States.

When these incidents subsided, strange objects were reported to be flying over the U.S. The hypothesis here is that the Soviets could be attempting to frighten both the European nations and the U.S. by a new device that they hope will be construed to mean that the Soviets are far ahead of the rest of the world in technical know-how.

The above theory, however, runs into one big stumbling block. If these objects are weapons or advanced types of aircraft, they are, of necessity, man-made. How is it then possible that, in the four years that the USAF has been studying UAOs, not one has crashed? Man-made devices are not infallible.

To consolidate, the USAF will maintain an open mind and study all UAO reports until enough information has been gathered to explain the unexplained 18%. By continually receiving reports, devising further methods of evaluating them, and collating them with other reports, a continual watch is being kept.

II. UAOs over USA
United States Air Force Headquarters continues to receive an increasing number of reports about weird objects in the sky. These reports are carefully checked at the Air Technical Intelligence Center, and when possible, evaluated - range from balloons to unidentified aerial objects of all conceivable shapes, sizes, speeds, and motions.

The dramatic scope of the subject of unidentified aerial objects has piqued America's interest for years. In this atomic age there is fascination in the weird and unknown, since man's inventions themselves approach the incredible. The public press has nurtured and sustained our interest in UAOs ((whenever it could find the slightest excuse to keep the story alive.))
