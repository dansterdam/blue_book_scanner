The image contains three photographs, none of which depict any human faces. The first photograph appears to show a reflection from a cylinder corresponding to the reflection from a 50-foot aluminum flabby plane. The second photograph shows an actual object taken from the film of the UFO system, which the caption indicates is a three-inch telephone lens that did not reproduce well. The third photograph appears to show a reflection from four jet planes, with the distance estimated at 2 1/2 miles.
