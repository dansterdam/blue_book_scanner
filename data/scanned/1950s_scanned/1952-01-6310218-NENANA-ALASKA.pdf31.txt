AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
OFFICE SYMBOL: TR-1-32

COMMENTS of Preparing Officers:
The following hypotheses are advanced concerning the aforementioned radar targets:

1. That the energy transmitted from a F-51 might have reflected from Mt. McKinley in such a manner as to produce these targets. 
Comment: Due to the frequencies and the pulse repetition frequencies of the radar involved, it is felt that this hypothesis is not valid for technical reasons.

2. That ionized air masses due to auroral activity might have produced these radar targets.
Comment: The force field at approximately 30,000 to 50,000 feet could have produced these targets, as the auroral activity at the time was pronounced. There is the possibility of small clouds (irregular masses of ionized gas) and have been floating in the upper atmosphere. On some occasions, these ionized masses may have the capability of reflecting radar pulses.

3. That the activity of the Aurora Borealis might have produced these radar.
Comment: Due to the known effect of the Aurora Borealis on radio in this theater, it is thought that some form of interference beyond the scientific capabilities of this command to determine may be involved.
