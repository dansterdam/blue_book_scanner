Marines Seeking Flying Saucers Find New Aviation Light

QUANTICO, VA., JAN. 5 - The Marines here have been on the alert the past five nights, and several times they have seen strange lights in the sky, which they suspect may have been flying saucers.

The lights, described as bright and flashing on and off in an unusual pattern, were seen by marine guards at the Quantico Marine base during the late evening hours starting last Friday night.

The lights, Marines said, seemed to come and go and at times were visible for several minutes at a stretch. 

The last time the lights were seen was on Monday night. The Marines said the lights appeared for about five minutes and then disappeared.

The Marines said the lights did not resemble any conventional aircraft. They said the lights were not like those of any plane or helicopter they had ever seen before.

One marine said the lights seemed to dart across the sky at high speed and then suddenly stop and hover for several minutes.

The sightings, the Marines said, were reported immediately to higher headquarters and to the Air Force. However, no official investigation has been ordered so far.

Similar reports of strange lights and flying objects in the vicinity of Quantico have been received from civilians living in the area.

No other details were available, except that the Marines said the lights were real and that they were convinced they were not seeing things.
