De Week
The Unusual Case of the Knoxville, Tenn.
Lights
Among the many flying discs and saucers reported in recent weeks is a strange case from Knoxville, Tenn., which deserves special consideration. The facts in this case are as follows:
On January 31, 1958, at approximately 8:30 p.m. EST, a young couple, who had been driving along the highway between Knoxville and Powell Station, Tenn., observed a large, glowing, yellow-orange light in the sky to the northwest, at an estimated altitude of about 1,000 feet. The light appeared to be rectangular in shape and was stationary. They watched it for about 20 minutes as it simply hung in the sky, apparently not moving.
After about 20 minutes, the light suddenly shot straight up at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. The observation of this light was reported to the Knoxville Airbase by the witnesses and is being investigated by the Air Force.
While there have been many reports of unusual aerial lights and objects in this area, this particular observation appears to be one of the more significant and puzzling cases reported to date. The Air Force is continuing its investigation and the results will be made public when the investigation is completed.
