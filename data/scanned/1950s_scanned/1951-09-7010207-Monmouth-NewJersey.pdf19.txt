It was at such a short range, however overcast conditions prevented such observation. Continuing to study conditions existing conditions the target was observed to be changing its elevation at an extremely rapid rate, the change being in excess of 1500 feet in a period of less than 10 seconds. It was therefore believed that the target encountered must have risen to an angle of approximately 1500 feet at which time it proceeded to descend, again at a rate of change of the target exceeding the added tracking ability of the SCR-584, so that the maximum range achieved was only 2,000 yards. It is therefore believed that a higher radar set capable of tracking the target to the maximum of the SCR-584 would have been required to continue the observation.
