COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The preparing officer was unable to come to any definitive conclusion as to the identification or classification of the visual aid described.
2. The following possibilities are offered for consideration:
- Considering the length of sighting, the hovering, speeding up and near level flight characteristics exhibited, it appears that this may have been an advanced type of aircraft which the witnesses could not identify. 
- The object was at such a distance that the details were not clearly seen. Even so, the witness reported that it was blowing between 10 and 15,000 feet at one point and between 5 and 10,000 feet at another. This sudden reversal in course would seem to preclude the possibility of its being a manned or remote controlled aircraft.
- It is possible that the object was that of a highly classified or experimental type of aircraft, possibly a new type of jet. Also, the object was between the size of a dime held at arm's length and it was high enough to catch the sun's rays. This would seem to indicate that the object was much larger than a conventional aircraft.
- Through the binoculars, the object then continued on its nearly course at a leisurely pace until it disappeared from view. This would seem to indicate a much higher rate of speed than any known conventional aircraft at that time.

3. The three individuals who spotted the object were briefed on the following possibilities:
- It may have been some form of military or experimental aircraft or other airborne vehicle, in which case they should avoid any conclusions or discussion until the matter could be properly investigated.
- It might have been some natural phenomenon, such as a meteor or atmospheric disturbance, which could account for the unusual appearance and movements.
- All three were familiar with air traffic and none had any ideas or conclusions concerning the sighting.

Air Intelligence Information Report of 1 July 1955. Although a great deal of meteorological activity was noted on the night of 13 July 1955, the witnesses reported that the object they saw was solid, silvery and disc-shaped. The sudden disappearance of the object was observed by the airliner pilot and the controller tower. Although the sighting took place at about 11:30 PM, it was fairly clear and all three witnesses had a good view of the object. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the object cannot be satisfactorily explained on the basis of the information presently available.
