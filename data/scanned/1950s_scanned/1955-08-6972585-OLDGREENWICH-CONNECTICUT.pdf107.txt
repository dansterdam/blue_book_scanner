BEYOND THAT, THEY WERE SWEPT BACK, MORE OF A HUMMING' NEAR.THEY DID AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE BASIC FORM OF THE EAR WAS CORRECT. BECAUSE OF THIS CONSTERNATION EARLIER, OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF A HOAX, I HAD AT THAT POINT OF LEADING THEM UP TO THAT QUESTION. WITH NO INDEED ANY INFORMATION ABOUT IT. NONE OF THE THREE HAD BEEN ONE...AND THERE WAS SURE THERE WAS ANY. IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT...WHO WAS LISTENING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AS HE WORKED WITH THE SOLDIER ON THAT DRAWING, SAID HE HAD DEFINITLY SEEN IT, HOWEVER,___ GAVE HIM A DISDAINFUL LOOK...AND___ AFTER SOME HEDGING, ADMITTED AND SAID HE WASN'T SURE. THAT GAVE THE SOLDIER A BAD OUTLOOK ON_AND HIS STARTED POINT BY POINT OVER HIS DRAWING AGAIN WITH HIM. WE RETURNED TO OUR ORIGINAL THE STANDING CONSULTATION CONTINUED, AS THE MAN CONTINUED TO COGENTRATE. DISAGREE WITH, OR ADVANCE SOME NEW FEATURE. THE BODY ABOVE THE WAIST WAS POWERFUL AND FLUILT, THIN AND SPINDLY, AS THE LEGS AND ARMS WERE MADE OF BROOM HANDLES. AGAIN, WE FOUND. AS WITH THE WOMAN, THE MEN HAD NOT SEEN ANY FEET._HOWEVER, WHO WAS STILL BEING INTERVIEWED BY THE SOLDIER, TOLD OF FEET THAT RESEMBLED SUCTION CUPS, BUT SINCE HE WAS IN THE MINORITY, WE DECIDED NOT TO MAKE ANY MENTION OF FEET, EXCEPT FOR A WINDING IN THAT AREA. THE ASSUMPTION HERE MAY BE HAD OR GOOD, HOWEVER: IT SEEMED REASONABLE THAT THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE TO SEE HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST THE LEGS TO SUPPORT IT, AS IT WERE. PERHAPS IT'S A FALSE IDEA TWO...BECAUSE WEIGHT WAS NO PROBLEM' APPARENTLY...THEY COULD FLOAT DOWN F OM ROOF-TOPS, THE HANDS WERE LARGE...WAY OUT OF SIZE...OF THAT THEY ALL AGED. THE OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF THE ARMS AND HANDS WERE THE SAME IN BOTH THE WOMEN'S AND MEN'S DESCRIPTIONS, WITH THIS EXCEPTION. LUCLY VENTURED THE POSSIBILITY OF WEBBING BETWEEN THE TALONS, ABOVE THE FIRST KNUCKLE. THIS REMARK WAS UNSOLICITED ALSO. AND SO IT WENT...UNTIL THE IMAGE WAS AS COMPLETE AS IT COULD BE HOWEVER STRANGE SOME OF THE FINAL DETAILS BECAME, AND WE HAD TO CLOSE THE SESSION, AS THE MAN HAD NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO EAT -THEIR SUPPER...LET ALONE TALK WITH ANYONE.
