"It was a very bright ciicular object. It stayed in one position above the trees for that same'd (?) long time, to me (though it moved have seemed to have been only for a minute). I stopped for binoculars, a camera, or even a witness, but was too late to get it again or have it seen.

I had started to get up, noticed with patches around the side, this was just a clear, bright object.

Size: it was about the size of average meteors.
The definite line on the lower part was seen, or imagined.

A came'ed at present it was as a pale, or minute, object. From other notes and drawings, like one I had before I thought it might be a balloon or airplane making low altitude flight, but this was not the case it was obviously not of this known type of air craft.

I moved a couple of steps (I was going to run for aid) then in a hurry, looked at, but did not see it again. I have a habit,which makes me very careful in all observasations [sic], to move and miss things, but that was not the case this time. I scanned the sky in all directions but it never reappeared, have a ball, your case."
