SUBJECT: Flying object sighted at Auburn, Alabama on 9 November
While at the Auburn-Mississippi State football game here on 8 November, it was observed an object flying at 5500 feet (approximately). This object appeared to be moving very slowly, and at times would start and stop suddenly, all the time maintaining a very straight course. About 1830 CST (approximately 1620 EST) a group of AFROTC students saw the same thing and many reported it as a weather balloon.
