10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object flying over the runway on a heading of 255 degrees. 
Appeared to be a formation of five a/c in "V" formation. Flying 
silently and appeared to stand still at times. Object appeared 
to have 10-12 large red lights. Radio several transmissions to A/C 
in area at time. Witness on duty in tower as operator.

Sounds like birds except for the red lights. No reports from the 
A/C in the area. The witness did not ask the A/C to try and iden-
tify the objects although on duty at tower. Considered as 
insufficient data since additional personnel in tower and A/C
in area did not report these objects.
