Case 183, Tarrytown, N.Y., Aug. 9, 1956 - At 12:15 police headquarters received a phone call from a citizen reporting a light in the sky. Patrolman Maessle was dispatched by radio to investigate. He confirmed the report together with two other officers. Patrolman Maessle, with a commercial pilot's license, described the light as "yellowish, and gave to eight times the size of any star in the sky." He could not estimate its altitude, but said it was hovering and generally southward in motion. About 1:30 a.m., the light disappeared.
