STATEMENT

On the 16th of August, 1953, I was on patrol duty, about 21:00 I arrived at the mess hall after going the guard to the main gate. Just b doing this, the guard told me to come over to the barracks. When I got there he told me that he had just seen a bright light in the air travelling at a high speed and then disappear. To investigate this, I went outside and it was about a few seconds I saw a very bright light in a different direction and it remained stationary for a few minutes and then it went dim, it was like a flare, only much more bright. The troops, who were outside at the time the article appeared, could not give any detailed description of the object. The object was gone. We are sure that did see it from the hill and it was sort of discernible.
