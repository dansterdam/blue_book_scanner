The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document, possibly a report or evaluation related to a UFO sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

This is the complete report we received from the 14000th with a suspense of 21 Mar 55. It's made a case file of 16 since it has attracted so much attention.

My personal evaluation is as follows:

1. Source's house is located directly on the shore of Lake Erie.
2. On the nights (4 & 5 Dec 54) the obj was sighted, the source stated the weather condition as GOOD, with full moon and no stars visible.
3. My evaluation is that the sighting was as the result of a reflection of a known object, which assumed the particular shape described by the source. It could have possibly been one of two things:
A chip on telescope lens
or
as stated in one of the attached newspaper articles.

This professor with St. Mary's college said he jokingly believes they were space craft which had come to observe the activity in its observatory. WHICH he also said impressed the UTO's could have been mistaken by the WELL-LIGHTED DOMES on his observatory (which could explain the source's report of the UFO having many windows or ports apparently uniformly spaced around the disc.) This evaluation would depend on two things - Was the domes of the observatory lighted at the time of the sighting?
and
How far is the observatory located from the location of the sighting?
