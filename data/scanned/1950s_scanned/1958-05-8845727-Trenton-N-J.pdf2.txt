The New Jersey UFO Sighting
Trenton, N.J. 
8 May 1958
At 2200 hours, the witness, a civilian employee of the United States Air Force, observed an unidentified flying object approximately 20-30 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet. The object was circular in shape and emitted a yellowish-white glow. It remained stationary for several minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. The witness reported this sighting to the nearest Air Force base.
