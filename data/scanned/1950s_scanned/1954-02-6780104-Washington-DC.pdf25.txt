The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing the "Captain Mantell Incident" that occurred on January 7, 1948.

The text reads as follows:

CAPTAIN MANTELL INCIDENT
7 January 1948

An official board of inquiry, which made intensive study of the crash reported that Mantell, an aggressive pilot attempted to pursue the object as long as possible, even though he knew he lacked oxygen.

Of significance, is the fact that although a number of witnesses observed the object, there were some discrepancies in their description of the object. The size of the object given ranged from "small" to "tremendous" and the shape as a "parachute", "ball", "ice-cream cone", "round", "disc", etc.

Although considerations was given to the objects being the planet Venus, because the times and bearings given by observers generally agree with the bearings and elevation of the body at the time, official files disclose that it was later determined that a large Navy "Sky Hook" balloon was released from a location in southern Ohio. This was a classified project, and the existence of the huge balloons were known only to a few. A wind plot for that day indicated that the balloon would have passed near the area in which the object was observed.

Because Mantell was in the same relative position as the object observed, undoubtedly some of the witnesses saw this body rather than the balloon.
