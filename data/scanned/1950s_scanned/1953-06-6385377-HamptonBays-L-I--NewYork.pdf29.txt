Dear Sir:

As you know, in our recent visit, we had one of our Canadian associates check with the Canadian authorities in regard to their interest in the "Project Saucebok" incidents. We find that their reaction is very similar to yours in that they do not place the kind of emphasis on this subject that Major Keyhoe would lead us to believe.

Enclosures are a few clippings from Canadian and Chicago papers that you may not have seen. We checked with the Canadian authorities on these stories and find that this "flying saucer" station is not a Government-sponsored affair, but rather being done on an informal basis by Mr. William Smith, in consideration of the interest shown in it by the public in recent days.

This Saturday I have an appointment to talk to Mr. Smith, so I should be able to give you something of a story on that next week.

Very truly yours,

Alexander C. Wall
Assistant to Vice President
Engineering Division
