1. S/S 22 April 1952
This is the statement of Capt USAF, ____________, Biloxi, Miss referring to sighting of unidentified aircraft control and movement as reported to the Aircraft Control and Radar units on above date.

On 22 April 1952 I was engaged in routine training flights over the Gulfport area. At approximately 0130 csr time, my attention was attracted to a strange object in the sky. This object was pointed out to me by another observer, and at that time it seemed to be hovering in the sky. As I observed this object, it gradually moved away, appearing to climb at a tremendous rate of speed. The object gave off a bluish white glow which seemed to light up the sky for quite some distance. There was no sound or exhaust as would be expected from a jet, propeller, or rocket type aircraft. The color seemed to be a brilliant bluish white, as I have described, and remained constant throughout the observation. The object made absolutely no sound and maintained a steady and rapid rate of climb which I would estimate to be in excess of 2000 mph. There was no deviation or change in direction, and the object seemed to disappear in the northeastern sky.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 22nd day of April 1952.
