"A woman who lived directly across the street from the house, Mrs. ***, was in her front yard, planting shrubs when the incident fell. 
"But I didn't hear anything," she said. "I didn't even know anything had happened until somebody came and told me about it."
"Mrs. *** said she didn't hear anything either. 
"She was asleep on a sofa in the living room, sleeping with her face toward the back of the sofa, her left hip up. 
"She describes how it knocked her across the room and struck her on the hip and injured her hand and arm which were lying on the hip.
"I woke up and thought the house was falling down," Mrs. *** said. "It was in the next room booming. She came running in and asked me if the house was falling down. 
"If and I didn't know. I thought it was the chimney. I got up and started out of the house. Then my hip started hurting. 
"I hadn't even seen the rock!"
"Then she and her mother found the hole in the roof and saw the 'rock' on the floor. They called the police. 
"Police Lt. W. T. Van Sandt, when he arrived, realized what must have happened and took the object to the police station where it was identified by the U. S. geologist.
"Van Sandt said that the object was cold to the touch when he arrived.
"Mrs. *** and her mother had not disturbed the meteorite.
"But her clothing was not scorched and she was not burned on the arm where it hit her.
"'It's a good thing it didn't hit me in the head,' said Mrs. ***. 'It might have killed me!'
"Mrs. *** thought at first the object had fallen from a radio set in the corner and hit her. 'But now I don't believe it did,' she said. 'The radio might have been hit by a piece of the ceiling or roof.'"
