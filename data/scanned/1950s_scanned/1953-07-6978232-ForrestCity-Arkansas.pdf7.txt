The image contains three sketches:

1. A sketch showing the curved trajectory of an object above the horizon (skyline) and the object's perceived height above the horizon.

2. A larger sketch depicting a person's view of a landscape, with directions labeled N, S, E, and W.

3. A smaller sketch showing a landscape with a road and mountains in the distance.

Transcribing the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
