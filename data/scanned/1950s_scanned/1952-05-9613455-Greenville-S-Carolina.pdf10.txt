TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On 20 May, 1952, at approximately 8:30 P.M., A GROUP OF SKYWATCH MEMBERS OF GREENVILLE, S.C., OBSERVED AN UNUSUAL SIGHTING, WHICH IS OF RECORD IN AIR FORCE FILES.

ON THAT DATE A GROUP OF SKYWATCH MEMBERS OF GREENVILLE, S.C. OBSERVED, FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY MINUTES, AN OBJECT WHICH RESEMBLED A ROUND OR OBLONG METALLIC OBJECT TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND MAKING ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION.

A PART OF THE GROUP OBSERVED THE OBJECT THROUGH BINOCULARS AND WERE ABLE TO DESCRIBE IT IN MORE DETAIL. IT WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE WHAT APPEARED TO BE PORTHOLES OR LIGHTED AREAS AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE. THESE LIGHTS WERE NOT BLINKING AND SEEMED TO BE STEADY.

AFTER BEING OBSERVED FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO INCREASE IN SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY AT LEAST 8 PERSONS AND WAS IN FULL VIEW FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY MINUTES.
