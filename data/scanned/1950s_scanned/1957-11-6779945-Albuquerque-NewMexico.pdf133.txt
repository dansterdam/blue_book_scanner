It is our opinion the residue from this meteor could account for the increase in the radiation level and that a small proportion could account for Mr._______ other illusions.

Major friend pointed out to Mr._______ that public anxieties over radiation could be curtailed by also supplying the newspapers with information as to what constitutes normal radiation. The newspapers wanted only information which would make sales.

CONCLUSION: Mr._______ and the other witnesses probably saw a meteor or exceptional brightness and size - a fireball. A fireball is defined as a meteor as bright or brighter than -4 magnitude. These meteors may have varied brightness and may change color during flight. Fireballs may appear at random and usually disappear without exploding. Some meteors leave trails which may also be variecolored and may change color after being observed. A fireball may leave a cloud of smoke which expand uniformly or in a certain direction.
