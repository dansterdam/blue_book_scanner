Proposed reply to letter from *, Col, USAF (Ret) 2 Nov 66

Dear Colonel *,

This is in reply to your recent letter of 2 November 1966 addressed to the Foreign Technology Division. We have again made a check of all 1950 files and could not locate your sighting. It is quite possible that your sighting did not reach the Project Blue Book office at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. If your sighting was evaluated at base level it would not have been forwarded to Wright-Patterson.

The analysts at Wright-Patterson will study the information which you provided in your letter of 2 November. You must remember, however, that at this late date it is impossible to check many aspects of your sighting. Also, it is impossible to duplicate the same atmospheric and relative conditions that were present the day on which you made your observation. Therefore, you can see that it will take some time before we can arrive at a conclusion as to what you observed in 1950. You will be notified as to what the final evaluation will be.

We do not understand the last paragraph of your letter in which you state that the "Air Force has been calling me a liar or otherwise of several years". Does this have anything to do with your sighting? If so, you do not explain it thoroughly. We regret your feelings towards the Air Force and hope that better relations can be established.
