Text extracted from the document:

One day I was at home reading my mail about 11:00 A.M. when I looked up and saw this object coming from the east. At first it looked like a normal aircraft but as it came closer I could see that it was not an aircraft but some kind of strange object. It was in a disc or saucer shape and appeared to be made of a brilliant silver metal. It had a dull finish and was completely silent. As it came closer I could see that it was just hovering in the sky. It came to a complete stop and just hovered there for about 10 seconds. Then it started moving again but this time it moved extremely fast and within a few seconds it had disappeared from sight. I am quite certain that this was not an aircraft of any kind that I have ever seen before. I have no idea what it was. I wish I could have gotten a better look at it but it happened so fast. This is the first and only time I have ever seen anything like this.
