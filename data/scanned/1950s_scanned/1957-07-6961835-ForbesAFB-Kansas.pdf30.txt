The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document page from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be an analysis report discussing an incident involving an RB-47 aircraft flight path.

Text from the document:

FAILURE:

When plotted against the RB-47 flight path, generally coincide with the detector indications contained in the RADAR equipment. The match is too perfect to be a coincidence.

if the s-hand signals displayed on the ALA-6 came from ground radars, and if the indicated target flight paths displayed on the Indicator corresponded to the aircraft's flight. An analysis of the data would indicate that the object that flashed by the RB-47 at 10,102, which had all the earmarks of a bright object and the implied telemetry collected by the GENERAL ELECTRIC ballistics/Telemetering station at FORBES AFB, Kansas.

IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE SERIES OF UNUSUAL INCIDENTS PROMPTED THE RB-47 CREW TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. SINCE THEIR INTEREST WAS NEARLY AN ALL-TIME HIGH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISING IF THE RB-47 CREW HAD NOT REACHED SUCH A CONCLUSION.

CREW COMMENTS:

A draft of this analysis-report was submitted to the two principal RB-47 crew members involved in this incident for their reactions, which follow:

Lewis D. Chase, RB-47 aircraft commander/pilot:
"I think this study is an excellent work. I apologize for leaving you would notice to request an analysis - and my thanks for your excellent work. As you can see, I am pleased with the content and the care with which it has been prepared."

Frank B. McClure, ECM Monitor #2:
"I am certain that for some reason we had intercepted ground signal that moved an object: I know that once we were near an airfield and (flying) north toward Forbes (AFB), the signals were undoubtedly CPS-6B/FPS-10 air defense radars. I do believe an UFO was emitting these signals."

IMPLICATIONS:
1. If it were not for the belated discovery of the original ("contemporary") records, manager as they are, this case would be inexplicable simply because of the discontinuity between the discrepancy in the current records and those original documents. But since the UFO cases lack such original documentation, they must remain unexplained. But this discontinuity-exploitation should not simply that they involve extraterrestrial vehicles.

2. Even when original data are available, if an investigator approaches his task with a conscious or unconscious bias to find no conventional explanation, then the investigator will end up with extraterrestrial "spaceships" as the only possible alternative, then the investigator will find no plausible conventional explanation.
