Strange Jet Over Gotham
Proves to Be Navy Plane

NEW YORK, May 7 (AP) - The objects of jet flights kept pouring out the sky from McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey today in a case of mistaken identity. 

The sky watcher, a member of the Civilian Air Defense Observation Post of the 26th Air Division, reported sighting a strange jet plane over Manhattan. 

The military immediately launched a jet interceptor from McGuire Air Force Base to investigate. After a long chase, the interceptor pilot reported back that the strange jet was actually a Navy plane which had been on a routine patrol.

The sky watcher, who couldn't find the object with his binoculars, had called in the alarm. Air Defense Command at McGuire Air Force Base had launched the jet interceptor to check on the report.

The Air Defense Command said today it was the third such incident in the past several hours that led to the launching of interceptor jets from McGuire. The spokesman said the Air Defense Command had checked all these cases and found that none had jets planes in the air."
