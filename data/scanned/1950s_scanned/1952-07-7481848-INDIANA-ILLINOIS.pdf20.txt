The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

At approximately 2045 hours one radiosonrle balloon with lantern attached was observed traveling towards WNW at altitude of 3,000-2,000 feet. As approximately 2100 hours, I observed a rocket-like ball of fire, (with a short orange or red tail of flame) traveling at a high rate of speed towards the WNW. No noise was heard and after about seven (7) seconds, this flare disappeared. There were no other objects noted in the sky at this time.

This observation was made at the rear of building F-103A at CHANUTE AFB, Ill.
