Review and Brief - Tape Recording of UFO Sighting - Boerne, Texas, 7 November 1957

1. Recording was apparently made last with considerable background noise (see 2 below). Questionable as to if any clarification of described object was given.

2. The following equipment points were established from observers:
a. Object was round or slightly ovoid.
b. Size given as about 200 feet away. 
c. Size given as about the size of this room (10-12 ft.). Seemed to hang over either side of horizon.
3. Witnesses emphatically stated that the object did not appear to be a balloon releasing gas.
4. Witnesses claim that the moon was to the right of the object thereby substantiating its position was about 0600 T. 
5. Check with Sea Antonic Area Control gave no report of any other light or object visible. This would be emphasized by a yellow or tan coloring.
Conclusion:
The object was without doubt the balloon that was released nearby (and is often the case) because of a slow leak or because of static conditions.
