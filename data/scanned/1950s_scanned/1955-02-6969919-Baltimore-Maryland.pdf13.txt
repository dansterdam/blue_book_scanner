AF FORM 112--PART II
REPORT NO.: 211-LC-CB-3-55
PAGE 8 OF 10 PAGES

III. OBJECT: DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING (Continued)
The residue, as claimed by the owner of the automobile, definitely was deposited by the object. The material was found scattered over the entire portion of the object. No observer tried to collect some of it or attempted identification. The witnesses described the material as a powder similar to that used in fireworks, and in quantities that established.
The color of the object before it disintegrated is doubtful. Stories range from "whitish" to "very colorful" - like a "rainbow". The investigator WILL MAKE NO COMMITMENTS CONCERNING THIS ASPECT UNTIL FURTHER STUDY ESTABLISHES FACTS CONCERNING COLOR CHANGES.
