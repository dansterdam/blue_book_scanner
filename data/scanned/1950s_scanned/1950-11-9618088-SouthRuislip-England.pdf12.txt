MCMXA-1A/3JR/cps 3 Jan 1950
FROM: HQ AMC, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio
THRU: Director of Intelligence, HQ USAF, ATTN: AFOIN-C/CO, Washington  
TO: Commanding General, Third Air Division, ATTN: DI, APO 125, c/o Postmaster, New York, N.Y.

1. The information contained in IR-1-50, United Kingdom, entitled "Unconventional Airborne Objects" has been carefully analyzed. It is the conclusion that the conditions described are those of similar reports received by AMC in recent months and that the incidents described ESSOR-58* radar, located at Hesston Airdrome, were due to abnormal weather conditions.

2. Unidentified radar targets comparable to those reported in IR-1-50 were detected by an SCR-584 located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on 3 March 1950. Meteorological conditions at that time were such that the targets were concluded to be normal radar reflections. A case-to-case analysis of these unidentified targets shows that the individual echoes had all the characteristics of normal radar returns. The rapid changes of radar altitude, direction, and speed could be attributed to a changing condition of the local atmosphere.
