their crafts, it would be fairly safe to imagine the great superiority of all their equipment over anything we have yet produced on this planet. For example, what world I not give to take a look at some of those pictures they took of the other side of the Moon. What marvelous cameras they must have! What sound recorders! What telescopes! I wouldn't be surprised if they could have seen me clear-up, as I stood there looking at them, transfixed, with my mouth-closed. Whatever they were doing, they worked fast, for in a few minutes they began to move again. They were turning around, first the leader and like its shadow, the second ship was making a turn. The size of the ships must have been certainly enormous, for the turning around was obviously laborious. They swung down toward the horizon as they manipulated the turn in a wide arc. It was then I became certain that they were not round orbs, but were very long and comparatively narrow, with respect to their length. I also saw that they were not entirely enclosed in the red shield, because, as the foremost one half made the turn about, I observed not only its length, but also a strip -- a flash -- of brilliant white light from top to bottom in the middle of the ship. It is safe to guess that each one of those ships could easily carry two million persons. The one which led coming in, led going back. The route and the precision manner of traveling were the same coming and going. If they made any sound it probably could not be heard.
