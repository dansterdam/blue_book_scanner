No Case (Information Only)
18 May 1956
El Cajon Valley, California

By 2:35 a.m. F.C., a 24 year old valley resident, was awakened by a strange sound and observed a bright light outside. He went outside to investigate and observed a very bright light, about 100 feet in diameter, hovering about 50 feet above the ground. It appeared to be elliptical in shape and had a white color. The light was blinding to look at. The object made a whirring sound and appeared to rotate. It moved rapidly to the north and streaked out of sight. The witness was somewhat frightened by the experience. He stated that there was no exhaust or trail that he could see and it made no sound when it streaked away.
