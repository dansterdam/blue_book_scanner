The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing an observation or report related to a UFO sighting.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"People claim a 'solid glut' that grew to the size of a small tree top, seemed to move with a life or intent of its own. The core of the body seemed to light up visibly, giving off a luminous glow. Occasionally there were a small detached glout - part of the whole - that darted away at tremendous speed, then leisurely returned and merged with the whole. There was no motor noise, just brilliant colors with a mystical sense of control and power. The shape and contour remained constant, yet appeared to be in a fluid state of flux. It simply moved as a unit, no apparent means of propulsion. No noise, no trail of any kind. Simply began to rise and when nearing the horizon it vanished. The time was approximately 9 pm. 

The matter itself was most likely an unusual type of electrical phenomena rather than a solid object. There was no evidence of any kind that it represented an artificial device of human origin. The incident was witnessed by several reliable individuals. Their testimony indicates this was no hoax or imaginary happening, but a true mystery of our time. As I saw it on the lonely road in Deering, New Hampshire, I share a privilege to have witnessed an event that poses more questions than answers."
