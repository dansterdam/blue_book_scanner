Two observations were made on 19 July; however, no report was made.
On 21 July, the undersigned received a call from an airman at 2200 hours who reported seeing a strange object over the field. Two minutes later a call was received from two colonels on the opposite side of the field. They reported that the object had disappeared from sight. The undersigned immediately went outdoors to observe the objects which had disappeared by that time. Approximately 30 or 40 minutes later an object was observed by me directly overhead flying on a course of 290 degrees at high altitude. It was undoubtedly the same object that had been reported earlier. The object was bright in color. Its speed was steady and was flying on an unerring course with no deviation observed during the entire flight, the object passed out of sight approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in the west. Altitude was estimated 75,000 to 80,000 feet. Based on time, distance and angles observed, its speed was computed to be in excess of 5,000 mph. All reports indicate that the sightings were made and unlimited sky conditions. A check was made with all jet air bases in Florida who reported no operations during the reported hours.

The undersigned is a rated pilot, has been based in the reported area for three years and states that he has never seen such phenomena as this at any time previous.
