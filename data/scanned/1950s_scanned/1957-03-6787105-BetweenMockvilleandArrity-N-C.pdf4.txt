REFERENCE REQUEST FOR SOME FIRM CONCLUSIONS OR EXPLANATION REGARDING
PAA ANDERSON FLIGHT ON THE BASIS OF ALL DATA AND EVIDENCE AVAILABLE
EVIDENCE AVAILABLE THE FOLLOWING ARE CONCLUSIONS OF ATIC:
A. ANALYSIS OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE PROVES THAT THE OBJECT WAS 
A GUIDED MISSILE. THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED: "FIREBALL," "THESE ARE
VERY RARELY ENCOUNTERED, BUT THE OBJECT CONFORMS EXACTLY WITH THE DESCRIPTION
OF FIREBALLS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED BY ATIC UNDER THE LAST TEN YEARS.
B. INTERPRETATION OF CAPE DESCRIPTION: THIS MORNING BY THE NEW YORK
UNIT OF THE GUIDED MISSILE DEFENSE CONFIRMS THIS CONCLUSION. IT COINCIDES
WITH A GREEN BRILLIANT BURST, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED, WITH A GREENI3H HALO,"
COINCIDES WITH THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY THE OTHER CREW MEMBERS.
C. THESE OBJECTS ARE GENERALLY OBSERVED ONLY A FEW SECONDS; ARE
EXTREMELY BRIGHT, RESEMBLING MAGNESIUM FLARES; AND, UNLIKE METEORS, 
GENERALLY DO NOT SHOW TRAILS. THEY SOMETIMES CUT UPPER ATMOSPHERE WITH
A BUZZING OR HISSING SOUND, AND UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS CAN BE A FRIGHTENING
EXPERIENCE, PARTICULARLY IN A PITCH-BLACK NIGHT, AS DESCRIBED BY CAPT
D. MISSILE-SANO JETS ARE RULED OUT. THE LATTER IS CONFIRMED BY A 
TASK FORCE SOME PILOTS ALSO MAINTAINING THAT NO AIRCRAFT WERE IN THAT AREA AT
THAT TIME. ALSO THE OBJECTS WERE NOT OBSERVED BY THEIR RADAR.
E. IN CONCLUSION WE BELIEVE THESE INCIDENTS ARE INDICATIVE THAT THE
OBJECT AT THE SAME MOMENT RULES OUT AIRCRAFT AND GUIDED MISSILES.
F. REGARDING "RUNAWAY" OR OTHER GUIDED MISSILE OPERATIONS, THIS POSSIBILITY
DOES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTING SUCH PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO THE DAY
INCIDENTS CONCERNED, IT DOES NOT FULLY EXPLAIN WHAT WAS WITNESSED IN THE CASE
OF THE OBJECT ENCOUNTERED. APPEARED TO COME FROM THE WEST, FIRST ALSO BE 
RULED OUT. THIS FLIGHT WAS NOT VISIBLE AT THAT TIME AND PLACE: 3:30 
m THE MORNING, APPROXIMATELY 25 MILES WEST OF JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA.
G. THE AIR FORCE BASE OPERATIONS CENTER, THAT IN RESPONSE TO ANY QUERIES
BY THE PRESS REGARDING THIS INCIDENT, THE AIR FORCE WILL BE STATED.
ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION NOW AVAILABLE THE PILOT UNDOUBTEDLY
ENCOUNTERED AN OBJECT VERY RARELY SEEN OR "FIREBALL." THIS
COINCIDES WITH THE DESCRIPTION OBJECTS IDENTIFIED AS "FIREBALLS"
RECEIVED BY ATIC OVER A PERIOD OF THE PAST YEARS. 
AIRCRAFT 175 MILES TO THE REAR RULES OUT GUIDED MISSILES AND AIRCRAFT.
(THIS IS TO COMBAT THE REMARKS OF "FIREBALL" SIGHTINGS" AND SIMPLE MISSILE
AND AIRCRAFT "CHASING" OUR SELVES.)
AND CONCLUSION IS CONCURRED WITH BY A WELL-KNOWN ASTRONOMER
