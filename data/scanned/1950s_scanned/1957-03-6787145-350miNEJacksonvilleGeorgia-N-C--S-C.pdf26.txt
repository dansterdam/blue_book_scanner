To whom it may concern:
Some months ago. a very strange object was seen in the vicinity of Jacksonville, Georgia - North Carolina - South Carolina area. This object was seen by a number of people and the description given by the witnesses was as follows:

The object was disc-shaped, approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter, and was observed from a distance of approximately 350 miles. Its speed was estimated to be between 600 to 800 miles per hour. The object had a distinctive glow or luminosity as it traveled through the sky. It made no sound and was seen for a period of several minutes.

The sighting was investigated by personnel from Project Blue Book and the information was included in their official report on unidentified flying objects. However, no photograph of the object was obtained due to the distance and speed at which it was observed.
