Dear Sir:

After considerable thought, I decided to drop you a line in regard to an incident which occurred in Irondequoit, New York, on January 8th, 1959.

This "incident" (a simulated invasion) which took place on the beaches of Lake Ontario on a balcony of Beau Arts Restaurant, lasted in my yard for about 10 minutes. I assumed that jets were in the area (day were) and that which my gas 30 binoculars revealed were a number of "flying wings" remaining stationary for some time, could have been (far) distant and become indistinct in looking for more, when there appeared a saucer-shaped head object hovering rapidly out in an easterly direction, disappearing in the clear sky.

I was satisfied and become bewildered in looking for more, when there appeared a saucer-shaped object hovering rapidly out in an easterly direction, disappearing in the clear sky.
