THE DOCUMENT CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING TEXT:

CONT'D.

THE SAID M.D. DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE TAKEN ANY MEASUREMENTS OR MADE ANY SKETCH OF OBJECT.

2. OBJECT CLOSELY RESEMBLED A STAR, BUT COULD BE DISTINGUISHED FROM A STAR BY BEING SLIGHTLY LARGER THAW ORDINARY STARS. THE LARGEST APPARENT STAR SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE SUSPECT OBJECT.

I WATCHED FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES OBSERVING THE SUSPECT UNTIL IT PASSED OUT OF VIEW. 
OBJECT WAS OF FIXED OBJECT CANVEY MOVED SLOWLY TO DETERMINE MOVEMENT WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE PRACTICALLY NON-EXISTENT.

POSSIBLY IT APPEARED, FLUTTERED, OR MOVED VERY SLIGHTLY AND THEN REMAINED STILL DRY SO. I COULD SEE IT.
