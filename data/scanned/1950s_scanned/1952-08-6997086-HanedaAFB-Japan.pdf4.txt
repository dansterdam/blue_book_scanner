INCIDENT NO. 5â€”Shortly before midnight on August 5,
1952, two airmen were walking toward the tower at Haneda
AFB in Japan to begin their shift when they spotted a large,
round object bearing a light in the sky. Hurrying to the tower,
they pointed it out to the other tower occupants, and they took
turns observing the object through 7x50 binoculars. Under ob-
-servation, a less brilliant light could be seen around the edge of
the object. The tower people called radar and gave them a
bearing on the thing, and radar picked up a target in the im-
mediate area. By correlating movement of the radar target and
the visual UFO, they established that they were both observing
the same object. The radar tracked the object at speeds varying
from hovering to 300 knots. An F-94 was scrambled and vectored
into the target. It got into a radar lock-on and started to close on
the object. At 6,000 yards, the jet radar contact, and at the
same time the tower and ground radar lost it, too. At a second
sighting, the object as seen on the ground radar broke
up into three pieces which flew formation at quarter-mile in-
tervals. During the incident, a weather balloon was released
at the base, and the witnesses reported that its flight was much
different than that of the UFO. One of the puzzling aspects of
the incident was that neither the jet pilot nor the radar crew
was able to get a visual sighting of the object, although each
was closer to it than the air base tower.
