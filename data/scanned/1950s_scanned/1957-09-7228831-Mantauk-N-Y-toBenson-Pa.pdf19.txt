speed, however, a ballistic missile would land in a period of 30 to 200 seconds and cover only 20-40 miles while doing so, whereas, the track carried by Benton extended over 100 miles and about 6 minutes subsequent to detection. Similarly, the second track carried by Benton fails to demonstrate the deceleration characteristics of a ballistic missile re-entry. Thus, if we consider the two pickups to be on the same object, it seems unlikely that the object was a ballistic missile.
C. To summarize: Considering the two tracks as a unit it seems very unlikely that the object was either a cruise type or a ballistic missile.
Considering tracking on the first segment only, one might conclude that it could have been a ballistic missile.
Considering tracking subsequent to the second pickup only, one might conclude that it could have been a cruise type missile.
5. Meteor Characteristics: Meteors were also considered as a possible cause of high speed radar tracks. It was hypothesized that a meteor approaching the earth at a relatively large angle (as measured from the horizontal) might produce a track having a horizontal component of velocity which could correlate with the portion of track BB-6 observed from Montauk. Upon closer examination, however, it appears that such a hypothesis is untenable.
Meteors penetrating the earth's atmosphere can be detected and tracked by radar, but the result of research in this area indicate that it would be extremely unlikely that a radar return from a meteor would be mistaken for a guided missile.
