Wires to Stork:

13 Jul 53                   Sheridan, Wyo.

13 Jul 53                   Shaw AFB, S. C.

11 Jul 53                   Forrest City, Ark.

13 - Very probably a meteor. Sending questionnaire. Ask your confirmation.

13 - Sending two questionnaires on this one since aerial and ground observation combined.  Again this sounds like a shoal meteor.

11 - Possibility here of upper air research balloon although our records on Navy Dick balloons show none in Arkansas for this date.

UAR activity starting from Carolina area, however.  Sending questionnaires to various observers involved.  This is wrong (0017Z) for local balloon release.  Carrying this as unresolved.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

It has been sometime since we have received any comments on the sightings and we are anxious to see your opinion on same.  When do you expect to leave for your summer vacation?  I am clearing base on 31 July but will hope to see you or at least call you before I leave.  Am going to Washington on Wednesday and Thursday this week on Press Release and new AF regulations for this Project and to tie up my projects in general.

Capt. Ruppelt is due back today and am anxious to see him, and as I think I have told you, he will be part-timing this project until my replacement arrives.

Best regards,

Bob Olsson
