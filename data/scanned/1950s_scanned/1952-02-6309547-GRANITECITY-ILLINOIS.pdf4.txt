REPORT OF INCIDENT (10 NOB 52)
CONCERNING A SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
Initially plotted at a horizontal distance of about five (5) miles west of
the site.
1. The "target" was recorded on the contracted scope of the
plotting equipment to the south and was visible on the scope. The
plotting indicated that the "target" was traveling at an average speed of
approximately 1,000 miles per hour.
2. He "target" was observed for about twenty-five seconds. During the
initial sighting, the target appeared to be a bright, glowing object, round
in shape, about the size of a B-36 bomber. It was estimated to be traveling
at a speed of 1,000 to 1,200 miles per hour, and was observed to disappear
gradually, fading from view, after the initial twenty-five seconds of
observation.
3. Radar contact was made with the "target" after the plot
and it was tracked on the radar scope for a distance of about 30,000 feet,
approximately five miles.
4. Immediate checks were made on the 832 equipment, and it was determined that the
equipment was operating normally. Therefore, the incident could not be credited to equipment failure.
5. No wind information was available at the time, as the Wind Data Recorder was
inoperative.
6. No action deemed appropriate.
