The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a typed document or report, with text discussing radar reflections and "things". There is no identifying information about specific individuals. As requested, I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

That though giving back radar reflections, they are not "solid" in the accepted sense, but are more in the nature of "living nature."

I hope I have not bored you too much.

Sincerely and respectfully yours
