The text in the document reads as follows:

where they were extended the courtesy of a staff car and a driver. 
It might be best, if the reader does not wish to study the 
interrogation in any detail, to state the opinions of these two 
investigators.
It is the considered opinion of this investigator ( and 
concurred in by Lt. Olsson) at the conclusion of the interrogation 
of about a dozen people that the object sighted was the planet Venus. 
This, despite the flamboyant descriptions of size and motion given 
by some observers, the conclusion is based on the fact that whenever 
it was possible to obtain actual positions (altitude-azimuth) of 
sightings from numerous independent observers, the positions and times 
corresponded very closely with the calculated positions of the planet 
Venus from 0320 to 1120 on 31 May 1953. That is, there was no residual 
specific evidence that the object was sighted in any other portion of 
the sky than that occupied by Venus. In particular, no agreement what-
ever was obtained concerning rapid angular velocities where an agreement 
was very strong as to position during the eight hour interval of obser-
vation. The evidence however does not exclude the possibility that a 
bright meteor traveling toward, and disappearing at, the approximate 
rising position of Venus, had been the triggering incident, although it 
seems more probable to the investigators that the observers' first glimpse 
of Venus (then nearly at its most brilliant phase) rising in the east may 
have given the momentary illusion of rapid motion. It must be remembered 
that none of the observers were tutored in matters astronomical, and hence 
unaware that on occasion Venus can be so bright as to be visible in the 
daytime.
