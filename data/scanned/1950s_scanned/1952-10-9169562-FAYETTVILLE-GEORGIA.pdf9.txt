From 0-2 Chief of Air Force, Army, subject: Extract from Reports Received Relative to Luminous Objects Sighted in Iran: Forwarding Investigations and Opinions.

There have been many incidents in Iran where luminous objects of various shapes and sizes have been observed. There have been about 13 reports of such incidents. The objects are usually spherical, circular, or cigar-shaped. They give off a brilliant light, sometimes pulsating, and are often seen to suddenly turn to a reddish color. They move at high speeds, making sharp turns, and disappear suddenly. This suggests some kind of a flying device, but the nature of this device is not clear. Witnesses have reported various phenomena in connection with these objects, but it is difficult to assess the validity of their reports. Therefore, it is not possible to accept this theory.

Investigations of the British Government: The English Government which has many establishments in Iran, especially in the oil industry, has followed these incidents with great interest. They have also maintained a close watch on the situation and have been observing the phenomena. However, they are not yet ready to commit themselves to any definite conclusion, as they feel that more data is needed before arriving at any conclusion.

In Iran: There have been 13 reports of luminous objects, all of which are connected to the border of Russia (various parts of which are sighted). The luminous objects are in various shapes and sizes. The objects are seen in the sky, on the ground, and sometimes hovering. The witnesses report a terrible noise accompanying the objects.

0-2 Reports: It is probable that in Iran there are inexplicable things which are not understood. The following points are made:
1. These are probably atomic weapons or test firing from Russian territory - such as 1, 4, 5, and 7. (Probably experimental)
2. Probable astronomical bodies.
3. Probable optical illusions.
4. These things were various balloons.
5. Perhaps machines for photography or the completion of atmospheric studies.
