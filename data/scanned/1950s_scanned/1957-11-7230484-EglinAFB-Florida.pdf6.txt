RADAR PLOT WAS TERMINATED ABOUT 2330 AND OBSERVATION CHECK CUT THE AREA THE UFOB WAS IN. HOWEVER THE UFOB WAS AIRBORNE AND TRACKED UNTIL APPROX 24 30 PST. THE LAST RADAR SEARCH OF THE AREA FROM 2330 UNTIL APPROX 24 30 REVEALED NOTHING AND IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE UFOB HAD DEPARTED THE AREA.

THE 2-6 MILE AREA OF THE UFOB COULD NOT BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED INASMUCH AS IT WAS APPROX 1-1/2 MILES FROM THE NEAREST RADAR STATION. COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICERS MRS. ORIGINAL RADAR RETURN MAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY INDIVIDUAL PRECONCEIVED OPINIONS CONCERNING UFOS. UNDERSIGNED SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS WERE NORMAL.

PROBABLE WERE AIRCRAFT WHICH WERE ERRONEOUSLY CORRELATED TO THE 
TARGET PICKED UP BY THE RADAR. IT HERE WERE SEVERAL OF OUR LIAISON 
PILOTS WORKING IN THE AREA WHO WERE TESTING NEAR DRAG CHUTES. THIS COULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THE PECULIAR MOVEMENTS SEEN ON RADAR. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY A POSSIBILITY AND IS A GUESS. IT WAS CONTAINED UNTIL THE MORNING OF 5 NOVEMBER 57.
