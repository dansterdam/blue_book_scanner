The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report document related to a UFO sighting in Sylacauga, Alabama in 1954.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"After he viewed it, an employee of Bell Telephone Co. said he thought he could 'get enough evidence that the thing fell in my house.'

"Swindle said Sylacauga Mayor Ed J. Howard gave assurance that the object will be placed in the State Museum of Natural History at the University of Alabama when it is returned by the Air Force.

"But Mrs. _____, his husband, who didn't know about the incident until he got home from work early last night, was furious about the loss of the meteorite.

"'I'm going to demand that the Air Force return the stone to me,' he said. 'They had no business taking it away in the first place.'

"Swindle, the geologist, said the meteorite was six inches in diameter. He said the inside was a metallic, gray granular substance which responded to tests given for sulphides.

"The outside coating was a black satin appearing substance.

"Besides striking Mrs. _____, the meteorite caused quite a stir in Sylacauga.

"Almost everyone in town saw the smoke which followed the explosion and a goodly number saw the explosion itself.

"A country store operator and farmer, was outside his home when he heard the explosions.

"'First there was a loud boom,' he said. 'Then in a few seconds there was another one and then a third.'

"He said after the first and second explosions, he located the direction of the noise and looked aloft and saw the third. There was a little fire and a lot of black smoke."
