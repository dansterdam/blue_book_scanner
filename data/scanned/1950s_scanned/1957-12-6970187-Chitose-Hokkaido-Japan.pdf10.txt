The image does not appear to contain any photographs. Based on the text in the document, the contents are as follows:

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
TO: AFOIN-4hh
AGENT: Capt. Gregory
1. This report is not sufficiently documented for a complete evaluation to be made. Obviously, photos of an object "thought to be the same object" as visually and radar two days earlier are of no value.
2. However, based on the above, and considering the number of people who reported the sighting, plus the fact that the object was said to have been seen from several places, it would indicate just what these people did see. The erratic movements of the target on the scope and the course sound like unaccountable and inexplicable. This report appears to fall in the category of those incidents which cannot be satisfactorily explained.
