TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:

In accordance with your request, I have reviewed the material forwarded and have the following information to report:

On 20 February 1958, a special investigation was conducted at Powell Station, Tennessee, concerning a report of unidentified flying objects sighted in that area on 6 February 1958.  

The investigation was conducted by Captain Lester D. Stevenson, 1st Lt. Walter L. Youngblood, and M/Sgt Arthur J. Bryant, all assigned to the Detachment #4, 1712th Geophysical Squadron, USAF, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

The principal witness, Mr. Joseph Paul Campbell, was interviewed and stated that on 6 February 1958, at approximately 2130 hours, he sighted an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Powell Station, Tennessee. He described the object as being elliptical in shape, extremely bright, and moving at a high rate of speed on a northeasterly heading. Mr. Campbell stated the object was visible for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing from sight.

Mr. Campbell reported the incident to the local civil defense authorities, and it was in turn reported to the Air Force.  The investigation team stated that they were unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the unidentified flying object sighted by Mr. Campbell.  No further details or conclusive findings were provided in the report.
