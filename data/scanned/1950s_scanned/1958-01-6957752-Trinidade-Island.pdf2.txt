The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing the events surrounding the UFO sighting on Trinidade Island in 1958.

TRINIDADE ISLAND
1958

The Air Force received its information on this case from the U. S. Navy; it evaluated the photographs as a "Trick".

Although a detailed investigation was not undertaken by the Navy, the photographs furnished by the Brazilian navy were reviewed and found to be inconclusive. Lasid detail is sharp, but the also appears to be little contrast, and shows no shadow effect. It also appears that the photographer's "friends" are extremely sharp, but the actual object photographed appears to be blurred as would occur in taking pictures of an extremely distant object.

The man who made these pictures had no connection with the Brazilian navy; he was a professional photographer, and an expert in such work. However, of the Brazilian navy reported seeing the UFO; in addition to the photographer, only two persons, both of them friends of the photographer, reported seeing the UFO.

This sighting is still carried as a TRICK in Air Force files.
