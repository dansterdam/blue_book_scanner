Got a wonderful letter from zher
wondering about getting more of that
material, and also report that when
my friends discussed it with them
they seemed quite interested. Thank
you for letting me know that you have
some extra on hand. If you can ever
use anything, give me a holler.

Sincerely,
Walter W. Jr.
