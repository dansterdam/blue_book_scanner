The text below the image indicates that the object was sighted at an altitude of 29,000 feet and was described as a "wave of light" that was "at 9,000 feet above" ground level. The image is marked as "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top.

Text extracted from the document:

ALTITUDE-29,000 FT.
AT 9,000 R. THE WAVE OF LIGHT SEEN CAME IN A WAVE OF LIGHT. WENT UP SO HIGH IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE A CRESCENT MOON. ESTIMATED THAT THE ABOVE OBJECT WAS AT 9,000 FT. ABOVE GROUND, BUT THE ABOVE DATA REFERS TO THE WAVE OF LIGHT, NOT THE OBJECT.
