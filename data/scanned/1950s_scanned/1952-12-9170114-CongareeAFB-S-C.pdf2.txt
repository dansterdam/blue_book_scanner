STATEMENT

On 4 Dec 1952 I went on duty as 0900 hours as a Plan Position Indicator Operator at the tactical Air Direction Center (TADC) at Congaree Air Force Base, S.C. At approximately 1000 hours I observed on my radar scope an unidentified target, which appeared to be moving westerly at a speed of approximately 800 knots. This target was designated a "track" and at approximately 1005 hours it passed within 10 miles of the radar station. 

As it passed the station I watched it carefully and estimated its speed to be well over 800 knots. I called the Controller and informed him of the situation. He acknowledged my report and told him that I had an unusual target. At this time the target was at a range of 59 miles and its course was 270 degrees. At this time the target flared up and indicated that it had slowed down to approximately 400 to 500 knots. It then accelerated again to approximately 800 knots and proceeded on a westerly course. 

At approximately 1015 hours the target was at a range of 99 miles. The target stopped at 112 degrees for approximately 3 minutes, then came back to 99 degrees and continued westerly. The speed was estimated at 800 knots. The target then disappeared at 99 miles.

The elapsed time from first sighting to disappearance was approximately 0347 hours. The speed was estimated at approximately 6,000 miles per hour.
