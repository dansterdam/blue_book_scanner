JANUARY 24, 1953
GIANT ROCK AIRPORT
JOSHUA TREE, CALIFORNIA

Air Force Intelligence 
Attention: Field
Dear Sirs:

On the afternoon of January 22, 1953, at about 1:55 p.m., what appeared to be a B-36 bomber, flew over here in an easterly direction. As it passed Yucca Valley, California, it apparently stopped and hovered as it was approximately 1,000 feet in the air and seemed motionless. 

The object was approximately 60 to 70 feet in diameter, silver in color, and circular in shape. It stayed motionless for about 2 minutes. Then it suddenly took off at an extremely high speed, climbing to an altitude of about 13,000 feet and also leaving a vapor trail. It went about 1 mile to the right of it's vapor trail when it disappeared from view.

I have had my observation verified twice. Several witnesses from Joshua Tree have contacted me and verified their observation which coincides with my report.

The entire sighting lasted about 2 minutes. On the right of the bomber and behind it was a smaller vapor trail. This smaller trail led from the bomber into the large vapor trail. When the object took off, the smaller vapor trail disappeared.

I just certainly saw this object and it could have been a bomber with a peculiar observation. But, it disappeared at such a high rate of speed that I doubt it could have been a bomber. Certainly no aircraft that I know of could have performed that maneuver.

Sincerely yours,
(Redacted)
