The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, but it does not contain a photograph. Instead, it shows a diagram or sketch of some kind, with the text "WAC-440" and "WAC-400" written on it.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have scanned the text in the document and produced the following output:

WAC-440
WAC-400
