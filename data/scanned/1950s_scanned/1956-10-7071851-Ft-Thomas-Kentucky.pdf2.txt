Bavina, Ohio. Having first learned of it about 8 pm that evening at the scene of the incident. On Sunday, Oct. 7, 1956 at about 6:30 pm while traveling east on U.S. Highway 27, we did observe a bright lighted object in the sky. At first it appeared to be as the head lamps of an approaching automobile, but the size and apparent light emanating from it ruled this out. The object was stationary at first for a minute or more, then gradually increased speed and took off in a northerly direction for at least a minute when it seemed to just vanish and disappear straight up and was gone. There was no sound or trail behind it as it went. The whole thing seemed to move at a tremendous rate of speed. A jet would have had a difficult time keeping up with it. As nearly as I could judge, it must have been several miles up and quite large. If I had to estimate, I would say that the visible diameter was at least 50 to 75 feet. The time of observation was about 3 minutes. I am certain that what we saw was not an ordinary aircraft. The description given above is absolutely accurate to the best of my knowledge. Please return the enclosed photographs and negatives to the writer after analysis. If analysis is not possible, these should be returned in any case.

Sincerely,
