BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
At approximately 1002Z, 22 JAN 52, ground control radar picked up an unidentified target. The target was observed on the radar scope at intervals for 2 min. The object was picked up several times, but each time it lost altitude and the radar operators could not lock on to it. It is believed that the various picks were not due to one distinct object, but rather to abnormal atmospheric conditions.
