THE KEARNEY INCIDENT

like polished steel or aluminium.
When I was about 30 feet from the ship a pencil-like stream of 
light shot out from the ship and hit me across my upper chest. I don't 
know whether I was scared stiff or
paralyzed by the ray of light, but 
anyway I couldn't walk or move my 
arms. Then a door slid open in the 
ship and two men cane out toward 
me. They asked if I was armed; I 
said "No," but they frisked me anyway. However, they didn't take any-
thing from me. By this time I could 
move again. I asked them what they 
were doing there, what kind of ship 
this was, and where they were from. 
They said they couldn't tell me that
at this time. I asked if I could come 
closer to see the ship. They said,
"Yes," for they couldn't leave for 
a few minutes anyway, and I was 
invited to come aboard. Inside, the 
leader said I could look around, but 
not to touch anything.
From the outside, this ship ap-
peared to be a solid piece of metal 
without portholes or windows. The 
only opening I could see was the 
doorway we entered. Inside, it was 
entirely different; the walls looked 
more like glass, and I judged them 
to be a foot thick, but you could look 
right through them! You could look 
up and see the sky, look down and 
see the weeds and brush - look out 
and see the trees and the entire 
countryside!
There were four men and two la-
dies inside the ship. The men were 
dressed in street clothes, approxi-
mately 5'8" tall, weighing about 170 
pounds; the two ladies appeared to 
be about the same height, weighing 
about 120 - 130 pounds, and I guess-
ed their ages to be about forty. Their 
complexions were rather dark, about 
like a sun tan. The ladies were bru-
nettes and wore light colored blouses 
and dark skirts, and medium heeled 
shoes. 

The two ladies sat behind a large
desk at one end of the ship all the
while I was inside. On the center
of their desk was a large instrument 
which looked like a TV set. Also at
this end of the ship there were four
columns of colored liquid - red, 
green, blue and orange. These tubes 
were approximately feet high 
and 6 inches in diameter. The liquid
was slowly moving up and down like 
pistons in an automobile. The girls 
seemed to be watching these tubes 
very closely.
The other three men worked on 
the instrument panel. This panel 
covered one side of the large center
room and seemed to be filled with 
clocks, dials, buttons and switches. 
In the center of the panel was an-
other large screen of some sort. It,
too, looked much like our TV screen,
but it was not operating while I was 
there. I saw one of the men clip off 
some short wires. I looked over the 
panel for identification of the in-
struments. I thought I might be able 
to see where they had been manu-
factured. There was no lettering of
any kind either on the inside or the
outside of the ship, but I did see
some regular and Roman numerals
on the instrument panel.
Later, I estimated that this large 
room in the center of the ship must 
have been about 50 feet long and 30 
feet wide and about 14 feet high. At 
each end of the ship were rooms ap-
proximately 25 feet long which I
was not permitted to enter. But 
when I looked down at the ship from 
the river bank and up at it when it 
took off, I could see a large tube
about 12 feet in diameter in each 
end of the ship. In each of these 
tubes was a large 8 to 10 bladed fan. 
What these fans were used for, I
don't know; I didn't notice any
breeze or dust caused by them on
the takeoff.
