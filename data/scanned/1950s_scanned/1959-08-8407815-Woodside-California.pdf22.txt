There appears to be no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
(Diagram showing an unidentified object moving in a wavy path)

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One): 
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22:
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain 
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? What color or colors would it be? When placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object you saw?

I tried to imagine a saucer-shaped craft about 50 feet in diameter that was made of some kind of lightweight material, perhaps a metal alloy. It would be a silver or gray color. I think that this construction would give the same appearance as the object I saw moving across the sky.
