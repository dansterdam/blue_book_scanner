There is a photograph present in this image, which appears to be a newspaper article about a supposed "Sky Blast Rocks" event that occurred in Seattle. The newspaper headline reads "Was Eerie Explosion a Meteor?" and the article discusses the details of the incident, including the estimated height of the explosion and the reactions of experts and observers.

Was Eerie Explosion a Meteor?

SKY BLAST ROCKS

SEATTLE — An unidenli-
fied object — possibly a me-
teor — "ripped like a
freight train" across the
sky over Seattle and ex-
ploded early Sunday.

The blast, which was felt
as far away as Forest
Hills, Wash., 40 miles from
Seattle, was seen by thous-
ands of persons. The explo-
sion, which created a seis-
mic disturbance, shattered
windows and shook build-
ings. The blast was estimat-
ed as loud as 5,000 tons of
TNT. The U. S. Air Force
said the blast was probably
a "bolide," a bright meteor
that flashes and explodes
within the earth's atmos-
phere.

The blast was heard by
persons in a wide area, ap-
parently reaching as far as
50 miles from Seattle.
James E. Yunge, of the U.
S. Coast and Geodetic Sur-
vey, estimated the height
of the explosion at 20,000
to 25,000 feet.

Dr. Fred L. Whipple,
Harvard astronomer, said
that the Washington blast
was higher than reported
by observers. Whipple said
that the blast could have
originated within the
earth's atmosphere.

Norwood Allison, pilot,
reported seeing a brilliant
saucer-shaped object about
2,000 feet high estimated as
low as 2,000 feet.

Thousands of persons
were awakened by the ex-
plosion, but there was no
substantial damage.

The Air Force said such
a blast was first definitely
believed to be within the
earth's atmosphere and
was almost impossible for
a meteor to get within 2,000
feet of the ground before
disintegrating.
