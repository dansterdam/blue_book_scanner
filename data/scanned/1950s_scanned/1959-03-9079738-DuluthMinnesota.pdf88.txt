III. DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
At approx 2050, 9 March 1959, Captain Joseph Murphy observed a single, bright, motionless light at approximately 10,000 ft, west-southwest of the P-69 radar site. The light was observed to be stationary for about 45 minutes, then it suddenly accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in about 2 to 3 seconds. The object was estimated to be traveling at a speed of over 1200 mph during its departure. It did not leave a trail. The object was tracked on the P-69 radar scope and the speed calculation was confirmed. No sound was heard. The night was clear with unlimited visibility. The object was observed by Captain Murphy through binoculars for the entire period of the sighting. A few other personnel at the site also observed the object, though the number is not specified.
