Mr. *** said he was coming from Painesville towards his home when he sighted this object. He said it seemed to be large, about the size of two large aircraft, and it was descending from the northwest. He said it slowed suddenly and then accelerated again. When he first saw it, it was a dull silver color and seemed to be glowing from the inside. As it slowed down, it took a bluish-green color much like that of a luminous welding torch. The object appeared to be flat on the top and bottom and almost round in shape. It made no noise whatsoever and gave off light waves which caused static on his car radio.

As he approached the object, it again accelerated, and he said he could not estimate the speed, but it was very fast. The color changed to a reddish-orange as it gained speed. He said it appeared to be about twenty to thirty feet above the ground.

Mr. *** was then asked about vision into the object or sighting any people or structure. The answer was negative, the object appeared solid and gave off varying colors of light as described.

Mr. *** was then asked why he was absent for a whole day and night after this incident.

He explained of his fears of the sighting, and the general attitude of his friends was one of disbelief and amusement, etc. He said there had been some light on the subject for the investigators, but that was all he knew and said.

The report goes on to provide additional details about the sighting, including the witness's physical symptoms and radiation measurements. However, it does not contain any photographs.
