Transcription of the text:

There appeared 5 m in diameter at the horizon and the objects appeared to be heading northwest and were travelling at a high rate of speed.
Estimated to be at least 1000 miles per hour.

In fact the object did not ascent or descend so the shape and the size remain the same.
Astronomers are now trying to determine if VENUS visible during to the period.
No actual details of objects were discernible due to haze and cannot determine the exact nature of the objects.
