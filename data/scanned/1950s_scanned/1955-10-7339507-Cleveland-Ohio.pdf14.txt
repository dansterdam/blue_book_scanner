Do they have a row of yellow lights?
No.
Do they have red and green running lights?
Yes, a green, red and yellow flashing lights.
By the description of witnesses and our investigation, then, we know the object is luminous, Probably 500 ft. in diameter, and stationary. As a last measure, we took the case file to the Air Force for closer analysis. 
"Thursday, November 13, 1955 - Sgt. Lee" after hearing my report, called the Olden detachment and told them I heard their report and can stand by what I said. With an explanation to the sighting however, further analysis was needed for the last time. He had this to say:
"Well, it seems what you saw was an unidentified flying object, Most certainly Unidentifiable from your account. This was quite strange and unusual phenomena, which nevertheless defies any further reasonable explanation from your account. If this is really what you saw, then no civilian or military authorities can otherwise say this was just a mistake." 
However, we have orders to release nothing on it. It will be sent on to higher authorities at Wright Field."
