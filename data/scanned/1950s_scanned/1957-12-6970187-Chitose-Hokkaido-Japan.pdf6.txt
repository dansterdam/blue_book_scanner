The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which includes a table with latitude and longitude coordinates, time, position, average velocity, and other details related to various UFO sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

3. The following is a list of the latitudes and longitudes for various sightings, and the times of such. The sightings all took place in this list contain only latitudes.

Position Latitude Longitude Time Altitude Average Velocity
(Miles) (min) (MPH)

42° - 00' N 139° - 30'E 093562 - 51.1 4 766 
42° - 55' N 140° - 30'E 09002 37.0 2 510
42° - 45' N 141° - 00'E 0112 -14.2 9 94.7
42° - 55' N 140° - 30'E 0132 25.7 1 1542 
43° - 12' N 140° - 20'E 0182 21.3 6 213
43° - 20' N 140° - 23'E 9202 14.4 2 122
42° - 34' N 139° - 37'E 9222 93.9 8 629
42° - 00' N 139° - 18'E 9292 23.1 1 1686
41° - 53' N 139° - 52'E 9312 30.0 2 900

The above positions were plotted and the time between grid and geographic coordinates were noted. The relation between geographic coordinates was computed. From these values the average speeds were computed. The mean of these average speeds was 1262 mi/hr or a value not consistent with the data reported. If the computed speeds at 0.0002 or 766 mi/hr were used in place of the reported 310k to compute ranges. The ranges would be increased by a factor of more than 10. Finalizing this situation requires additional investigation.

4. The location of the observation starting and the heading and elevation angles during the sighting were not included. While data is prime importance in evaluating photos for other supporting data.

Likewise, nothing was stated concerning type of film used or development it received. The photo images did not appear as closely as would be expected to the operations methods however nothing definitive can be ascertained because of the lack of data.

Conclusions: From the above analysis it is shown that considerable contradiction in results are the direct effect of inconsistent data. Unless the points in question regarding the data can be resolved no valid conclusions can be made.
