The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter discussing a UFO report.

Text from the document:

It is my understanding that it is AF policy to vigorously investigate all "good" UFO reports. Almost the only person who has bothered to investigate me was a flying saucer chaser.

It is also my understanding that it is AF policy to send a "standard questionnaire" to all people making a "good" report. Where's the 9" if they wait much longer, the report will probably be classified and filed as "doubtful value".

In conclusion, I would like to point out that many civilian and military pilots, radar operators, astronomers and ordinary citizens like myself have made these reports, explaining them away as weather conditions, meteors, mirage, mock suns, planets, etc. I do not think that this stock answer explaining them away as weather conditions is sufficient. It is certainly insufficient to explain the insistent and accurate descriptions given by many competent observers who have traversed the sky THREE TIMES, from horizon to horizon, maintaining a different formation pattern with each pass. This sighting is dramatic evidence supporting the argument held by many competent observers that there is intelligent control behind these observations.

Hoping this report to be of value...

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Los Angeles, 22
