STATEMENT
17 October 1952 

On 16 October 1952 while in the vicinity of the French Bowl, DT 9942 at 0652T, three (3) miles northeast of Suwon, Korea, an object was observed. This object appeared to be at an extremely high altitude, traveling on an easterly heading at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to be circular in shape, a bright silver in color, and was observed to stop and hover. After a brief stop, the object continued on in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. The speed of the object is estimated at 800 MPH as it covered approximately 19,000 feet. The objects speed was estimated at 800 MPH as it covered approximately 19,000 feet. 

At the time of the observation, it was a clear day and all-this-time the military Air Force issued sun glasses and pilot goggles were being worn, and when I first observed the object it was outlined against a background of blue sky and what appeared to be white fluffy clouds. The object was brighter than the sky background as it was a brilliant silver in color. I observed the object until it was in the vicinity of the coastline at which time it faded from sight due to early morning mist over the ocean.

From my heading, the object was observed at the following clock positions: 1.) from right due to early morning mist over the ocean.
