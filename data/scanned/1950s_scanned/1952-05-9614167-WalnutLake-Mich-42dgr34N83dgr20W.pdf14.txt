AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (sigence)

UNCLASSIFIED

There were no fragments or photographs taken. There was no interception or identification action requested by this headquarters.

10. The only air traffic reported in the area at the time of the sighting were two F-84's which were flying from Indian Springs AFB, Nevada to Bergstrom AFB, Texas, and landed at Bergstrom AFB at 2127 Central Standard time.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

11. Source was sincere, positive and definite about all aspects of this report. 'The other two witnesses were in complete agreement with him, which substantiates his story as to time place and what was seen. The fact that the observers were looking at the sky in the direction in which the objects first came into view, allowed them to observe the objects throughout the entire period they were in the area. Observers were also accustomed to the darkness, having been sitting out of doors looking at the stars for some time. The source stated that it was a sight such as he had never seen before. This statement is reasonable in that the officer had considerable experience as a navigator and was well acquainted with conventional aerial objects. No special significance can be given this report inasmuch as there are no other records of comparable sightings in this area on file at this station.
