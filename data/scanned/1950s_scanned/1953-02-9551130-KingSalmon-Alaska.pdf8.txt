CLASSIFIED

INCIDENT

On 7 February 1953, at about 2200 hours, the undersigned was standing near the King Salmon Airport when he observed a very bright light in the sky. The light appeared when Plane No. 128 was taking off from the airport. The light was observed to be traveling at a high rate of speed and changing direction very rapidly. It was going from one position or altitude to another position or altitude at a speed which made it impossible to follow with the eyes. The light disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. This incident was verified by the tower operator and other observers at the airport. No unusual sounds were heard.

The above is a voluntary statement and is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
