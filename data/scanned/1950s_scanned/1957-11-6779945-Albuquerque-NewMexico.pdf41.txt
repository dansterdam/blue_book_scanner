FORTUNE ITEMS: The Smithsonian Institute recently set up an elaborate rate system of cameras and other electronic devices in an endeavor to study and record any Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) that might appear in the area. Hundreds of people have been witness to these strange objects and it is estimated that over 200 men are working on this project. A scientific committee has been formed to study any information gathered from this elaborate setup.
