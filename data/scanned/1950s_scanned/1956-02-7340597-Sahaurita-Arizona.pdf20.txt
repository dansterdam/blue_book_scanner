22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.):
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? AFTER HOVERING VERY CLOSE OVER ABOUT 30 MINUTES I TOLD NOT ABLE TO LEARN ANY MORE ABOUT IT WE DROVE OFF AND CONTINUED HOMEWARD.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw, or of what type of material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Give some appearance as the object which you saw.
A GLOBE OF IKON AND LEAVE IT IN A ROUGH FINISH. I WOULD ALLOW IT TO RUST OR DETERIORATE UNTIL IT WAS AT LEAST A HOUR OLD. THE SHAPE OF A ROUGH DIAMOND OR SPHERE WOULD CAUSE IT TO DRIFT AND WANDER IN THE AIR. THIS METHOD OF SELF PROPULSION MIGHT CAUSE IT TO GIVE OFF HEAT. I AM PARTIAL SHARPLY TO RESEMBLED OBJECTS WHICH HAVE SEEN OR FLOATING MINES. I KNOW IT SOUND SILLY BUT THAT IS HOW I CAN BEST DESCRIBE IT.
