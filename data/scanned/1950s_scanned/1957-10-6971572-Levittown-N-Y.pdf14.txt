The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that contains a textual description of an event involving a "huge fireball seen over Denver". The text describes how radio trackers spotted the Soviet satellite Sputnik over the mid-United States and how the "radio tracking control center here said Sputnik would pass."
