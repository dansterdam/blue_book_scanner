EVALUATION OF UFO REPORT, GULF OF MEXICO 
TO: TDED/Capt Quintanilla
Opinions regarding 5 May 1957 Gulf of Mexico reports:
a. Speeds of two or three radar sightings are compatible with aircraft speeds.
b. If planes were flying at very low altitudes (below 1000 ft), they could "drop out" at distances around 92km. (Assuming ships' radar could not pick them up).
c. "Second time around" signals might act like this - be erratic, and drop out at what looks like short ranges.
d. If the target in the third sighting actually did "hover", balloons, or a flock of birds, could indicate oscillation if the contacts since the contrast
6 minutes. Since 3 radar contacts were observed in a period of about 5 minutes, then disappeared, it seems more likely than anomalous propagation (false targets) is the answer.
