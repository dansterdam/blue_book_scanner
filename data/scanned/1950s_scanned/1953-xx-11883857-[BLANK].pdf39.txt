AIRCRAFT

1. Shape: From conventional to circular or elliptical.
2. Size: Pinpoint to actual.
3. Color: Silver to bright yellow (night - black or color of lights).
4. Speed: Generally only angular speeds can be observed. This depends
   on distance but small objects crossing major portion of
   sky in less than a minute can be ruled out. Aircraft will
   not cross major portion of sky in less than a minute whereas
   a meteor certainly will.

5. Formation: Two to twenty. Numbers greater than 20 more likely
   birds than aircraft.

6. Trails: May or may not have (vapor and exhaust).

7. Sound: Zero to loud shrill or low depending on altitude.

8. Course: Steady, straight or gently curving (not erratic - may
   appear still if approaching head-on). Right angle turns
   and sudden reversals, changes in altitude ruled out. Note:
   Although report may indicate erratic course, if other items
   check, follow-up should proceed on basis of aircraft be-
   cause of psychological tendencies of excited people to
   exaggerate course changes.

9. Time In Sight: More than 15 seconds, generally of the order of a
   minute or two.

10. Lighting Conditions: Night or Day.

11. Radar: Should show normal aircraft returns.
