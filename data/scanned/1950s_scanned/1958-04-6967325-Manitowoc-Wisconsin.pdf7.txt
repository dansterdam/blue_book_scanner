This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text describing a sighting of two unidentified objects in the sky over Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

The text describes the witness observing two objects descending from the sky, one of which appeared to drop into the trees. The objects were observed moving in a northeastern direction, with one object leading and the other following at an angle of 90 degrees towards the northeast horizon. The objects were described as bouncing over houses and then turning southwest, continuing to bounce until after midnight when the witness left the area.

Sister _____

and we saw a second object coming down from the sky, which is number 2 in my questionnaire. It seemed to drop in jerks into the trees. It was circular shaped similar to a large grade school eraser object but smaller. It seemed to hover low in the trees. After Sister left I noticed the object (No. 1) started to move in a Northeast direction. I shifted position from the West to Northeast part of the building and as I ___ watched from the second position I noticed that both objects were going in a Northeasterly direction.

No. 1 was leading and No. 2 following about an angle of 90* toward NE horizon. No. 1 kept rising until it disappeared in a more northerly direction. No. 2, after it had gone quite a distance in a SE direction, turned and came back and seemed to bounce over houses and seemed to be about a 90* angle. It headed in a Northwest direction, then it turned Southwest. It kept bouncing over the ___ field. It kept on until after midnight when I left. Later the sheriff came and asked me to show him where I ___ the objects. He I showed him the exact spot. I also used the binoculars and saw object No. 2. He couldn't tell what it was and ___ went toward it to find out what it was. It disappeared when he got close to where it was.
