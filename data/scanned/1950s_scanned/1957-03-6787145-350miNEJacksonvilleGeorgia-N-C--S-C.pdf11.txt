There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing only handwritten text.

I will now act as an OCR system and extract all the text from the document:

April 20, 1957
DATE

I was sleeping at the time and the only thing I remember
is that I was taken out of my seat and I was hit on top of
my head and I was bleeding from my nose for many days after
that. I still bleed and I get awful headaches. I was treated 
by two doctors in Puerto Rico and they remitted certificates
to you about my condition but as far as the accident is
concerned I heard people talking but I didn't see a thing.
