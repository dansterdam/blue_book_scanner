**In accordance with AFI 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBRPT), the following report of unident-
ified flying objects is submitted:**

On 3rd August 1952 at 2220 MST, Mr. --------------------, Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, observed a formation of orange lights apparently hovering in the sky. The objects were about 45° above the horizon and appeared within the line of sight leading to the Big Dipper handle. The observer was located in the south edge of Truth or Consequences, leading west of north.

The objects made an intricate change in formation, and then, seemed to ascend at a rapid rate until out of sight.

The observer, assuming size of objects to be equal to a jet fighter, estimated the position of objects to be 6 or 7 miles away. (This would place objects overhead the Truth or Consequences Airport which has a rotating light or beacon.

The time of observation was approximately 9 minutes.

**The reliability of the observer is considered good.**
