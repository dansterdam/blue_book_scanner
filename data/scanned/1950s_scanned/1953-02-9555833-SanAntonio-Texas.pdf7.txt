STATEMENT

The following took place on the night of 26 February 1953. As I came to work at about 20 minutes to mid-night 1, along with about twenty-four others, I was traveling light in the sky. In appearance it looked about like a star moving at excessive speed. The object was very clear against the night sky. As I watched it progress, it disappeared from sight. It must have covered the distance between here and San Antonio, which is about 80 miles, in a very short time. It was traveling so fast that the object appeared to be at an extreme height. It must have taken about eight minutes to travel the distance from here to the southwest of us. There is not much I know about it. It was not a saucer-like flight, but it seemed to be propelled by some mechanical power I would have taken for another star.
