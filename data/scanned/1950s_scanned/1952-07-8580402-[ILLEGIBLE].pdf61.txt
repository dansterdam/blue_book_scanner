I have furnished aviation for last 13 yrs. Since Flight Engineer XXXXXXX and director to Lockheed 403 with Airforce. I now sell a converted Piper Cub. I can name any aircraft by sight or sound but I will say this object was not an aircraft and did not fit anything I weighed or knew exists or weather or wind conditions except a hovercraft.

Please advise if I can be of further service. It will gladly give any information that I have at my dispsal.
