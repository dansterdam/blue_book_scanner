GREAT FALLS, MONT.
August 15, 1950
Unidentified Flying Object Report
Subject interviewed: XXXX XXXX
(Details withheld to protect privacy)
On August 9, 1950, at approximately 2200 hours, XXXX XXXX, a resident of Great Falls, Montana, observed a bright, saucer-shaped object in the sky over his home. The object appeared to hover and maneuver for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing from view. XXXX reported the incident to the local authorities, who in turn forwarded the information to Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects.
As part of the investigation, XXXX was interviewed, and the four photographs included in this report were taken during the follow-up inquiry. The photographs depict what appear to be unusual markings or patterns in the landscape, possibly related to the sighting. However, the exact nature and origin of these markings remain unclear and require further analysis.
This case has been classified as an "unresolved" incident in the Project Blue Book archives, and the investigation is ongoing.
