The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, discussing a UFO sighting.

Text found in the document:

They had seen a brilliant light thru the blizzard and overcast, to the west of them around 7:30 PM., the night of January 6th. The object must have been a long distance from them, a little later it disappeared to the northeast. Also, the light had been seen in a southwesterly direction. Later in the investigation, it was found that there had been a military jet in the area, but there was no connection established between the light and the jet.

Early in the investigation it was learned that some civilians and military aircraft had been reported as unidentified. Evidently, it was learned later, that a civilian aircraft was flying in the area. The crew members were questioned, but they could not recall having seen anything in the area. Up to this time there was no knowledge of a meteorite.

Both men insisted they had seen a large red light that looked as large as an orange held at arm's length and it had appeared to be moving erratic for the aircraft, then it suddenly disappeared. The path of the object was downward and to the right of the aircraft which was heading north. This appeared to resemble a controlled descent rather than a simple visual illusion. No persons had seen reported the phenomena.

If no objection is forthcoming -- an incidentally if Air Force is uninvested in further action or examination -- I request permission to write an article examining related possibilities, including contributions of the civilian and military observers, a brief overall summary, and of course, on the national interest, but I would appreciate a response to this inquiry.
