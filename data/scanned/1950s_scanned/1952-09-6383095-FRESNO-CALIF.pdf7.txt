We are very familiar with flying devices and are much interested in this matter. I am also familiar with flying discs. Do not believe in this way as other people are so positive, we have little traffic of any kind of people from some other planets, and if so, what could they do for us? Have ideas as a matter of human welfare are very dubious and it is wise to be reserved from human feeling than to become excited over unidentified phenomena.

The objects observed were dim and first and then bright and distinct, and seemed to travel at a varying speed, sometimes slow and sometimes fast, and seemed to maneuver in a manner difficult to describe or reconcile with any known aircraft. What was seen did not appear to be any kind of standard aircraft and gave the impression of something unnatural. The objects appeared to fade from view and then reappear, but I was not close enough to obtain any detailed observation of their construction or method of propulsion."
