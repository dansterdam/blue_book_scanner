Congress of the United States
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.
July 21, 1958

Dr. A. Francis Arcier
Scientific Advisor
United States Air Force
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Ohio

Dear Dr. Arcier:

How very kind you have been to me in taking your valuable time to investigate and report back to me concerning the bright August day in 1950. I saw reflected in Puget Sound on that bright August day in 1950.

Never in my life had I heard of a fireball. Now I feel superior to my friends in that not only do I know what one is, but also I am among the few who have seen one. In addition, I can, from now on, relate this experience from my own observation of it.

With your permission, I shall use a substantial part of your letter in my weekly Sunday column to the Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune, probably next week. I shall send you a clipping.

Again, many thanks for this great privilege to have met you and I sincerely hope our paths may somehow bring us together again.

Sincerely yours,
