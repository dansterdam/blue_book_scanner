AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PROJECT 10-108-446 AUG 1956
FLIGHT 1-8, 6602D AISS
ID# 93
STATEMENT OF TOWER OPERATOR

AT approximately 2130 on 11 November, 1956, while our crew was on duty
in the R.F. sector, I looked through the binculars but could see nothing.
A bright flash, bright as lightning, appeared for 1 or 2 seconds. That
started an investigation. I kept in visual contact with the helicopter most of the
time he was there. At one time I thought I saw a light going around the 
helicopter but it disappeared, I would judge it's speed to be that of a fast light
bearing in a rapid static flash. I would judge it's disappearance as instantaneous. Another
time after the helicopter had landed, I sighted a similar light bearing
approximately 30 degrees from the helicopter to the east, moving at a rapid rate and
dropping from an altitude of 3000 or 6000 feet. This was very near the time the
helicopter was first sighted. I would estimate its speed to be around 600 to 800
miles per hour. I would say this is the only sighting I am definitely sure of. The
time was two heading in the same general direction.
