In compliance with FEAR Letter AG 350.07, dated 5 March 1952 and in connection with investigation by 6004th AISS, the following report of an Unidentified Object is submitted: 

1. Object was first sighted flying near deck of T-6 aircraft at approximately 10:30. Object was amber in color with a very distinct outline. Object appeared to be under control. There were no aerodynamic features such as wings, tail or fuselage observed. The object maintained a constant velocity of approximately 100 MPH (estimated) at an altitude of approximately 13,000 feet, heading North then turned and headed South again.  It orbited the aircraft at a distance of 1/2 to 1 mile. The object then made a very high speed pull-up, climbing almost vertically to an estimated altitude of 60,000 feet in a matter of seconds. There was no sound from the object.

2. Object was under observation for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

3. Observation was visual, air to air from a T-6 aircraft flying at 10,500 feet. 130 miles per hour. Air Force issue sun glasses were worn by the observer. No optical devices were used.  

4. Object was at GR 6554.55 on initial sighting, flying close to the ground. It climbed to an altitude of 13,000 feet when the observers lost sight of it. 

5. Pilot was First Lieutenant Layton S. Baus who has flown 54 missions in Korea and the observer was First Lieutenant Richard A. Johnson. Observations of both are accepted as completely reliable.
