As approximately 0500 6 November 1957, we were operating under the blackout condition, and we had just been relieved from a patrolling mission. It was about this time that we noticed a bright light appear over the hill which was about one and a quarter miles away. It was a like a white flash (flash of bright light) that lasted quite a long while, like 10 to 15 seconds. It looked like some sort of a lighting and seemed to illuminate the whole area. It was not a lightning flash, as that light produced was generally more of a bluish color, and about 100 yards or less in diameter. This object which we saw was much brighter, and the illumination seemed to cover a much larger area, perhaps 500 to 1000 yards in diameter.
It was just about this time that we went to the sandbagged shelter as we were under a blackout condition. The light which we had seen earlier had disappeared and it was very dark. We could see only dimly outlined shadows and could discern no details.
All of us had witnessed this bright light and it is my personal opinion that it was not a lighting flash, but some other type of illumination or object which produced the bright light. I have no idea as to what it could have been, since it did not resemble any type of known aircraft or projectile.
