THE NIGHT OF 6 OCTOBER 1959 
AT APPROXIMATELY 2000 HOURS, I WAS OBSERVING THE EVENING STARS IN FRONT OF MY RESIDENCE ON LANGLEY AFB, VA. SUDDENLY, I NOTICED A BRIGHT MOVING OBJECT IN THE EASTERN SKY WHICH AT FIRST APPEARED TO BE A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. AS I OBSERVED IT FURTHER, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THIS WAS NO ORDINARY AIRCRAFT. IT WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND MAKING ABRUPT CHANGES OF DIRECTION. IT APPEARED TO BE OVAL-SHAPED AND BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR. IT WAS ALSO GIVING OFF A BRIGHT, PULSATING LIGHT. I CALLED MY WIFE TO OBSERVE THE OBJECT AND SHE ALSO CONFIRMED WHAT I WAS SEEING. THE OBJECT REMAINED IN VIEW FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION.
