NOTE: Individual frames are numbered in the order taken.
C-97 AERIAL CAMERA:
Standard base filter.
G-97 91111100 was equipped but hand held and braced against
the aircraft to avoid blurring. "Planning" was not used.
Frame #1 was slightly blurred, possibly due
to fore and aft motion of the camera. Altitude 970 feet from this northward and at an
angle of 0 degrees (approx parallel) to the ground.
COMMENT: Although several attempts were made to 1812Z, the first picture was not taken
until about 1312Z, and all the attached frames were taken before 1322Z. During
the daily between the time of the lighting and the first picture the recall was
not made to the pilot. The 12 photographs were taken when the aircraft
was on a heading of 350 degrees.
