"This was reported to the city of Mobile, Alabama police station at approximately 1959 on the evening of 6 October 1959. The individuals who reported this incident stated that they were traveling on the U.S. Highway 90 approximately 13 miles west of Mobile, Alabama when they observed a luminous round object hovering above the highway. This object was described as being approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and it appeared to be rotating slowly. The object was estimated to be about 300 to 500 feet above the highway. The witnesses further stated that the object appeared to be extremely brilliant and was lighting up the surrounding area almost as bright as day. After observing the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, it suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The witnesses were quite shaken and upset by this incident and requested that an investigation be conducted. This case is presently under investigation by the appropriate authorities."
