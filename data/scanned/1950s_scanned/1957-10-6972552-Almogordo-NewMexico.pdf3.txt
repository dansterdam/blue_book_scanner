"10-6-1957

SUBJECT: CIVILIAN RESEARCH GROUP

INFORMATION AND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE INDICATING A CIVILIAN RESEARCH GROUP IS INCLUDED IN THE INCIDENTS REPORTED NEAR ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO, ON AUGUST 5-6, 1957.

PRIMA DONNA, THE USAF PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR, OR HIS AERIAL PHENOMENA BRANCH STAFF, DID NOT SEEM INCLINED TO FURNISH ANY INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS MATTER. HIS EVASIVE REPLIES AND RELUCTANCE TO DISCUSS IT INDICATED THAT HIS SUPERIORS HAVE INSTRUCTED HIM TO WITHHOLD ANYTHING THAT MIGHT IDENTIFY OR INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF THE CIVILIAN RESEARCH GROUP INVOLVED.

REPORTS OF WITNESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WERE SECURED THROUGH THE AFFIDAVITS AND INTERVIEWS OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND CITIZENS. CONSIDERABLE ROCK AND SOIL DISTURBANCE WAS OBSERVED. RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IN THE AREA WHERE THE OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED.

MEANWHILE, FOLLOWING OUR INQUIRIES, OFFICIALS FROM KIRTLAND AFB VISITED THE SCENE AND TALKED WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS. THEY HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED, SAID OR DID NOT IDENTIFY, SAID THE OBJECTS AS BEING OF UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ORIGIN.

AN ASTRONOMER FROM THE NEARBY OBSERVATORY SAID, "I LOOKED UP AND SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE DOZENS OF STARS ALL FLASHING ON AND OFF." HIS DAUGHTER, LEAVING FOR WORK AT THE TIME, SAID, "I LOOKED UP AND SAW A ROUND OBJECT IN THE SKY, AND IT SEEMED TO BE EMITTING A BLUE-GREEN FLAME. IT THEN DISAPPEARED TO THE NORTHEAST." HER STORY CORROBORATES THAT OF OTHER WITNESSES IN THE AREA.

PSYCHOLOGICAL DR. CARL JUNG OF SWITZERLAND MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO DISTURBANCES THERE DURING THAT PERIOD. THIS MAN IS QUOTED IN A BRITISH JOURNAL AS SAYING THAT SOME "FLYING SAUCERS" WERE REAL.

THESE THINGS ARE NO MORE RUMORS SOMETHING HAS BEEN SEEN."
