discussed with the NORAD team the events leading up to, and those associated with, the detection and reporting of the high speed tracks on 20 September 1957. The details of the above discussions along with the NORAD team observations are contained in the following paragraphs:

2. MONTAUK AFB: Montauk Air Force Station is located on the northeastern tip of Long Island, N. Y. The following is a list of radar equipment and operating parameters associated with this station at the time of the incident: 
Prime Search AN/FPS-20 (1250-1350 mc) Dual Channel
Emergency Search AN/FPS-8 (1280-1350 mc) non-operational
Height Finder AN/FPS-6 (2700-2900 mc)
Antenna Rotation Rate 5 rpm
Antenna Tilt (Electrical) 2.20
Pulse Recurrence Frequency 400 pps
Bin/Scan Ratio on RR-6 from Detection to Fade 1.0

6. Circumstances Related by the Montauk Operations Personnel: Prior to the detection of the high speed track RB-6, the duty controller was engaged in an intercept over the Rockaway and Quogue Range south of the Montauk Station. Scope displays and the appearance of routine traffic seemed normal.

At approximately 1905-1825, a target return was observed on a PPI console at a range of approximately 210 n.m. east southeast of the station. An initial track was established on it at 1906:52.
