MEMORANDUM FOR MAJOR GENERAL WALSH
SUBJECT: Air Defense Radar Incident

I have reviewed the attached account of an Air Defense radar incident. The radar incident is reported to my headquarters by the RORAD and the incident is reported to have occurred on 7 September 1957 in the vicinity of Montauk, New York. The report indicates that the most probable cause of this incident was equipment malfunction, however, the report also states that it is impossible to determine that this was in fact the cause of the incident precisely as reported.

Considering the good correlation of the object observed, I am inclined to believe that the object observed is most probably not a person. The report indicates that from the observed points of light, it should not be concluded that there was a determination of a definite solid object. However, I suggest that from the points of light observed, electronics people as well as ARDE may possibly be able to shed further light on this incident. In the meantime, you may wish to consider taking a closer look at the types of incidents on a special effort basis for the next few months in an effort to determine whether this is in fact an isolated incident.
