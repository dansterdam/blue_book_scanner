Sondrestromfjord Air Base, Greenland  8 April 1953

I. DESCRIPTION
At 2302, two observers flying MATS aircraft reported sighting an unidentified light 1 to 2 miles south of Sondrestromfjord Air Base, Greenland. The object was observed to be traveling in a northerly direction of travel at an estimated speed of 165 knots. The object maintained a steady course, but seemed to be in a shallow descending turn. The observing aircraft was at an airspeed of 165 knots and a true heading of 30 degrees. The white light was observed on the starboard side at approximately 20 to 30 degrees off the bow. The duration of the observation was approximately three seconds at a distance of 30 to 100 miles.

II. DISCUSSION
It was felt that there was a similarity between this sighting and the Reykjavik, Iceland, sighting of 1 April 1953. It was the opinion of the Director of Iceland Defense Forces that this was the selected phenomenon. The description of this light fits that of a meteor, except that a meteor very seldom appears white. However, Professor Bjork concurred with the MSAF evaluation when its contract astronomer also was of the opinion that the phenomenon was astronomical in nature.

III. CONCLUSION
Probably astronomical (Meteor).
