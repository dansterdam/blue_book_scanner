30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional pages if necessary.
I want to assure you we are not confused as to the color of the objects. This is part of the time we watched them they looked to be a very light grey or white, for a few seconds before they turned over two or three times and that's when they reflected the sunlight that cased them to appear brighter (possibly as bright as 7.2 seconds) they turned over again two or three times and that's when they reflected the sunlight and appeared to have a different color or brighter as the report states.

Now that I have answered your questions, I would like to ask you one. Don't you know more about these objects than you are letting us know?

Sincerely,
_<redacted>_
