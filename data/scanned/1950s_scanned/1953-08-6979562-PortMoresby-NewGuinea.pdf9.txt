(Unclassified) JAG NO. 54-54

SUBJECT: Unidentified flying object

DATE OF REPORT: 27 August 1953

SUMMARY: (Narrative should be couched in summary paragraph. Last sentences all known to be true. Begin text of report on AF Form 112â€”Part II.)

At approximately 1330 hours, 26 August 1953, 1st Lt Norman B. Jenner, 54th Fighter Bomber Squadron, was on a routine training flight over the area of Port Moresby, New Guinea, when he observed a bright, shiny, metallic-like object in the sky. The object appeared to be disc-shaped and was at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. Jenner immediately called the tower at Kila Airfield to confirm his sighting. The tower operator and other personnel also observed the object. The object was approximately 30 inches in diameter, disc-shaped, and was moving at an extremely high rate of speed. It appeared to pulsate or throb at intervals. Jenner watched the object for several minutes as it moved about the sky. At one point, the object stopped and hovered briefly, then accelerated and disappeared rapidly in a straight line. Jenner stated that the object gave off a bright metallic glow and moved in a manner unlike any known aircraft. There had been no other aircraft in the area at the time.

Jenner is a very reliable observer and his sighting was confirmed by other personnel. It is the opinion of this Command that the object observed was an unidentified flying object. There is no other explanation that can be given for this sighting.

There had been no other balloons or aircraft reported in the area within two (2) hours prior to the sighting. Nor did the object conform to the flight characteristics of any known aircraft.
