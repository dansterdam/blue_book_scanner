AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT OF REPORT: 
1. The source showed great presence of mind in the investigation of this case. When the sighting was made, he went to an underground command post and immediately reported it. This was the proper procedure to follow in sighting of this nature. 
2. The source states that he has received training in recognition of aircraft and their capabilities. He was able to observe certain characteristics of the object which differentiated it from conventional aircraft. A clear sketch not only of the object itself but of its maneuvers, as well as the flight path, was provided.
3. The report states that the object was observed near a known radar site and that it exhibited characteristics not common to conventional aircraft. Its high speed, abrupt changes in direction, and ability to hover are indicative of a highly technical device not presently in our possession.
4. The report is considered to be of great value in the continuing investigation of aerial phenomena of this nature. The source is considered to be reliable and his report is given full credence.
