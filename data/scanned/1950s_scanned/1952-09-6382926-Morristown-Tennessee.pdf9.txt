I feel almost certain that this object was not an aircraft - at least not an aircraft as we know them. A pilot almost certain that this was not an aircraft. I feel almost certain that what we saw was a completely unfamiliar object, differing in shape, color, and flight characteristics from anything we have previously known. It was completely silent and moved in a manner that could not conceivably be a conventional aircraft. The flight path was very erratic, the motion almost impossible to describe. Some observers thought it might be one object, others thought they saw two or three objects. The estimated speed was incredibly fast, varying from 500 to 1000 miles per hour and probably higher. The object(s) were sighted by 10 or more people. Several of us observe the thing for several minutes. It came into view low in the east, passed overhead approximately a mile away and disappeared in the west. I feel sure this report is accurate and the thing we saw was an object of some extraordinary nature, very different from any conventional aircraft. I would welcome any further questions you may have, and would be glad to provide any additional information that might be useful.
