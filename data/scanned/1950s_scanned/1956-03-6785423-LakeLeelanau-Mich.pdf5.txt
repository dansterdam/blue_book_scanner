AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: 30-APRB-2-56
PART FIVE
3-3-56, 46028 AIS

I. SOURCES: Mrs. Address: Rural Route One (Box 130), Cedar, Michigan
Age: 66 years
Occupation: Farmer
Education: Grammar School
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: Most of those interviewed, when asked about the reliability of this source, conceded that she was a bit eccentric and had mentioned things in the past which could not be verified and therefore did not consider her testimony as irrefutable.

III. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "I was sitting in the house sewing last Saturday evening at about 10:30 p.m. (03-31-56) when the dogs started barking and carrying on outside. They seemed very excited so I went out to see what was causing it. Looking up, I saw a large, bright light in the sky, perhaps about 500 feet up, hovering about, and moving slowly from west to east. The light seemed to be about the size of the full moon and very bright, almost dazzling. I watched it for about 10 minutes, and it kept changing colors from dull red to bright white, to blue-green. Then it shot straight up and disappeared. I went back into the house and reported it to the radar base. I was quite concerned."
