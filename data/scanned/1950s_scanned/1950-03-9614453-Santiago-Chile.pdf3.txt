STATEMENT

On the 28 Mar 50 at approximately 1430 hours I was returning from my home
at 1057 Vitacura to the U.S. Embassy for the afternoon's work period. I noticed
numerous persons outside looking at the sky enroute to the U.S. Embassy, I did not
stop or talk to anyone until I arrived at the U.S. Embassy. I immediately came to the
9th floor and started looking out of the window. Northing was sighted.  I then decided
to go to the roof of the Embassy building, I borrowed from the U.S. Navy Attache a
pair of field glasses and proceeded to the top of the Embassy building with the sole 
thought in mind that I would discover some illusion, perhaps a cloud wisp or a
reflection from an object and thereby convince myself that there was nothing present
in the sky. I was on the roof of the U.S. Embassy for approximately one hour and was
constantly scanning the sky with both my normal eyes and with the field glasses. At
approxmiately 1515 hours I detected an object travelling from south to north at an
extraordinary altitude and at an extreme rate of speed. I detected this object with my
naked eye and was then able to look at it through the field glasses. The height of
the object made it impossible to determine any details about it other than what it
appeared to be moving in a straight line. It appeared to be more white than any other
color. I watched the object move approximately 30 degrees of sky within 5-10 seconds
then decided that I would return to the office and procure a camera with a telephoto
lense and attempt to get a spot on a piece of film to support my story. I returned
to the roof of the U.S. Embassy with a camera equipped with a telephoto lense and
was unable to spot the object again. The small graph is furnished in relation to point
of sight and the object seen in relation to the sun.
