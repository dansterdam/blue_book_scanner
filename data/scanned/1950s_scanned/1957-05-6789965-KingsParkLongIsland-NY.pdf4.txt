Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Cont'd)

during world war II. His observation that the speed of the object was so low that if it was an aircraft it would stall out, seems to rule out the P-1D2 even if he was mistaken about the apparent size. The winds reported by the weather station at Suffolk were approximately 90 degrees to the reporting direction of the path of the object. This however does not fully rule out the possibility of this being a balloon. M.________ story cannot be fully accurate as to the direction from him to the object. If the balloon traveled the course he claims, he would have had to look almost directly into the sun near the latter part of the object's apparent flight. Mr._______ says however that the sun was in back of him and did not interfere with his view. That being the case the object could have had an easterly course which would correspond with the winds reported. The cigar shape could be accounted for as the shape of the object or the shape of the shadowed portion. The diminishing size and disappearance of the object might be accounted for by a combination of balloon climb, and outbound heading, and the normal decrease in definition as an object goes up-sun on slightly hazy days. The weather balloon from LaGuardia might be in the vicinity at the time reported, or more probable 15 minutes later. This balloon however should have been considerably smaller in size than the object Mr.________ reported.
