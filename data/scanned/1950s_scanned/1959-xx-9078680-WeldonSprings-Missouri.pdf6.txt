The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It seems to be a handwritten letter or document from the Diplomat Motel in Waterman, Saint Louis 8, Missouri.

The text in the document reads:

"Near front control room
Note: Concerning most unusual and the front news from the motel are receiving continuous calls again- some as unusual as your friends up North - the front desk never sure from moment to moment what to expect - all of it very interesting - but half us wish that for a change a normal night of peace and quiet - it seems that the folks in the rural areas here are getting fully as excited as the city folks and keeping us on the go with reports and requests for information - we are anxious too -but need sleep sometimes!] The folks even call up and say they saw 'a flying saucer' - and want us to go out and see it - we have to tell them that we are not equipped for that kind of an observation - and suggest that they report it to the proper authorities - the night watchman did see some lights in the sky the other evening but could make nothing definite of them - strange sightings from many sources - it makes one wonder and speculate - do you have any word there in the city that might throw some light on it all? If you do, we would be most interested in hearing about it - for the time being we just try to be helpful and courteous to all who call and keep our sense of humor! Very best personal regards, [signature]"
