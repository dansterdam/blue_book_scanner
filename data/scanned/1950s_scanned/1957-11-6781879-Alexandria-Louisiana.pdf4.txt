ASTRONOMY
Venus Most Prominent
Venus is the brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars." Then you will see them high in the south by early evening. Venus now stares over in the west, after the sun sets, with a brilliant figure stands against, and to the left of her, the well-known figure stands Aquarius, the water-bearer. Looking closely, one can see that aside of Venus, in the evening, two other planets appear in the sky, bright near Venus. One is Saturn, and the other is Jupiter. However, it is Venus that exceeds the star in brilliance at this time. Venus appears much brighter than anything else in the sky at present, rivaling the brightness of the moon. In the evening, look for Venus, the brightest object in sight. This will continue through the month of November.

Shower or "Shooters" to Come
November is the month bringing one of the year's famous showers of "shooting stars," which appear from about this time to the 18th.
