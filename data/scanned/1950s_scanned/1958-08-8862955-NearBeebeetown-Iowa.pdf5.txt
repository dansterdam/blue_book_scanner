Omaha World Herald  
13 August 1958  
Glowing Light in Night Sky  
Definitely Wasn't Satellite

A Lincoln resident and two Omahans reported seeing an unusual bright light in the sky about 3:30 a.m. Tuesday.

No explanation was apparent immediately. "It could not have been a satellite," said Lynn Aspaugh, acting observer in charge of the Moonwatch station at Nebraska Wesleyan University at Lincoln.

The only remaining Russian satellite in the sky passed over the Lincoln area about 11 p. m. The American Explorer is passing over the area during the day, is not visible to ground observers, he said.

The Sputnik III will pass just west of Lincoln at 10:39 p.m. Wednesday and about 10:24 Thursday, he added.

Tuesday's reports came from:

Weslevan watchman, who said he saw the object traveling southwest at 3:28 a.m. He said it was "a bluish white, intensely brilliant oval with a very short yellow-red tail, appearing to be about half the size of the moon."

who was reporting to work at the City Market, 511 South Eleventh Street, at about 3:30 a.m. He called it "a blue flame as big as a basket ball, traveling straight west."

Mrs. who happened to be awake and glanced out a window about 3:25 or 3:30. She said she had the impression of a "flash," then a glowing green object traveling north, then turning west. "It was bigger than a star," she said.
