STATEMENT

The approximately 12:00t on the night of 29 November 1952, it was flying on a heading of approximately 270 degrees, at an altitude of approximately 23,000 feet, over the Hokkaido Island area of Japan. The object was first observed at approximately 24 miles distance to the northwest, traveling at an estimated speed of 70 to 80 miles per hour. As the object approached the aircraft, the speed apparently increased to an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour. The object showed a tail all one sudden swirling motion, giving the appearance of being transparent. When the object was approximately 5 miles from the aircraft, the pilot interrupted the object with his aircraft. The pilot observed the object but nothing was recorded on the radar. The vertical visibility was unlimited at 15,000 feet. The pilot reported the sighting to the 67th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, who in turn reported it to the 543d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. Specific information concerning landing, launching or any unusual light or activities within the area were negative. The possibility of an unusual natural phenomena being the cause of the sighting is considered extremely remote.
