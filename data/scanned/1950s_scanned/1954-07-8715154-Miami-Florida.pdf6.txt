The text in the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

From: Officer in Charge, Field Intelligence Office, Miami, Florida
To: District Intelligence Officer, SIXTH Naval District
Subj: Unidentified Flying Object

Encl: (1) Views from observer of subject, Object
(2) Sketch of sighting, compiled by observer

1. A representative of this office was informed by Chief of Staff, Naval Base, Key West, that a report of a sighting by LCDR BOWN, USN, on 29 July 1954, was forwarded to your office on 4 August 1954. Enclosures (1) and (2) are forwarded with this report.

2. BROWN is regarded by the command at Key West as a most reliable Chief Petty Officer, with the observation. He stated that he has observed meteors, meteorites, comets, and the like in the past, and knows them. However, he was convinced at some length to the horizon on the earth's surface. He did not believe subject object could possibly have been one of those terrestrial phenomena, so it may be of interest to the surface of the earth.

3. The helmsman on BROWN's vessel also sighted subject object. His version of the sighting is being compiled and will be forwarded in the near future.
