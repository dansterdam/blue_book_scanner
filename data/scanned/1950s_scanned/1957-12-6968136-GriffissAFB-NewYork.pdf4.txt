The image appears to contain handwritten text, but no photograph. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe the text found in the document:

The object appeared to move very fast, and no sound (of jet exhaust) was heard. The speed of movement from north to west was much faster than the speed of movement from a point west to 10 degrees or 15 degrees south of west. This indicated direction from NE to SW. The object appeared to be very distant and did not compare at all with other aircraft sightings in the area at the time.
