FACTUAL DATA

At the present time there are a number of instrumented test installations but the United States has capable of tracking aerial objects. Such installations are Holloman Air Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, etc.

DISCUSSION

It is suggested that these installations be contacted and their operations for tracking aerial objects be determined. It may be possible that by slightly altering present operational procedures the tracking of such objects could be utilized in this project.

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES

A. Contact the Air Research and Development Command and request authorization to visit the slow-moving/low-altitude installations. Facilities to determine the time aloft, hours per week the tracking equipment is operational, etc.

B. Determine whether or not it would be feasible to establish such photographic facilities, etc. according to the information received.

C. Submit a proposed plan for utilizing tracking facilities in conjunction with reported visual sightings.

As soon as a plan for the utilization of AF facilities is established, approach the Army and the Navy with the same plan.
