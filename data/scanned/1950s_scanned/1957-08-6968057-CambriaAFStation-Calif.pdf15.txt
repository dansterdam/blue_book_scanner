A HOPPING UFO OVER OLD GREENWICH, CONN.

August 6, 1957: Mrs. ________ of Old Greenwich, Connecticut, was standing on her porch at 9:00 p.m. when she noticed a strange object in the sky. It was silent, and there was no trace of daylight left in the sky. Her attention was caught by the sudden appearance of a bright light which she describes as being south of her. It was bright, larger than the full moon in angular size, and the color was bluish-white. The object was roughly equivalent to the full moon in angular size. The object hovered and wobbled about, up and down and in an erratic manner, for some minutes, approximately two to three.

Mrs. ________ had barely noticed this object when she saw it suddenly execute a semicircular and upward movement which she described as "a sudden scaling just as a fish springs from the water." It disappeared in about ten "oscillations."

It returned almost immediately - still fairly bright but not as large. It did not pause or hover this time, but shot away rapidly as if it were retreating and it disappeared in the distance across the sky. Mrs. ________ thought it must have accelerated tremendously to have gotten away so quickly.

The entire observation lasted several minutes. The object, while hovering, was large and distinct; however, if it did disappear into the clouds, it was evident only by the larger and farther away it became and then by its disappearing from view. The editor is indebted to Mrs. ________ for this report to CSI.
