The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

C. DISCUSSION (Cont):
asked Mr. _______ of then brought up the subject of my real purpose for being there and discussed the question of the nature of the object. ____ said he had come to the conclusion also far and said if it was opened the "Angel's-hair" would disappear. However, suspect-ed immediately that it would not have destroyed by opening the job and he could see that the object was still intact inside the jar. What he had meant was that if the jar was left opened the "Angel's-hair" would disappear.
I then replaced the lid of the jar as it appeared outside and obtained photographs outside. I took additional pictures of the area. In so doing, I noticed a white object floating in the air and retrieved fragments of what appeared to be cotton or spun glass.
I then returned inside and Mr. ____ gave me the ore or metal samples he had collected, stating that they were dug out of an old stone quarry. (I understood him to say near Cincinnati; however, I have since learned that the samples were found in Huntington, Indiana.)
