S. G. Fuld: Object first sighted by the observers as they were leaving the main gate of Holloman Air Force Base. The object appeared in view in the northeast sky and was observed for a considerable length of time. About 10 minutes. The object moved rapidly back and forth across the sky, alternately speeding up and then slowing down considerably. At one time the object appeared to be definately not aeroplane. They thought it might be a meteor or balloon or some other strange object. Even after the sun crossed, the object was still in view. During its slow segment, the object seemed to take on the appearance of a ice-cream cone. The observers advised that the lower part of the object would occasionally reflect the light of the sun - like a pendulum and would occasionally reflect the light of the sun.

Checks were made with the Base weather Squadron, Operations & Projects Sections and a Aato-meteorological Research Branch at the White Sands Proving Ground Research Branch and the Base Weather Squadron. That would account for the sighting. This was reported to the Intelligence Section and no indication they were in the air at the time was given.

There were no special precautions taken as this was no place in the Air Force Regulations where any official investigation was required. This was reported unofficially to the Intelligence Section and they advised that there were no places in the air at the time.
