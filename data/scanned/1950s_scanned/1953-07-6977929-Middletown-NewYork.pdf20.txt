There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This page appears to be a document titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from Project Blue Book.

The text of the document is as follows:

THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECTS WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, BUT OBSERVERS STATED THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE FLAT, OR SLIGHTLY CURVED, DISCS. THE OBJECTS WERE QUITE POSITIVE THAT THE OBJECTS DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THEY WERE QUITE POSITIVE THAT THE OBJECTS WERE LARGER THAN ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT IN THEIR AREA AND THEY WERE QUITE POSITIVE THAT THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

2. WEATHER: 
a. LIGHT CLEAR DAY, VISIBILITY EXCELLENT, WITH VERY LIGHT WIND.
b. AIR TRAFFIC: OBSERVERS HAD OBSERVED SOME TRAFFIC, SUCH AS CARGO PLANES IN THE GENERAL VICINITY, WHICH APPEARED TO BE HEADING FOR STEWART AFB, BUT NOTHING SIMILAR TO THE OBJECTS THEY OBSERVED.

3. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE INTERVIEWER THAT THE OBSERVERS WERE INTELLIGENT, STABLE AND RELIABLE PERSONS AND THAT THEIR OBSERVATION WAS MADE IN GOOD FAITH. THEIR DESCRIPTION WAS QUITE DETAILED AND THEY SEEMED TO BE QUITE POSITIVE ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW, SO THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO DISBELIEVE THEIR STORY.
