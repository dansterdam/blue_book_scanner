Attention Capt. E. J. Ruppelt

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter concerns our examination of a sample handed to me about a month ago by Capt. McGovern. This sample appeared to be ceramic in character, and was reported to have been picked up at a location not indicated. The material was requested to have a determination made of its mineralogical origin. Due to its strange nature, it was examined by metallurgical methods, and two thin sections were studied in transmitted polarized light.

Neither the texture nor the mineralogical composition of the specimen is consistent with the texture and mineralogical composition of natural materials. This cursory examination indicates that both texturally and mineralogically the specimen bears a strong resemblance to very basic slag from an open-hearth furnace. The five principal phases in the specimen have been tentatively identified as a triclinic silicate, dicalcium silicate, calcium ferrite, ferrous oxide, and metallic iron.

It is considered that these data fulfill the requirements of the request.

Sincerely,

Howard C. Gross
