Fiery Ovals Sighted in Far Places
(Dallas, Texas staff and wire reports)
Several cases of fiery oval-shaped objects sighted in far places were recently reported. 
The objects were reported as hovering near the ground for periods ranging from a few minutes to almost an hour before moving straight up and out of sight.
Creditable witnesses include ranchers, businessmen, and a deputy sheriff. 
The sightings occurred in southern New Mexico, first on June 29, 1949 near White Sands and later in July in several locations.
Both sightings were investigated by military and civilian authorities.
