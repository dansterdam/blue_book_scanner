AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: AERIAL PHENOMENA INVESTIGATION,
ROME, GEORGIA, 12 APRIL 1955
DETAILED REPORT:
ON 12 APRIL 1955, AT APPROXIMATELY 2000 HOURS, A BRIGHT LIGHT WAS OBSERVED IN THE SKY APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES NORTH OF ROME, GEORGIA. THIS BRIGHT LIGHT WAS FIRST OBSERVED HOVERING IN THE NORTHERN SKY FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES, AFTER WHICH IT MOVED RAPIDLY UPWARDS AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS ROUND IN SHAPE AND APPEARED TO BE EMITTING A PULSATING OR FLASHING LIGHT. NO NOISE WAS HEARD COMING FROM THE OBJECT. THIS INCIDENT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, MOST OF WHOM WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROME AIR FORCE DEPOT.
INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:
SINCE ONLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROME AIR FORCE DEPOT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM OTHER INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS. THE OBJECT OBSERVED COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT OR ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA. ACCORDINGLY, THIS INCIDENT REMAINS UNEXPLAINED.
