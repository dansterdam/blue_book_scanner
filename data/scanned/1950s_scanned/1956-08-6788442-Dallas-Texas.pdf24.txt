The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, titled "RADAR OBSERVATION DATA SHEET". The document contains a series of questions and answers related to detecting radar equipment.

I. QUESTIONS REGARDING DETECTING RADAR EQUIPMENT
1. What type radar equipment is involved? 275-429
2. Has there been any recent maintenance difficulties? If so, describe. None
3. What type modulator (i.e., spark gap, hard tube, etc.) is used in the radar equipment? Hydrostatic
4. Was the AFC (automatic frequency control) circuit of the receiver operating properly? Yes
5. Has interference from another radar set been observed recently, and are personnel familiar with the effects caused by an interfering signal? No
6. What type indicators, "A scope", "B scope", etc., were used to follow the target? PPI
7. What was the radar scan rate? 27/
8. What was the approximate frequency of the transmitter? 3,900 MC

II. GENERAL QUESTIONS
1. What were the general weather conditions at the time unidentified target was observed? Yes - 5, Clear
2. Other weather data from nearby weather stations is available on temperature vs altitude, humidity vs altitude, and wind velocity vs altitude? Humidity 50%, Visibility 30/40, 2 miles 30'
3. Was the target observed by any other nearby radar equipments? If so, give details. No
4. Are the operator and the supervisor familiar with the effects of anomalous (duct-effect) propagation as they pertain to this type radar? Yes
