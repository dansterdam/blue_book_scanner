The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text and diagrams.

The text from the document is as follows:

23. In the following sketch place an "M" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

[Diagram showing overhead view and horizon line]

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "M" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
