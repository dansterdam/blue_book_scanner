Transcribed text:

"It looked like a large ball of white fire. At first it was coming to a stop at an altitude of approx 5500 ft and remained stationary for a time, then started off again to move horizontally. It was approx 50 ft to 75 ft in diameter. 

It seemed just like a large ball of white fire. At first it was kind of hazy, but then it became brighter and brighter until it began to glow. I was not able to see that it was newly round. 

There were several sets of lights that were maneuvering one... another that was near it and other distant lights that were also maneuvering.

The object stayed there hovering for about five minutes and then was no sound at all, and then I noticed that the object was beginning to change slightly from white to more of a yellowish, and then it was left in a terrific burst of speed."
