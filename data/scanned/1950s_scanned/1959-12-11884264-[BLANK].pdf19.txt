DRAFT ltr to M/Gen A. H. Luebernan Pr Ger Walsh
SUBJECT: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

1. In the fall of 1949, the USAF took official notice of reports of unidentified flying objects. Responsibility for the UFO project was assigned to the intelligence community.

2. The project, as established, was to determine if UFOs were hostile, and any possible scientific value, and to determine the nature of each of these objects. After 12 years and more than 5000 reports, the Air Force has not discovered any evidence which would indicate that UFOs are hostile or pose a security threat in any way.

3. In the absence of evidence to indicate a possible security threat, the scientific and public relations aspects of the program gained stature. It becomes obvious that with these new objectives the program's assignment to intelligence is no longer practical. Experience during the past 12 years has indicated that the program is more a public relations program than anything else. The few reports that may have intelligence and/or scientific and technical value have a tendency to become lost in the volume of UFO traffic. In an effort to overcome this shortcoming, it is my opinion that the aerial phenomena project should be assigned to SAFOI.

4. To prevent the loss of valuable information, intelligence, scientific, and/or technical, it is suggested that an individual with a technical and intelligence background be assigned to the branch of SAFOI which becomes responsible for the program. All reports which have indication of value in the intelligence and/or scientific areas would be routed to the appropriate agency for exploitation. The officer presently responsible for the program has had technical training and experience.
