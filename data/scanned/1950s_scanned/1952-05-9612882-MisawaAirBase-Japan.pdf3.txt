The report details an incident on 8 May 1952 at approximately 2200 hours when the witness was walking around a number four gun at "A" Battery. The witness observed a flash in the sky which appeared to be a flare. The light seemed to burst between 150-200 feet and then changed to a bluish color until it burst and changed to white and faded. Approximately 20 minutes later, the witness noted another of the same type flash at the same position, but this one didn't seem to go as high into the air.

The report also includes a "STATEMENT" section describing the witness walking out to their post at "A" Battery at approximately 2205 on 8 May 1952. The witness observed a flash in the air approximately one mile north of "A" Battery. The flash appeared to be red in color and had a long tail reaching approximately 200 feet, then dropped and faded. The flash seemed to last about 2 minutes.
