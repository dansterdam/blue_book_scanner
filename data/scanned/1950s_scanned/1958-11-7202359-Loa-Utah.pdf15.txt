Our headquarters are at Monticello, Utah,
the hub of the most scenic area in southeastern
Utah and the Four Corners area.

In connection with these points of interest we
visit many more areas, side wayons and an
cient Indian Ruins as out time and local con-
ditions will permit.

For superb scenery and complete relaxation
plus delicious meals prepared over an open
camp fire and sleeping out in the fresh air
between clean sheets and blankets in warm
sleeping bags with air mattresses, is a thrill
never to be forgotten.

THE NEEDLES was named for the thousand
of red and white sandstone spirals standing
in this canyon country near the junction of the
Green and Colorado Rivers. This area is fa-
mous for its photographic scenery and near by
are hundreds of canyons with cliff dwellings,
pictographs, and the beautiful Angel Arch,
Castle Arch and many other arches.

THE STANDING ROCKS is a wild and remote
country bordering along the North Rim of Cat-
aract Canyon. In places a person can loo!
into the river canyon and see the muddy Colo-
rado 2000 feet below. There are sprials, arches,
unexplored side canyons and many other inter-
esting sights in this wild land of the historic
Robbers Roost country.

SOUTHEASTERN UTAH is the land of blue
sky and white clouds. Often a person can see
the distant mountains 100 or more miles
away.
