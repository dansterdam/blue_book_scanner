STATEMENT
16 December 1957

The UFO which appeared SSW of Aomiyama on the 12th of December, 1957 appeared to be a bright, star-like object. I watched the object four times for periods of about three minutes each. The first two times I saw it, the intensity of light was very bright. The last two times I saw it, the intensity of light was not quite as bright. (The approximate coordinates were 08952, 09102, 09402, and 09502.) I viewed it with a pair of 7x50 binoculars as the naked eye.

The object's form was oval, almost circular. The intensity of light seemed the same all over the oval form but the left side glowed slightly brighter than the right side. There were two long steady arms of light extending from the left side. These were the most distinct thing about the object. At times there appeared to be a double or triple image, and the only one visible with the naked eye was the most distinct second image. This could have been caused by the intensity of light. The object's speed was very slow, approximately the same speed as a jet aircraft passing overhead. The object had no other distinct characteristics which was a white light. The object had no other distinct characteristics.
