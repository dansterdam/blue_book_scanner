III. DETAILS OF SIGHTING: On 13 March 1959 at 0135Z, 1st Lt. Tony A. Cox, Jr., AC 30713, USA was piloting a T-33 jet aircraft (Ser. No. 52-9502) in an S-1025 designated training mission over Lake Superior, approximately 20 miles northeast of Duluth, Minnesota. The object was first sighted at a distance of approximately 10 miles and was observed for about 2-3 minutes. It appeared to be about the size of a T-33 aircraft and was luminous (whitish-yellowish glow). It seemed to be stationary and hovering, maintaining an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet. Lt. Cox conducted a series of maneuvers to get a better look at the object, which appeared to respond by making similar maneuvers. He noted that the object seemed to accelerate rapidly when it moved, and that its speed was greatly in excess of the T-33's capability. At one point, the object appeared to divide into two parts, which then rejoined. Lt. Cox felt that the bodiess were nearly spherical in shape. The flight was terminated at approximately 0215Z, and Lt. Cox immediately reported the sighting to the control tower. He stated that the bodies were very obscure (like a pilot's silhouette was well acquainted with this type of flight). There was no sound associated with the object, and it displayed no visible means of propulsion.
