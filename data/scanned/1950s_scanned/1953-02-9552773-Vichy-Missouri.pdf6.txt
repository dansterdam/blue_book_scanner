STATEMENT

The following statement is submitted in accordance with Paragraph 76a, AP 12-50 dated 22 April 1952.

I, Capt. Robert R. Bailey, the pilot of a C-47E, on a course of 135 degrees, reported an unusual object in the vicinity of the Vichy radio range station. While at an altitude which had previously been established at circular direction of 170 knots, heading 180 degrees, a light intensity appeared to be on a collision-intercept course from my plane. The light, which was preceded by very brilliant exhaust flame, took a circuitous course in approaching my airplane. When it reached a point off my left wing or at 12 o'clock, the light varied in intensity and color from red to green. The light remained visible for 5-10 minutes during which time it dropped back. Relative to the aircraft, then increased its speed and made a turn and passed on a course approximately 5 miles in front of my airplane. The Chief and a seaman passenger reported the light disappeared upward at a high angle to the previous course. I executed a CIRVIS in-flight report to the Vichy Radio Range Station.
