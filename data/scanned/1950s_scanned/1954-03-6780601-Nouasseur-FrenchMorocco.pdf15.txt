(10) mile search loops indicated that lighting, which was reported
to be in the northwest, was actually toward the east. This sighting
was observed by two pilots and two GC (OREONAN controller) personnel.
It was recommended that no action be taken on this sighting since
it does not involve any objective evidence. 
(2) Five to eight seconds (3-5) sightings by two (2) pilots.

GROSSMAN further advised that the target, reported by GCA
as reflected on the Control Tower (AZ) scope, was not seen visually
by the pilots under GCA control. Although the target showed distinctly
on the GCA scope, the pilots were unable to acquire it visually.
Numbar 35.- GROSSMAN could add no further pertinent information.

1. 15 March 1954. Captain ROBERT R. SADLIE, AO 6781101, Lieut-
enant PAUL A. GAUCH, AO 2231172, and Lieutentant GEORGE A. KERR,
AO 2232460, c. 1133-1135Z. Air Refueling Squadron 3031, Desert at a point
7 miles SE of Nouasseur Tower, altitude 10,000 feet, observed one bright
light in the northeast, which was stationary and changed to dim and bright
while under GCA control, as observed by the pilots. The light appeared to
the left of their course and was held in their sight for approximately 3
minutes. The light appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 10,000
feet, which was the altitude of the aircraft. They stated that: (1) Light
started as a bright light, then dimmed to a dull glow and brightened again.
(2) Light appeared to change and vary in intensity, (3) it moved erratically
and seemed to accelerate and decelerate, and (4) It gave the impression of
being intelligently controlled. The pilots stressed that they were under GCA
control at the time of the sighting, and the light appeared to be at approximately the same altitude as their aircraft.

The Crew stated that they believed the light to be jet aircraft in a
vertical plight. However, they could not identify it as such. Nine lights
were sighted.
