On get 22tat 1952 a reported to the ****** at ****** Air Force Base that a **** observed this object hovering over this area for several minutes. The object then made an extremely rapid departure straight up into the air.

He stated that it did not so much as make a sound. The object appeared to be 150 to 200 feet in diameter and had a very intense bluish white color. The observed the object for several minutes and then it made this extremely rapid vertical takeoff and disappeared from sight.

I request that this investigation do everything possible to verify this sighting and to determine the nature of the object that was observed. It is certainly most urgent that we determine what this object was and from whence it came. This sighting is of utmost importnnce and I shall appreciate a very prompt and thorough investigation of it.

The above case is so incredible and the consequences so evident that I have no choice but to insist to the fullest upon a complete and penetrating inquiry. I do not feel that I can conscientiously pass this case along without the most rigorous examination that can be conducted. 'This sighting appears to me to be of highest priority and importance and I would appreciate your personal interest and attention to it.
