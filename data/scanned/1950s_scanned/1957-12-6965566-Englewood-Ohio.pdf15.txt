Memo to File:

A original man reached in Center 6:30 type morning 17 7 with request for a "flash" onlyâ€” Stated 28,500 0-s/m (one of many typical 89.92 $). Flew carried 8 8:40 (CAS). 
This was a report. However, follow up was negative, as man was overly enthusiastic, stated siting was only of casual interest, - no evidence indication any true sighting.

He was located through his license and was reasonably normal, but his siting seemed to be overly dramatic and obviously a serious in depth of interest. It was recommended that no further action be taken.

The case was duly handled, and - ment is partially human that type of reaction still frequently occurs.
