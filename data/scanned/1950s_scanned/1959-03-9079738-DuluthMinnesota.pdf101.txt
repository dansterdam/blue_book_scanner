The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. It does not contain any photographs, but rather a typed document with text. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

ACTION ROUTINE
OP: ATIC, W-2 AFB  
ADC1, ENT AFB, COLORADO
UNCLAS/FROM: APOIN-MB
REF UFO SIGHTING OVER DULUTH, MINN AREA ON 14 MAR 59. THE FOLLOWING IS OUR ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THIS INCIDENT. THE RADAR READINGS WERE MORE LIKELY DUE TO INTERFERENCES, PROBABLY FROM THE EXCESSIVE ACTIVITY OF AURORA BOREALIS, RATHER THAN AN ACTUAL PAINT. THE OBJECT SEEN VISUALLY WAS PROBABLY THE PLANET VENUS WHICH WAS A FEW DEGREES BELOW THE HORIZON AT A MAGNETIC BEARING OF APPROX 300 DEGREES. AND REFRACTION COULD BRING THE PLANET INTO VIEW AND DIFFRACTION AND DISTORTION BY THE ALTERNATE LAYERS OF AIR OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES COULD CAUSE THE EFFECTS OF MOVEMENT AND CHANGE OF COLOR AND SHAPE. THE FACT THAT THIS OBJECT MAINTAINED ITS SAME RELATIVE POSITION, AND THAT THE F-102'S WERE UNABLE TO CLOSE ON IT, LENDS CREDENCE TO THIS CONCLUSION.
