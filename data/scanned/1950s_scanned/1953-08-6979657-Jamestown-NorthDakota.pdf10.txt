To tell a correct story that came to my mind was within 3 minutes after seeing what I saw. This thing and meed a little bit about it. What came moving across the sky appeared as a fire head giving out a blinding light from it. It appeared as a fire head giving out a blinding light from the night sky, over my head, and to the right of me. When it had gone over a long, thin oblong shape, that seemed to have a light of its own also. This thing passed over with great speed. There in the city said the light was peculiar in all I can think of seeing don't it.

Yours truly
