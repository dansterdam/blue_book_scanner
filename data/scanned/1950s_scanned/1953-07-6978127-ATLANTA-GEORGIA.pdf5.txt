OPERATIONS REPORT - 6 THRU 10 JULY 1953

During the past week press activity concerning unidentified flying objects has increased noticeably with the most apparent case in which press publicity was given being centered around the Atlanta, Georgia, area. In this instance this rising concern seems to be centering along in a few near Atlanta where persons have reportedly sighted a flying disk with three creatures attempting to enter it as the car approached. The three men stated that two of the unknowns got back into the "saucer" but the third was hit by their car. They took this object back to Atlanta with them and one of the observers, Mr. R. displayed it in his hardware shop window.

Upon investigation by the 35th Air Division, Intelligence Office, and pressure from local and national news agencies, was assessed the whole story to be a hoax in an attempt to gain publicity. The unknown creature which he had reportedly hit with his car was in fact a monkey which he had chained. A local pet shop reported that three monkeys had recently escaped and one was damaged about the story being a hoax was never in doubt.

Waters stated that before his planned sighting, he had attempted to spread stories of the flying saucers and found people very eager to transmit his rumors.
