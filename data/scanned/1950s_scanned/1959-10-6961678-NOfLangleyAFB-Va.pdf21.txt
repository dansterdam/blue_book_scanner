There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be an old document from Project Blue Book, a military program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

As an OCR system, I can extract the following text from the document:

Dear Sir:

At your oral request, this office has further investigated the Photographs of an unidentified object which were submitted with the letter of Captain Daniel Harley dated 20 May 1959. A copy of a letter which has been sent to Captain Harley is attached hereto for your information.

As you are no doubt aware, the investigation and analysis of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) is a responsibility of the Air Force. This responsibility is directly related to the mission of the Air Force to maintain the security of the United States against known enemies and possible aggression from unknown sources. All of the reports on UFO sightings which have been submitted to the United States are carefully considered.

At the same time there are over one hundred other reasons for sightings of Unidentified flying objects. The technical and scientific evaluation of sightings is one means of assisting in determining the defense capability of the United States. However, the defense capability is only one aspect of the problem and is not sufficient in itself to justify the establishment of a scientific advisory group to carry out a continuous investigation. The conclusion of the technical and scientific evaluation is that UFO sightings do not present a direct physical threat to the national security of the United States, and do not warrant the expenditure of the large sum of money that would be required to maintain a continuous scientific advisory group solely for the analysis of reports of UFO sightings. You will note, as indicated in the newspaper article attached hereto, that an unidentified flying object was sighted and the report was evaluated by the authorities at Langley.
