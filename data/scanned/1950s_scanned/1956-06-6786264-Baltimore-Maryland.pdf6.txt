COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

b. The course of the advertising aircraft coincides with the approximate course of the object, as described in Part II.
c. Lighting as described by SOURCE in Part II would be the same as that on the advertising aircraft.
d. Due to negative radar contact accomplished by the 647th ACGW Squadron, scrambled from 29th FIS and Andrews AFB, Md., poor visibility could give varied impressions of a strange object.

f. The Air Defense Command and the FBI indicated that no unusual phenomena were evident in the area at the time of sighting.
