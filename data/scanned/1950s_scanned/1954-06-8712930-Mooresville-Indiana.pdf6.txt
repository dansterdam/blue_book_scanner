AFOIN-4X3 Dear Mr. [redacted]
AFOIN-4X4
Thank you for your letter of 14 May 1957 submitting two sightings of an unidentified flying object.
AFOIN-4A
This Center has made copies of the negatives and they are now under study by our analysts. However, due to the age and lack of information, it will be very difficult to reach a firm conclusion.
AFOIN-4B
In accordance with Air Force Regulation 200-2, all sightings should be reported to the nearest Air Force Installation for rapid analysis and possible rapid identification. This is any investigation the Air Force conducts.
AFOIN-4C
Inclosed are the two original negatives, the USAF Summary of Events and the latest USAF Press Release.
AFOIN-4D
Your interest in this program is appreciated.
Sincerely,
ROBERT E. O'CONNOR
Captain, USAF
Assistant Adjutant
