There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It is a typed page of text describing a UFO sighting report.

(period of reporting twilight had already begun). Vera was a "very say, near the going or sighting but it was only temporary. The object was a circular object in the sky. This was like the type that came later, and I know from past experience how easily it can be mistaken for an airplane. It made no noise whatsoever and there was no blotting out of the stars. The pre-sunrise sky, and I know from past experience how easily it can be mistaken for an airplane. It made no noise whatsoever and there was no blotting out of the stars, and it was Veras.

The case of the "daylight meteor" is greatly ambigious. While the daylight meteor could be confused by some, I would still favor the accidental release of stress and tension from some previous nervous strain. It could have been some type of light meteor; if the light was simply a bright reflection of sunshine in other cases, there is nothing hostile, and I say this with confidence. For a bright object, a satellite or other falling object, to carry such a visible record of a disturbance, although I think it quite unlikely, is possible. It could conceiveably have been a burst weather or cosmic ray balloon, with the reflection from traveling material perhaps being responsible for the damage, I think this is a distinct possibility. The occurrence is so uncertain and unexplained that the multiple reports of the same object suggest a real observation was made, although distorted by different observers from different angles. The first visual observation was at 4:00 a.m. their time which makes the sighting believable. The chances of such balloon launch retrievals day or night are reasonably good, and they seem to be the most likely explanation.

I am looking forward to visiting you in your new quarters---- I hope in early June.
