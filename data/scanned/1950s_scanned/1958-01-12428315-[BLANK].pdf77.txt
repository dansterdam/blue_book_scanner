SAFDD CASE

Dear Mr. Vigilesworth:

You recently requested information concerning air force investigations of unidentified flying objects.

The allegation that the air force has withheld critical information on unidentified flying objects is entirely erroneous. Many persons who report sightings to the air force do so in confidence hoping that their identities will not be disclosed. Since this information is not consistent with the conditions outlined, no scientific or objective conclusions as to the nature of these sightings can be made public. Since this information is confidential, the air force is not justified in violating what it believes to be the wishes of these persons.

The air force is compelled to deal scientifically and objectively with the facts developed during its investigations of unidentified flying objects as outlined in the attached fact sheet. The committee desires of holding public hearings on this subject.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest developments on this subject, dated 5 November 1957. You will note that paragraph 7 of the fact sheet should be amended to change the last sentence to read "The files on unidentified flying objects are adequate CTBJ TAPE."
