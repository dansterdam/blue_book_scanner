I, WALTER RANDALL, B. Nr. AF 13010849, do certify that:

As the approximately 11:23 G.C.T. an announcement was made over the interphone, to the effect that unidentified objects were spotted on the radar scope.

As the time of this announcement I was relieving the student aircraft observer and detailed the crewmembers to their usual stations.

The radar operator clocked the objects (about four or five were clocked) and detailed and X competed the air speed of the objects to average about 400 to 500 m.p.h.

While during the period 11:23 G.C.T. and 11:37 G.C.T. the radar operator tracked the objects to an approximate altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet, and I observed the objects on the radar scope. I then saw the objects make a steep climb and disappear under the scope at an altitude of about 40,000 to 50,000 feet.
