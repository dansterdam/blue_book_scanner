MEMO FOR GENERAL CABELL:

In regard to the incidents involving observation of an unidentified object by pilots or USAF aircraft on 27 and 28 April 1950 in the vicinity of Misawa Air Base, Japan, we are convinced that the cases actually saw what was described.

As to what the object actually was, we feel that it was not an aircraft or aerodynamic device of any sort, but was a visual effect produced by shock waves from other USAF aircraft in the area at the time each observation was made. In this connection we believe that the effect resulted from shock refraction of light rays caused by varying densities of air caused by shock waves, such as the condensation effects which can be photographed or superimposed vapor or super-cooled water vapor in the atmosphere, or a combination of both these possibilities. The distorted light signals would also explain the various colors and "pulsing" effects noted, all of which suggest not a solid thing but a "condition" which existed in the space. If polaroid material was used, its optical characteristics could have contributed to the appearances in form and color.

This case in some respects is similar to the excitement caused by "temperature inversions" over certain bodies of water, which decided the performance of jet aircraft. All this seems to prove that in advancing use of performance of jet aircraft, there will continue to be sights and sounds that were not associated with the old.
