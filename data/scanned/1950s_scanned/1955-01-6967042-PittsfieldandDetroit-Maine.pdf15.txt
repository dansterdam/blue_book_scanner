The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old project Blue Book document, specifically a "MEMO ROUTING SLIP" containing text related to a case regarding something in Alaska. The text discusses a Major Cooper, ATIC, and the responsibility for investigating UFO-related incidents.

Memo Routing Slip
NAME OR TITLE: Major L. J. Tucker
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: SAFOI-34
REMARKS: Regarding Case in the Files Here,. Alligator, your info only, as I am enclosing under separate cover for Foster in Alaska during the time mentioned, and he claims not know of the case. A Maj. Cooper here, who was also there at the time, knows nothing of it. How in the hell can he write objective about something he knows nothing of is beyond me.

With reference to paragraph of his letter, I think I should be told that the Air Force, and particularly ATIC has the responsibility for investigating this. Investigation of UFO and we have no desire to make a latent investigation. Especially since a solution have been arrived at locally in the Alaskan Command, and ATIC was not even advised.

Looks to me like he is trying to get into something he knows little about.
