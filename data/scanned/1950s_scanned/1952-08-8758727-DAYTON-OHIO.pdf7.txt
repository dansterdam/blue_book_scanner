Report of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

Date: 31 Aug. 1952
Time: 2345 hrs.
Details: Capt. Atkinson, OP NO. 1, Bldg. 10, received a call from the Piqua Police Dept. (Patrolman Etter) at 2330. Patrolman Etter informed Capt. Atkinson that one of the inhabitants of North Piqua) observed an unidentified object with red and blue lights, definitely unlike an aircraft. Patrolman Etter stated that the object hovered and as soon as a squad car became available, he would check with Mr. Etter on this story. Ptl. Etter feels that the source is reliable. Mr. Etter phoned No. 1 in POLIA.

I advised Capt. Atkinson that we would like to speak with these people as soon as the return call is made. Since action is being taken, do not feel that there is any need for an immediate call.

Capt. USAF

Note: Called Capt. Atkinson 0715 hrs. 1 Sept. since I did not receive any further call from Piqua. Neither did he.
