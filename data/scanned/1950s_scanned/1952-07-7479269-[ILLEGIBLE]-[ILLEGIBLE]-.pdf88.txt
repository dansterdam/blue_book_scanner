The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is handwritten and difficult to read in some places, but I will try my best to transcribe it:

7-8 AUG 46
Twelve circular objects, observation
made by Capt. T. of 8 min. observation
made by observer riding automobile.
