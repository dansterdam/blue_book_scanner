LUBBOCK, TEXAS - AUG 27 - TWO STRANGE FORMATIONS LIKE "STRINGS OF BEADS" IN CRESCENT SHAPE HURLED THROUGH THE SKY OVER LUBBOCK AT A SPEED WHICH CARRIED THEM FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON IN THREE SECONDS, THREE TEXAS TECH COLLEGE PROFESSORS SAID TODAY. THE WEIRD FORMATIONS WERE REPORTED BY W. L. DUCKER, HEAD OF THE TECH PETROLEUM ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, WHO SAID "IF I HADN'T HAD CONFIRMING WITNESSES PRESENT, I FEEL SURE I WOULD HAVE SAID NOTHING ABOUT WHAT I SAW." DUCKER SAID HE AND DR. A. G. OBERG, PROFESSOR OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, WERE RELAXING AT THE HOME OF DR. W. L. ROBINSON, GEOLOGY PROFESSOR, SATURDAY NIGHT, WHEN THE "STRING OF BEADS" WHIPPED ACROSS THE HEAVENS. "WE FELT NO SONIC WAVES, SUCH AS AN OBJECT MOVING AT SUCH HIGH SPEEDS IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE WOULD GIVE OFF," DUCKER SAID, "AND THE ABSENCE OF SUCH WAVES WOULD INDICATE THE FORMATION WAS FLYING IN THE STRATOSPHERE, 50,000 FEET ABOVE THE EARTH OR HIGHER."
THE THREE PROFESSORS AGREED THAT PASSAGE OF THE OBJECTS ACROSS THE ARC OF THE SKY REQUIRED ABOUT THREE SECONDS. WITH THAT TIME BASIS, DUCKER SAID, "WE FIGURED THE SPEED MUST HAVE BEEN 1,800 MILES PER HOUR IF THE OBJECTS WERE A MILE HIGH."
"IF THEY WERE AT 50,000 FEET," DUCKER SAID, "THE SPEED MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT 13,000 MILES PER HOUR."
THE PROFESSORS SAID THEY COULD NOT DETERMINE SHAPE OF THE OBJECTS BECAUSE OF THE SPEED, BUT THAT EACH GAVE OFF A GLOW OF REFLECTED LIGHT.
AUTHORITIES AT REESE AIR FORCE BASE NEAR HERE SAID NO JET PLANES WERE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES TO THE PHENOMENON.
