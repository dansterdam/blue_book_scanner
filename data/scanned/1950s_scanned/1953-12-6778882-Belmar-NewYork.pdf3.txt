Reported sighting of unidentified flying objects.
SUBJECT: AIRTNER
 Subject reported sighting of 3 unidentified flying objects on 3 December 1953.
1. Was in the town of Belmar in the state of New Jersey on a drive when I happened to look up and saw 3 bright objects moving in the sky. They appeared to be either silver or white in color, round, and moved very rapidly in a southeasterly direction. At first I thought they might be jet aircraft, but they were moving much faster than any jet I have ever seen. The objects appeared to be at a very high altitude.
2. The duration of the observations was from 30 seconds to 1 minute.
The sighting was reported to the nearest Air Force office.
