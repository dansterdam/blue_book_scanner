Gentlemen:

I wish to add this bit of information to my report
of an unidentified flying object observed by me on
July 31, 1956 at Temple, Texas, which was forwarded
from James Connally Air Force Base at Waco, Texas.

In addition to my initial report, I have also completed
and returned your AFIC Form 164, both given in the
clearest description possible in writing; but today
I was fortunate to view at a local theater the film,
"Unidentified Flying Objects."

The single object which I observed and reported looked
exactly like either one of the pair shown in that part of
the film which was photographed in 1950 by Nicholas
Mariana at Great Falls, Montana, except the object I
saw moved directly away at an even flow considerably
longer, but otherwise was the same apparent size, shape,
color and with the very same appearance during
its dissolution.

A review of particular part of the above film
will present a visual duplicate of what I observed,
and tried to describe in my report and in Form 164.

I trust this will be helpful in evaluating this
sighting.

Very truly yours,

[signature blacked out]
