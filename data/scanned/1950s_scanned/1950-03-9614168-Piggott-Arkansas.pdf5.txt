I apologize, but I do not see any photographs in this document. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text instructions and guidelines related to radar sightings. 

Text from the document:

GUIDE TO INVESTIGATION (Cont'd)
Relative to Radar Sightings
1. Re Radars now operating on ground
a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size of targets;
b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180 degrees), etc., and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable, how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed?
c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several targets upon approach.
d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent with size of objects; faint; pulsating at regular rate?
e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?
2. If airborne, when object was sighted:
a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits?
b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.
GENERAL
1. Teletype sequences of local weather conditions: SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT
2. Winds aloft report: SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT
a. Adiabatic chart for period in question: SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT
3. Local flight schedules of commercial, private, and military aircraft flying in vicinity at the time: (Check Canadian activity if close to border.)
NOT AVAILABLE
4. Possible releases of testing devices in vicinity sent aloft by Ordnance Navy, Air Force, Army, Weather Units. (For release and tract of lighted asynoptic balloon and other information), SEARCH ORGANIZATIONS FOR ANY OTHERS.
