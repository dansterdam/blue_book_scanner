Mitchel Air Force Base, New York
1 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
Between 0430 and 0500 EST a number of observers from varying locations around the New York City area observed a strange, round object with colors ranging between white, white-orange and amber. All observations placed the unknown in the New York City area showing the highest elevation angle of about 35°. The object was observed with the naked eye and with binoculars. Although radar was tried, there was no electronic sighting.

Observers were experienced CAA rated Airways Operations Specialists and Control Tower Operators. Observations of the object were as follows:

Location      Azimuth    Elevation   Time
a. Teterboro Tower        275°           0°         0447
b. Westchester Tower      220°          15°        0455
c. Newark Tower           315°           0°         0454
d. La Guardia Tower       320°           4°         0450
e. Idlewild Tower         275°          15°        0455
f. Mitchell AFB Tower     305°           6°         0500

An Eastern Airlines Flight inbound to La Guardia was queried as to a strange light appearing in the west. The pilot notified the object and departed the area. The weather at the time of observation was CAVU and extremely clear for the New York City vicinity with the winds NNW at 16 knots average.

II. Discussion of Incident
Intelligence personnel at Mitchel AFB determined that the planet Jupiter, on 1 December, had an approximate azimuth of 305°, a 2° magnitude (extremely bright), and disappeared below the horizon as the object was last observed. Undoubtedly, the unknown object is thus explained. The outline of other color-range under the expended presence of light reflecting through atmospheric dust. This report is one of the most complete in the files and is comparatively uncommon. Positive identification has been made with astronomical observations and no further investigations are contemplated. If the object had not been identified, more detailed data would have been possible.
