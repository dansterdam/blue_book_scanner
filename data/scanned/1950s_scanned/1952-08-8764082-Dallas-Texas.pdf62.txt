On 21 August 1952 at approximately 8:40 A.M., Major Fournet of the I/I called Captain Ruppelt and asked whether or not we had received a wire from West Palm Beach, Florida. ATIC had not received the report and Major Fournet was so advised and stated that he could not read the report over the phone. However, he did ask that someone go to Florida and find out the answers to the following questions:

1. What was the chemical analysis of the cap and remains of the clothes?
