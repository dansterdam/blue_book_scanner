The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and instructs the reader to place an "A" on the line to indicate where a high object was observed above the horizon, and a "B" on the same line to indicate where the object was observed later. The second sketch is a larger drawing that shows a road or path with trees on the sides, and two smaller sketches - one of a person standing on the road, and another of a sky with an object at the position marked as "A" and "B" in the first sketch.

Text extracted from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
