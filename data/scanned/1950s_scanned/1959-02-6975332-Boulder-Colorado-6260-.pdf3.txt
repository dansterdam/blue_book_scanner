PROJECT 6260

BOULDER, COLORADO 
6 FEBRUARY 1959

SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
On 6 February 1959, at approximately 2125 hours, a report was received at the Air Defense Command Control Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, concerning an unidentified flying object observed over the city of Boulder, Colorado. The initial report was received from the Boulder County Sheriff's Office and was followed up by telephone contacts with the observers. The sighting was also reported to Colorado Civil Defense and the Commander, 14th Air Division.

The object was described by the observers as a brilliant white light, approximately 10 to 15 feet in diameter, hovering at an estimated altitude of 3000 to 5000 feet above Boulder. The light was observed to suddenly increase in size and then diminish, with the cycle repeating several times. The duration of the sighting was approximately 5 minutes.

The object was observed by several individuals, including Deputy Sheriff H. L. Garner and the Boulder County Undersheriff. The object was also observed by an unidentified private pilot who reported the sighting to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.

EVALUATION:
Based on the investigation conducted by the Air Force, the object was determined to be a natural meteorological phenomenon, possibly a lenticular cloud formation. No definite conclusions could be drawn as to the exact nature of the observed light. The case was classified as "Unidentified" due to insufficient data to positively identify the object.
