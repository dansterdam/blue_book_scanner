Marines Chase Flying Object With 'Copter
Two Sentries Report Seeing Mystery Craft In Sky Near Quantico
Camp Lejeune, Va., Dec. 5. - Two marines here reported seeing a mysterious flying object in the sky near Quantico, Va., on New Year's Eve but armed forces officials could get no other information on the incident.
The marines, who are sentries on duty at Camp Lejeune, said they saw the strange object being chased by a helicopter.
They said the flying object was observed passing over a nearby marine base and then descending toward land. The officer of the day said it had disappeared when the helicopter returned to the marine base.
The report said it that two platoons of officers and men were sent out to search for the object but this was denied by an official spokesman.
Statements were taken from the marines and the copter pilot but were in the hands of intelligence.
Stationed off the base on pass last night, the two sentries were unable to supply their report on the actions of the object, or their reports on its actions.
No further information was reported before high officers of the Marine Corps could make any statements on the incident.
