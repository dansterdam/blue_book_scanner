Dear Mr. Secretary:

I am a cafe cook here in Jameston, N.D. and I witnessed just a few words for you about than an unusual flying object I saw on the night of August 27, 1952.

It was 10:00 P.M. (approximately) when I went outside for a breath of fresh air. I saw a light out of the ordinary - it was a bluish-white glow, almost immediately I was aware that it was moving rapidly and silently. It seemed to be about 200 feet up and moving in a westerly direction. It was almost immediately out of sight, so fast was its movement. 

I was so startled that I called my wife to see it, but she missed it. I would appreciate it very much if you would have someone investigate this for me, as I am almost certain that what I saw was an unusual flying object.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
