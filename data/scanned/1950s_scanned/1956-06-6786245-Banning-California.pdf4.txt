"Trareler report from Banning, California:
On June 6, 1956 at approximately 11:30 p.m. I was driving north on Highway 60 about 5 miles south of Banning, California when I saw a bright light in the southern sky. At first I thought it might be a meteor, but as I watched it, it seemed to be hovering and changing color from a bright blue-white to a deep red color. The light then started to move in a northerly direction, went behind some trees, and then reappeared further north traveling at a high rate of speed. I watched the light for approximately 5 minutes before it disappeared over the mountains to the north. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and much larger than a normal aircraft light. I am a pilot and have observed many types of aircraft in flight, but this was unlike anything I have ever seen before."
