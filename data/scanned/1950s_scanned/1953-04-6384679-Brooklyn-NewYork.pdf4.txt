USAPTIS
5. This officer were not on of the following familiar effect:
(a) airplanes - running lights or exhaust
(b) Search lights - there were no signs of the existence of such apparats on beam of light to the object
(c) Reflection or reflection of any illuminated hand
lights - again the to clean and effect seemed
too low.
(d) Meteor - as material after did not resemble
any previously observed and describedata.
(e) after burners of a jet - no flames came - neither
was it any flashing or glow, back ground were clear
seem it always moved as a dark silhouette of a low figure
plane.
5. The apparent change in course could be an error
because the first sighting of a viewpoint
of flight dire were very short maybe Ve sec.
It may could be due to effect coming in perpendicular
to any line of travel flight and making a wide angle
bank - resulting in a pattern of a side shaped effect
which so far presented along its course. Detailed and
more and more careful examination and investigation
which involved friendly and cooperative consultation
may very possibly lead to an explanation.
