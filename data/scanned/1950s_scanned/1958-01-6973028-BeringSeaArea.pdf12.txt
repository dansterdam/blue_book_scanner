COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
After investigation of military and civilian agencies knowledgeable of aerial operations in the area of the sighting, no further informa- tion could be obtained which would tend to identify the unidentified objects. Correlation cannot be made as to the alleged or the observed object with those facts contained in the report. The indicating factors showing aircraft flights in the area of sighting have been reviewed and the estimates of the participating observers would indicate the possibility of the sighting of the ballooning lights which were seen, however, this office has found no physical evidence to substantiate or verify the accuracy of the report.
