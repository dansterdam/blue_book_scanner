PASSENGER AND HOSTESSES VERIFY SIGHTING
Name of Captain Killian's passengers: N. : Detroit, Michigan, and General Manufacturing Manager of Curtis Wright Aircraft Company's New York Division, who said this to be true to the best of his knowledge, and one or more panicked or showed signs of worry. Everyone immediately began to show a keen interest in what was going on. He did a fine job. There wasn't a sound in the sky when I looked out and saw the objects in question. I have been making that same trip a number of times because the home office is in New York, but I have never experienced an incident like this before. When the object came closer, I could see a little tail like an exhaust. The plane's hostesses, Mrs, LeGate, 22, of Weston, Arizona, and Miss Beverly Pine, age 26, Oakland, California, said respectively, "I don't know what they were," and "I'm not a science-fiction fan, but I know what I saw."
