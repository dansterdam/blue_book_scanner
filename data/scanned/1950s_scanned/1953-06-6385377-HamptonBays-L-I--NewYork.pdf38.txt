"TORONTO, Sept. 18â€”Top defense scientists from the United States and Canada collaborated today with Canadian officials on super-secret Project Magnet blueprints for a 'disk-shaped fighter plane' that can go 'as far as 1,500 miles an hour.'

Lt. Gen. Donald L. Putt, head of the Research and Development Command of the United States Air Force, led a United States team of twenty-five in discussions with Dr. O. M. Solandt, chairman of Canada's Defense Research Board, Clarence U. Meritt, and Gen. A. G. L. McNaughton, head of the Canadian section of the United States-Canada Joint Defense Board.

Officially the touring group was here to inspect the newly constructed Nickel Jetfighter at A. V. Roe, Ltd., and naval radar installations at Dartmouth, N.S. But it is known that the 'saucer-shaped fighter planes' used their imagination and demanded most of their attention.

V. Roe recently developed paper developments of their evolutionary jet-powered disk-shaped engine, whose pilot sits in the center of a plastic bubble with controls surrounding him. The plane is said to have starting maneuverable ability, allowing it to take-off and land vertically.

The United States Government has spent no money directly on the project to date, but has provided two research teams that have worked in secret surroundings at Malton. The United States group, which includes Maj. Gen. John McCormick, Dr. C. J. Hill, chief of Developments and Operations with Marthell, technical director of the Cambridge Research Center, moved to Ottawa tomorrow to discuss their findings in Canada's progress in developing maneuverable controlled guided missiles."
