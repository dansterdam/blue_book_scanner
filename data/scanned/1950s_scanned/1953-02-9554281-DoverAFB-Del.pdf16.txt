UNCLASSIFIED

In accordance with AFR 200-2, 29 April 1952, the following report is submitted:

29 February 1953 - This unit was alerted by the CD at Dover AFB at approximately 0200Z, 29 February 1953. A reported "flying object" was sighted over New Castle, Delaware. The CD control advised they had visual contact with the target for several minutes. The object was described as being approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, metallic in appearance, and estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The object apparently hovered and maneuvered for some time in the area of the New Castle Airport. The pilot of an F-94 aircraft, which was scrambled to investigate, reported that he sighted the object but was unable to close to within firing range due to the tremendous speed of the object. After approximately 30 minutes the object disappeared from view.

The weather during sighting was clear, unlimited visibility with a very bright haze layer at 20,000 feet.

The pilot's description indicates the object may have been a space vehicle for a very long time, but no definite conclusions can be drawn. The object was not identified and its purpose and origin remain unknown.
