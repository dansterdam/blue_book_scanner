STATEMENT

While returning from Fairfax, Oklahoma, traveling on Highway 60, at about 20 minutes past 6:30, approximately one half mile west of the state line, I observed some orange colored objects on the horizon directly ahead. Within a few seconds the objects were greatly reduced in number, the shape of a disc, and traveling at a terrific rate of speed. I turned to my friend and asked him to look at the objects, but by this time they were too far away to see them out of the rear window, but with no success. We were driving approximately 30 MPH, and although I slowed down, I did not stop. A day later we were discussing the objects, and we commenced on the fact that we had heard no noise, and moticed no motion.
