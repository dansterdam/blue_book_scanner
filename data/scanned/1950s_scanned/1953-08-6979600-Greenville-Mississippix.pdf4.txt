STATEMENT

Statement of sighting by A/1C A. E. ARCENEAUX, AACS Squadron Greenville

Over the horizon, it appeared to be a circular shape. It didn't appear very large from our viewpoint. Its color was sort of red, green and slight yellow. There was a very slow oscillating movement, and it did not appear to have any sound. The object did not appear to have any appendages but it seemed to be rotating. It was moving at an extremely high altitude, so its exact size could not be determined because I did not know its distance, but it appeared quite small. The movement was approximately the same (5 to 10) altitudes. It seemed to fade away into the distance toward the west. It appeared (3) or (4) times it would disappear and reappear. But as time went along I could definitely determine a movement.

I alerted the crew from the Control Tower at 2300 hours until 2320 hours. No aircraft were in the area at 2315 hours. At 2300 hours it disappeared.

At first, it was I sighted with the naked eye and in order to get a better view, using 7 X 50 binoculars. I did so. But I could not determine any definite outline or shape. I feel that I may not have seen it as clearly as I wished, due to the distance and conditions of the viewing.

The weather was VFR, and there were no conditions of meteorological disturbances to be noted for the sighting. I have no physical evidence of the sighting.
