AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
HEADQUARTERS 33rd SUB-DISTRICT, OSI, DISTRICT OF OHIO
DATE: 7 OCT 1951
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Paris, Illinois
1. On 7 October 1951, at approximately 6:00 PM, a resident of Paris, Illinois, observed a luminous object in the sky which was described as being approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, round in shape, and hovering at a height of approximately 500-600 feet. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10-15 minutes. Witnesses stated that the object appeared to be surrounded by a bluish haze and that it emitted no noise. After remaining stationary for a brief period, the object is reported to have accelerated rapidly in a southerly direction and disappeared from sight.
2. A military aircraft was apparently in the area at the time of the observation, and it is believed that the resident who reported the incident may have mistaken this aircraft for the unidentified object. However, the resident is reported to be a reliable and rational individual, and it is not believed that the observation was merely a case of mistaken identity.
3. No other reports of unidentified objects in the Paris, Illinois area have been received.
