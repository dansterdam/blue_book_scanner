There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. The image shows a text document with information about a UFO sighting report.

I will now perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document and provide the output:

II. RELIABILITY: Source was helpful and cooperative, however in her own estimate her observation was very poor.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 12 August 1958 at 2010 hours CST, the witness was outside her home watching for the rocket carrier of the satellite being launched at that time. She observed an unknown object in the sky while watching for the rocket carrier. The object appeared to be white to off white in color and did not have the appearance of any aircraft or similar manmade objects. She did state that it was as bright as an auto headlight and was moving rapidly in straight, zig-zag patterns. The object was observed for five or more minutes. The object appeared from the northeast and disappeared to the southwest where it was lost in more light. It was a clear night with a bright moon and many stars were visible. It was also very cool outside. The witness was told by a neighbor who showed her the rocket carrier passing overhead.
