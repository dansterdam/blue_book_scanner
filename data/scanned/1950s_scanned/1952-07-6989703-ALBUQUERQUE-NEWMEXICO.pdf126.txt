STATEMENT OF WITNESSES

I had heard over the radio that objects had been spotted in Cuba, so we were looking up toward the north all the time. About 10:30 it was going from NE to SW. Then I started seeing them about every 15 minutes. They were going quite slow and would stop every little space in between. At first they were going from the southwest to the northeast, but after a little while they started going from the northeast to the southwest. We could see them much longer than we could the stars. You could see them disappear when I saw them last, they didn't look as big as the last ones.

As I saw them, they were bright white. The reason I didn't think they were stars was that they were not twinkling. They seemed to come nearer instead of going far away. They others didn't notice them until I pointed them out.
