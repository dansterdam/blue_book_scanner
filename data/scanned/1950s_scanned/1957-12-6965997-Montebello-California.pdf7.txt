REPORT CF INTERVIEW WITH MR.

I questioned him the following questions:

Q. What was your estimate of the size of the objects which you photographed?
A. About the same height as the light airplanes which I frequently see over the house, between 2000 and 4000 feet.

Q. Were they at any time as high as jet aircraft which you have observed?
A. No, constantly not.

Q. Did you see any smoke trail or any kind of trail from the objects?
A. No there was no visible trail of any sort.
