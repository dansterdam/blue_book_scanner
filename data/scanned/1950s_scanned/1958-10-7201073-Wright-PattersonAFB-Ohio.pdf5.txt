The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document with a number of questions and space for written responses.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.
22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
(Circle One): a. Head of a pin b. Pea c. Silver dollar d. Basketball e. Grapefruit f. Doorknob g. Nickel h. Baseball i. Other
22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): a. Very sure b. Pretty sure c. Uncertain
23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it take? We want to know what appearance the object or objects which you saw would give the same appearances as the object which you saw.
