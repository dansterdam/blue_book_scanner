With God's attitude of space explorers, the U.S. can do things that neither Russia nor any other nation can do. We have a far better history of the U.S.space program than does Russia. We have had far more successful and ambitious programs. Our communications satellites, weather satellites and scientific satellites have given the U.S. a great technological lead which is continuing to increase. We must be patient and allow time for the former president to complete his plans which will be for the good of the country.

Recently you published a letter from L. E. (Bud) Sackett, Dr. Secretary Voice, I do not intend to do any more of that type of thing. I am absolutely against the plan which your program has come up with. I am sure those who did not expect a good reception in the plan for California are right. Another from the State of California summer so-called plan is not wise choice for California, it would be wrong for California.
