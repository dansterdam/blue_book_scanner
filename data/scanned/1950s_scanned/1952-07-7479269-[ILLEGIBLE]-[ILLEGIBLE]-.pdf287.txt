STATEMENT OF: Pvt David M. Hall
1 July 1952

From an MRG antenna tower I saw what at first appeared to be a silver ball hanging in space directly above my head. It seemed to be larger than the object that was circling around it. The object hovered there, apparently motionless for about a minute then moved sharply to the right. (south), appearing to revolve, then darted north, too fast for my eye to follow, then just disappeared as if it elevated out of sight.
