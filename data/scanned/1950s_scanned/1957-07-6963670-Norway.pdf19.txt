Dear Sir:

I am enclosing a letter written by you to Mr. Joe Bray, of my farm, North Bermont, Massachusetts, with reference to her letter which was addressed to Secretary of Defense, McGilroy. 

Mrs. has filled out, you will note, the additional information as requested. Since then, she has received a letter from the editor of the Swedish Magazine, PATTERSON SAUCER REPORTS, asking for a copy of this photograph, and a film. In his letter he states that a friend of his during a vacation in Germany last summer--1950--had a somewhat similar experience. One day he saw a silver chrome disk in the sky.

In your letter you state that as soon as the evaluation is complete you will forward the results to Mrs. and return the photograph and film, you may do so. As I have had duplicates made of the original film.

Mrs. who is an intimate friend of my wife, is now on her way to London, and therefore I should like to have your advise about the evaluation, and I shall take pleasure in forwarding it to her.

Very truly yours,
[Signature]
