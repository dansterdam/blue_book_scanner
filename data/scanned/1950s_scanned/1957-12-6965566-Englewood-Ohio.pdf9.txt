The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document and does not contain any photographs. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

Q. Would you say they were as big in circumference as a circle inclosing the wing tips and tail to nose section of a light airplane? 
A. Yes, about that size.
Q. Were they all the same size?
A. Yes.
Q. What shape?
A. They were circular, and relatively flat.
Q. What color?
A. Sort of white-to-blue-green glowing objects.
Q. What do you think they were?
A. I don't know, but they were certainly not balloons or airplanes like any I had seen before.

(This concluded the main portion of the interview.
