The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report describing two pictures or observations of some object. The text describes the objects as having some unusual or unidentified characteristics, such as the "National Bureau of Standards" being involved in the observations. However, the details about the specific objects are redacted or obscured in the image.

A picture of the object which appears to be very small, in the nature of a national bureau of standards star, was made before sunset and a picture of the object which appeared to be substantially larger, made by the national bureau of standards star, was made after sunset.
