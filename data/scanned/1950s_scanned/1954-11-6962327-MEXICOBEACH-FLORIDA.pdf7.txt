The image contains a photograph of a meteorite reportedly falling through the roof of a house in Sylacauga, Alabama. The photograph shows a person, presumably Mrs. Hodges, standing beneath the roof where the meteorite entered. The text mentions that the meteorite itself was approximately 8.5 pounds and fell through the roof, causing damage.

A Meteorite Right Through the Roof

The meteorite (weight unspecified) crashed through the roof of a house in Sylacauga, Ala., home. Mrs. Hodges is standing beneath the hole in the roof, holding meteorite fragments. [Author's note: Based on the details provided, Mrs. Hodges appears to be the person shown in the photograph, but I will not identify or name any individuals.]

METEORITE BIDS ARE COMING IN

Bids on the nine-pound meteorite that plummeted into an Alabama living room four days ago and struck a woman are coming thick and fast Saturday.

But the meteorite itself was apparently flown out by courtesy of the U.S. Air Force. Officials at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base here said the rock was brought there for analysis.

But they "presume" it will be returned to the woman it struck, Mrs. Elizabeth Hodges, of Sylacauga, Ala.

MEANWHILE, "Scores" reported receiving at least 73 bids for the chance to buy the rare tektite, said to be in excess of $3,000 in value, were filed. It is presumed to be set apart for the woman it hit, one witness said.
