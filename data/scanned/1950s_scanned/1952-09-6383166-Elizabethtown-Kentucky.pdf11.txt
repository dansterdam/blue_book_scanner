The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

The text on the page reads:

The object contacted C's car and carried it across the ground for a considerable distance, during which time C claims to have been rendered unconscious. Upon regaining consciousness, C found that the object had apparently deposited his car without damage, and that he was unharmed. However, C says that upon examining his car, he found that various parts of it had apparently been subjected to intense heat, which would indicate that the object emitted some form of energy or radiation capable of affecting metallic substances. This, it seems to me, would be a most interesting and important aspect of the case, and C's claims in this regard should be carefully checked and verified if possible."
