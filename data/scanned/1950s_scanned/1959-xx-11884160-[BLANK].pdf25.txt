"Group should, in their relatively short attention to this subject, find or discover any scientific foundation: it is the panel's firm belief, based on examined evidence, that the so-called unknown sightings are the result of insufficient and inadequate reports, lacking in precise details and physical phenomena, often perhaps of a meteorological or astronomical character.
The panel further recognises that in the next decade sky surveyors, electronic and optical will of necessity encounter many field detection devices, such as the Baker Nunn Cameras and new types of telescopes. Parabolic antennas are already in the process of development. It follows, therefore, that in the next few years surveillance groups will have to contend with many of the phenomena which have heretofor been reported to ATIC. The development of this equipment will of necessity be stimulated by its ability to discern between natural occurrences and phenomena related to real objects in the sky. While these surveillance devices will be used for possible scientific progress, it must be realistically recognised that they also, possibly with refinement, the equipment upon which we will depend for the first steps in defense detection and to do no more can call for much imagination, in view of recent history. The reliability and speed of these detecting devices will depend upon the reliability of the system, and allowance for effective reaction in event of an attack will depend upon the reliability and speed of these detecting devices. It is equally dangerous to think of taking aggressive action due to misidentification of some object seen in the sky, or to take action if our detection devices dismiss an enemy missile as a meteor. In order to realize such limitations, the scientific and technical characteristics must be exactly determined. Other important patterns such as frequency of occurrence must also be determined, as this is an indication of how often our detecting devices would be called upon to estimate such phenomena. It is difficult to imagine which devices would we used to detect. The differentiating factors would be small; therefore, the number of characteristics which are as greater variations should be considered to help increase reliability of such a detector. This, of course, indicates and emphasizes the difficulties both the characteristics and scientific position of these phenomena, in the ATIC files, but it requires further processing for its scientific value.

II. Recommendations:
A. The panel hereby recommends a review of past material in light of accrued experience, and a thorough scientific analysis be made of those cases which are determined to be the more outstanding and having a high scientific potential.
B. It is recommended that in future, after consideration has been given to the threat possibilities, that those cases which give indication"
