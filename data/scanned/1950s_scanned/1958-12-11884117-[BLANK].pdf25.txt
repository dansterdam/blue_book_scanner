Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Professor of Astrophysics and Astronomy at the Air Force on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects.

His lectures and those of other qualified civilian scientists are utilized if deemed necessary by the Air Force to further investigations of the general subject. As an example, a panel of scientists was called upon the Air Force in 1953 to make an over-all examination of investigative procedures and findings on specific projects.

The panel said at that time "the evidence presented on UFOs showed no indications which these phenomena constitute a direct threat to national security." Further, there was no residuum of cases which indicated phenomena are attributable to hostile foreign agents. The panel concluded that national security agencies should take immediate steps to strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired.

In line with this recommendation, the Air Force periodically scrutinizes through the scrutinization process and classification of findings pertaining to cases which have received national attention. Only in a few instances were slight indications of some elements in our air defense system, and no reports containing any evidence to the contrary that UFOs were real. Moreover, there are no Air Force documents which indicate the existence of any artifacts which can be logically associated with such items as would be threatened by machines from other planets.

However, because of limited personnel resources and to preclude possible embarrassment to individuals who have assisted Air Force in investigations, the Air Force does not desire to correct erroneous or detailed analyses of special cases.
