The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO analysis report, titled "UFO ANALYSIS SHEET". The report provides details about a UFO sighting, including the location, date, time, and description of the observed object. The report also includes sections for recording details about the motion, astronomical phenomena, radar analysis, natural phenomena, and aircraft/balloons/airships. The final section contains the "Analysis and Conclusions" which describes the observer's account and notes that it is "more to describe rather than analyze."

Evaluation of Source Reliability CREDIBLE

The speed and maneuvering indicated it was not a conventional aircraft. It is unidentifiable and of considerable interest.
