JOINT MESSAGEFORM
PARAGRAPH NOT REQUIRED EXCEPT
AS INDICATED BELOW
FROM: (Originator) SPACE ABOVE FOR COMMUNICATIONS CENTER ONLY
CMDR ATIC
TO: D/I HQ USAF WASHINGTON 25 D C
INFO: AFOIW-4
Reference your messages 53032 dtd 071826Z Dec and 52776 dtd 011902Z Dec. Although the time element and description of the glow could coincide with a nuclear explosion, it is unlikely that this cause initiated the report for the following reasons:
a. Negative historical report from Far East sources maintaining 
	dissonance viii1.
b. No previous explosions reported from that particular location of
the glow.
Reference our message IC 41208 dtd 021132Z Dec. Evaluation contained therein 
remains the same. However, one discrepancy remains to be clarified. In your 
message 53032, the following statement appears: "REAP comment, at the time of
incident, the moon was at 191 degrees from the position of the aircraft." Should
this azimuth location read 291 degrees? A position of 191 degrees would locate 
the moon in a SSE direction at time of setting. A position of 291 degrees would
establish the correct approximate 1055 14-18 july 1955 1507.
