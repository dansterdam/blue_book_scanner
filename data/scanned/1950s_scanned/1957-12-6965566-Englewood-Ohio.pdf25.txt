The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document with handwritten text.

INSTRUCTIONS FROM OFFICE OF THE SECY OF THE AIR FORCE INFORMATION SERVICES TO HAVE ALT UNEXPLAINED FILM (FILM) PICKED UP AND RETURN IT TO THAT OFFICE. THE FILM RETURNED TO MAJOR WAGNER, SAFIS, HEADQUARTERS. WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE RETAINED FILM FOR SUFFICIENT TIME TO REPRODUCE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY TO HAVE A COPY OF ALL PHOTOS AND FILM ON UFOS TO INSURE AGAINST FUTURE CLAIMS, ALLEGATIONS OR OTHER ISSUES.

MY ANALYSIS CONFIRMED BY INDEPENDENT REVIEW BY PHOTO ANALYSTS, IN THAT CHANGES OR OBJECTS ARE REGISTERED. THEY KEEP THE SAME DISTANCE AND POSITION TO EACH OTHER ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE GROUP APPEARS TO MOVE TOWARDS AND FORTH. AND HAVE ALL THE APPEARANCES OF BEING BALLOONS OF SOME TYPE OF RIGID FRAMEWORK.

MORE FIRM CONCLUSIONS COULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IF A REPORT ON THE BACKGROUND, FACTUAL DATA AND INFORMATION, AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SUBMITTED TOGETHER WITH THE FILM PER AFR 200-2.

WILL CONTACT MR WAGNER, SAFIS, AT HQ USAF AND NOTIFY YOU OF RESULTS.

END
