This report describes progress on this project for the period from
August 11, 1952, to September 10, 1952.

Interrogation Forms
About 800 copies of the revised Tentative Observers Questionnaire,
Exhibit A of the Fourth Status Report, dated August 11, 1952, were prepared
and sent to ATIC. A great many of these were sent out by ATIC to observers
to be filled out and returned. This was considered a "trial test" of the
questionnaire.

More than 100 of the completed questionnaires have been returned to
us. These are now being studied by Dr. Paul M. Fitts and his associates in
the Aviation Psychology Department at Ohio State University. The final
revisions of the questionnaire will be made as results of this study show that
revisions are needed. The Final Observers Questionnaire is expected to be
completed and sent to ATIC during September.
