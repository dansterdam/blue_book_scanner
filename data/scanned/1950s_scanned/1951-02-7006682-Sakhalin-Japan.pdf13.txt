On 21 February 1951, and those on 23 February 1951 were all observed during the hours of darkness. This activity consisted of luminous objects flying erratically and reported to be moving at very high speed, estimates of speed being made in range of 600-700 mph. It might be that these sightings were attempts by the military to verify the degree of night flying proficiency already achieved.
