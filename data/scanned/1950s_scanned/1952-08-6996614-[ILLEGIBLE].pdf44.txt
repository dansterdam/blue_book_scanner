INTELLIGENCE (SIGHTING) REPORT
(Tentative - Further Details Awaited)
17 JULY 1952

1. On 6 July 1952 at 1645 hours, two (2) objects were observed by Capt. H.W. , F-86 pilot assigned to the 1500th Air Base Wing, and Second Lt. W. L. L. , radar observer, during a radar-visual intercept mission.

2. Upon interrogation by the Intelligence Officer of the 1500th Air Base Wing, the following details were obtained:

a. The objects were sighted by the pilots at an altitude of about 15,000 feet and appeared to be traveling at speeds in excess of 600 knots (about 700 mph). The objects were maneuvering in a spinning, rotating fashion, and at times appeared to stop in mid-air, then dart off at extremely high speeds.  

b. The sighting lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes. The objects were observed to merge at one point, then separate again. Pilots stated that the objects were about the size of a conventional fighter aircraft.

c. It was estimated that the objects were at a distance of about 8 to 10 miles from the intercepting F-86.

d. The pilots reported that the objects were dazzling white in color and showed no exhaust or trail of any kind. The pilots also stated that they could not estimate the actual size of the objects, since their distance from the aircraft was uncertain.

e. It is believed that the objects were about the size of a conventional aircraft.

COMMENT BY PREPARING OFFICER:

This case is being forwarded to higher authority for further analysis and evaluation. The pilots involved are highly reliable and this sighting is considered to be of great significance. No other reports were received from other sources in the area at the time of the sighting.
