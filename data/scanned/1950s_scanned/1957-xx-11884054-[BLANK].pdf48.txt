SUBJECT: Aids to Identification of Flying Objects
TO: AFOIN-21A
FROM: AFOIN-4

1. Attached publication, prepared for the most part from Project Blue Book, is a commendable effort toward analysis and reporting of the philosophy, guidance and techniques in the UFO-ATIC containment and elimination of the problem. It represents some conclusions arrived at after considerable analysis and assistance to UFO field investigation and analyses.

2. Up to this time, the only aids to UFO investigation and field analyses have been given to AISS and GCI units (see Enclosures 3 and 4, "UFO Guide" now being reviewed, and USAF).

3. A complete review and revision of subject publication would require a respect for preceding comment. However, a review has disclosed the omission of certain key points and a significant lack of guidance to ATIC identification, and other explanatory items. A number of items were revised; others were clarified.

4. It would have been more desirable if a draft of the publication had been submitted to the Center for review and corrections, assuming the guide in question is a final publication item. This would have suggested that the recommendations submitted herewith be incorporated into the proposed final publication.

5. The UFO guide and GCC poster (Enclosures 3 and 4) are also to be submitted to USAFE and should include the original UFO guide prepared for Air Force units "How to make UFYSAPTs", attached (Enclosure C) both for possible use in the USAF guide and to demonstrate that the AAF Forces in UFO material, and publication as the latter from USAF appears to indicate.
