The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and an object above the horizon, with instructions to imagine the observer is at the point shown and place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when first seen. The second and third sketches show two larger sketches, with instructions to place an "A" at the position where the object was when first seen, and a "B" at a different position.

Text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
