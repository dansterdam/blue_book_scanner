CRASH SITE REPORTS SHOWED CRAFT PASSED FIRE BARRAGE en route to land
The second sighting was made at rl 5-10 miles west of Levellanel. This object was sighted about 11:00 p.m., and the witnesses estimated its height to be 50 feet over the highway.
The object was described as a large brilliant light moving in an east to west direction, at an estimated speed of 600 to 700 miles per hour. It was described as being "elongated in shape" and larger than an automobile. It soon passed out of sight to the west.
The third sighting was made the same evening by the same witnesses about 10 miles west of Levelland. This object was sighted about 12:30 a.m., Monday. It was again described as an elongated object giving off a brilliant light, and moving in a westerly direction at a high rate of speed. 
'THING' DISAPPEARS IN NORTHWEST
In Chicago's suburban Elmwood Park, three citizens reported seeing a mysterious object in the sky about 9:30 p.m. Monday. They said the object appeared to be round and luminous, and soon disappeared in the Northwest.
At Martinsville, Va., Mrs. Ralph A. Allison said she and her family saw a strange object in the sky about 10:30 p.m. Sunday. She said it was brightly lighted and moved very rapidly before it disappeared in the Northwest. 
"She said the object had a peculiar glow and moved at a tremendous rate of speed," according to Sheriff A. Y. Bowers of Patrick County, Va.
And in Lincolnton, N.C., a border town between North and South Carolina, a resident reported seeing a strange object in the sky about 10:30 p.m. Sunday. He said it appeared to move slowly, but later picked up tremendous speed and vanished.
Lee said he considered the story of Mrs. Allison and the Lincolnton resident as related to the Levelland incident. "Weight told Lee that he was convinced that what he saw was from Outer Space," the report states.
