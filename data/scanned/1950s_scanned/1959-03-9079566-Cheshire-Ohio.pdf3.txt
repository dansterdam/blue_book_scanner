1. Returned herewith is tape recording of your request that the Air Force investigate the sighting of a UFO over your area. We have found that the information contained on the tape was insufficient for us to come to any specific conclusion as to the cause of the sighting. Air Force regulations require that we compromise you and the others who have been inconvenienced by this investigation. In doing so, we ask your understanding that you and the others who have been fully cooperative in this matter be assured that we have done everything possible to arrive at a valid conclusion, and that you have that would assist the Air Force in its investigation of the UFO phenomena.

2. Due to the retirement of Colonel Gilbert, the tape was late in reaching us. The tape was retained here for study and analysis and is being returned along with a copy of this closing summary.

Sincerely,

/s/ D.L. Brennan
