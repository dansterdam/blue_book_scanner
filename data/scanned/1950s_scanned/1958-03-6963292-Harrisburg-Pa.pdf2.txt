The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

The text appears to be an internal Air Force communication related to a UFO sighting report, but does not provide any details about a photograph.
