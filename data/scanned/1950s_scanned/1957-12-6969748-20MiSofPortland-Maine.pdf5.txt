11.5 COMMENTS: CAPTAIN THOMAS E. BOWER, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER,
PREPARING OFFICER EMPHASIZES EXTREME RELIABILITY OF
WITNESSES, AND HIS BELIEF THAT OBJECT APPEARS AS
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. INVESTIGATION HAS FURTHER
ASCERTAINED THAT OBJECT WAS OBSERVED NOT AS THE DIRECT
RESULT OF UNUSUAL METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA, THE EXPERIENCE
OF OBSERVERS SUGGESTS PROBABLE CAPABILITY TO MANEUVER ACCORDING TO THE REPORT.
(CAPABILITY OF OBSERVERS MISTAKING METEOR OR SHOOTING STARS FOR OBJECT WAS INVESTIGATED, AND IN ALL CASES REFUTED BY OBSERVERS. NO TRAIL, TRAIL OR EXHAUST WERE OBSERVED. OBSERVERS DECLARE IN ALL THAT OBJECT, ATTITUDE OF OBJECT, PAINS ITS UNITED
TRAJECTORY DEFINITELY REMOTE. ALTHOUGH ALMOST TOO CONVENIENT, OBSERVERS
AND DEBRIEFING OFFICER AGREE THAT OBJECT WAS A SATELLITE IN ORBIT.
