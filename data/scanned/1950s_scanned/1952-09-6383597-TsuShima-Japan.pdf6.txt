AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
ISSUING AGENCIES: Intelligence Office, 529th Air Defense Group, APO 929
DATE: 6 SEP 1952
SUBJECT: Unusual Radar Condition, Tsushima, Japan

At approximately 2050I on the 28 Sep 52, A/3c Hall called me into the scope room to see an unusual radar condition. At 2052I the target was picked up on the radar scope and was tracked to 2054I, when it passed off the scope. The target appeared to be at 30,000 feet and was observed for a period of approximately 2 minutes. It was plotted on the scope and showed this same condition. The target was observed to travel at a speed of approximately 1,500 MPH, which is too fast for any aircraft known to be operating in that area and did not show this condition.
