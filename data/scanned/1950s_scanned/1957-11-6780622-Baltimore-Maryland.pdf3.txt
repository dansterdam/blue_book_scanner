Dear sirs,

I received the enclosed letter in reply to my previous letter in which I requested information concerning the condition you have some to in regard to the UFO report I had sent you on December 15, 1957. Unfortunately due to some misunderstanding, December 15 was not the date of the incident which I saw over Baltimore appeared on the night of November 6, 1957 at 9:43-9:47 P.M.

Would you please search your records for the night of November 6th, 1957 and let me know into which of the six general categories my report has been placed. I would very much appreciate any details accounting for the object's most unusual appearance and whether or not your files indicate any other sightings in the Baltimore area on the night of November 6, 1957.

I am anxious to know what the unusual serial object I saw on Nov. 6 was, because in the hundreds of hours I have spent in observing the night sky as an amateur astronomer I have never seen the likes of it. In closing, I wish to thank you for your trouble and consideration.

Sincerely yours,
