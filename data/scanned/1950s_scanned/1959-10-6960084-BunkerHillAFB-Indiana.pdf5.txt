UNCLAS FROM: 003 DCOI 12-249. FINAL SECTION OF TWO.
WHILE ALL OBSERVERS WERE IN CLOSE AGREEMENT ON THIS SIGHTING, 
ONE OF THEM ALSO SIGHTED AN IRREGULAR FORMATION OF 9 PIN POINTS OF
LIGHT INTERESTING TO SOUTH 135 DEGREES. THESE LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES
AS THEY TRAVELED AT HIGH SPEED ACROSS THE HORIZON AND DISAPPEARED
FROM VIEW. THESE WERE KNOWN TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE VICINITY OF THE BASE
AT THIS TIME. NO OTHER OBSERVER MADE A SIGHTING OF THIS TYPE. THE
OBSERVER WHO GAVE THIS ACCOUNT IS VERY RELIABLE ONE BUT DUE TO
THE LACK ON CORROBORATING EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THIS SIGHTING WE ARE
DISCOUNTING ITS VALIDITY.
