the Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Knoxville, Great Falls, Minneapolis, Traverse City, and Bangor Zones, at
altitudes of less than 4000 feet above the immediate terrain. Any person who knowingly or willfully fails to do so is subject to
penalties of one year in prison or $10,000 fine. The Air Defense Identification Zones are identified as follows: Seattle ADIZ,
San Francisco ADIZ, Los Angeles ADIZ, Atlantic ADIZ, Pacific ADIZ, Albuquerque ADIZ, Knoxville ADIZ, Great Falls
