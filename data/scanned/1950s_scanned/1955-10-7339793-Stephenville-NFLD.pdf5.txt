Offers Theory In Case Of Air Crash
DENVER, Nov. 22â€” A Denver attorney said today that if a flying saucer ever crashes near here, the government should immediately take possession of it in the name of the people.
James A. Williamson V., A.F. (Ret.) said in an interview that the finder of the crashed saucer would be entitled to a reward, but the government should take over the craft.
He said the government should set up a commission to study the saucer's construction and how it operates.
Williamson said if the saucer is found to be of extraterrestrial origin, it should be turned over to a United Nations scientific commission for further study.
He said that in the second day of sightings of a bright object over Stephenville, Nfld., the object was not the planet Venus, as reported, but an actual flying saucer.
