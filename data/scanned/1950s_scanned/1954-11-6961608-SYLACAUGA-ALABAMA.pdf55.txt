1. Reference report 17 Dec. 54. Preliminary report to ADC of unidentified flying object. From Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia, sighting report of two daylight sightings of unidentified flying objects. The sightings were at Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia on 8 December 1954. 

2. The object was observed at 1300 hours on 8 December 1954, red elliptical in shape, approximately 1200 feet altitude, speed estimate in excess of 600 M.P.H. The object was tracked on radar approximately 1200 hours 8 December 1954, where it had entered the pattern at approximately 1200 hours, 8 December 1954.

3. The following is the preliminary evaluation in possible explanations:
a. Meteors and meteorites - one class is almost certainty another is largely stony, and appears to be very dense, like rock, somewhat like aerolite, weighing 3 pounds, 8 ounces.
b. Explosions of very large meteors at high altitudes, well above the earth; not resulting in craters or anything striking the ground, because they do not come to the earth. Some other fragments remain unrecovered, and much of their mass may be scattered.
c. The average limits of all phenomena observed.  They seldom appear at greater altitudes than 100 miles, where there is insufficient air for combustion and they burn up before reaching the earth.
