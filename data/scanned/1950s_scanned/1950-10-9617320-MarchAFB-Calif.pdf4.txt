AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
COUNTRY: United States
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
DATE INFORMATION OBTAINED: 10 October 1950
PLACE INFORMATION OBTAINED: March Air Force Base, California
REPORT NO.: 10-6490-1
DATE OF REPORT: 14 October 1950
REPORTING OFFICER: Captain Howard C. Holmes

SUMMARY: By investigation and interview of witnesses, the following information was obtained:

On 10 October 1950, at about 1615 hours, a pilot, co-pilot, and navigator, on a routine flight from March Air Force Base, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky. The object was described as a bright-reddish glow, unsteady in intensity, and moved at high speed. Several witnesses related the possibility of the object being a star, planet, or balloon. However, the observers stated that the object did not behave in the manner of any of these, and they are convinced that it was not a conventional aircraft or a known object. The evidence presented is not conclusive, and there is insufficient data to determine the nature of the object.
