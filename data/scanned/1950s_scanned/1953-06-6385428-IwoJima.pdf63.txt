ARDC Reveals Photo Device Saucer Tip?
A "real" answer to some flying saucer reports was included in the announcement here Wednesday of a new device for taking night pictures of aerial objects.
The Air Force's Aircraft Radiation Development Center at Wright-Patterson air base, near Dayton, is designing the all-electronic camera to be installed in the Air Force's interceptor planes, it was disclosed. 
The center is hoping to develop the highly sensitive night camera into a practical instrument for photographing unidentified light objects which have been sighted by pilots and observers during night hours.
The camera, designed to use infrared light for night photography, is being developed to prove or disprove "flying saucer" reports, according to Lt. Col. Richard F. Haines, chief of the ARDC Reconnaissance Branch.
"First test flights" have been made with the new equipment, he declared, but there have been no flying saucer pictures made to date. Haines said the new camera may shed light on the still-debated question of whether "flying saucers" actually exist.
