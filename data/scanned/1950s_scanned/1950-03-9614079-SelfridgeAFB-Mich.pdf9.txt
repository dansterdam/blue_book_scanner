SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT

SUBJECT: Unconventional Type Aircraft 
(Unexplained "Blips" on Radar)
Sighted Ground by Tactical Targets)

TO:     Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force

ATTN: Counter Intelligence Division

1. SYNOPSIS: 1st Lt. FRANK K. HATHCOCK, 10-19213, radar operator and Capt. C.W. DALY, 0-678576, pilot, both of the 6th Fighter Wing, did on 9 March 1950 observe in radar scope "blips" or "objects" that could not be identified. The "blip" was of an unconventional type aircraft, exceeded the performance of any known aircraft, and appeared to be controlled by HARRISON and PARKER.

2. DETAILS: At 1925 hours on 9 March 1950, the Ground Control Intercept Section of the 6th Fighter Wing at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan, received a report from Lt. HATHCOCK that he had observed a "blip" on the GCI radar scope which did not fit the characteristics of any known type of aircraft. Capt. DALY, the pilot, also observed the same "blips" on his airborne radar scope.

Capt. DALY was immediately scrambled to investigate this unknown target. However, when he reached the area, the "blips" had disappeared. Capt. DALY reported that the "blips" were different from any aircraft he was familiar with. The estimated speed was approximately 500 knots, and the estimated altitude was 25,000 feet. The "blips" were observed for approximately 15 minutes. No sound or exhaust was observed, and the "blips" made abrupt changes in direction.

The incident is considered to be of extreme importance, and further investigation is considered necessary. HARRISON and PARKER, the Counter Intelligence Officers, have been informed.
