Meteor Blazes
Across Sky In
7-Second Show

A large meteoric fireball estimated at about the size of a full moon as seen at dawn, blazed across the sky in Greenwich last night—taking a full seven seconds to burn out and disappear. The fireball swirled out of the southwest and burned out and disappeared in the southeastern sky. It was a pale green in color and left a long trail of sparks behind it.

It was sighted at the Ground Observer Corps observation tower at Greenwich Point at 10:55 p.m. by Timothy J. O’Keefe of Cos Cob, who was on duty at the time. William Urban and Lee Spann later reported they saw the fireball in central Greenwich.

Officials of the Ground Observer Corps said they received reports from other residents of the town who saw the luminous meteor and who thought it might have been a blazing plane about to crash.
