The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

As an OCR system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

He did not see the object again that night. His description of the object was as follows: dull metallic grey color, circular in shape, about 30 feet in diameter and 5 feet thick. It gave off no glow, but seemed to reflect light somewhat. It made no sound and moved at a good rate of speed quite rapidly.
