The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter addressed to the "Director of Intelligence, United States Air Force, Washington, D.C."

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sir:

Enclosed is a clipping from the local newspaper.

On February 13, 1955 at 7:45 P.M. a bright light was seen by Mr. and Mrs. Jack Riley of Kings Landing, California. The light was not an exceptional one as the Air Force might well have had one in area at the time.

I had to go thru the Congressman John White and get an acknowledgment from the air force before I could even make an inquiry about this matter as it is in restricted area.

I have a letter from the Congressman John White stating that the Air Force has no comment to make on this incident. Would you please ever have someone talk with Mr. and Mrs. Jack Riley as their story may be worth while and I am sure they would be glad to give you any information you may desire. As a result of the way you handled this case I am sure it will cause the good people of Kings Landing to feel less enthusiastic about reporting any unusual occurrences in the area in the future.

Yours truly,

P.S. Many apologies for bothering with your good correspondence, but I thought you might be interested in this as it seems to be a rather interesting case.
