STATEMENT

At approximately 0110, Saturday, March 2, 1957, I was riding in Captain Ingor's private airplane 350 miles northeast of Jacksonville, Florida, headed toward North South Carolina. The object entered my line of sight. The object, as an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 7,000 feet, appeared to be brown in color, and was estimated to be approximately 20 feet in diameter. It had a speed similar to a meteorite. The color was a dull green. It had a distinct glow, and appeared to be emitting sparks, but it did not appear to decrease in size as it came toward me. After passing within 30 feet of the wing, it appeared to be sparks emitting from the tail and immediately after a hood appeared, the object disappeared downward into the clouds. It did not appear to explode, however there were sparks in all directions. The return [sic] of the object as it disappeared was that of a meteor and it appeared to be traveling from a South West to North East direction. I had the feeling that the object was under intelligent control. The weather was clear, the object appeared about six feet in diameter and I heard no sound.
