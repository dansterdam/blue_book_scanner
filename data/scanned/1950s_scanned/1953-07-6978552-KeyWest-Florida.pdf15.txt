AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: FLYOBJECT
PLACE: KEY WEST FLORIDA - KEY WEST 
DATE: 5 AUGUST 1953
PREPARED BY: DONALD J. TIMBLY

SUMMARY: (Omit the detail necessary to report. Give impressions in usual well-organized paragraph. Limit narrative to 1 sheet, single side of report (on AF Form 112—Part I).

On 24 July and 1 August 1953 two apprentice training students assigned to the Naval Station at Key West, Florida, observed and reported a flyobject maneuvering in the sky at about 2220 and 2330 EST and the second was at 2135 EST. The object appeared to be about the size of a small aircraft and maneuvered with a high rate of speed and a rapid change of direction. No trail or exhaust was observed. The object emitted a bright light and appeared to be controlled and even under intelligent guidance. No sound was heard and the observer does not believe the object to have been a meteor or aircraft in flight.

Technical characteristics were not noted. The object was never closer than about one mile and therefore, detailed characteristics could not be observed to modify a regular report. The observer does not appear to be excited or over-imaginative and seems sincere and truthful in his statements.

This experience had common features upon the report other than to note that the observer appears unusually well-balanced and reliable in his evaluation of his own sighting and checked it against whatever object with which he was not familiar. The object with which he was not acquainted was not familiar to him and therefore, he made a factual report as he observed it.
