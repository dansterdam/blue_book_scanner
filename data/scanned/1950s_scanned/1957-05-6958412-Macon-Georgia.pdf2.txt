MACON GEORGIA 
INCIDENT
7 - 8 May 1957

During the nights of the 7th and 8th of May 1957, an individual and his 
family observed from a location near Macon, Georgia, a number of 
unidentified serial objects that appeared to move in a strange and 
unorderly fashion. Mystified at what they saw, the family secured 
a motion picture film which was reported to take pictures 
of the strange white objects. The film and prints were submitted to the
Air Force for examination.

A large number of enlargements were made from the black and white
prints. These showed emulsion flaws, that appeared to be pinholes, 
out-of-focus spots of leaves and other objects, and small white, oddly-
shaped objects near the horizon that were definitely airborne.

The 8mm motion picture was in color. This, then, would 
apparently indicate with some finality the nature and existence of the
UFOs. The film was projected on the screen and the objects appeared 
to be similar in shape and movements to those of the "Tremonton Incident".

Micro-photographs were made of the best frames and the general appearance
still prevailed. 

The individual frames where then subjected to certain light densities
and other laboratory techniques. These immediately revealed the wings and
jet exhausts of aircraft. The object slightly below appeared to be a "spent" 
flare or some similar object.
