AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IR-71-52 (ATIC) PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES
A/2C Joseph A. Kupeck, AF 17232299, Control Tower Operator, received the following information by telephone in the Ryan Air Force Base Control Tower at 2300 hours on 29 September 1952.
Persons giving the information stated that they observed and Dr. called in to the Control Tower and said they observed one large flying saucer over Hearne, Texas, at 2107 hours, 29 September 1952. The object made a large semi-circular sweep from south to north and made its exit to the southwest at a terrific rate of speed. The object was described as orange-yellow and black in color. Several of the men in the alleged crew of seve stated the celestial appearances as being in sight on many occasions. All men in the specially visible; the saucer had no wings. Altitude was estimated around 20,000 feet.
Upon analyzing it was determined that neither Mr. lived in the surrounding directory of Hearne, Texas, or of Bryan, Texas, or anywhere in the neighboring areas; therefore, further questioning was not possible. The credibility of the observers can not be established.
