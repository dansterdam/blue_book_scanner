Jaxons Awakened By Flying Saucers

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July 17 (UP) - Residents of Jacksonville reported seeing three flying saucers high in the sky early today.

Jacksonville Journal reporter Tom Veveska was among the first to report the incident. She said three objects moving at a speed of about 15,000 feet "were glowing from beneath with violet flashes forming a point," then stopped suddenly "and were wavering up and down like grasshoppers in a high wind."

Joe Noll, announcer at radio station WMBR, said he saw three of the objects at 3 a.m. "flashing a red light, flying in a circular motion at about 15,000 feet." 

Another report said the objects were moving "like a ball of fire" with the military services reportedly having knowledge of the sightings.

The military services reportedly have denied knowledge of the flying saucers.
