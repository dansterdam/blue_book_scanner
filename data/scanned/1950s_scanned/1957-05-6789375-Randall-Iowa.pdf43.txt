SCIENCE NEWS LETTER

THE WEEKLY SUMMARY OF CURRENT SCIENCE


ASTRONOMY Comet Has Its Picture Taken in Blue Light See Front Cover > COMET AREND-ROLAND, now visible in the northwestern sky, is shown on the cover of this weekâ€™s Science News Letter. The photograph was taken in blue light with the five-inch Ross camera at Georgetown University in Washington. Exposure time was 10 minutes at 9:20 P.M., EDT, on the evening of April 29th. The faint vertical line near the center of the photograph results from a flaw in the film. The tail of the comet, when it first was sighted after passing close to the sun, extended about 25 degrees across the sky. (See SNL, May 4, p. 268.)
