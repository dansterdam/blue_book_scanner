Commanding General  
December 2, 1953

On the opposite side that I was flying in, the air seemed to be unusually clear, the air. Petersen had thought so little of this that he did not complete his description till I reminded him.
The only plausible explanation which I can make for this is that there was a mirage, probably on our porch on June 2%, permitting what a caller vivid dreams. She and been seated in a swing and this green light appeared to be coming to her though it had really been elsewhere. This current event seems to been sufficiently vivid so that she actually believes the saw some strange light. However, I feel confident that the mirage probably originated from natural occurrences which her active imagination has amplified, through vivid color and brilliancy, far beyond the normal. I do not believe any reasonable person could ascribe this to a real object, since I doubt it would be worthwhile for any observer to contend that I saw something, though I am sure one would be very happy to talk to anyone. I was unable to detect any reliable observer for your investigation to contact.
For your amusement we enclose the latest "spacer signifi--" made in the vicinity of our research laboratories. It is simply an old tin lid or some ping pong balls and a tobacco humidor top.  
Enclosed you will find the original report by Mrs. E.R.F. for your files, and also the remarks of Mr. C.S. Hudson, who examined the same size.

Very truly yours,

Alexander G. Vill
Assistant Vice President
Engineering Division
