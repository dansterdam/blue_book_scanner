SUGGESTED REVISIONS AND ADDITIONS TO UFO AID

Page 1:
DEFINITION: Insert, after 2nd paragraph: "Unidentified aircraft" are not within this definition of unidentified flying objects; hence should not be a basis for the submission of UFO reports within the meaning of AFR 200-2. The reporting of "unidentified aircraft" usually results from the sighting of an aircraft which is readily identifiable as an aircraft, but whose origin, type, purpose, destination, etc. may not be known. These are the responsibility of air defense and other pertinent units, and should be "screened" or "filtered" out from the UFO reporting system. This should include jet exhausts, parachute flares, condensation trails, navigation lights or other phenomena known to originate from aircraft or aircraft operations, although the aircraft themselves may not be immediately identified. These "unidentified" familiar objects are not "UFOs".

BALLOONS: 2nd paragraph, 5th line: Change "one hundred feet" to read "two hundred feet".
After 2nd paragraph, insert separate paragraph substantially as follows: The majority of balloons released at night carry one or more "running lights", which often contributes to weird or unusual appearances. Many balloons carry metallic, triangular shaped "corner reflectors" suspended some distance below the balloon proper (Fig. 1). Larger, research types, may rise considerable distances before becoming fully inflated, and may often be flattened on top until completely expanded (See Fig. 2). Partially inflated balloons may be caught in updrafts.
