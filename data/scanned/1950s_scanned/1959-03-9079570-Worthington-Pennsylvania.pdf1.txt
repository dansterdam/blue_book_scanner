10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Observer got a good look at UFO & decided it was definite flying object. Was silver-white dull, no more than 25' across & showed up very clearly & slowly moved south. Sighting lasted 10-15 min & then object gradually disappeared. This a definite sighting & no more than unreliable art.
