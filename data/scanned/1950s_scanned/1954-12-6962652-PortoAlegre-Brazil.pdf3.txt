The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document about flying saucer "investigations".

UNCLASSIFIED

Source, as well as the PAS officer in charge of flying saucer "investigations", is convinced that sightings reported by reliable observers are thoroughly credible. He is also convinced that there have been a number of actual flying saucer type objects seen above. What neither he nor PAS official investigators know is to what to do with this information.

Source also stated that PAS has on file various photographs of these objects. An effort will be made to obtain examples for forwarding.

COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:
This reporter has maintained a skeptical attitude toward "flying saucers". Up to this point I have felt that the interest and study being given to reported sightings in Brazil are from unqualified observers and crackpots. And there are therefore completely unreliable. There is an underlying bias of sound reports from qualified observers which makes it difficult to doubt the existence of these objects. This reporter is no longer certain. But an evaluation of what they are and where they come from is beyond his capabilities.
