Subj: Unidentified flying object report of 

1. At approximately 1638 on the afternoon of 3 October 1955, from a point of observation approximately one mile north of Loogootee, Indiana, I observed an unidentified flying object, apparently round in design, and silver in color, passing eastward.

2. This object was traveling in an east-south-easterly direction at an estimated speed of 7000 miles per hour. It left no visible trail and made no sound. This object which left no visible trail crossed the sky in approximately 4-5 seconds.

3. The day was extremely clear, the sun shining brightly, the sky 100% cloudless, visibility and ceiling unlimited. There was no surface wind.

4. I have observed, during my time in service, both piston engine and jet aircraft under normal and combat conditions. This object was definitely not an airplane of any type that I have ever seen.
