38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
If it is decided dismissible, I would prefer leaving it up to you.  It most definitely was NOT a plane or ship of any type, a reflection, (no ship in sight and we were 3 miles from road), mirage, (five seen them), a meteor, or any atmospheric phenomenon, or a dirigible such as the Boca Chica, unless it was high invisible.
