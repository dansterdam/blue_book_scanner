Dear Sir:

First November 29-1959, I sent you a Report on 4 flying saucers seen by me in Flagstaff, Arizona. I also forwarded a drawing of the same.

Since none of my letters and records have received any notice whatever, and as I have no hope of ever hearing of them, will you please simply acknowledge the receipt of this, and, if you can, let me know if I will be notified later on if the saucer case is found to be of enough importance to be investigated?

Thanking you in advance, I am,
Very truly yours,
Mabe Mannassa"
