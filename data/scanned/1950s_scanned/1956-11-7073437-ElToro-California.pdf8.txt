I do not see any photographs in this image. This appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation into UFO sightings. 

The text in the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: (AGENCY)
SUBJECT: M. S. SCHUMACIIER, CAPTAIN, USNG 
ADDRESS: RCAS M. TORO, CALIFORNIA
AGE: 33 
DEGREES: ONE AIR FORCE UNIT
EDUCATION: TWO YEARS COLLEGE
QUALIFICATIONS: PILOT AND/OR OBSERVER FOR FOURTEEN YEARS 
II. DETAILS: WHEN INTERVIEWED, SCHUMACIIER WAS VERY COOPERATIVE AND DID ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING HE COULD TO ASSIST THIS INVESTIGATION. HE WAS VERY FRIENDLY, THOUGH SERIOUS. HIS OBSERVATIONS AND FACTS WERE CONCISELY AND CLEARLY PRESENTED. HE APPEARED TO BE ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLEGENCE, SINCERE, AND SERVICE AS RELIABLE. 
III. SCHUMACIIER'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING AND EVENTS:
1. SOURCE WAS IN STATION OPERATIONS MCAS EL TORO AT APPROXIMATELY 2135 AND OBSERVED THE CONTROL TOWER THAT GCA WAS REPORTING A BOJECT TO BE TRACKED. SOURCE IMMEDIATELY TOOK OFF IN HIS HELICOPTER AND PROCEEDED TO APPROACH AREA. GCA VECTORED HIM IN ON THE OBJECT WHICH HE OBSERVED AT APPROXIMATELY 2220 FST. HE OBSERVED A FLASHING LIGHT ON A HEADING OF APPROXIMATELY 160 DEGREES. HOWEVER, HE WAS UNABLE TO CLOSE IN ON IT AND AFTER FIVE MINUTES THE LIGHT MADE A SHARP TURN TO THE LEFT AND SPED AWAY AT A PHENOMENAL SPEED ESTIMATED TO BE OVER 1500 MPH.
2. SOURCE TOOK OFF AGAIN, ATTEMPTED MORE INTERCEPTS UNDER CONTROL OF GCA AND CIC. AFTER REPEATED ATTEMPTS AT INTERCEPT, SOURCE HAD TO DISCONTINUE DUE TO SHORTAGE OF FUEL. ON ONE PASS, THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE APPROX. 300 FEET BELOW HIM AND SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT. SOURCE ADVISED FLIGHT SERVICE AND ATC OF THE SIGHTINGS. 
3. FURTHER INTERCEPTED WERE ATTEMPTED BUT NO CONTACT COULD BE MADE. SOURCE STATED THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS LAST SIGHTING, HE WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE ANY IMAGE NOR MAKE OUT ANY DETAILS OF THE OBJECT. HE DESCRIBED IT MERELY AS A DARK "GLOB".
