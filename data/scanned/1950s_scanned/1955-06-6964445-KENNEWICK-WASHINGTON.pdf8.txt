Re: Unidentified Flying Objects

Date: June 12, 1956

ball stood still several minutes and then took off with a speed so great that it disappeared. Richardson stated that obviously some different type of engine was utilized in flight such as a jet engine because of the speed of the ball. Richardson noted no fire or smoke on leaving.

Richardson stated the most disturbing thing to him is that apparently the builders of the ball have mastered the pull of gravity. He stated that this fact most likely cost this country a poor position defensively as the ball obviously either came from Russia or some extraspace planet. In which case this Russian might now bid for world domination. Richardson stated that by any known United States device, the United States does not have this ball or any device like it propelling with a high degree of intelligence. Richardson stated that he believes that whoever produces this ball had to have just about perfect control of all natural phenomena such as light waves. He stated he never saw the ball again and has not advised other persons other than the FBI. He also stated that he did not hear of anyone else seeing the ball but commented that this be to his continuing he is a skilled observer.

The above is for your information and no investigation is being made by this office. There is no objection by this office to your investigation of this matter and your interview of Sergeant Gordon Richardson.

Very truly yours,

R. D. Auerbach
Special Agent in Charge
