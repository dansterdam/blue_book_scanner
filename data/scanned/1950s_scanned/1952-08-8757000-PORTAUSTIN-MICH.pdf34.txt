TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects
DATE OF INFORMATION: 6 AUGUST 1952
PLACE: PORTAUSTIN, MICH.
SOURCE: Lt. Col. Ralph L. Broun, Air Attache, Lima, Peru
ON 5 AUGUST 1952 A PRIVATE PILOT, CAPTAIN [REDACTED], REPORTED A SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER LAKE HURON (APPROX 30 MILES SE OF PORTAUSTIN, MICH.) AT 1:13 PM EDT. HE ESTIMATED THE SIZE OF THE OBJECTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY 3000 FEET. 
THIS ACCOUNT APPEARS TO BE MORE AUTHENTIC THAN THE ONE REPORTED ON 4 AUGUST 1952. HOWEVER, THE FACT THAT A SIMILAR SIGHTING WAS REPORTED AS HAVING OCCURRED ON THAT DATE LENDS SOME DOUBT AS TO THE TRUE RELIABILITY OF THE PRESENT SIGHTING. THE LOCATION OF THE SIGHTING, HOWEVER, COINCIDES WITH A RECENT PUBLICITY IN THE STATES OF "FLYING SAUCERS" WHICH HAS INTENSIFIED PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE MATTER.
