OLD "UTO CLASSIC" -
ABSTRACT SPECIAL STUDY
(MOTION PICTURE FILM)

TWO Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) were sighted and photographed 
at about 11:30 MST on August 15, 1950 by Mr. and Mrs.[REDACTED] at Great 
Falls, Montana. The sighting took place during an inspection of this ball park.  
[REDACTED] (and his secretary, also present at the time) first noticed the
UFO's as silvery objects to the NW, accidentally when looking to sell the
wind by the smoke from the Anaconda Copper Company smokestack nearby.

The UFO's drew his attention to the extent that he ran 60 feet from the
grandstand to the parking lot, got his motion picture camera (Revere turret
type 16mm) out of his car and began tracking the UFO's which appeared
to him to have stopped in mid-air, remained stationary for a while and then,
with a swooshing sound flashed away to the left (SW keeping about the same
distance from each other until they were lost from sight.

The color film (Daylight Kodachrome) was submitted to the Air Force.
It was studied and analyzed by the Air Force and the U.S. Navy. 

The original Air Force conclusion, based on the interrogation of
witnesses and the evaluation of the data, was that the UFO's were. In all
probability, two Air Force T-33 fighter aircraft known to be in the
vicinity at the time.
