Biscayne Key
Miami 45, Florida
July 3, 1952

Lt. Anderson G. Flubb,
Assistant Project Bluebook Officer,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Lt. Flubb:

I was one of the two American World Airlines pilots who watched close red-orange lights maneuvering in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico on July 14, 1952. 

As I reported at that time, we were flying an air mail run from Houston to Miami. Suddenly we noticed an array of lights which appeared at about 27,000 feet altitude. After watching them for a two-hour session, we landed, and I immediately reported what we had seen to the control tower at Miami, and later to the other authorities concerned.

Since the experience which was so vivid, I have maintained considerable interest in other reports of similar incidents, as I feel the phenomenon is of the best informed. Any information you can give me regarding these sightings and the results of your investigations would be greatly appreciated, and would tend to satisfy my curiosity.

Thank you for your kind attention.

Very truly yours,
Lt. Cdr. Gair
