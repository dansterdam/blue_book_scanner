The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, with text and instructions for drawing a sketch.

Here is the text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. On the left are the objects you witnessed in the sky. Place a mark showing where you last saw it. Place a line to show how high the object was above the horizon. (Kristina's Note: Here you are instructed to draw a sketch.)

In the following sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. This will show an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
