AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM:  CFPT2 - Composite Wing, Reno, Nevada 
STATEMENT OF MR. ------, RESIDING AT RENO, NEVADA
Col Barrington:  Lt. -----, the USAF at the University of Nevada called us by telephone. He was working with this object in the sky. Will you tell us about these?
Mr. ------: I was coming from Los Angeles to Bishop last weekend and I spotted something that kept moving. It was at middle between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. when I first saw it. It looked about the size of a star, when I first saw it (longer about his arm's length, diameter size of three fingers). So I looked about him to see if anyone else could see it and there was no one that I could see. As I kept watching it, it seemed to be turning from a light yellow to a light silver color. Anyone can see it high and it kept turning from a light silver to a light, silver-white color and it did that about every two seconds. It changed complete color from light yellow to light silver and it kept revolving in different directions. We were traveling northeast and it kept looking it at that time. It seemed to disappear and left a vapor, tail or streak behind it. It didn't go off straight down and left a vapor behind it. It didn't go off straight down and disappear.
Col Barrington: What was the shape?
Mr. ------: I had a telescope, close and we spotted and sighted it. It was a little glow like a star. It would get brighter and dimmer. I could not say if there was anything else to it. If there were any wings or anything on it, I could not definitely say.
Col Barrington: What about would have been its size on the ground?
Mr. ------: It looked pretty big to me. I could not say just how big, but it looked like the telescope and the last object I saw through the telescope appeared to be 25 or 30 feet in diameter. 
Col Barrington: Could it have been the landing lights on a plane?
Mr. ------: No. Definitely not. I could see that silver round disc against the sky and it helped remain a distinct outline. It was definitely not an aeroplane.
Col Barrington: Was it similar to anything you have seen before?
Mr. ------: I am not.
