AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
Station: Corry, Pennsylvania 
Date: 5 Apr 53
Hour: 11:30 PM, E.S.T.
Duration: 5-10 min.
Location: Ground Observer Corps
Observation by: qualified ground observers
SUMMARY: Unidentified flying object observed. Details given in body of report. Maneuvers and general behavior of object indicate phenomena of migrational nature not attributable to known flight performance characteristics of any conventional aerial vehicle.
There were 6 sightings of luminous objects which appeared to be related to this investigation. The objects ranged in color from a bright white to a reddish-orange. The objects were circular in shape and appeared to have a luminous corona around the outer edge. The objects were observed to make abrupt changes in direction and to perform other erratic maneuvers.
The first sighting consisted of a single object which was observed first directly to the east at approximately 45 degrees elevation. The object then appeared to move to the northwest and finally disappeared from view. The second sighting consisted of 3 objects which were observed moving together in a general northwesterly direction at a moderate rate of speed. One of the objects then appeared to execute a sharp right angle turn. The third sighting consisted of 2 objects which were observed moving toward the northeast at a high rate of speed.
