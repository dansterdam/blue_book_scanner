The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter from the U.S. Air Force's Public Information Division to an individual in Cincinnati, Ohio, dated January 19, 1960.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear [Redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter (undated) regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Although you gave us quite a bit of information, there still is not enough for a valid conclusion. Therefore, request you complete the attached Air Force questionnaire in regard to the sighting and forward the completed paper to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
