1. Mr. X, a civilian employee at a Registration Office by occupation, stated that on 29 April 1952, while he, his wife and five children (the youngest 12 years) had all observed the object, reported in the subject case, for a period of about ten minutes. This officer has no reason to doubt the credibility of this witness, who appears to be a reliable person.
