The image does not appear to contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is handwritten and appears to be describing some details related to a reported UFO sighting or incident.

Transcribing the text from the document:

6 October 1957
After having carefully examined the object, we observed that under the object, there was a low-frequency hum, like a transformers. The object seemed to be about 30 feet in diameter, and about 12 feet high. It was a dark gray color, and had a slightly rounded top. The bottom was flat and seemed to be made of some kind of metal, possibly aluminum. There were no lights or markings visible on the object. The object was completely silent, and seemed to be hovering about 20 feet above the ground. The object remained in the same position for about 15 minutes before slowly ascending and disappearing from view. Some of the parts of this object appear to be U.S. government made, but the cables and connectors in the object have never been seen before. They were hidden by the paint, as if to conceal their true nature.
