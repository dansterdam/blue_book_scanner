On August 16, 1959, the intelligence officer of the 20th Air Division, 20th Air Force, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, was informed that a sighting of an unidentified flying object had been made on that date in the vicinity of Washington, Georgia. The witness was described as a mature, responsible individual who apparently had experience in observing aircraft. The witness reported the following:

At approximately 12:20 P.M., EDT, the witness was at his place of business in Washington, Georgia, when he observed an object in the sky. The object was described as round, silver in color, and appeared to be metallic. The object was seen to hover, then make a sudden dash or burst of speed, then stop and hover again. This sequence was repeated several times. The object was observed through a pair of binoculars and was reported to be at an estimated altitude of between 3,000 and 5,000 feet. No sound was heard. The object was observed for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes.

The intelligence officer made a follow-up investigation and interview with the witness. The witness appeared to be a mature, responsible individual and his report was considered credible. No further information was obtained.
