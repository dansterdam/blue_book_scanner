Report of flying object seen over the Atlantic Ocean

On the 18th October 1958 the Dutch M.V. Goedkind, Captain Vries (C.H.), under way from Norfolk, (U.S.A.), to Rotterdam (Holland), was Officer on the First Watch when he sighted what he described as a very strange object.

At A 22:20 ship's time (00:20 G.M.T.) the estimated position being 46°22'N, 19°25'W, the lookout called attention to an object, which at first they took for a shooting star. But as it came closer they were able to identify it as a lighted object, about the size of a medium sized aircraft moving at great speed, about 2 or 3 times the speed of a jet plane.

I.: A very bright, absolutely white light, giving the impression of a solid object.
II.: A lighted connection, looked like a row of lighted portholes.
III.: A steady bright light in the center, brighter than the rest.
IV.: It was already about 200 yards away from a "rocket" the planes have sighted, this being no more than 5 minutes old. 

Captain Vries, at once warned the Captain at once, who also saw the object. It was large, under perfect control and seemed to give off a phosphorescent glow. It appeared to be about 1/2 mile wide. We saw it for about 30 seconds, low. It would say about 1000 to 1200 mph. The object's width, from head to stern, the height was difficult to say. but as I read that the captain intends to send a report to the Dutch Navy.

Philadelphia, 20-11-1958: A Captain informs that on the 18th October 1958 he received the report from Captain Vries.
