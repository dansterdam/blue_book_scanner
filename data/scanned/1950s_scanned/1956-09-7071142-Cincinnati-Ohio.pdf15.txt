The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing an unidentified substance that was collected as part of Project Blue Book, a former U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

seemed to curl.  She then gathered the substance on a stick 
and put it in an air tight jar. In so doing, a gelatinous string 
was drawn out, which upon drying, became a bulk of the 
bacon-appearing fibre-hung pendant in the glass jar.
A second and smaller specimen, was collected on a pencil.
This we left exposed to the air.
I told my wife not to disturb the state in which she first de-
posited the substance.  For this reason I believe mailing is
not advisable.
Of course, the substance may be worthless, but it does seem 
similar to other specimens I have seen, reputed to be "angel
hair," and to other specimens I have seen in photographs.
I would like to make a chemical analysis of this substance, 
but shall wait until I hear from either you or Capt. Gregory.

Respectfully yours,
