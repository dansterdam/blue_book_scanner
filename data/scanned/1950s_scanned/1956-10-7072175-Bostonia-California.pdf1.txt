10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
In reporting given to FBI, source stated that as
part of her photography course, she fixed a
camera on the ground to get a “time-exposure” 
of the moon. Camera was left “open” for 10-20
minutes, than shutter closed. Upon development
of the film a saucer-like object was found over
a tree in the prints. Source claims she has no
knowledge how the object appeared in the film.

11. COMMENTS
Enlargements and different density reproductions
of the prints indicate that there was a
“break” in the exposure. The position of 
the moon and its track, which was shifted 
to a 45° angle from the original track, 
was the clue. Apparently a partial track 
of the moon was made; the shutter closed,
and a light fixture in a dark ceiling 
(indoors) was photographed; and an attempt 
to return the camera to its original position
was made. Evidence of “dodging” and 
“burning in” of this photography in question 
is also evident.
