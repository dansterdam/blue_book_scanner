The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. There is no photograph present on this page. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document.

At 19:20 hours, 20 January 1952, I was leaving the 92d Bomb Wing Headquarters Squadron barracks with T/Sgt Harry A. Cavagnaro and S/Sgt Robert T. Barnes. As I drew a little to the North and saw what I thought was a shooting star, slightly above the water towers.

I called Sergeant Cavagnaro's attention to it, and he remarked "That's no shooting star, sir." As I continued to look, I knew the object could not be a shooting star, for it was traveling at a high rate of speed and appeared to change in size several times. 

The object was below the clouds, which I estimated at a height of 200 feet, moving silently from North to South. It was oval shaped and appeared to pulsate as it left a sharp blue intermittent flame at approximately six foot intervals.

The color of the object was a bright blue-white and appeared to be the size of a grapefruit from a distance of approximately 2000 feet.

Sergeant Barnes did not see the object, for it was visible for only about two seconds.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Since the NO major this report is a very reliable individual who holds a responsible position within the Wing Intelligence Section, and since the sighting was witnessed by another person, this report appears well-founded.
