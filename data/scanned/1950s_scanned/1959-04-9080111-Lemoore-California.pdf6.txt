a. Number 10 - Description "other" as to brightness of the object, but failed to be specific.

b. Number 11 - Report indicates three objects, but fails to mention if all three were seen at the same time or at different times. If they were seen at the same time, no indication is given if the movement or position of the objects in relation to each other was constant.

c. Number 20 - Did not attempt to draw the apparent path of the object.

d. Number 23 - States the object disappeared in the distance and a subsequent 21 states the object again only five seconds from when it disappeared. However, there is no mention of radial velocity in the report.

e. Number 36(2) - It is ATIC policy to categorize all cases which have insufficient evidence as "Insufficient Information". This case should be reclassified in this category.

Number 39 - Indicates a speed in excess of 1000 MPH. However, the angular velocity he recalls is only approximately 2-3 degrees per second.

2. It is stated the object was in sight from five to ten seconds, but had less than the recorded five seconds when it disappeared from sight.

3. Suggest you send another questionnaire as a reference with your letter requesting clarification.
