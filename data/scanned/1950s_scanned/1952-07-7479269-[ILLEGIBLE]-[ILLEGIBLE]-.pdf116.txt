"Trans. at 6:00 MACLELLAN FIELD
Rayed some type effective for altitude
seemed to pause for 4 sec. slowed, accelerated
no P.M. Mac Berger was at the stand. There
was no reflection of stars. He stood there
a minute. It turned, went straight up into
the base of the second cloud layer, about 3
mins he thought it took to disappear. I doubt
if any of this will help, but thought you should
have it anyway. Capt. Ruppelt has copies, too
I asked Mr. Jacobson if he would be willing
to turn over to me any reports of unidentified
aerial objects reported to him, to which he
replied he would be glad to comply and has
asked me to call him to discuss the matter
further. I am now endeavoring to obtain
reports from him on the above request.
Sincerely,
Lt Col USAF
