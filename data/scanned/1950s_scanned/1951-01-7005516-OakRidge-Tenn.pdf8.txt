This page from the Project Blue Book document contains a photograph that appears to depict a schematic or diagram of some kind. It is shown near the bottom of the page, labeled "DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS."

Now, I will proceed to produce the text found in the document:

LTR AUG
ATI Project No. 10073 to TCF, Hq., USAF, "Unconventional Aircraft."

The normal atmospheric temperature condition is that temperature decreases linearly with increase in altitude. The above data indicates that two inversions layers existed, one above the interceptor and one below the interceptor target over the Oak Ridge. Since the physical mechanism of these inversions are not thoroughly understood, it is considered that this effect caused the detection of a ground target to be airborne, first above and then below the interceptor as the interceptor closed on the target.

4. In view of the lack of factual evidence relative to the visual sightings covered in the report, no positive explanation can be offered, however, there are several possible explanations for this sighting:
