RELIABILITY
TOO GENERAL
1. This Center had very little additional information concerning the specific sighting by Mr. 
, however, the case was compared to past incidents with similar circumstances of riolityY, lighting and weather conditions. As a result 
of analyzing this comparison media, it was decided that the case in this instance involved an ambucption of a known rnenomenenation of a known space phenomena, which assumed the particular shape described by the source.
2. Upon examination of the "U.S. Air Technical Information Digest" cempleted by 
the source, it was noted that under Items 5-3, the statement, "3. Moon was out and a
mist'confirmed slightly with items 3.1 - b and 3.3 - a and b. However, it is a
known fact that conditions of either haze or mist,even vater vapor, are inductive to
possibility of misidentification phenomena.
3. As to the identity of the subject involved, two possible explanations
exist. It could have been a reflection of a ship on Lake Erie or a reflection from
an observation dome. This latter possibility results from a statement made in one
of the newspapers included with the report. It is further, Mr. A. Dewdney, Astronomer 
at St. Mary's College, that he believed the object was a reflection from his observatory, which gleamed like the moon of a silvery object by the light of the moon." It must be considered that the object could have been a reflection of the observatory dome depending upon the exact location of the observatory with respect to the source's home.
