The object was sighted about light as night. We left Put in Bay about 9:30 P.M. on the Middle Bass return from a dance. There were about 13 or 14 persons in our party and all saw the object. It looked something like an airplane,but brighter than any plane we had ever seen, and was stationary in the sky. At first it was as bright as a star, but soon blotted out all the stars in the immediate area. It faded a little and then got very bright again. It changed colors - red, green, blue - and went through these changes several times. After a while it just seemed to fade away into the sky. Our watch elapsed was approximately 20 minutes. We were all quite excited about this and continued to watch it as long as it was visible. Ohio Highway Patrol investigated this incident about 3 weeks before Oct. 31st.
