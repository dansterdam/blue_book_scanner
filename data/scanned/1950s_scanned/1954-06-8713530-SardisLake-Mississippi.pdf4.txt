SARDIS MYSTERY BOX IS AIR FORCE RADIO
Greenville Base Identifies It As Lost Transmitter

GREENVILLE, Miss., Sept. 22 - A mysterious object which dropped from the sky into Sardis Lake three months ago was identified by Greenville Air Force base officials Wednesday as a Signal Corps radio transmitting device.

Lake and Reservoir officials at Sardis said they had kept up a weekly surveillance of the lake after J. P. Cullipher, a Como, Miss., fisherman, reported that an object fell near his boat three months ago.

Virgil Kuns, assistant flying safety officer at the Greenville base, was called in to identify the object after residents and authorities failed to find a satisfactory explanation for the incident.

Kuns said the object was a plastic case containing a metal radio tuning wires and other Air Force equipment. He agreed the case was a paramotor transmitter which had been lost from a training plane from the Greenville base.

"If we can locate the transmitter, we will ball out," Kuns said, explaining the transmitter is normally picked up by the plane carrying aircraft. The signal is usually held to guide the plane. The transmitter probably fell by accident from a passing plane.
