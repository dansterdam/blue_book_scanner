SUBJECT: Report of unconventional type e/c 
TO: Director of Intelligence United States Air Force.

1. The following report of observation of unconventional type aircraft is submitted in spite of the termination of inquiry into this subject.

2. On Oct. 15, 1950, at 1625 EST, the undersigned observed a jet plane(s) moving in a Northeasterly direction at an altitude of 35-40,000 feet. Plane(s) not visible but characteristic sound accompanied flight as well as an easily observed and clearly defined contrail.

3. At 1625.40 while observer was following the flight of the jet plane(s) an object solate and spheric in shape crossed the line of flight of the jet plane(s) and continued its movement in a Northwesterly direction. Total length of observation, 10-12 seconds.

4. Object appeared to be constructed of aluminum or like substance...speed unknown...altitude unknown...trail none. Object followed a perfectly straight line of flight.

5. Observer realizes that paucity of detail in this report makes it undoubtable material from an intelligence standpoint, but there is a strong likelihood that the object sighted is the same or one of the same objects sighted and reported by a commercial air lines pilot of the Miami Air Lines. He reported sighting a group of saucer-like objects (four in number) in the vicinity of Pope AFB, N.C., at 1620 EST. Pilot pursued objects for period of time before losing them.

6. If certain assumptions are made, the following conclusions are well within the realms of possibility: 
Pilot's time of observation - 1620 EST
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS
DOD DIR 5200.10
