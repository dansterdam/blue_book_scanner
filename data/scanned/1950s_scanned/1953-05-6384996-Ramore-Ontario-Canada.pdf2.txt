STATEMENT

At 0415 we five airman, Dean McDonald, Vittoria Battini, Paul Ryan, Thomas McLaughlin, and Thomas Griffin were just making the turn off the main highway towards Ramore. At the mile post 69 station when the moonlight illuminated two objects hovering up and down. At first we watched the light. Suddenly the light which seemed about the size of a softball began to move in towards the site. At the same time it was to the left of the site at about 20 to 30 miles. It watched it move in towards the site. According to the time it takes, for the light to move from where we first observed it to the spot it ended up it must have been traveling at terrific speed. We last Paul Ryan off at the barracks and then started up the hill. As we started up the hill the light began to move to the right of the site and as it approached the light became dimmer and disappeared into the clouds and leaving a small indication where it broke through the clouds.
