SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA OVER LORING AIR FORCE BASE, MAINE

As the observer, and the object did not come in close enough for a positive identification, they were unable to determine specific details regarding the object. It was described as approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter, oval in shape, with a vertical row of 5 to 8 bright blue-white lights rotating around the perimeter. The object was first observed at an altitude of approximately 500 feet, moving in a straight line at a speed of 40 to 50 knots. After approximately 60 seconds, the object reversed its direction and climbed rapidly out of sight. Ground observers were able to track the object through binoculars. Captain XXXXXX XXXXXX, who reported the sighting, stated that it was unlike any conventional aircraft he had ever seen. No other specifics about the size, shape or performance capabilities of the object were provided. The report concludes that the object remains unidentified.
