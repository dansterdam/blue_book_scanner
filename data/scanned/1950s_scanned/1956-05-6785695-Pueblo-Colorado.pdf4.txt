Text transcription:

ON MAY10,1956, the man hit the dog.

A CITIZEN OF PUEBLO, COLORADO, witnessed some strange activities in the sky the night of May 10, 1956.

WHILE GOING TO WORK AT THE PUEBLO PAPER MILL, driving on the main highway, just outside of PUEBLO, COLORADO, he saw a strange object descending through the sky. AT FIRST IT SEEMED BRIGHT AND RAPIDLY DESCENDING, BUT AS IT CAME CLOSER AND HE COULD SEE IT CLEALER, THE GROUND OBSERVER CORPS SAID IT APPEARED TO BE MORE OF A ROUND OBJECT RATHER THAN A BRIGHT LIGHT. 

AS USUAL THERE WERE VARIOUS DESCRPTIONS BUT EVERYONE AGREES THEY'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.

On the street REPORTING back to the ground observer Corps, he described an object that was at various times a bright fluorescent light, sometimes pulsing or blinking, and at other times it appeared as a sharply outlined dark silhouette against the sky.

He saw them between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and midnight - it would come to a hover and then dart away at a great rate of speed.

The next day this investigator was called back to Colorado Springs, his base, and a fresh team was sent to Pueblo.

The man really chomped down on the dog July and the UFO really made no findings.
