III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was outside of his residence, looking at the sky, at approximately 9:00-9:15 P.M. on August 13, 1955. He saw 2 objects, in a sequence, which he first described as parachutes, but later stated that they were not parachutes. The objects were about 100 to 150 feet from him and he saw something run from the objects to the ground. The objects then made several sharp ascents and descents which seemed to stumble over each other. Source does not know what the material was that looked like pieces of pottery. Source does not believe the objects were any type of aircraft.
Source also sighted a small, transparent parachute land 100 to 150 feet from his location. Source then saw the 2 objects he had originally observed disappear, and he could not find any trace of the parachute.
Source also saw four (4) more of the parachutes which took on an appearance of bubbles, and then disappeared.
The next night the source also sighted what appeared to be a wing type aircraft, but he was not sure what it was, and stated that it might have been a hawk.
Source also saw a glow in the sky about a month ago, then a circular object with a red glow, traveling very rapidly, north to south.
