The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter addressed to "Mrs. Godfrey" from Donald H. Menzel, the Director of Project Blue Book, regarding a reported sighting of a "flying saucer" the previous May. The letter discusses the witness's observations and Menzel's assessment that the saucer was likely an "inferior mirage" of the sky, consistent with similar reports. The letter thanks the witness for sharing the information and indicates Menzel's continued interest in such sightings.

Dear Mrs. Godfrey:

I have recently learned that you observed a "flying saucer" last May and reported this to the Air Force a few days later. Perhaps you are familiar with the story as published in the University Press. In any event, I am always interested in sightings, and try, if possible, to find a reasonable explanation for them. In most cases I have succeeded. I would appreciate it if you would send me just as much information as you possibly can - times, directions, locations, sky, and so on.

From the character of your report, as repeated to me, I would judge that this might be an "inferior mirage" of the sky, seen against a roadway. If the saucer was of a silvery gray and seemed to move ahead of your car as driving, keeping the road, this is almost certainly the proper explanation. Many people have made similar reports.

Thanking you in advance, I am

Cordially yours,

Donald H. Menzel
Director
