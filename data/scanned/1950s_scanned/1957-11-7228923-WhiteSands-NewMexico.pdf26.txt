SUMMARY:
On or about 2000 hours 3 November 1957, a light was observed near the planet Venus, which was described as unusually bright, approximately 1/4 to 1/3 the size of the planet. The object was bright enough to cast shadows on the ground. After being observed for about 2 minutes, it suddenly disappeared.
Weather records reveal that the planet Venus was at first magnitude at that time, with an altitude of 25 degrees.
On 3 November 1957, Venus was at an altitude of 270 degrees.
The conclusion is that the first patrol probably saw a UFO that the second patrol probably witnessed the planet Venus.
The sighting was made by lonely and isolated personnel on duty in remote areas.
