CUTTER SIGHTS FLYING OBJECT OFF LOUISIANA
Noted on Ship Radar, Guard Reports
(Continued from first page)
which the object was later quoted as saying it was just one of a flight of three similar round objects. The objects were produced from a radar contact made by the U.S. Coast Guard cutter. 
Shortly after the objects were reported, the cutter reported hearing a series of strange sounds, described as "a series of beeping signals" by the security guard.
At this time government officials were unable to discuss the matter extensively, other than to say the incident was being investigated by the Air Force as a "hush-hush project probably related to some secret Air Force activity."
Widely separated residents of the midwestern communities, including several college professors, have reported seeing similar round objects. One professor said he watched the objects maneuver over Chicago. Another noted that the objects were cigar-shaped. The Air Force has been quiet regarding an explanation.
