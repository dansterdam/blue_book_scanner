CONCLUSIONS:

1. This report contains as many details and facts as were available on 24 and 25 June 1954. Upon reviewing this report, there are several paragraphs yet to be included, therefore, it is felt that this report can be utilized as a future rough draft report to facilitate appropriate future analysis, decisions, etc.

2. Dr. Hynek, AFOO-4, would also like to contribute to this report when it is finalized.

3. Tentative analysis of all available details obtained indicates the following:
The UCM was not -
a Jet aircraft,
a canopy reflection, 
or
a weather balloon.

TENTATIVE EVALUATION: A reflection phenomena of some sort. An attempt to further determine the source of the reported light will be conducted as soon as possible.
