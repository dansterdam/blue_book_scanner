Dear Sirs,
I am writing you to give out some information about a certain thing I seen Dec. 30-31 1955. I was traveling home from Sioux City to Omaha on my way home when I saw an object 4 or 5 miles away from where I was on my way home. After looking at it for a while I could tell it was not an airplanes or anything else I had ever seen before and it was hovering right above the ground. It seemed to have a bluish light all around it and slowly moved in front of me as I was driving. When I got a mile or so closer to it I decided I want a mile closer to get a better look at it and as I got closer to it it suddenly took off at an unbelievable speed and was out of sight in just a matter of a few seconds. I was amazed at this and I felt I should report it to someone but I didn't know who to report it to so I kept it to myself until now. I hope this information I have given you will be of help to you in your investigations and if you have any questions I will be glad to answer them to the best of my knowledge.
Yours truly,
Firman Miller
