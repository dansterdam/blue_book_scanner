(Neff, continued): to be an overcast that evening which eliminated the possibility of the stars being out, and several times the ball was three or four times the amount of fuel at low altitude than it does at high altitude. I didn't think a jet could stay down that long without using up a considerable amount of gas.

Miller: I didn't know that about jets. You knew that of course before?

Foster: It's also true of rockets. That's one reason I wouldn't think it would be a rocket. If they have a rocket for half an hour, this is quite a long time to operate a rocket engine.

Mrs. Miller: Well now I'd like to ask you a question: How fast were you going?

Mrs. Miller: * * * (garbled) then did they slow down or why didn't * * * (garbled)?

They must have slowed down. "They" or "it" must have slowed down.

Mrs. Miller: Yes, granted.

Miller: The unidentified object must have slowed down, flying as it was.

Neff: We trailed out as far as Oswego, which is right on the south shore of Lake Ontario and we passed up our point of landing at Syracuse, and we weren't sure we should hold the listeners up any longer, and of course we did the best we could.

Mrs. Miller: ...that would have been wonderful.

We were calling Griffiss and asked if we could change over to emergency frequency which is 121.5, and we came down rather low and the GHF (or VHF) is a line-of-sight operation. And we did we changed over figuring.

Miller: Go right ahead. I don't even know what you're talking about, but that's all right, go right ahead.

But we figured the uncooperative were going to operate on a frequency that's a little different than the line-of-sight.
