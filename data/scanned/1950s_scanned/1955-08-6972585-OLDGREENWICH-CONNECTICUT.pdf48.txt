OBSERVER REPORTS JET PLANE "TAKE" BY UFO!
Mr. Eugene Metcalf of Paris, Illinois, has reported to Project Blue Book that he witnessed a strange incident involving the "take off" of a jet plane by what he believes was a UFO. The following are Metcalf's own words as reported on March 9, 1955, at approximately 3:50 p.m.: "I witnessed the plane-taking-off while standing on my farm at home in Paris, Illinois. The plane was heading in a northeasterly direction. I stood watching this plane, and suddenly it appeared to be taken or drawn up quickly and at a sharp angle. In a split second it was gone. The whole thing appeared to be caught up and pulled up through the sky by something invisible, but the motion was no faster than the normal climb and turn of the plane after takeoff."
