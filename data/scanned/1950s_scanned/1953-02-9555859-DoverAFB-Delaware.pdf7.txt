Dover Air Force Base, Delaware

28 February 1953

I. Description of Incident

At 2121 EST four AF personnel observed a single light of alternating colors
with red predominant. The light was due west of Dover Air Force Base and about 
20° above the horizon pursuing a very gradual course from west to northwest. 
No sound, smoke or vapor was observed. It appeared to fade away or disappear 
over the horizon. There was no air traffic in the area.

II. Discussion of Incident

As in the case of the Dover sighting of 26 Feb 53, it was the opinion of 
ATIC-5 that Venus caused this sighting. ATIC’s contract astronomer was contacted 
and definitely concluded that it was Venus.

III. Conclusion

Was Venus.
