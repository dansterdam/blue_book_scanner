WARNING: TIGHT TRAIL:

UNCLASSIFIED

Warrant Officer Squadron, Moriarity, New Mexico, do hereby with to make the following statement:

At 0730 MST I took my position on CIT scope #1 (range 30-50 miles). At approximately 0740 MST I noticed a blip at 3350 at 11,000 feet. This blip appeared to circle the field, then headed southwest at a fast speed, then appeared to stop, hovered for a while, and then I continued watching this blip until it faded from my scope.

The first unusual blip had to appear faded when at approximately 0755 another blip appeared at 2200 at the same alt. This blip like the one before circled the field, then headed east until it faded from my scope about 70 miles away.

Attached hereto is the approximate path of flight the blip was in.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 30th day of April 1952.
