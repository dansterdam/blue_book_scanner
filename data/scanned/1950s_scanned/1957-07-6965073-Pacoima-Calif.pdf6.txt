Jupiter and Saturn Rule Skies
Jupiter and Saturn will be brighter than the other visible planets in the July skies, while Vega, in the constellation Lyra, will be the brightest star seen at this time.

During the month of July the two major planets, Jupiter and Saturn, will dominate the evening skies, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. 
Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky, after the moon and Venus. Saturn is next, being the fifth brightest object. These two giant planets will be very prominent this month, easily visible to the naked eye as they travel across the southern sky during the evening hours.
As the month progresses, Jupiter will become steadily brighter, reaching a maximum brightness on July 25. Saturn, too, will increase in brightness during the month, but not to the same extent as Jupiter. 
The star Vega, in the constellation Lyra, will be the brightest star in the July skies, outshining all the others. Vega is one of the three stars that make up the "Summer Triangle" along with Altair and Deneb.
Double-Double Star
A nice double-double star for the telescope is Epsilon Lyrae, in the constellation Lyra, just a few degrees from Vega. This star, like Sirius, the Dog Star, appears single to the naked eye, but a small telescope reveals it to be a double star, and a larger telescope shows that each of these two stars is also a double.
