Examinations and analysis are now being pursued. Therefore, without confirming anything, we publish and present, in their chronological order, the first reports that are related to the three events.

Case 21 - Vins-sur-Caramy (Var), April 14, 1957.
Detectives: Jimmy Guieu, Chief of the Investigational Bureau of C.I.E.
Assistant: M. Pierre Ayraud, Engineer of Studio of Radio Monte-Carlo.
Eye Witnesses: Miss ______, Miss ______, Mr. ______, all three live in Vins-sur-Caramy.

On Sunday, April 14, 1957, at 3:00 pm, Misses ______ and ______ were walking along route D-24 at approximately 1 kilometer to the east of Vins-sur-Caramy. Suddenly, at approximately 100 meters from where they were standing, a curious metallic apparatus landed. The apparatus was disk-shaped, metallic colored and cone-shaped, and the nose of the apparatus was vertically pointed downwards. The apparatus was similar to a large spinning top with a convex peak. The maximum height of this apparatus is believed to be approximately 1.50 meters, and the maximum diameter was approximately 1 meter. There were metallic like tights that were parallel to the walls of the cone-shaped apparatus that were rapidly vibrating.

At the time of the machine which was maneuvering to land, the witnesses heard a deafening noise. This noise was made by a signal panel that was rotating (as on the diagram that follows) that was situated at approximately 5 meters from the landing point and oscillated and vibrated in a brutal manner. Misses Guerin and Bari, frightened, let out a cry of surprise and terror and the same time of the noise.

Alerted by these shouts and screams, Mr. ______ who had been caring for an apiary in the hillside, came running as there was thought that there had been an automobile accident. It was then that he saw the apparatus take off.
