Anderson AFB, Guam
19 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
From 2050 to 2055 hours an unidentified serial object was sighted from three superimposed C-47s flying at 12,000 feet. The object appeared to be going north, 2 to 3 miles from Anderson AFB, and climbing to an altitude of 17,000 feet. It was observed as an incoming B-17 115 miles from Guam on a westerly heading. The object or objects in all cases were reported to be on a heading of 270Â°, appeared cylindrical in shape, of silvery color with a bright flame trailing from rear. The object was considered to be in considerable excess of the conventional jet and in each case the sighting did not exceed 15 seconds.

II. Discussion of Incident
The object was seen at 0850 a.m. at which time it would be too bright to see a meteor or satellite. The object appears to that of an observed B-52 returning directions from the unknown detection site. The time and direction of flight hold indicate that this object was five minutes alter the other sightings and yet the object was reported to have been going west of Anderson AFB. The seeming discrepancy here might be explained by the fact that the time estimate by the B-17 pilots was off. The object appears to be going towards an unknown location rather than in conjunction with other sightings but the description of the object does not coincide with usual balloon descriptions.

III. Conclusion
Unknown.
