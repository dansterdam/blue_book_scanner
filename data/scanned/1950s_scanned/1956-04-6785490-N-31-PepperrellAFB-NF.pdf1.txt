One round bject colors mostly red, 
other colors noticed orange & blue.
Brilliant very bright flashing
illuminated sky for many miles, then
faded to barely visible, then bright
again. Bobbed noticeably. No radar
contact at any time.

11. COMMENTS
Venus in NW, estimated altitude
of object at 500’ indicates that
object low on horizon. Venus
would give the appearance of
moving Northerly at this latitude.
Color change & behavior of obj
similar to observation of astro
body. No azimuth of object reported
however all other data indicates
Venus as the object sighted.
