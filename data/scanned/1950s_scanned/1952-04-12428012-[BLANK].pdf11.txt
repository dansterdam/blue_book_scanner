of 10 and higher. The higher the better. A representative value would be 15 to 20.

While the glider enthusiasts were always striving for higher aspect ratios (and in that category fall the "all-wing" enthusiasts), the circular airfoil designers were dabbling with aspect ratios of 1 to 4. This so-called "battle of the aspect ratios" was decided in favor of slender wings (that is, high aspect ratios) in spite of the fact that Prandtl was eager to point out that his airfoil theory did not hold water for very small aspect ratios. That, in fact, the induced drag of disc wings was less than his theory suggested.

Some early tail-less airplanes had rather stubby wings and heavily reflected airfoil sections. A 1929 design by the Frenchman, Abrial, showed an aspect ratio of 2.88 with, however, substantial wing tip discs (which have the effect of increasing the aerodynamic aspect ratio). Wind tunnel experiments of this model indicated a creditable performance.
