The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document appears to be a report of an object observed over Auburn, Alabama on November 9, 1952. The report describes the object as a weather balloon and provides the signature of the reporting officer, Capt. USAF.
