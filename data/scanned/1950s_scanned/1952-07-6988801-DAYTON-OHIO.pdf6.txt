During the month of July on three (3) different occasions, pilots and radar observers of the 666th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, reported unusual radar returns obtained with the AF-33 airborne radars installed in their F-94 aircraft.

5 July 1952 - F-94, 52937, pilot: 1st Lt. Thomas G. Harns (R-6), Radar Observer: 1st Lt. John F. Winn (R-6)
At approximately 0332Z in the Redoubt Bay Area, 60°42'N 151°43'W, while at 6,000 feet, initial contact was made at 20,000 yards from initial contact into 6,000 yards. This contact appeared to climb at 1,000 yards per minute to 16,000 feet and was lost. A search was conducted in the area and contact re-established about 15 (6) minutes later at 15,200 yards with the same results. At no time was visual sighting made.

The weather was overcast at 6,000 feet, tops at 7,000 feet; visibility good with no precipitation. The altitude conditions of the clouds was believed too low to give reflections.

The radar set in use was not operating at good efficiency with the short range almost inoperative. (Radar Observer's comment)
