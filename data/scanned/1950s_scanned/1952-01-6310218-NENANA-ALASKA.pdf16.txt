NENANA, ALASKA
6 January 1952
1. On 5 January 1952 at approximately 1645 hours, I observed a strange object in the sky approximately 15 to 20 miles south of Nenana, Alaska. At first I thought it might be a meteorite or a strange cloud formation, but after observing it for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, I realized that this was no ordinary object.
2. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and was emitting a bright blue-white light. It was traveling in a northwesterly direction at a high rate of speed, approximately 1000 to 1200 miles per hour.
3. The object seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 feet. It was visible for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from sight.
4. I am a registered guide and have spent many years in the Alaskan wilderness. I have never seen anything like this object before.
