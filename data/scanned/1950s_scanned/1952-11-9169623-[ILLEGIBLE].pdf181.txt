STATEMENT

On 27 November 1952 in a return trip from a cross country with Lt. Colonel McCaskill we both witnessed what appeared to be smoke on the horizon. The smoke seemed to be coming from out of the sky of about 2 or 3 puffs at a time, then as we would approach the area puffs of the same black smoke would appear again to dissipate in front of us. I told Colonel McCaskill it appears to be smoke from a crash, but we were unable to see any type aircraft or about the time we would approach the smoke we would encounter much rough turbulence and we made several 90 degree turns to find the smoke, this went on for about twenty minutes and we made several 90 degree turns to find the smoke puffs behind us. This report is accurate to the best of my knowledge.
