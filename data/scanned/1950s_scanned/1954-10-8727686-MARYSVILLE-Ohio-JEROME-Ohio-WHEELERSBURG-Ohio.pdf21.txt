I was on one of my closest associates, ght I was seated on the porch at my home in when I suddenly noticed a bright light in the northwest sky. At first I thought it might be an airplane but as it approached nearer I could see that its shape was not that of an airplane. The light appeared to be approximately the size of a small airplane and was slowing descending in a vertical direction without any sound. As it came closer I could see that it was circular in shape and was emitting a bright light. The object then appeared to stop in midair and hover for approximately 30 seconds. It then ascended vertically at a rapid rate of speed and within a few seconds had disappeared from sight. I was quite amazed at what I had witnessed. The entire sighting lasted approximately 2 minutes. I immediately contacted the local authorities to report what I had seen but they were unable to offer any explanation. I am quite certain that what I saw was not an airplane or any other conventional aircraft. I believe that I may have witnessed an unidentified flying object.
