This image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document describes a sighting of an object that was observed and analyzed, comparing it to the planet Mars. It mentions technical details such as the object's brightness, size, and visibility. The document also discusses the possibility of launching a "lunar probe" rocket, indicating this was likely part of the space exploration efforts during this time period.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

WASHINGTON, AUG 2, 1958
MOONWATCHERS EARLY TODAY TO GO BACK TO SLEEP -- THAT WAS NO ROCKET.
IT WAS THE PLANET MARS. A NAVAL OBSERVATORY SPOKESMAN SAID:
IT APPEARED ALL ASTRONOMY WAS STIRRED UP OVER THE PLANET MARS. OBSERVATION BY TELESCOPE SHOWED THAT IT WAS VERY BRIGHT OBJECT, SUCH AS IT OFTEN APPEARS WHEN IT IS EXCEPTIONALLY CLOSE TO THE EARTH.
CYCLES CALCULATE THAT ITS BRIGHTEST PERIOD WAS LAST NIGHT SAID. AND WITH THE FULL MOON ALSO IN THE SKY, OBSERVERS SAID, THE BRIGITNESS OF THE PLANET MARS WOULD BECOME INCREASINGLY BRIGHTER. IN RELATION TO THE MOON, DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS, WHICH IT NORMALLY WOULD SEEM DIMMER.
THE BRIGITNESS WOULD DIM SLOWLY DURING THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. ASTRONOMERS DISCLOSED THAT MARS IS NOW 35,000,000 MILES FROM THE EARTH, AND BETWEEN AUG. 17 AND AUG. 20, ALTHOUGH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS MAY DELAY IT, THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO LAUNCH THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF LUNAR PROBES. WITH THE FLIGHT OF THESE PROBES POSSIBLY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE.
A MOON SHOT OF THEIR OWN AND THE FIRST HAVE BEEN REPORTED THEY ALREADY TRIED ONCE, BUT FAILED.
PHONED BY EXCITED CITIZENS WHO REPORTED SEEING A BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE WESTERN SKY. THE OBSERVERS AT THE OBSERVATORY SAID THE OBJECT WAS MOVING TOWARD THE MOON.
MOON SAILORS SEEM TO DISPEL THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL. MARTHA SHEPARD, A FORMER NAVAL OBSERVATORY CONSULTANT, SAID SCIENTISTS COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE OBJECT, TOO, ALTHOUGH IT WAS MOVING IN A WAY SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A PLANET MOVE BEFORE. SHE CONSULTED THE OBSERVATORY ON THE MATTER, SHE SAID.
MARS WHICH HAPPENS TO BE AT THAT ANGLE JUST NOW -- BUT MUCH FARTHER AWAY THAN THE MOON.
AT THE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, ASTRONOMER OWEN GINGERICH SAID THE SIGHTING WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BRIGHT OBJECT, BUT HE SAID IT WAS A BRIGHT STAR OR POSSIBLY A PLANET.
MATHETICALLY SAD NO ROCKET FIRED FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON WOULD REMAIN VISIBLE IN SPACE FOR VERY LONG. IT
BECAME VISIBLE ON SPACE FOR VERY LONG. IT WOULD JUST WOULDN'T BE BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE THE BRILLIANCE OF A STAR OR PLANET.
NO ROCKET WAS FIRED ACCORDING TO NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY, WHICH TRACKS THE U.S. AND RUSSIAN EARTH SATELLITES.
ALTHOUGH THE MOON, FRANKLY, SAID THE SIGHTING WAS ACTUALLY FOR REVENGE. TOWARD THAT SOMETHING IN ADDITION TO THE MOON, AS NOTHING UNUSUAL REMAINED IN THE POSITION FROM THE REVERSE WAS TRUE.
