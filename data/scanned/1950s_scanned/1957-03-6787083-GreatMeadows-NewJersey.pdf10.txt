Text from the document:

"March 6-Warren County, W.New Jersey--2pm--Huge white UFO (shaped like a Derby Hat) hovering low over a field, with shimmering ray(s) below it.

Dear sirs:

This is to inform you that on the above mentioned date, at the above mentioned time, I saw an unusual aerial object which I believe to be of extra-terrestrial origin.

My wife and I were out for a drive in the country when we noticed this large, white, disk-shaped object hovering low over a field. As we watched, it appeared to emit a shimmering ray or beam of light from the center of the underside of the craft.

We would estimate the object to have been approximately 60-75 feet in diameter, and it appeared to be hovering at an altitude of around 200-300 feet above the field. It remained stationary for several minutes before suddenly accelerating in a horizontal direction and disappearing from sight.

While I realize that reports of UFO sightings are often dismissed or discounted, I can assure you that what my wife and I saw was very real and quite remarkable. We are both level-headed, rational individuals who have no history of being prone to exaggeration or fabrication. This was a genuinely unusual aerial phenomena that we feel compelled to report.

I would be most interested to learn if any other similar sightings were reported in the area around that time. Any information or feedback you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]"
