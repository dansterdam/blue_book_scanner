There does not appear to be any photograph or image in this document. The document seems to be a narrative statement about an unidentified flying object sighting. As an OCR system, I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

Narrative statement of unidentified flying object
About 1200 hours of the 4th of December 1952 I was talking to a man by the name of [REDACTED] on the installation course No. 1 on Camp Carson, Colorado. I heard a loud an object somewhere about 30 degrees from the south on the horizon.
At first it appeared to be a star, but as I watched it, the object began to move from one side to the other. At this point we decided to draw to our left and then light back on the same line. The object continued to be visible. The detail I can give you is that there was no noise - - it seemed to be moving at a tremendous rate of speed. There was no flame, no exhaust - just a round object that had an eerie glow about it.
The project officer for the 6952d intelligence squadron observed the object with me. We both felt that the object was not a known type of aircraft. The project officer phoned his information to the nearest air defense direction center.
