GUS FROM CAPT GREGORY.

HAVE CONTACTED PROF FITTS OFFICE EVERY DAY FOR THIS LAST
TWO WEEKS. YESTERDAY I RECEIVED ASSURANCE FROM HIS SECRETARY
THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST REVIEW THE DOCUMENT SOMETIME TODAY.
SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION THAT WAS SUGGESTED TO ME BY THE
SECRETARY THAT SHE PLACE THE DOCUMENT IN HIS HANDS AND TELL HIM
WOULD HE MAKE A CONFERENCE APPOINTMENT ASAP TO DISCUSS SAME WHICH
WILL REQUIRE SOME TIME ACTUALLY ONLY THREE PAGES BELIEVE HE
CAN DO IT IN A HALF HOUR. VAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE
DOCUMENT WAS IN FITTS OFFICE FOR SOME TIME WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE REGARDING
DOCUMENT AND THAT HE SEEMED VERY INTERESTED. IT WOULD GAIN US PRECIOUS
TIME IF PROF FITTS WOULD REVIEW IT THIS AFTERNOON. PLEASE ADVISE AND
HANDS ASAP. LETS TRY THIS WAY, GUS 
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS?

GA

FROM A SECURITY VIEWPOINT WE HAVE HELD THIS DOCUMENT HERE AND HAVE
MADE NO EFFORT TO DELIVER IT TO FITTS BECAUSE OF THE DISCREET HANDLING
SITUATION THAT THIS FACT THAT IT IS DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL AND
FINALLY SIC SINCE WE HAVE NO IDEA OF HIS CAPABILITY TO STORE IT

JUST CANT FIND IT IN MY SOUL TO DEMAND ANYTHING OF FITTS AM LEARY
THAT HE WOULD INFORM IT OF DEATH SQUAD DEAD PEOPLE SINCE THIS HAS BECOME
SO SERIOUS US INSTITUTE GRAND MASTER AS SOME OF THESE DELICATE MATTERS YOU
KNOW WE MUST BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL ABOUT

I SUSPECT THAT FROM AN OVERALL STANDPOINT INCLUDING TRANSMISSIOI THE
DOCUMENT SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO FITTS ONLY AND ONLY IN A HALF HOUR
CONFERENCE SESSION AND STRICTLY UNDER OUR CONTROL GUS
LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS
