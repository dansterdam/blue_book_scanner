The present case offers no doubts as to the details. We have the report of the witnesses and it is absolutely clear. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted], [redacted] bus driver, are reliable we have been able to find out.

The Investigation Department of CIOVI states that due to the evidence they have it can be described as an unidentified flying object called "flying saucer."

The report has many coincidences with others and can be considered a classic.

We have 2 other reports given by Mr. [redacted] that will be studied later on, as they deserve a special consideration.
