The image appears to be a letter from Maribelle Cormack, the Director of the Roger Williams Planetarium, addressed to Dr. Walter Uphoff of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The letter mentions that the writer had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Uphoff speak at the planetarium and had used his book on flying saucers for a planetarium show.

The letter also describes an encounter that a Rhode Island woman had with an unidentified flying object (UFO) on May 20, 1958. According to the letter, the woman saw several things, including a "saucer" that was about 8 feet above ground and had two ordinary house rooms, metallic gray in color, connected by a large metallic band. The woman is described as a rational and sensible person, married with a son in some research work.

July 24, 1959
Dr.
Walter Uphoff
Cambridge, Massachusetts
Dear Dr. Uphoff:
We've had the pleasure of hearing you several times
at skyacrapers and we have used your book on Flying Saucers
at our Planetarium shows.
About a week ago, I made the acquaintance of a Rhode
Island woman who has actually seen a U.F.O. She may write
to you regarding this sighting. She made this sighting on
May 20, 1958 while driving from her home in a suburb of
Chicago to her home in a suburb of Chicago. The hour was
8:00 P.M. It was approximately clear. The matter
was reported on May 12, 1958.
She saw several things, among them, the "saucer" which
she said was perhaps 8 feet above ground and was two
ordinary house rooms, a flat gun metal gray in color,
connected by a large metallic band. She is a sober,
rational and sensible woman, 45 ish, married, with a son
in some research work, I thought perhaps you would wish
to add this to your voluminous file on U.F.O.
Sincerely yours,
Maribelle Cormack
