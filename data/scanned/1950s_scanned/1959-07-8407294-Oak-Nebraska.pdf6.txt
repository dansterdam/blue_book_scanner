__The 11 July Pacific ocean sighting resulted from a meteor.
All aircraft saw the meteor at the same time and the direction was also constant.__

Evaluation of Source Reliability____________________________

Analysis and Conclusions: Even though the aircraft involved in this sighting were spread out over an area of approximately 800 miles, all indicated that the object was in the same general direction from their individual positions. This point substantiates the fact that the object was at a very great distance from the witnesses. The description of this object is that characteristic of meteors of the fireball class. These meteors may have a magnitude of greater than -4 (brighter than Venus), while meteors of this type are not an every day occurrence, the experience of seeing one is not at all uncommon. However, one's first experience with meteors of this type is bound to be startling and lasting.
