The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It seems to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

REPORT OF OFFICERS WHO INTERROGATED WITNESSES WHO REPORTED SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE YUKON CANADA ALASKA AREA ON 12 MARCH 1958 

The text in the document describes the details of the reported UFO sighting, including the location, date, and observations made by the witnesses. There does not appear to be any identifying information about the witnesses.
