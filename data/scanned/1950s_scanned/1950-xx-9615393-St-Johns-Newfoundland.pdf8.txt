250 l.m.e. It disappeared down behind the White Hills transmitter site. It did not appear to be traveling horizontally but rather dropped down and did not appear as a meteor but rather disappeared as if behind the transmitter site. I have a witness that substantiates this.

Capt. T.F., 2205th Air Base Group, Pepperrell AFB, Nfid. was interviewed and stated that at approximately 2000 hours, 30 July '50, I was coming into Pepperrell AFB, Nfld. from Argentia, Nfld. with my husband. We were both in the town near the base and driving slowly when I saw a streak going across the sky like a lighted torch from the right to the left. It went in a downward direction until it seemed to strike the ground or pass behind a hill in the distance but the way it disappeared into another cloud. It had no effect on the clouds that were present. It was traveling at a terrific speed, or so it seemed. 

Lt. E.J., "St. John's", Newfoundland, was interviewed and gave substantially the same report as his wife. He also stated, I have seen such items before and it is not unusual. I have a civilian friend who is brilliant with a long career in aeronautics and we only saw it through the break. It disappeared behind a cloud.

Capt. J.L. MACS, Pepperrell AFB, Nfld. was interviewed and stated, I was on 1300 hours to 2400 hours at White Hills, transmitter site. Pepperrell AFB, Nfld. on 30 July 50. At approximately 2020 hours the C.O. and I were standing in front of a distance that had a no trespassing sign and I got the impression that it was some more like something hitting the ground. I do not think it was far away. In fact, I arose and looked around thinking it might be the O.D.'s jeep on his routine check but I could see nothing.
