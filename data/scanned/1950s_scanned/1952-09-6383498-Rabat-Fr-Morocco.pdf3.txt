BELIEVE OBJECT OVER MOROCCO ONLY A METEOR. RABAT'S L'ECHO DU MAROC 23 SEP 52.
5:55 P.M. 22 SEP 52 - A BRILLIANT UASE(?) OBSERVED OVER MOROCCO EAST OF RABAT. ALL MOROCCO AND BEYOND WAS OBSERVED OVER RABAT. IT SEEMS MOST LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WAS ONLY A METEOR, BECAUSE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE OBJECT WAS GIVEN AS RECTILINEAR, IT DID NOT MANEUVER IN THE WAY OBJECTS SUPPOSED TO DO, AND ITS TERMINAL VELOCITY WAS THAT OF FALLING MACHINES.
THE OBJECT WAS VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS AN ORANGE-COLORED BALL OF FIRE, AN ARROW, OR A CONE-SHAPED OBJECT TRAILING A BRIGHT GREEN-BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE, HEADING FROM EAST TO WEST AND PARALLEL TO THE COAST, AND MOVING AT THE SPEED OF A CONVENTIONAL PLANE AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 1,000 METERS. THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS. AFTER IT PASSED AWAY, A THIN, WHITE TRAIL OR SMOKE REMAINED VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES.
