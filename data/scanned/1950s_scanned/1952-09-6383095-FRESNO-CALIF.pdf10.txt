There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text of the document is as follows:

IR-250-52
Siting Intelligence
Castle Air Force, California

b. Reliability of Information:
Californian: This man had no previous record of sighting unidentified aerial objects, however, his interest in this particular incident was obviously more than casual. His reliability is therefore considered as good, according to the rules for classification of witnesses established for the UFO investigations. This indicates the probability of visitors from outer world.

"The principal information obtained together represents a former USAF pilot, employed as a retired-secretary. However, quite stable and intelligent, and discussed his observation in a normal, consistent manner. All reported details related to make observation possible."

6. Weather: Clear sky--winds light and variable, of less than 5-15 velocity (as reported by Castle AF Base weather service).

7. Related Activities or Conditions: None determined.

8. Physical Evidence: None.

9. Intention or Identification Action: None determined. 

10. Local Air Traffic: Aeronautical facilities in the Fresno area were checked to determine possibility of any aircraft in the area at this particular time, but negative results were obtained. No local records were available to indicate what, if any, other significant air traffic may have been flying in the Fresno area at this time.
