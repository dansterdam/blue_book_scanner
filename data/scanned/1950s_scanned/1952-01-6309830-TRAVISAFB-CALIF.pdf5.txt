The following report is submitted as the result of an interview with Pfc. with the Air Operations and Electronics Section, 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Travis Air Force Base, California on 5 January 1952:

On 6 January 1952 between the hours of 0300 and 0530 the informant sighted what appeared to be an unidentified flying object. The weather during the time of observation was clear, the moon visible, however a high, broken, overcast was observed over the area. The object was alone at the time and moving in a steady, uniform motion approximately 10,000 feet in altitude. The object hovered on a relatively bearing approximately 60 to 75 degrees to the north (300) feet. The unidentified sighting appeared to be going forward and moving up and down slightly in a vertical motion. No jet type aircraft taking off or landing were observed at the time. The object appeared to be about the size of a quarter when held at arm's length. The object shone a bright, brilliant light and after reaching a point about 20 degrees above the horizon, it dimmed gradually until it disappeared from sight.
