The image contains a series of sketches and descriptions of an observed object in the sky. The sketches depict the changing appearance and behavior of the object, including its irregular outline, halo of light, and shifting colors ranging from orange-cast yellow to pale yellow. The text describes the object as being immovable in the sky for several minutes, then moving sharply to the north where it was lost from sight. It then describes the object coming slowly back to the same spot where it was first seen, moving slowly upward and westward, with changes in its color and appearance. There is no photograph in this image, only the sketches and descriptions.
