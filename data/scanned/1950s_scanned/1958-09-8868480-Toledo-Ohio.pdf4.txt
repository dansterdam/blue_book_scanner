The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a request for photo analysis.

Text in the document:

SUBJECT: (U) Request for Photo Analysis
TO: AFCIN-4E4 FROM: AFCIN-4E4 DATE: 7 NOV 59 COMMENT NR: 2
1. The attached photographs are of such poor quality as to preclude any accurate evaluation beyond pure conjecture.
2. It is recommended that the original film be made available to this office and/or 4E4 for evaluation. It is possible that an optical enlargement could yield more information than can be provided us with enough information to determine the nature of the object.

TO: AFCIN-4E4 FROM: AFCIN-4E4 DATE 7 NOV 59 COMMENT NR. 3
1. In accordance with your recommendation, the attached original negatives are forwarded to your office for evaluation.
