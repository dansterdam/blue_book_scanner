CASE FILE OF JESUP GO 

AS REPORTED BY MAXWELL AIR RESCUE DETAIL OBJECT PRESENTLY WEIGHS 6O POUNDS AND IS STILL PROBABLY REMAIN IN THE CUSTODY OF CAPT HUNTER AR 134

STATEMENT BY CAPT. HAINES R HUNTER
AR 134

CAPT HUNTER SAID AS TO HIGHEST OR TRUE HEIGHT 49 DEGREES ELEVATION DOWN TO 32 OR 39 DEGREES ELEVATION WHAT APPEARED TO BE A METEOR WITH LONG WHITE FIERY TAIL AND A LITTLE WHITE SMOKE ABOUT AS LONG AS A 1 1/2 INCH HELD AT ARMS LENGTH WITH A WHITE FIERY EXHAUST AND CONSIDERABLE BRIGHT AND FLASHY LIGHT. IT CAME DOWN THE SKY OF THE SIZE OF THE SHELL OF THE END OF A FINGER POINT AT YOU FROM ARMS LENGTH. NO NOISE WAS HEARD THROUGHOUT ITS VISIBLE 32 TO 45 DEGREE DIVING COURSE TO SOUNDLESS EXPLOSION POINT. AT EXPLOSION OR DISINTEGRATION POINT IT STOPPED INSTANTLY, SEEMED TO VANISH INSTANTLY EITHER BY DISINTEGRATING OR BY LEAVING EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. NO PIECES COULD BE SEEN DUE TO HIGER EYE OBSERVATION.
IN VANISHING POINT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO STILL BE WHITE HIGH, SAY 25 TO 35 THOUSAND FEET. I IMAGINE DEGREES OF 9 TO 9 THOUSAND MILES PER HOUR SINCE IT COVERED 32 DEGREE ARC OF THE SKY IN ABOUT 2 SECOND OR LESS. I WAS COINCIDENTLY LOOKING IN A DIRECTION AT TIME OF EVENT. THE WHITE SMOKE TRAIL (PART OF IT) LINGERED IN THE SKY FOR ABOUT 2 TO 5 MINUTES AFTER VANISHING POINT, AND FINALLY DISAPATED INTO OR ABOVE A VERY THIN LAYER OF CIRRUS HORSE TAIL IN THE WAKE OF THE OBJECT.
