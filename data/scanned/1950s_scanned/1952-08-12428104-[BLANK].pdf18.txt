The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, discussing early UFO sightings and reports.

Or were they real, and of terrestrial origin? Or real, and of celestial origin, possibly tranplanetary or even transstellar?
There are many hundreds of reported early sightings on record, but, after careful screening, the DIGEST has selected for presentation only those discussed and/or reproduced (see accompanying artwork) in this article.
A large percentage of the early reports were in the form of letters to such sober and reputable journals as the London Times; Scientific American; Nature; American Meteorological Journal; U.S. and Canada Monthly Weather Review; l'Astronomie; Astronomische Nachrichten; London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science; The Observatory---Monthly Review of Astronomy, etc. This proves, if it proves nothing else, that the witnesses were deeply moved and shocked by what they saw -- or thought they saw.
"Esekiel saw a wheel."
Ezechiah saw a "roll".
The AIR INTELLIGENCE DIGEST will not quarrel with readers who dismiss as far-fetched any interpretation of the Biblical citations below as references to 1) a disc-shaped UAO and 2) a cigar-shaped UAO. These quotations are presented solely for whatever significance, if any, that DIGEST readers may read into them.
