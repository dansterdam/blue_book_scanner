"OBSERVATIONS OF VENUS 19-24 MARCH

"It's Only Star, Folks!"

"'Thing' Is Identified From Plane Window

"We chased it then and identified it as a 48 shiny, flying object with some fantastic stories attached to it.

"Captain William T. Dunn, USAF, Langley Air Force Base, Va., an experienced pilot, said he was flying a T-33 trainer from Cincinnati to New Boston, Ohio, at about 12,000 feet when he and his student pilot spotted an unidentified flying object through the pilot's windshield at about 3:00 p.m. on March 19.

"Dunn said the object appeared to be ova-shaped, shiny, and metallic, and was moving slowly compared to the speed of his aircraft. The object was some distance away and seemed to be at about the same altitude as the T-33, Dunn estimated. 

"He said he at first thought it might be a weather balloon, but ruled that out when the object changed course sharply and accelerated to a high speed, disappearing from sight in a few seconds. Dunn said he had a good look at the object through the windshield and was certain it was not a balloon or any conventional aircraft.

"The captain said he and the student pilot immediately reported the sighting to operations at the Cincinnati Astronomical Society, where it was received with considerable interest. Capt. Dunn said the Cincinnati Astronomical Society later reported that they had received several other reports of unidentified flying objects seen in the Cincinnati area that same afternoon."
