I was sitting on the back porch with the family talking about nothing particular. I remember that it was a warm summer evening in late August. I just happened to look up and notice a bright object moving across the sky from north-south-east at what must have been a great speed because of the short time that it took to vanish. When we first noticed it it was moving from our right to our left. I went inside and got my camera (a Kodak Pony 135 Model B) and took a photograph of it as it was nearest point. (I don't know what the settings were)

As we watched, it continued to move to our left and appear smaller and smaller until it had vanished.

One must take into consideration that the above incident occurred in August and it is now March. At the time that it happened I payed no great attention to the conditions at that time. The reason that I took the picture was, I thought it might be an unusual occurrence.
