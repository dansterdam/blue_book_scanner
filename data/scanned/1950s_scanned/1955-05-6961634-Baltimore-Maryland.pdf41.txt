The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be an incident report detailing the probable cause of an incident. The text in the document is as follows:

B. Probable Cause of the Incident

(1). It is extremely unlikely that any aircraft flying in the area at the time could have generated winds particular to this incident, if the whole wheel had been subjected to such winds, it would have been dislodged from the aircraft, rather than lodged in one side of the building. There were no other pieces found or recovered.

(2). The material could have caused a great amount of physical strength to have drawn it up and through the roof.

(3). If the objects had been part of a revolving mechanism of any kind, they could have entered the building in a more jagged direction, rather than the obvious vertical direction they fell in.

(4). Based upon close examination of the report and as a result of the investigation concluded, it is felt by the examining authorities that the skull-cracking operations and the objects penetrating through the roof of the building, notes skull-cracking to the building up of machinery and other instable objects into the air and back down, for undulating and re-cresting.

RECOMMENDATION
In line with conclusion (4) above, it is recommended that Capt. C. B. Hanson, USAF, Hq 3-4, be contacted and requested to check on the locations of operational commands conducting skull-cracking operations that may have resulted in any such calamities on 7 May 1955.
