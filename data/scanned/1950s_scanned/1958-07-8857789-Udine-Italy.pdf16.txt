Dear Sirs:

On 12 July 1958, at 0:14 hours, a report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object was received.

The object was first sighted at approximately 23:56 hours, 11 July 1958, and was observed until 23:59 hours, 11 July 1958, a duration of approximately 3 minutes.

The object was described as bright white in color, round in shape, and moving at a high rate of speed. It was at an altitude of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The object was seen by Air Force personnel.

I would like to know the following:

(a) What is the Air Force's conclusion in connection with this sighting?
(b) What was the exact number of witnesses?
(c) Why did an Air Force officer, will one of the division, basses, this officer's report as probably on erroneous and unreliable indications?

Sincerely yours,
