The following statement is my opinion of the reliability of the witnesses:

Captain ——————--thoroughly reliable.

Lieutenant————--thoroughly reliable.

Mr.————--reliable but statement must be considered in the light of his late observance of the object. He did not study it as long as the others.

Lieutenant————--reliable but is conyiced that the object was an outbound plane even though there is no evidence that a Constellation would have been in that area at that time.
