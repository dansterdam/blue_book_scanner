MINNEAPOLIS, MINN. - 11 October 1951

I. LIST OF INCIDENT:

The only information available on this incident is a letter quoted below:

"THE 0650, 11 OCT 51. MY WIFE AND I WERE FLYING AT 10,000 FT. CARRYING A SMALL PORTABLE RADIO. AS I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO THE NORTH, DIRECTLY OVER MINNEAPOLIS - ST. PAUL AIRPORT, I NOTICED A PECULIAR OBJECT IN THE SKY. IT APPEARED TO BE GLOWING BRIGHTLY AND WAS MOVING SILENTLY NORTH-SOUTH. I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES."

"THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 40 FT. LONG AND VERY SLIM. IT STARTED OUT CIRCLING MOTION AND THEN HEADED SOUTH AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEN IT TURNED EAST AND WEST SEVERAL TIMES IN RAPID SUCCESSION, CHANGING DIRECTIONS VERY SHARPLY, AND ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY CHANGING DIRECTIONS FOR SOME SECONDS."

"THIS OBJECT WAS PECULIAR IN THAT IT HELD WHAT COULD BE DESCRIBED AS A PALE YELLOW OR AMBER COLOR, AND AT TIMES APPEARED TO SHINE OR GLOW BRIGHTLY. AFTER WATCHING IT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES, IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT, THROUGH THESE GYRATIONS, FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS AND THEN REAPPEARED. THIS OBJECT WAS NOT MOVING AT A CONSTANT SPEED, AND I DID NOT HEAR ANY SOUND FROM IT."

"I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE ITS SIZE, BECAUSE AT THE TIME I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE TO COMPARE IT WITH."

"SHORTLY AFTER THIS WE SAW ANOTHER ONE, BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T HANG AROUND LONG. IT WAS APPROACHED FROM THE WEST AND DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST, NEITHER ONE LEAVING ANY TRACE OF VAPOR TRAIL."

"WHEN I SAW THE SECOND ONE I CALLED OUR STATION AT MINNEAPOLIS AIRPORT AND THE OPERATOR SAID THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED SEVERAL SIMILAR REPORTS AND THAT THIS WAS A RATHER COMMON OCCURRENCE IN THAT AREA."

II. CAJAR

Unknown, but evidently clear.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

Further investigation provided no additional information as to the identity of the objects. The two-mile sergeant was stationed and stated that he could only observe "a brief blur for about two seconds during its brief appearance. He did not get any details and there was no vapor trail gave off no reflection."

All observers were positive of the following facts:
