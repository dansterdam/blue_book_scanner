To whom it may concern -
Around midnight, Aug 11-1959 I was laying in bed and looking
thru the window. I saw what I thought was a large star.
Imagine my surprise when all of a sudden my star took off
towards the horizon to the east.
It was south east when I first saw it. I hopped out of bed
and watched it disappear. I remember thinking at the time,
I never saw a plane move so fast. I told a few skeptic people
who laughed at it. This was the week end, I forgot it -- but yesterday
a teen age boy came to ask about it.
