Melbourne, MAY 19, 1953
A group of people at Surrey Hills yesterday reported seeing a bright object in the sky. It appeared to be 100 ft. long. The sun shone brilliantly off the object, which was visible for about 4 minutes. A telescope could not be obtained quickly at the time, so the opportunity to examine the object more closely was lost. Several people in the group reported that the object appeared to be circular like a ring or the objects that fly about it.
