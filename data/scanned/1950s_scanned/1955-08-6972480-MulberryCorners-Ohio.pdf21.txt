The document contains three photographs. Each photograph is described below:

1. The photograph on the top left, labeled “ABOUT NORTHWEST”, appears to be a dark image showing a treeline or a line of shrubbery, with the terrain mostly obscured due to the darkness or quality of the image.

2. The photograph in the center of the page, labeled "FACING NORTHWEST ACROSS ROUTE 6", shows a hand-drawn diagram or sketch instead of a photograph. It appears to depict a road with trees, elevated ground, and marked locations labeled as high ground, low ground, and where trees are.

3. The photograph on the top right, labeled “EAST ALONG EAST”, features a wooded area with trees and underbrush. There's a car visible in the bottom right corner of the image with the driver's side door open.
