THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY
COLUMBUS 10

8 July 1953

Lt. Robert Olsson
AFIT - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson,

Mrs. Janet Jennie has her Preliminary clearance, she can help me handle the reports and can type the letters to you and to your successor. This will improve the quality of the typing. (I am sure I cannot guarantee spelling. (Neither can I.)

With reference to the 21 June case you sent us on June 23, there is only one thing to say: The 21 June report to APB case must be tossed out because of possibly inaccuracies there. Do you think there is a chance of anything interesting there which would justify sending a Form AI? It seems to me that reports of this kind just clutter up the wires without accomplishing anything. 

The San Antonio 16 June is clearly a meteorological phenomenon and one that would warm the heart of "sensi." This was undoubtedly as suggested, namely the siting of this setting sun on a high cloud.

Referring to the follow-up statement on the 10 June Detroit case, both reports and I still think this was a landing light and agree it could not have been a meteor. 

Business is a little slow, Jan is going ahead with requesting cooperation from the air control tower operators. Her difficulties have increased in view of this contact and I hope that her full clearance will not be too long in coming.

I hope we can see you soon and wish you a bon voyage into Law School.

Sincerely,
Allen Hynek
