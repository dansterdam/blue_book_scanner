NICAP Letter (Mr 

1. The Portland, Oregon UFO sighting of 24 September 1959, is carried on the records of ATIC as "insufficient information". The ATIC account of the sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of the attempted intercept. It is the ATIC opinion that this object was probably a ballon as evidenced by its relatively long period in the area (more than an hour), and the fact unless equipped with reflectors balloons are not sood radar reflectors. The average direction and strength of the wind at the time of the sighting was about 15 knots.

2. Project Twinkle was discontinued in the last quarter of the calendar year 1951. The conclusions from the project were that unusual phenomena could be attributed to man-made objetcs as airplanes, balloons, rockets, etc; others were attributed to natural phenomena such as flying birds, small clouds and meteorites. There was no mention in the conclusions as to the specific composition of "green fireballs".

3. ATIC is familiar with the theory of Dr. Donald Robey concerning the composition of "green Fireballs," but as yet these theories have nor been substantiated. Air Force studies of meteors have not revealed any data which would lead to similar conclusions as those proposed by Dr Robey.
