The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a handwritten document that appears to be a report or notes related to a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Wake 3 knew 1 sited UFO maneuvered around while lighted up. Was in army on Okinawa & believe around 1952 Sept, Nighttime
Little while man saw 1 UFO, circling area at high altitude, Bright lights, Stood still & then shot away very fast. Same time, another GI saw one
& reported to CO, so both saw same thing. I do not know what make, model or size of UFO, but it was lighted up, maneuvered around & then
left very fast. I have seen a couple of other UFO sightings also, but not so clear. Last night in our area 2 sighted UFO trailed by SAC jet
approx 830 PM 9/6 Unidentified object very bright. Moved to West. Watched several minutes & then object made a quick acceleration & was gone
Total time seen approx 5 minutes.
One thing was noticed on many occasions, we could not see very clearly of the UFOs, seem to have haze around them. Do not know why. This
could mean they are operating some kind of shield or magnetic field to obscure clear view. These are facts, not fantasy. I have no theory, only
reported what was seen. No explanation by base officials."
