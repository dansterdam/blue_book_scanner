AT 1752 H., ON 9 NOVEMBER 1952, I WAS FLYING IN THE REAR COCKPIT OF A T-6 AIRCRAFT.

AT APPROXIMATELY 1753 H., THE PILOT, WHO WAS FLYING THE AIRCRAFT, OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT COMING FROM THE NORTHEAST, APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. THIS LIGHT WAS APPROXIMATELY 40-50 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A STEADY AND LEVEL FLIGHT AT AN ALTITUDE ESTIMATED TO BE 1,500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE WHITE IN COLOR AND APPEARED TO BE ILLUMINATING OR REFLECTING A BRIGHT LIGHT.

THE PILOT IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE AIRCRAFT TOWARD THE LIGHT AND SPED UP THE AIRCRAFT'S ENGINES IN ORDER TO CLOSE IN ON THE OBJECT. AS THE AIRCRAFT APPROACHED TO WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 2,000 FEET OF THE OBJECT, IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION, LEAVING NO VAPOR TRAIL.

DURING THE INITIAL OBSERVATION OF THE LIGHT, IT WAS WHITE IN COLOR AND APPEARED TO BE ILLUMINATING OR REFLECTING A BRIGHT LIGHT. THIS OBSERVATION LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS. THE PILOT STATED THAT WHEN HE TURNED THE AIRCRAFT TOWARD THE LIGHT AND SPED UP THE ENGINES, THE LIGHT APPEARED TO DIM SOMEWHAT, INDICATING THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN REACTING TO THE APPROACH OF THE AIRCRAFT. WHEN THE OBJECT ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED, IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH RATE OF SPEED THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

LATER, I OBSERVED A STAR NEAR THE HAZE LAYER, AND ALTHOUGH IT IS LIGHT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, IT IS MY OPINION THAT WHAT I OBSERVED WAS NOT A STAR NOR ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
