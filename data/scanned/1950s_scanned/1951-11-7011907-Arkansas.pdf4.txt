SUBJECT: Aerial Phenomenon
7 November 1951, at 0539 hours the witness, was a 51-year old fishing guide, observed a clear disk-shaped object at 6700 feet altitude.

The witness called the attention of other personnel to the same object. The object was at first stationary, then moved above 23 miles per hour visibility.

The following radio transmissions were used in new broadcasts:
From Station KGHI, at 0748 hours, 7 November 1951.

KXGO on the 1370 Kc frequency reported a similar object was tracked by radar at 0739 hours, 7 November 1951.

All of continuing reports indicate the object was tracked both visually and by radar. The object was observed to be a perfectly flat disk, reflecting sunlight toward the observer. It was moving in a horizontal direction at a high rate of speed. The object at one point changed its course abruptly from 270 degrees to 90 degrees, maintaining its high rate of speed.

It is believed only about 6 minutes of observation elapsed, after which the object completely disappeared, moving too rapidly to be further observed. It is believed to have moved in a northeasterly direction and vanished from the observer's sight.

MHIO on the GTO FM news, "Standby, 7 November 1951":

The U.S. Air Force at Ft. Smith, Arkansas, confirmed the sighting and stated that the object had been tracked on radar. They stated that the object had changed course abruptly and then disappeared.

SUBJECT: This (2) information comes in a report forwarded to Commanding General, A.T.C. No other action contemplated by this office.
