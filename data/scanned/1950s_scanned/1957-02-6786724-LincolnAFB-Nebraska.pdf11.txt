No Case (Information Only)                   21 February 1957     Yokahama, Japan

1957 brought the advent of the so-called "space age" with the Russian launching of its first Sputnik, but 15 other objects were observed on that night. On February 22, another photograph of five glowing objects in flycatching formation was taken. Of these, the Japanese newspaper called the UFO investigation one of the most serious for a long time. UFO investigators regard Japan as an outstanding area, since ten or eleven authentic reports of close UFO-human encounters were received from that location.
