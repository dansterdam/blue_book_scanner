friendly aircraft((or, since they are as yet unidentified, global missiles or space ships from another planet.)

It should be stressed that USAF intelligence has no indications that any foreign nation has a super-weapon capable of flying anywhere in the world at will, nor that craft from outer space are coming near our planet. Even if it should be certain, however, to say that such is happening, no matter how highly improbable it may appear, it would be foolish.

(((The impact of the atom bombs on the entire world is well known, and it immediately posed a problem to any nation that had dreams of conquest. It would seem natural for a nation with the apparent plans of the Soviet Union to use any means possible to negate the leadership strength that possession of the bomb has given the US.))

(( It is possible to suppose that UFSs might be a Soviet propaganda weapon, in which case, they could be either 1) planted false or 2) a clever use of natural phenomena designed to create mass hysteria. If this be true, it has been as miserable a failure as the balloons upon which the Japanese placed so much reliance during World War II.))

(((If UGOs are being used for propaganda, it would be reasonable to assume that the plans would choose sightings that tend to reflect adversely on America's technological capabilities with the appearance of a radically new person, to compensate for the atom bomb. To support this theory, it will be remembered that strange objects appeared over the Scandinavian countries in 1946. The objects observed there were reported to have unusual range and unusual performance characteristics.))
