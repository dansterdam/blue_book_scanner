My name is George Coburn, 41 Main Street, South Boston, Mass., and I'm writing this report on what I observed on the evening of February 6, 1959.

At about 7:30 PM I was alone, looking out the east window of my home, when I saw what appeared to be a large object coming from the northwest, traveling in an easterly direction at a high rate of speed. It appeared to be flat and circular in shape, and had a diameter of approximately 100 feet. It had no visible means of propulsion and made no sound. The object had a series of lights around its perimeter, and the center appeared to be illuminated.

The object passed directly over my house at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet, and then proceeded to disappear from sight in the southeast direction. The entire sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.

I am a serious observer of such phenomena, and I can assure you that what I saw was not an airplane, satellite, or any other known aerial device. I am convinced that what I witnessed was an unidentified flying object of some kind.
