Dear Major Friend:

I think that you and your associates will be amused at the flying saucer report I want to acknowledge - that fairly wide coverage is given this incident since it is related to the idea about its connection with our consulting fee. I wish, however, that all of our cases could be so neatly solved!

I will shortly submit my expenses incurred on the past trip and I hope for your understanding. I will also promise that the consulting fee previously agreed upon between us will now be forthcoming. I think I can keep my records straight, if this is more helpful to you this way. You will hear from me in about a week on this matter.

I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of giving the talk the other day and I am particularly glad we had a two-star General officer in the audience since my acquaintance with those things seems more seriously received, especially by officials of the type to which these guests must be accustomed to seeing - the top echelons of our Armed Forces as the source of such authority and knowledge on these matters, and if we can show them on such occasions the evidently thorough treatment of these things, we lay ourselves open to a greater deal of confidence. It is this that I had hoped you would gain, and even impressed these points so strongly. You will be hearing from me.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek
Associate Director
