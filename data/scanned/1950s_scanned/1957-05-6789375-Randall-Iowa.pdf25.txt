NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

I saw a saucer on April 21, 1957;
Next day I sent the report to the
Air Force in Washington and got no
reply. I would have sent the sight-
ing to you in your first issue but I
did not know there was such a mag-
azine at the time. The time was a-
bout 12:15 P.M. (EST), the sky was
clear so I decided it would be a good
night to look through my telescope.
As I was about to lift my telescope
to look, a saucer appeared right over
me in the eastern sky. The object
was pretty close to me as I could
make it out very well. The saucer 
was lighted yellow, it had a circular
disc with a dome on top. On the 
dome I could see a round window. I
saw no one inside. I sighted it for 
about a half minute when it disap-
peared behind our house (I was 
standing at the side of it). As I could
see it, it was the size of a kite. The
object was heading southwest at a
very fast speed. It did not make any
sound.
