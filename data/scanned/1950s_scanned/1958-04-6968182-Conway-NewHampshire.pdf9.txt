FROM: Weather Bureau Airport Station
Buffalo, New York
SUBJECT: Balloons Released at Approximately 1430EDT 19 April 1958
Reference: AFCIN-4E4 19 April 58 Syracuse Case
Your Dispatch dated May 14, 1958

A check of our records indicates that our only balloon released about this time was a small 100-gram pilot balloon released from our Syracuse or Albany, N.Y. weather station at about 1300EDT.

Large radionde balloons are released from Canadian weather stations such as Toronto and Ottawa, etc. You might contact the Canadian weather service on these. Possibly even some radio wind target devices are released by some of their stations.
