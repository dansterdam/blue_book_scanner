There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image shows only text, which I will proceed to transcribe below.

"It thought it was a 'blowjob' (sic) at first." 
"It had a continuous brightness; no flickering or pulsating."
"I chased it out of sight."
"It made several complete circles. But it seemed to make from, in position, right with me."
"It seemed to be whatever it was, watched my lights, for when I started to change my position, he would go right with me."
"When I contacted Patterson-Hines, I told them of the situation and asked them to watch as I flew over. They said they only saw me. I also asked for my radar position. They told me I was on a NE heading and I was on a SE heading. I corrected them but received no reply."
"There was definite linear movement of the object in relation to my aircraft."
"It is like me, I didn't leave it."
"I contacted a C-47, aircraft S/N 263, I think, that was alerted by Patterson to be on the lookout for the thing. The pilot said he didn't see a thing."
"I knew there was a blowjob up from the 97th somewhere over Columbus."
"There were two other F-51 boys up over Columbus. Before the sighting, I had intended to join formation with them. I believe it was Lt Wallace and Lt Wilmer. When I saw it, I asked Wallace 'Tell you see that blowjob?' He said 'Yes, I see it.'"
