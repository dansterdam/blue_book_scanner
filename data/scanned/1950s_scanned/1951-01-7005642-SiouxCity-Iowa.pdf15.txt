Kearna City, Missouri
28 January 1951
C.I. 23 January 1951. At 2:26 hours, I was piloting a P-51 Gentilen interceptor, callsign to the Sioux City Tower Airport and landed by a forced landing at approximately 3:30 hours. When our aircraft was 48 miles northwest of the field. We were unable to lower the landing gear, and as a result we were forced to make a belly landing. After a thorough inspection, it was determined that the difficulty was caused by a complete failure of the electrical system. The object was reported by the trailing pilot, Ltn. Doyle C Erwin, to be a bright light, approximately 8 to 10 feet in diameter, observed at 3:20 hours, estimated to be 3 to 5 miles ahead of the aircraft.
It was moving in a north-to-south direction at a high rate of speed, estimated to be in excess of 600 mph. The object was sighted out of the corner of the eye and as the object was approached, it suddenly disappeared. No other details could be determined, and there were no indications of any damage or malfunction of the aircraft as a result of the incident. The object appeared to always be under perfect control, and moved at a wide arc around the aircraft and was observed to be gaining in altitude as it moved away. The observer, Ltn. Erwin, stated that it appeared to be "shooting upward" and that it was visible only for perhaps 5-10 seconds.
The tower operators also reported seeing the object as it moved away from the aircraft. I can add nothing further to this report, except that the object appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and changed direction and altitude with ease, which was not characteristic of any known aircraft.
