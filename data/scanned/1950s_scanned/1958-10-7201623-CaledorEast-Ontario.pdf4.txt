The image contains a hand-drawn diagram labeled "The Launcher", showing a side-view profile of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object. The diagram indicates the object's dimensions, with a length of 20' and a height of 10'. There is also handwritten text underneath the diagram that describes the object in further detail.

The text in the document states:

"The shape that is shown in the diagram above is the shape of the object that was seen. The object was about 20 feet long and 10 feet high. It had a dome on top and a bulge on the bottom. The object made a humming sound and gave off a bright light. It hovered over the area for several minutes before speeding off at a high rate of speed."
