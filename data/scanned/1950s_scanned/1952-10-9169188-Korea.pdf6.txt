AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det 3, 502Nth A.I.S., A.P.O. 970  52-376

INTELLIGENCE REPORT 
Incident: Report No. 52-376

1. A military airborne observation of a small airborne object in reference to an incident reported on 12 September 1952. Since the reference points would normally be some distance from the object, and as the vertical angles were apparently quite small, it is very near to the object. Since the reference points would normally be some distance from the object, it is concluded that the object must have been hovering, and to some extent moving in a direction opposite to the relative motion of the observing vehicle.

2. Since enemy balloons are known to have been used in this vicinity, this incident could possibly have been observation of such a balloon. No action was taken.
