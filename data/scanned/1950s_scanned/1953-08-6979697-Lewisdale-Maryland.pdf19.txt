SEPT. 7, 1953 BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
DR. , JR., A BALTIMORE ASTRONOMER, OBSERVED FOUR LARGE LIGHTS AS HE WAS WATCHING A TRANSIT OF THE STAR FORMALHAUT. AT FIRST, "I SAW THEM WITH THE NAKED EYE," HE REPORTED; "THEN IMMEDIATELY OBSERVED THEM THROUGH SEVEN-POWER BINOCULARS. THE LIGHTS MOVED SLOWLY. I COULD SEE THAT THEY CAME FROM THE NOSES OF TWO ENORMOUS OBJECTS WHICH WERE MORE THAN FILLED THE BINOCULARS." I OBSERVED A CABIN IN THE NOSE AND PORTS ON THE SIDES OF THE HULLS IN EACH CRAFT. THE HUGE OBJECTS, DR. _____ STATED, WERE EITHER CIGAR-SHAPED OR CYLINDRICAL.
