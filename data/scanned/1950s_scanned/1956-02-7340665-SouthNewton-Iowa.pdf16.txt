The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a low-flying jet aircraft enveloped in an aura of cloud made by the jet itself. The text below the image provides a detailed description of the "condensation phenomenon" observed, including how the air cools by expansion in the slow-moving boundary layer, the depth of the boundary layer, and the interaction with the low-pressure system. The text also mentions that the image was taken on February 4, 1956, along the coast of Africa near Accra on a morning when the condensation phenomenon occurred several times during the maneuvers.

A low-flying jet, enveloped in an aura of cloud made by the jet itself, can look like a strange object. This condensation phenomenon, called contrails, occurs when areas of low pressure develop on the wing surface; the air cools by expansion in the slowly moving boundary layer in contact with the wing. The depth of the boundary layer and the air pressure depend on the relative speed of the air with the aerodynamic qualities of the wing. An excellent photograph of one such disk produced by a Canberra jet was taken on February 4, 1956, along the coast of Africa near Accra on a morning when the condensation phenomenon occurred several times during the maneuvers. The weather was fine; the air patches of haze over the sea, and visibility was more than eight miles. During the display the air speed of the jet was usually too low or the air too dry for the aura to form. But over the cliff edge where the sea-breeze was just beginning to break through in patches the air would be moist enough to allow the condensation to persist. The effect is increased by higher speeds at the end of a dive (when the angle of incidence of the aerofoil is least) - but it is likely that the patchy onset of the sea-breeze was the most important contributing factor.
