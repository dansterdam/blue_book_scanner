AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

We didn't observe anything that might be described as a "flying saucer". On investigating the object seen in the sky, it was found to be a conventional aircraft, as heard and sighted minutes. We could not account for this object being noticed at all, as it was probably too far away to be seen very well, especially at night. The weather at the time was clear, visibility good, no moon or stars obstructed.

It should be noted that there has been no incident justifying suspicion of a secret weapons research project or the sighting. The object was almost certainly a conventional aircraft.

The incidents occurred on the night of 17 July at the time of the Mauch Chunk incident, which was claimed to have been twelve miles. The weather therefore was the same as observed locally: clear, visibility good, no moon or stars obstructed.

And the existing circumstances do indicate that both reports should be noted and compared, but there is little or no further investigation warranted or considered necessary under the present circumstances.

This opinion is unable to give any explanation for the sighting and remains inconclusive.
