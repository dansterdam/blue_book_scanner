The text in the document reads as follows:

I, 1/Lt H. JONES, 17th VAP Squadron, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, do hereby make the following

ON 28 July 1952 at approximately 1350 MST, as I was going to the WAV 3asebracket for lunch, I observed a luminous object in the sky. They called my attention to it. They had been watching it for some time. The object appeared to be elliptical in shape and seemed to be emitting a blue-green glow. It remained in the same area for several minutes. The object appeared to be approximately 15,000 to 20,000 feet in altitude and was estimated to be moving at a speed 800 to 1,000 miles per hour. There was no sound associated with it in any manner whatsoever. After I had observed it for a while, it started to descend rapidly, and then, it stopped descending and began to ascend again. It appeared to be oscillating up and down for a while. It suddenly appeared to be surrounded by a white glow and then, it stopped descending and began to ascend again. It seemed to disappear completely in a short time. It disappeared completely.
