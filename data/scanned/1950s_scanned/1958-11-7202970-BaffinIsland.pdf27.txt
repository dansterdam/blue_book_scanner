The image contains a handwritten document that appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph or image included in this page of the document.

I am making no excuses for the matter I have received in referring to a club that does not exist. The other boys have not seen through him yet and he has some of them thinking that those men in his plane are something else.

He has called into my house so often that I was about to forget I was a Mother and a lady. I think I have the telephone calls stopped.

The pictures Major is sending to UFOC, and I know to be of USAF, this may have to do with some of another family here and I intend to have a talk with him. 

so far. I have tried to stop him but since he isn't of age, I can only go so far. (I was thinking of a good spanking.)

If you care to look into this matter further, his name, address, and telephone number is listed below:

Mr. 
Newark, Ohio

I talked to a gentleman from O.S.I. and also one from O.I.S. and I was told to write this letter and explain what had happened.  If this letter is not clear, I will answer all questions that I can.

Sincerely,
