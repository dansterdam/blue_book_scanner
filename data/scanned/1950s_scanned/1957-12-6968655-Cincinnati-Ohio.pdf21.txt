The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photograph. Based on the text and information provided in the document, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: Brightest white, light to meet at the center

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label it and include in your sketch any details of the object that you can, such as wings, guidance fins, exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please do not identify any individuals.

Object seemed completely round somewhat like a flat plate or disc. It had no lights or any details that could be told if visible. It moved in a horizontal direction from west to east at a terrific speed. Seemed as enormous as disc ever seen before - true.

18. The edge of the object were: 
a. Clearly outlined
b. Fuzzy or blurred
c. Sharply outlined, circle
d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
