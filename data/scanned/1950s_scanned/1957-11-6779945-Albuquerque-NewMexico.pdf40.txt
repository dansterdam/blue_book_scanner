The UFO appeared visually as a luminous object with a tall or some sort. The pictures, taken at an exposure of five minutes, show an object much longer than it actually was, due to the object's movement during the exposure.

NEWS BRIEFS:

Pieve di Sacco, Italy, - a young pilot named Mario Salviato photographed a flying saucer and one of its occupants. He says he was walking along a country road when a luminous object descended near him, round luminous object with a dome on top. He managed to take four pictures while the man climbed into the saucer and took off. The pictures "are quite sensational" - they show an "egg-shaped" object and a man-like figure. The photos were examined by many experts in Italy and were considered genuine.

Two Texas businessmen claim they saw a fluorescent circular light behind their automobile on the night of February 6th. Near Washington, D.C. on the same night, a couple in an automobile also reported seeing a similar object hovering near their car. The director of the space sciences program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, stated last December "it is increasingly difficult to dismiss UFO reports entirely."

Unidentified flying objects have been sighted by hundreds of persons in the Hawaiian islands. The reports indicate that the objects were traveling at very high altitudes and speeds. The high rate of speed was sighted by hundreds of persons in the Hawaiian islands. The objects were traveling at an estimated altitude of 40,000 feet. Honolulu newspapers and radio stations were flooded with calls from persons who had seen the UFOs. A provision must now be made to plan for the possible creation of "existing and thinking beings" which may soon be discovered by higher-powered telescopes.
