STATEMENT OF
SATSUMA, ALABAMA

On 17 August 1953 at 20:55 PM local time, I was standing near Highway 45 approximately 100 yards south of the Dip Store in Satsuma, Alabama. I was looking for the lights of a commercial airliner which I had observed some time earlier. Suddenly, my attention was attracted to the North to the South at an intense rate of speed and in a vertical direction. It was at a fairly high altitude and traveling in a straight and level flight. There was no sound associated with this flight. It appeared to be a bright reddish glow with the duration of sighting lasting approximately three seconds. I did not hear or see any sign of power or any other disturbance in the area at the time of the sighting.
