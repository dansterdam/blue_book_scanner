HE FELT IT WAS A TOUCH OF MYSTERY WAS ADDED TO THE CRIME BY THE FACT THAT HIS COMPANION WAS OUT FRONT AND DID NOT FEEL IT TOUCH THE CAR EITHER. HE SAID IT JUST HOVERED OVER THE CAR, WAS LOOKED WHEN THE GUARDS RETURNED TO IT, AND THAT A MAN WEARING A UNIFORM SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE GUARDS WAS SEEN LOOKING IN THE CAR.

HE WARNED RUSSIA AGAINST AGGRESSION AND DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL AMERICAN PRISONERS OF WAR ARE RETURNED FROM KOREA.

FOLLOWING THE GENERAL'S SPEECH, THERE WAS A PROLONGED DEMONSTRATION IN HIS HONOR WHICH LASTED ABOUT 30 MINUTES FOR THE COMMOTION TO SUBSIDE.
