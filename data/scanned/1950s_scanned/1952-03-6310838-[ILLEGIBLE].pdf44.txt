AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
1. Information required by ADCOC 200-1, 11 Aug 51:
a. Time and date of sighting: 17:01h, 6 Mar 52.
b. Witnesses description of sighting: "An elongated light, orange in color, was observed at C2252 and at 0115Z but did not make a sharp turn as previously reported. The pilot estimated sightings at C2252 and 0115Z but did not make a sharp turn as previously reported. The pilot estimated sightings at C2252 and 0115Z but did not make a sharp turn as previously reported. The sighting was approximately 45 seconds in each case."
c. Observed visually from F-94H aircraft, speed 350 KTS at 25,500 feet and again at 25,000 feet.
2. a. Course and position: Twenty (20) miles south of Yakima, Washington. Sighting occurred on heading of 350 degrees at 25,500 feet.
b. Weather at point of sighting: 20,000 scattered, 25,000 scattered.
Winds Aloft: 25,000-30,000' - 315° - 52 knots
18,000-25,000' - 315° - 50-100 knots (see sketch)
10,000' - 315° - 40 knots
3. No activity or characteristics or otherwise, which might account for the sightings was reported.
4. a. The interesting aircraft was turned each time toward the object to place it under radar observation, but the radar observer under the hood did not observe the object visually and failed to pick it up on the radar scope.
b. No local aircraft could have accounted for this sighting. Includes closing and opening of landing gear with changes in altitude, as isolated by Radar Observer.
5. COMMENT OF REPORTING OFFICER: For the short period during which the object was observed directly, the pilot states that he has never observed anything close to matching the characteristics of this object. Both the speed and the maneuverability were greatly in excess of any known type of aircraft, particularly at that altitude, where the wind would have been at a position having a magnetic bearing of 150 degrees, and the temperature of the air was approximately -45 degrees Centigrade. According to the Forecast and Warning Service, there were no weather balloons reported in that area and at that time, nor any other type of balloon that could have been observed in that position, but all installations relating weather balloons in this area.
