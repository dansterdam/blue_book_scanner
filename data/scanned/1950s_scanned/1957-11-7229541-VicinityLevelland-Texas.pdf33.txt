LEVELLAND, Tex., Nov. 4 (AP) â€” Hunters and other residents near this West Texas town say they saw a bright, egg-shaped object land in a pasture Sunday night.
 The witnesses said the object was about 200 feet long and about 40 feet thick. It lighted up the area for about 40 minutes, then rose with a sound described as a "whooshing" noise and disappeared, they said.
The incident was reported to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, which is studying the report.
The Texas organization which investigated the incident says the object was sighted by several different persons in two separate areas.
One man, who asked that his name not be used, said he was driving near Levelland when his car stopped, apparently because of some unknown influence of the object. He said he was about 300 feet away from the object when it rose and went away.
Another man, who also asked that his name be withheld, said he stopped his car about 500 feet away from the object until it rose and disappeared.
