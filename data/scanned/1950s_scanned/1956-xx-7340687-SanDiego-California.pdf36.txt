Cit- Here is what was said on the flight. She can do more for me than I can do for her. As she left there were some disturbance and excitement. I saw that she was very beautiful and lovely. Ours are myriads in that. I see that. Near that was a distance from here. I was troubled and I felt that I can be and have been in grave error in the attacks on these objects. They come from other planets. I was awakened and felt that I must on some measure do what I can to clear this up. For this are my sincerest wishes. I must keep this to myself. I'm so glad now I have seen something from other planets and hope, as you put it, that they will be friendly and not destroy us. Do let me know what you think and feel about this. I hope I have not bothered you in this.

P.S. I will see what I can do in tracing this incident.
