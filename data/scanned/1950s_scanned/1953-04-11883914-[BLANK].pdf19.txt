SECTION I 

Tentative Observer's Data Sheet

A completed copy of the Tentative Observer's Data Sheet is
shown in Exhibit I. Two uses for this form are anticipated. First, 
filed sighting reports will be analyzed to extract facts to be entered
on this form for coding. Second, when tests establish the adequacy of
the form, it may be used directly by observers in recording sighting
reports. This latter use will conserve time now expended in extracting
information from the present reports for coding on the punched cards.

Coding Scheme

The coding scheme is illustrated in Exhibit II. This com-
pleted enclosure is to serve as an intermediate between the observer's
report and the punched-card abstract of the facts on the sighting. In
most cases, the facts on the sighting are not entered on the punched
cards directly. In some cases, intervening steps require only coding,
while in others calculations or analyses also may be involved. Prior
to discussing the uses to which the punched cards will be put, it
should be emphasized that the facts represented include:

1. Those presently on the standard form,
2. Those suggested by the Sponsor, and
3. Those suggested by the panel.

As might be expected, many more entries are proposed than have been
used previously.
