I. BRIEF HISTORY.

In the fall of 1947 the United States Air Force took official notice of a rising number of reports of unidentified flying objects. These became popularly known as "flying saucers" because they represented, to the general public, a possible threat to national security and had to be investigated. The Air Force established Project "Sign" to collect and evaluate all UFO sightings.

II. UFO PROGRAM:

1. Determine if these objects constitute a threat to national security.
2. Determine if any scientific and/or technical information was available from the sightings.
3. Identify and/or explain all UFO sightings.

In January 1947 until February 1949, the program was identified as Project "Sign". In December 1948, the name was changed to Project "Grudge". In September 1951, the name was changed to Project "Blue Book".

D. As of 30 June 1959, after 12 years of investigating and analyzing reports, the Air Force has accumulated a file of 12,618 cases. The number of reports received under Project "Blue Book" is increasing. However, the number of sightings over the past three years has been downward. This decline for the period since 1 January 1956, is shown in the statistics for TAS *. Another factor which adds to uncertainty requirements is that individuals frequently neglect to report sightings. And millions have been educated to be alert for the 21c phenomena.
