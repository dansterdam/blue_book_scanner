The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a written document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. 

The text of the document is as follows:

During this time Mr. and Mr. had been drawn to the object. At approximately 0830 Mr. Logan with him by radio and I believe he claimed to have climbed to 12,900 ft, the object at that time from 30,000 to 40,000 ft. Mr. then descended and landed again at Benson.

During this time, and until it disappeared, I kept talking sights of this object and it never moved, the slightest fraction in relation to the canopy of my aircraft, which during this time, had not moved.

At 0914 Mr. who had been an intent observer of this object, walked to a position at the right wing tip. This qualified and took a position at the right wing tip. This qualified and took a position at the flight wing tip. This disappeared from observation in approximately fifteen seconds. When he reached this new position he remarked that the object had disappeared. Two or three of the students had also noticed the object while passing over Benson.

During the time of timed observation, from 0823 to 0914, this object did not change size, position nor intensity and vanished completely in approximately 15 seconds.
