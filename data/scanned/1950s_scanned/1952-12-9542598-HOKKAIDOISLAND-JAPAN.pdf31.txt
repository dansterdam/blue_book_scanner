ON 29 DECEMBER 1954, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM
an unidentified civilian who reported sighting a LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER HOKKAIDO ISLAND, JAPAN. HE STATED HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH AIRCRAFT, AND WAS CERTAIN THIS WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT.
ACCORDING TO HIS DESCRIPTION, THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT 200 YARDS IN DIAMETER (APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF A DC-6), BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR, AND HAD A LIGHT REDDISH GLOW AROUND THE EDGES. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 10,000 FEET ALTITUDE AND WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. HE WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
AT THIS TIME WE OBSERVED ANOTHER OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE MUCH SMALLER (ABOUT 10 YARDS IN DIAMETER), SILVER IN COLOR, AND TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED FROM WEST TO EAST AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 5,000 FEET. THIS SMALLER OBJECT DID NOT HAVE ANY LIGHTS OR GLOW VISIBLE. IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN ABOUT ONE MINUTE.
THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE GOOD. A FEW SCATTERED CLOUDS WERE PRESENT, BUT DID NOT INTERFERE WITH OBSERVATION. THE VISIBILITY WAS GOOD.
THERE WERE NO AIRCRAFT OBSERVED IN THE VICINITY AT THE TIME THESE OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THESE OBJECTS COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT.
