REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN-1AB

SUBJECT: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

TO:    AFCIN-4 (Colonel Dewher)

1. In keeping with a policy of producing the maximum of aerospace intelligence data, AFCIN-1B in December 1959 recommended the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program to AFCIN-4 and Development Command. It was felt that a transfer to a unit with a primary mission to uncover any positive evidence that UFO's constitute a threat to national security would provide greater impetus to the program's scientific and/or technical aspects. ARDC, after reviewing the program, declined to accept the transfer, indicating that the limited data available was not sufficient to warrant their active participation.

2. Since the data available is limited quantitatively, only because of the organization's inability to devote itself completely to the program, it is recommended that the USAF obligations to this program and also to continue monitoring the intelligence activities of the public and the press in this field be transferred to AFCIN-4. This office strongly recommends such a transfer.

3. Draft of ltr to Gen Walsh clearly indicates the benefits which might be derived from such a transfer.

4. If you concur with these suggestions, it is recommended that the steps for the above transfer be authorized and forwarded to AFCIN-4.
