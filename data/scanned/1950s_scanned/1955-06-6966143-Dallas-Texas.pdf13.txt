II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE answered all questions in an informal, conversational manner. The source was cooperative in answering ALL questions.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE INCIDENT:

The initial sighting was on 28 May 1955, 9:30 PM CDT. The object was first observed by the SOURCE's husband as he was returning home from work. He called the SOURCE outside to observe the object. 

The object appeared to be oval in shape and very bright and shiny. The object appeared to be revolving on its axis, which made it hard to estimate its exact size and shape. The revolving action of the object produced a flickering effect making it difficult to determine exactly how high the object was or how far away it was.

The object appeared to be hovering and remained stationary in one spot about 500 yards to the north. During the second and third sightings, the altitude of the object appeared to be lower and seemed to be moving in a westerly direction. On the third sighting, the object appeared to be revolving even faster.
