TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

MARCH 29, 1958 - PONTIAC, ARKANSAS
On the night of March 29, 1958, a 24-year-old man, his younger brother and other friends, drove out from Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, looking for a "flying saucer" with their flashlights. They had sighted a bright object in the sky several days before and wanted to see it again. 

After driving some distance, they spotted a bright, glowing object in the sky a few miles away. It was about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and seemed to be hovering over the ground. As the group approached the object, it started moving. They followed it in their car, shouting at it. The boys were quick, however, and they reached the car ahead of the object. 

When the object came closer, the boys said its hair "stood up on the back" of his head. As it drew nearer, the object appeared to be surrounded by a bluish glow. The object then went behind some trees and the group lost sight of it. After a short while, they spotted the object again, this time moving rapidly through the trees. It disappeared from sight.

The group continued driving, hoping to see the object again. At one point, the road curved toward a hill. As the car climbed the hill, the object was spotted again, hovering just above the treetops. As the car approached, the object shot straight up and disappeared from sight. The group then returned home.
