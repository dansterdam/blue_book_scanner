The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes a celestial time table for July, including the positions and movements of celestial bodies such as the Moon, Venus, and Mars.

Text from the document:

other planets or a star--because it takes up so much space in the sky. There is a lump of dark space between the stars for the planets to move, and not come in front of.
The most unusual event on the celestial program for july is such a planetary occultation. This occurs on the seventh, when Venus occults Regulus, in Leo. This star is at the end of the handle (which is toward the east) of a smaller group, the Sickle, in Leo. It will be a close grazing occultation, visible from the Eastern Standard Time, when Venus is low in the east. Further events, of course, will not have risen.
while Venus is so bright that you can see it in the daytime, if you, know just where to look, you cannot see the star. The phenomenon will be visible in Europe and parts of Asia. It will be darker when it happens.
that even though the actual occultation, it will be interesting to watch Venus before and after the seventh, especially in relation to Regulus. On the evenings of the sixth and sixth, the planet will draw closer and closer to the star; and on the seventh it will have passed it.
