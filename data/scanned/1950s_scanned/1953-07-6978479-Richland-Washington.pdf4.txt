"On the evening of July 3, 1953, while watching the clearance of a rain squall over my backyard and taking a look, my attention opened to about 8 feet. It was very powerful while watching a series of bright lights travel over the treetops. A suddenly spotted the rim of a black surface begin to protrude at the lower left edge of the lights. This rim or black surface was very thin and gave the appearance of some metallic surface. The lights stopped and the object remained motionless for several seconds in this position. It then began to tilt slowly from the original horizontal position to about a 45 degree angle, and then it swiftly accelerated and disappeared from view. The whole observation covered a period of about 1 minute.

I SAW A FLYING SAUCER

Lower edge, but enough was sighted to indicate this was an EXCELLENT description. It was immense! With a sort of glow around the outer edge. I could distinguish the pale black disc was moving along very slowly and smoothly from left to right of the moon so that I was able to take CAREFUL note of its contours. Humps on the outer edge, and these exhaust(?) were moving reciprocally (left to right). As the object righted itself to the direct center of the moon, I was able to detect a thin vapor or dark smoke trailing behind them evaporated into nothingness, just as the exhaust smoke from one of our engines when it is idling."
