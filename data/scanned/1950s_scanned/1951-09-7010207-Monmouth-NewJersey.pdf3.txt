UNCLASSIFIED

For forty-five seconds after the initial sighting, the observer noted the object to be glaring in bright sunlight, hovering almost stationary in mid-air. However, the object then began to make an upward climbing motion and proceeded to rapidly accelerate, gaining altitude until the balloon was silhouetted against the sky. As the object gained speed, a light emanated from it, giving the "illusion of elongation" of the balloon-like shape. This "phenomenon" of balloons is a common occurrence with high-speed observed balloons.

In order to determine the identity of the object, a further check was made by the observers of the balloon release which took place at around 1710 hours the same day. It was found as a result of this investigation that the object had been a balloon and that the motion witnessed was consistent with what could be expected. It cannot be concluded that the object was definitely a balloon.

DETERMINATION OF FORMATION IDENTITY

4. Determination

At the Fort Monmouth Installation, the exhibits in question were made by students. They were taking a meteorological course. The exhibits would not constitute a security violation. The object in question was not definitely determined to be a balloon. The students were maintaining accurate records, but a curator.

While further follow up of this case would be desirable, inasmuch as it is felt that the object observed was in fact a balloon (in view of the information developed subsequently), and that the later acceleration and behavior observed is consistent with the characteristics of a balloon, no further investigation along these lines appears to be warranted. The operator who had more experience than the average student, was making a conscientious effort to determine the identity of the object.
