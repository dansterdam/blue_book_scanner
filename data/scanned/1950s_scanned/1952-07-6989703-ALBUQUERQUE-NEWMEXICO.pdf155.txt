The image contains a photograph of a "flying saucer" that was reportedly photographed on the Miami Beach, Florida. The text describes the event and provides details about the sighting, including the speed and size of the object and the witness's account. The image also includes four smaller views of the object, which appear to be stills from a film taken of the saucer.

Marine Here Snaps 'Disc'
A strange, yellowish object traveling at more than 2,000 m.p.h. was photographed last night by a Marine private from a Miami Beach beach house. The object, it is claimed, was a "flying saucer", approximately 40 feet in diameter.

This 'A Saucer?'
Four views of the "flying saucer" that flashed over Miami Beach last night are reproduced here from the film taken by Marine Pfc. Ralph C. Maycock. The object was disc-shaped, steel-gray in color and was sighted for only three minutes, officials said. They had received permission to make the unusual expose.
