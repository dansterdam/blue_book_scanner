DATE OF REPORT: 9 FEBRUARY 1953
INVESTIGATOR: CAPT WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, USAF

SUMMARY OF REPORT 

1. On 21 JANUARY 1953 at approximately 1935 hours the witness reported observing a luminous, unidentified flying object over the Victorville area. The witness was driving alone on U. S. Highway 66 approximately 3 miles east of Victorville when the object was first observed.

2. The witness described the object as being approximately 30 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and emitting a bright, white light. The object was observed for approximately 3 minutes before it disappeared from view.

3. Weather conditions at the time of the observation were clear, with unlimited ceiling and visibility.

4. The witness was interviewed and provided a statement concerning the details of the observation. The witness appeared to be reliable and was able to provide a detailed description of the object.

5. Upon further analysis, the object was determined to be an aircraft with navigation lights. The bright light and circular appearance of the object were likely due to atmospheric conditions distorting the appearance of the aircraft.
