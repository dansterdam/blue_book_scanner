Gentlemen:

Last April we saw these things just north, 3 miles from Coopersville, Michigan about 4 P.M. They were dazzlingly white and seemed to a farmer when suddenly there we saw 4 of them moving in a group Eastward. As they got past us we could see they were traveling rapidly. There wasn't a cloud in the sky and they shown like jewels silver in color although with a bright sun shining they might have been other color. There was neither smoke, flash, or sound of motors. In five minutes they were out of sight. We could not determine size or altitude. They were traveling globes.

Very truly,
/s/ (signature redacted)
