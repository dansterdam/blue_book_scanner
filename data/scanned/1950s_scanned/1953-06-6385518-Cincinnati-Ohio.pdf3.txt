The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

The text in the document reads as follows:

The object changed color from yellow-white to a brilliant red, and then changed to a brilliant blue. It seemed to come over the observer to a distance of about 900 yards. It made a very gradual climb and seemed to go up in sort of steps, accompanied by a whining noise which seemed to increase in intensity as it climbed. As it moved away, it seemed to be tilted off balance and go into a slight wobble. When over the location, the object appeared to be about the size of a medium sized automobile from the observers point of view. The object was observed by the witness for about 90 seconds. The observation took place at approximately 10:20 p.m. on June 4, 1953. The witness, who was driving a car at the time, is considered to be of sound mind and reliable. This information is submitted for your consideration.
