SUBJECT (U) Review of UFO Photos Obtained by FBI FROM DATE A*0/APCIN-L2A

1. Attached herewith are subject photos and a report regarding the incident.
2. Request your comment concerning the preliminary analysis made by this office, which indicates the following:

a. Source's statement that the camera was not moved does not appear valid: a stationary, time-exposure of the moon would have been shown as one continuous line. Two directions of the moon are indicated on the photograph.

b. Both enlargements show a slender-like item, above and extending outwards from the middle of the object.

c. The object resembles the glass fixtures usually found hanging from ceiling - lighting arrangements.

d. In our opinion, the shutter was tripped sometime before removal of the film, and in some room having the glass fixture. A dark-colored ceiling with a clean or frosted-glass fixture, would result in the fixture being superimposed, with any slender fixture supports and the ceiling blending into the night sky of the original exposure.

1. The comments above are in general agreement with this additional one. The moon path appeared broken both in direction and exposure time. The moon appears as two, possibly three, separate images rather than a single wide line. This shows a lapse of time between separate exposures of possibly 2-3 minutes, a sufficient length of time for removal of the camera, a second superimposed exposure to be made, and the camera replacing to nearly its original position. If the camera had not been moved, the moon path would have appeared as an uninterrupted, wide, nearly straight line.
