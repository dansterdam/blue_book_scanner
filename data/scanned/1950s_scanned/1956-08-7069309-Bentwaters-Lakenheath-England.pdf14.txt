AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DECLASSIFIED BY AUTHORITY OF
DATED 27AUG1956
LOCATION: Bentwaters, England
DATE: 29 August 1956
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects
SUMMARY: 
On the night of 13-14 August 1956, at approximate 2230 hours, unidentified luminous objects were sighted in the sky over RAF Station Bentwaters, England, and RAF Station Lakenheath, England. The objects were tracked on radar by both stations and observed visually by the pilots and ground control personnel. One object in particular was tracked on radar and visually observed descending to a low altitude, hovering briefly, and then accelerating at a high rate of speed. The unidentified objects were also observed and tracked on radar at RAF Station Sculthorpe.
DETAILS: 
At approximately 2230 hours on 13 August 1956, the RAF Radar Station at Bentwaters, England, picked up several unidentified targets on their radar screens. The targets were also observed visually by the pilots and ground control personnel at the station. The radar operators tracked the targets for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, during which time the objects made several abrupt changes in speed and direction. One object in particular was observed descending rapidly to a low altitude, hovering briefly, and then accelerating at a high rate of speed and disappearing from sight.
Simultaneously, the RAF Radar Station at Lakenheath, England, also picked up several unidentified targets on their radar screens. These targets were also visually observed by the pilots and ground control personnel at that station. The radar operators at Lakenheath tracked the objects for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, during which time the objects made several abrupt changes in speed and direction.
The unidentified objects were also observed and tracked on radar at RAF Station Sculthorpe.
The radar operators at all three stations reported that the unidentified targets displayed characteristics that were not consistent with known aircraft. The objects were able to make abrupt changes in speed and direction that were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.
CONCLUSION:
The unidentified objects observed over RAF Stations Bentwaters, Lakenheath, and Sculthorpe on the night of 13-14 August 1956 remain unidentified.
