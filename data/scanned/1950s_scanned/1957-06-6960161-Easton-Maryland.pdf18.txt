Dear Sirs,

I am reporting an incident which occurred here in Easton, Maryland on June 6th, 1957.

On the date mentioned, at approximately 10:15 p.m., I observed a strange light in the sky. This light was unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. It was oblong in shape, with a reddish glow in the center, and surrounded by a blue-white halo. The object appeared to be hovering, and then suddenly shot off at a terrific speed, leaving no trail. I observed this phenomenon for several minutes before it disappeared from sight.

I would appreciate it if you would investigate this incident, as I am quite puzzled by what I saw. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.

Sincerely yours,
