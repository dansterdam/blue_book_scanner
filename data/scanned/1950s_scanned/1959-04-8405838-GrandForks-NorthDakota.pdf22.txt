Dear Mr. Friend, ATIC

23 March 1950

I refer to your telegram dated 17 March 1950 stating that USAF would not send the AF-ID-Report to you at this time as you indicated in your previous correspondence. Regulation 200-2 would prevent release of the findings to the press.

This is a reasonable act and I can assure you that I am limiting distribution only to those directly concerned and officially with the analysis and/or evaluation. Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
