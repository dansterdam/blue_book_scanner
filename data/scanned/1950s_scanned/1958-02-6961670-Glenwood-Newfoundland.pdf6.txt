At 12:40 A.M., 25 February 1958, a call was received from Mr. [REDACTED] at Glenwood, Newfoundland. He reported the sighting of a disc like object falling from the sky and on fire. 

Later during the day Mr. [REDACTED] called and stated he had visited the area where the object had touched landed and found a clearing 1/4 mile by 1000 ft. trees, freshly broken and uprooted, and snow was cleared away in a perfect triangle. The snow was depressed and plowed up at one end. There were no signs of heat or tracks. He also stated that a Mrs. [REDACTED] and her daughter of Glenwood had seen a long, red streak in the sky East of Glenwood at 12:00 midnight. 

Mrs. [REDACTED] was not available for interview, but her daughter, Miss [REDACTED] was questioned concerning their sighting. She described the object as a red light in the East travelling toward Gander. A check disclosed the light was seen in the vicinity of the Trans-Canada highway. There was a snowplow clearing the roads after two days of heavy snowfall, and it is very possible this is what they saw. 

While investigating Mr. [REDACTED] sighting, a call came in from Flight Officer Miller, Duty Controller of the 226th aircraft control and Warning Squadron, at Gander, NEK Newfoundland. He and two other men saw an object on their radar scope on a very erratic course. It disappeared from the scope to the West and they went outside to see if there was anything in the area. Upon further questioning, Flight Officer Miller revealed that, in his opinion, this object was definitely a bright star which appeared to change colors due to the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time.
