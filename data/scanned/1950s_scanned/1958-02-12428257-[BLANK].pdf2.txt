The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memorandum for the Director of Information Services from the Office of the Secretary of the Department of the Air Force in Washington, regarding the McClellan Subcommittee Statement Concerning the Handling of UFO Reports.

The text of the memorandum is as follows:

MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES
SUBJECT: McClellan Subcommittee Statement Concerning Handling of UFO Reports

1. Reference is made to your memorandum of 20 February 1959, subject as above.

2. The reason for the delay in my reply is that considerable exploratory work has been done with the Committee and the staff relative to your suggestion. However, the general attitude of the Committee is that while they feel that it is not necessary to invest further time and money in this area, plus the fact that the Air Force is conducting investigations, they will not make a release to this effect at this time.

3. In cases of this type, we have found that Congressional Committees are not prone to commit themselves in the way you suggest. Therefore, while the Committee's attitude now is that they are not going so far as to commit themselves publicly for it the situation should change at some future date they would not want to be accused of indicating that they had no further interest in the matter.
