"THINGS" THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT

The reader will have noticed that the 1957 sighting wave in the U.S., like the Fall 1954 wave in France, has been marked by numerous reports of landings with little (if any) physical evidence to substantiate the claims. What appears to be a break of continuity since, along with similarities, the stories show differences of unexpected details that tend to confound the student of this phenomenon. We have been told that scores of such incidents have come to light, but have then been suppressed or explained away as illusion, fantasy or downright hoax by the Reverend Albert Bailey of Greenfield, Mass. on his NBC Television broadcast, on Sept. 26. Despite this repetition, such cases about the Potters.

Between 3 a.m. and 3 a.m., the Potters were awakened by a noise like a jet about to land - "but not really like it" - and looking out their bedroom window, they saw a bright light illuminating the corner of their house and then growing dimmer as it rose up over the trees, and they could see three dark figures moving around that "kept bumping up and down". The Potter was called but after watching for a while remarked "after a while, Mr. Potter shouted at the 'things' to go away, and they ran behind the trees". Shortly after this, there was a bright flash about 200 yards behind the house. From the ground at the top of the hill, a "short, stubby object" 40 feet or so in diameter, "was noted as it rose up the hill and then shot up into the sky". In the near morning the Potters found the high grass in the area flattened in a peculiar manner. Several observers told their story, and by its agreement, in all essentials with the tape of the events, it is done, made for CBS.

Mrs. Potter, describes the landing object as a half dome, with a few rows of lighted "square windows" around the lower portion which were of blinding intensity. The figures on the ground - about three or four in number - were humanoid in shape but the faces or other details cannot be ascertained. Reportedly, the bright flash afterwards may have been due to an explosion, a crash landing or perhaps a take-off. This figure must fit into the first paragraph but carefully avoid naming or identifying any individuals. Refrain from stating anything that may identify the specific individuals involved.
