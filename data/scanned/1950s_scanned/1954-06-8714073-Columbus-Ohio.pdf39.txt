There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, containing text and a hand-drawn diagram or sketch.

The text output from the OCR is as follows:

The other person to see this object was a co-worker;
Dr. __, Columbus, Ohio.

We are not related. At work Monday June 28 the mentioned that I had seen a bright light in the sky. He said that he had also seen the same light. I do not really recall clearly seeing the light, but he said that he has seen an object which he described as "a brilliant light, larger than a star, shaped like a cigar or egg and having a bluish color." The object was seen by him on the way to his house on the main road, more than twice the size of the moon, and this lasted for approximately 30 seconds. I also judged it's size to be similar to a football and all was over almost as soon as it began. Neither of us saw anything more than the object which I believe resembled the one I saw in the afternoon last March 21 as I was driving home from work. I told him that the same or a similar object was seen by me one afternoon last March 21 as I was driving home from work.

This statement, and the diagram that is included, appear to be part of a larger Project Blue Book document related to a UFO sighting report from the Columbus, Ohio area in 1954.
