The Killian Case
The most famous UFO sighting of this type is the Killian case. On the evening of February 24, 1953, an American Airlines plane was taking off from Seward Air Force Base near Detroit. At about 5:45 p.m., when the plane was climbing to 1,800 feet, Rennebohn, the pilot, Captain Killian, noticed a strange light in the sky. There seemed to be three, their colors changing from yellow to their coming and brightening in intensity and shifting their relative positions. At first he supposed it was looking at the constellation Orion, for the lights had the same configuration as the stars in Orion's "belt", but when the lights changed position and he could see distant in addition to the lights, he discarded his first theory. He considered the possibility of a jet tanker refueling, but he couldn't think of any ordinary explanation- - but he had long wondered what truth there was in the idea of flying saucers and had thought "there must be something to it". Over the loud speaker he remarked to the passengers that American Airlines planes were looking at a strange light. He continued to watch the lights as he flew west toward Detroit, and noticed two other American Airlines planes in the area. Learning that their pilots were also watching the unusual spectacle, he notified Air Traffic Control (ATC) in Detroit. The lights remained in view for about forty minutes.
