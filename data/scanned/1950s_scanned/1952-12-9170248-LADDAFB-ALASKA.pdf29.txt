PROBLEM: To obtain additional information on the reporting of contraril sightings in Greenland 10 and 12 December 1952.

FACTS AND DISCUSSION:

1. Received message AFIN 27501 which was garbled, AFIN 27525 dtd 10 Dec 52 was corrected copy. These were followed by AFIN 27571 confirming cable (from Quartermaster A73 Greenland).

3. Received AFIN 28916 dated 12 Dec 52 (from Harrarassauk AD Greenland).

4. Cables received 10 Dec indicated contraril heading of 360Â° which would indicate aircraft sighting progressing towards the U.S.

5. Cable received 12 Dec contained insufficient information to make a conclusive evaluation. However it was stated Canadian aircraft could have been involved. The time group stated in this cable are correct. Navy Air Greenland to investigate if it could have been one of their aircraft.

6. The Commanding FEAF obtained information that three P-86s landed at Harrarassauk at 1450 Zulu, 12 Dec on a classified mission. There is a possibility that this aircraft could have been responsible for the reported contraril due to a discrepancy in the reported time.

7. That between 1200 and 1300 Zulu, 12 Dec, the visibility was 15 miles and the ceilings and from 1300 to 1800 Zulu 16/10ths stratus cumulus. While it is possible that contraril could have been seen below the over-cast by these ground observers, it is certain that the aircraft could not have been more than 15 miles away and possibly much closer. Further this contraril could not have been observed except by visual observers that it is questionable.

8. The provisions of paragraph 203 of JANAP 146 B were only partially complied with in Cable 27571 from Sonderstrom AFB. Cable 29916 from Harrarassauk does not fall into a CIRVIS category since it was not observed from the air. The information required in the case of CIRVIS incidents should have been reported.

10. Cable 28916 from Harrarassauk indicates that the cable was processed and dispatch at 1300 Zulu reporting the condition of contraril sighting. This would not allow the 1400 Zulu time reported for preparation and time of sighting indicates either a cable or typographical error either in time or date. The fact that both preparation and time of sighting are within 1 hour of the dispatch time indicates a questionable validity within the report.
