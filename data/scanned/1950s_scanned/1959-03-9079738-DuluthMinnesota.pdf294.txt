THE REPORT I SUBMITTED HERE CONTAINS A NEW PIECE OF INFORMATION WHICH I FEEL HAS SOME SIGNIFICANCE. LAST EVENING, MARCH 6, 1959, ABOUT 8:00 P.M., I OBSERVED AN UNUSUAL LIGHT IN THE SKY WHICH I CANNOT READILY EXPLAIN. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED IN THE NORTH, APPROXIMATELY 40-45 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT APPEARED TO BE A VERY BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO BE STATIONARY. AS I WATCHED IT, HOWEVER, IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST. IT CONTINUED THIS WESTWARD MOVEMENT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN ABRUPTLY CHANGED DIRECTION AND HEADED NORTH. IT CONTINUED THIS NORTHWARD MOVEMENT FOR PERHAPS A MINUTE OR TWO, THEN ABRUPTLY TURNED AND SPED AWAY TO THE NORTHEAST AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED, DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A FEW SECONDS. DURING THE TIME I OBSERVED THE OBJECT, IT APPEARED TO CHANGE DIRECTION ABRUPTLY ON AT LEAST THREE OCCASIONS. WHILE MOVING, IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE BLINKING OR PULSATING IN ANY WAY. IT SIMPLY CHANGED DIRECTION IN A VERY RAPID, ABRUPT MANNER WHICH I FOUND QUITE UNUSUAL. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER OBSERVED ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THE SKY, AND I CAN OFFER NO EXPLANATION FOR WHAT I SAW. I AM A SOMEWHAT EXPERIENCED OBSERVER OF THE NIGHT SKY, AND I AM QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES, AND ASTRONOMICAL OBJECTS. WHATEVER I SAW LAST NIGHT DID NOT CONFORM TO MY KNOWLEDGE OF ANY OF THESE FAMILIAR OBJECTS. I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE IN THE DULUTH AREA OBSERVED A SIMILAR OBJECT LAST EVENING. IF SO, I WOULD APPRECIATE LEARNING OF THEIR OBSERVATIONS AND ANY CONCLUSIONS THEY MAY HAVE REACHED AS TO THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REPORT.
