NO CASE (Information Only) 1 December 1958 (Saucer News) Southern California

FOUR LOS ANGELES PASSENGERS driving toward San Bernardino at about 8:30 p.m., Dec. 12, 1957, saw four objects in the sky. The objects were traveling at a high rate of speed and "zig-zagging" erratically, according to the report. The objects were estimated to be about 60 feet in diameter and were described as appearing to have a "soft yellow light" around their rims. The objects were observed for about 3 to 5 minutes and then disappeared. The car was traveling at about 55 miles along the highway before it finally disappeared. The witnesses became somewhat apprehensive and believed the objects might have been following them but they could not be certain of this. One of the passengers said one of the objects seemed to stop and hover momentarily as if observing the car. The color and behavior of the objects led the witnesses to believe they were not conventional aircraft. NOTHING CONCLUSIVE.
