The image appears to contain two sketches. The larger sketch shows a curved horizon line with an object above it, and instructions for the viewer to imagine that the object was first seen at position "A" on the curved line, and then later seen at position "B" on the same line. The smaller sketches on the right depict a winding road passing through a mountainous landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. 

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
