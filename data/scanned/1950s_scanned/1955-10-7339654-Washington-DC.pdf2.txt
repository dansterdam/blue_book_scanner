COMMENTS: The report contains a detailed account of a sighting over the Dayton, Ohio area. The witness, a male, was driving along Hoover Park, Dayton, Ohio, at approximately 11:20 PM EST, when he observed a very bright object hovering at about 35 to 40 feet above the ground. The object, circular in shape, appeared to be about 25 to 30 feet in diameter and was giving off a brilliant white glow. It remained stationary for a few minutes, then rose at a slight angle, accelerated rapidly, and disappeared from view in a northeasterly direction. The witness stated that the object made no sound and that there were no exhaust fumes or flames visible. The witness seemed reliable and apparently had no reason to fabricate his story.
