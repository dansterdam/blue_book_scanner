The image on this page of the Project Blue Book report contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the top shows an object in the sky above a landscape, with a curved line indicating the object's trajectory. The smaller sketches on the bottom show a person's view of the object from different angles, labeled "A" and "B".

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline). Then, place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object got later on. Now, sketch in quickly how the object looked to you.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
