The image contains three sketches or illustrations, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" to demonstrate how high an object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second and third sketches depict larger views of what the observer saw, with a person standing on a road in the second sketch and a simple landscape with a curved sky in the third sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
