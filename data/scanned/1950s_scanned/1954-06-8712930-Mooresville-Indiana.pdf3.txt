Gentlemen:

During June 1954, I took two pictures of an unknown flying object, one with a regular Kodak camera and the other with a camera with a telescopic lens. I sent the photographic to be developed, they could not develop them but returned the negatives to me.

I misplaced them and again found them last month (April) and thought that you would be interested in seeing them.

I would be pleased if you would kindly send back the pictures and any reports or records on the sightings of flying saucers that you could give me.

THANK YOU
