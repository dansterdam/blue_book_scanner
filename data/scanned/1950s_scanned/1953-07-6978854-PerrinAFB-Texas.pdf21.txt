AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PAGE 1 OF PAGES

This is a project in my behalf and viewed them twice. (2) was a fairly light or illuminous object, appear as a (3) bright like a star, blue-white in color, about (4) 2-3 miuntes. 
(5) unknown. (6) estimated size of a large aircraft, varying somewhat in intensity at times. The shape appeared to be circular or elliptical at time and length. (7) Visible in (8) 30 to 40 eeconds and disappeared to the north or northeast,, the object did not leave any smoke, trail, exhaust or other visible evidence of propulsion. It moved at a very rapid speed, estimated to be several hundred miles per hour. The officer (9) spotlighted, tried to get a telescopic look at it, but was unable to do so. 
(10) unknown. The air police said they observed the same type of object on several occasions. (11) unknown.
The object appeared to be under intelligent control as the changes in size, speed, and direction indicated. They were unable to determine the distance, altitude or rate of speed other than it was obviously very fast. The object did not show any conventional wings, tail surfaces or other identifiable features of an aircraft. They believe the object was powered by some unconventional type of propulsion system. They were unable to specify whether the light was reflection of some kind or an actual light source. They are definite however, that the object they observed was not a star, planet, meteor, aircraft or any conventional type of flying object known to them.
