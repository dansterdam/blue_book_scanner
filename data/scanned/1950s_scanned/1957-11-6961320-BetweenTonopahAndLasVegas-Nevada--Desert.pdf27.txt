The image contains a photograph of an unclassified object, which appears to be a document from Project Blue Book containing a report of a UFO incident near Tonopah, Nevada.

The text in the document is as follows:

SUMMARY OF TONOPAH, NEVADA UFO INCIDENT FOR GENERAL MASON

Priority report received on 24 November 1957 that an Air Force pilot had encountered four (4) so-called "flying saucers" early in the morning or 26 November 1957. West of Tonopah, Nevada, he observed it closely; in fact, approached within 50 feet of the object before it disappeared.

Numerous UFO reports from pilots and aircrews during the last ten (10) years have observed in the air, this no instance knows of any "contacts" by otherwise qualified military personnel. Headquarters ATC was requested to make immediate full-dress investigation, and reports to ATIC in detail.

3. A review and evaluation of this report indicated the following:

a. Officer had a background and studies in Speech, and related subjects for TV work.
b. Was familiar with names of well-known science-fiction and "flying saucer" writers.
c. Advanced the same classic arguments of "saucer" believers that objects were space ships, 1.e., did not resemble any known military or civilian aircraft.
d. He is a reserve officer, with the possibility that he may complete his tour of duty with the Air Force in the very near future, and would probably enter into TV work.
e. He just completed the very rigid USAF Survival Course at Stead AFB the day before, last immediately, and drove all night enroute to Las Vegas.

4. Checks during no ICBM or other unusual objects from radar, GCI, military and civil flight and other operations from that area. No reports from any other persons in that locality.

5. ATIC evaluation: (A) Probably mistook conventional objects because of fatigue from driving all night and the mental strain from the recent completion of survival course, coupled with his imagination of well-known "saucer' writers; or (B) a deliberate hoax.
