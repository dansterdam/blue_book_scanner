Plane Firm Tests
"Flying Saucer"

      EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
Calif., Aug. 8—(UP)—The United
States' first official "flying sau-
cer," a plane with a huge, discus-
shaped structure spreading over it
like a parasol, underwent its first
flight test today with "definite
success."
      The plane, built by Lockheed
Aircraft, was described as resem-
bling a flying saucer that has cap-
tured 50 airplane. It was built
for the Navy to test advanced
ideas in flying radar stations.
      The new "flying flapjack" craft 
is a Navy WV-2 Super Con-
stellation powered by four turbo-com-
pound piston engines. Its overhead 
disc, measuring more than 30 feet 
across, actually is a radome that 
houses distance-determining radar
antennas.
