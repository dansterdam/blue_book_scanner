Transcription of text within the image:
"I saw an object that appeared to be a fairly large, round, silver colored object with red lights around its edge. This object was just above the mountains and travelling in a NW direction. It was moving rather fast and seemed to be at an altitude of about 1500 to 2000 feet. It only visible for about 60 seconds before it disappeared behind the mountains. It was a clear night and visibility was good. I was not able to take any pictures as this was a spur of the moment observation."
