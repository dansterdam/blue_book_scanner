The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The document contains rows of data with various columns, including categories such as "Location", "Date", "Time", "Shape", "Size", "Duration", "Direction of Movement", and others. The data appears to be a tabular summary of information related to reported UFO sightings or incidents.
