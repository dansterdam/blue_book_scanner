"Not on the report made up this morning for the newspapers and radio. The man at the airbase said this was on the report, but it wasn't. It seems this aircraft made a turn away from the airbase and that there were two craft together for about 10 minutes, and then one of them split off and went in a different direction. I want to get the facts as accurate as possible, as I don't want to get anything confused. I have 5 or 6 signed reports on this sighting. It happened at 11:35 pm and from the description it was quite an unusual sighting. I will know more about it as soon as I can talk to the man who phoned this in. I believe this was recorded on the radar at the airbase, but I don't have confirmation of that yet. The same general description."
