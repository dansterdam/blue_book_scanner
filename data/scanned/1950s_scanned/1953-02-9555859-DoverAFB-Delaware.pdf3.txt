2 March 1953

On the nights of February 27th and 28th, 1953, I observed an unidentified object in the sky at approximately 21.20 hours.

The object appeared to be stationary in the sky and its approximate position was north-north west. It was approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.

As I continued to watch the object, it changed colors. When first observed it was a bright red. It then changed from red to white to yellow to green. It repeated this changing of colors but in no particular pattern.

On observing it for about ten minutes it started to recede on a north-north west course and appeared to lose altitude.

I watched it for about ten minutes more, after which time it was lost to sight over the horizon.

On the night of February 28th, its' actions were the same as the previous night except in the last ten minutes of its' occurrence it swerved out of its' course by approximately 15 degrees in less than 5 seconds. It swerved onto its original course with the same speed and disappeared over the horizon.
