5 January 1959

Dear Mr. [redacted],

I am returning herewith your 35 mm color slide which you thought show an unidentified flying object.

The red dot was determined by the Air Technical Intelligence Center photo lab people to be a presentation of one or two layers of emulsion. If the slide is held at an angle to a light source, a small size with a pit at the center can then be seen.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
