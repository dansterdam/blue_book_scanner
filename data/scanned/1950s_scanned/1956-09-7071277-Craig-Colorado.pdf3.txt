The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report about an unidentified object seen over Craig, Colorado on September 26, 1956.

The text in the document is as follows:

On the morning of 26 Sep 56, the undersigned interviewed Mr. [redacted], and his wife Mrs. [redacted], regarding a report of an unidentified object seen moving over the Craig area the evening of 26 September 1956.

The object is described as a string of lights, approximately ten, preceded by three or four lights, smaller and immediately above and slightly ahead of the others. These lights were uniform in distance, and appeared to be similar to a string of cabin lights on a modern passenger a/c as seen from the ground.

Description would seem to follow the folgr diagram:

The shape and color of the object are unknown. It was dark at the time of sighting. No other lights were sighted, so it is not known if the object had wings or tail structure. No smoke or vapor trail was seen, also because of darkness.

The lights were first sighted by Mr. [redacted] as he was climbing the outside stairs to his second floor apartment in down town Craig. He said his attention was first called to the object when a bright flash in the sky caught his eye. He then watched the lights move from a point approximately one mile directly north of Craig south east till it passed out of sight, to the south east.

Approximate speed of the object was 85 to 100 MPH. As the object flew by, a bright light similar to a carbon arc light began flashing on and off. In appearance it looked much like an airplane beacon flashing. It continued till object was gone.

At no time during the observation was any sound heard. Which would seem to indicate it was an aircraft carrying no engine noise or any other like sound.
