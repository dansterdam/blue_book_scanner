Rough DRAFT

Cincinnati 27, Ohio
Dear Sir,

The material which you submitted to us will on 12 October 1955 for study and analysis is herewith returned.

A thorough, critical analysis has been carried out on the material submitted, and some identification of the material fragaents, and some classification of the physical characteristics of the material.

The results of an analysis of this material which, incidentally or by implication, you appear to be of some extra-terrestrial origin, as in the case of the "metal fragments" included from a "flying saucer", is summarized as follows:

a. All material submitted is "man-made" or "man-fabricated."
b. Samples were examined microscopically, chemically and spectrographically.
c. None samples:
All four samples were found to be ferrous-chromium and magnetic and not radioactive. The composition obtained for these samples was:
Chromium 6 - 7% 
Nickel 0.4 - 0.6%
Fe. Co. 3 N
Mn. Si. 0.5 All

The crystalline structure and non-oxidized condition of these samples points directly to the fact that a high-temperature such as would be encountered by one of current origin has not been imparted. Both the coarse appearance and the analysis of these samples strongly suggest that they have come from the site of either a small mill or steel foundry where calcium in this form is customarily added to steel melts.
