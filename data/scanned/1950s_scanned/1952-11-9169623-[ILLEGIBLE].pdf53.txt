The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Nature of File Per Request of Mr. [REDACTED]
Air Force Press Desk 
ATTN: Lt White
Directorate of Intelligence, DCS/O

1. Attached is a roll of film that was requested by your office that could be retained for possible analysis. The following analysis may be used if you desire in your answer letter.

2. The Air Force does not attach significance to these pictures because:
a. Only a few frames contain anything that is discernible.
b. No movement of any object could be seen.
c. On the frames that something could be seen there were two blobs of bright lights, apparently reflected from the sun. In that the glass were taken on a sunny day, the sun, its reflection could not always be avoided. Sometimes called "mock sun" or "sun dog".
