The text transcribed from the document is as follows:

"This would seem to be an unusual request of an unusual nature. Are there any facts or intelligence available which would indicate that this request should be granted? The report indicates that he has information which he feels may be of considerable value. However, no details are given as to the nature of this information. Do you feel that if this information is actually of value, the only way it can be obtained is by granting the request for reimbursement of expenses? I am somewhat hesitant to recommend granting this request without knowing more details as to the nature of the information which he claims to have. Perhaps it would be advisable to have him submit a more detailed outline of the information he claims to have, and the reasons why he feels it is of value, before making a decision on his request. I would appreciate your views on this matter."
