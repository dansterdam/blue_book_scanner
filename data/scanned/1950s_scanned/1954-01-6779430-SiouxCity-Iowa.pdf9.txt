Dear Sir:

It has come to my attention that around 2 to 4 January 2, 1954, your trainee or jet craft were seen criss crossed for four consecutive hours at Knoxville, Tennessee, apparently in pursuit of a U.F.O./U.A.O. over that vicinity.

It is my objective to learn the reason for this unusual maneuver. Very often these jet craft in pursuit of a U.F.O./U.A.O. as so, can you inform me of the circumstances, location, and possible identification, including speed, color, of said U.F.O./U.A.O.?

If, for any reason, you cannot give me the requested information for classification/ security restrictions, please forward this missile to the proper authority.

Thank you for your kind cooperation in this matter.

President
