Blinding "Flying Saucer" Stops Texas Motorcars
Levelland, Tex. (UP) - Mysterious objects sighted over this area Friday night and early yesterday morning are reported to have stalled the engines of several automobiles.
James A. Ross, chief deputy sheriff of Abilene, Tex., said he received a report of the sightings in the vicinity of Levelland and plans to send investigators to check the reports.
The object was also reported in the vicinity of Clovis, N.M.
SHERIFF Wier Clem and Deputy Sheriff Pat Naoum, who went out to investigate the reports, said the "most graphic description" they received was from a motorist near Levelland.
The motorist said he was driving along a highway about 70 miles northwest of Levelland when he saw a bright light in the sky. He stopped his car when the object, which he described as a "blinding, brilliant light," came down close to the highway. The object, he said, stalled his motor, and after a few minutes rose straight up and disappeared.
Another motorist, the report said, told a similar story. He said the object "looked like a brilliant star" and that when it came close to his car, his motor "died." He said it remained near his vehicle "for two or three minutes" before shooting straight up and disappearing.
