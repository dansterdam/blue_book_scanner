There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document.

Dear Sirs: - In my own way I will try to explain. And as to the data you see - I was not sure as to just what facts to tell. I saw something in the sky. But as to the time it happened and the direction it was traveling, I am sure as to what I saw down as described. About 11:30 p.m. on May 21, 1952, I was ready to retire. I looked out the window and saw a strange bright light moving rapidly in an east to west direction. It appeared to be larger than a star and brighter. It moved very rapidly and then seemed to stop, then suddenly it disappeared and then reappeared again, repeating this several times. I watched it for about 2 or 3 minutes. It was a clear night and I could see the stars very well. I watched the strange light until it disappeared completely. I would be glad to discuss this further if you have any other questions. I looked at the time and noticed it was 11:35 p.m. when the object disappeared.
