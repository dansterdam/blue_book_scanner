At approx 1855 hrs on 15 Nov 1957, I was informed by the guarding Mackay CQ, CO Code 04 that a larger than average white light was observed to the east and that it was moving west. I went to take a look at this object. This object was moving west and appeared to be at an altitude of 400 to 600 feet. It was a large round white light, that gave off a steady glow. Also, there were blue, green, orange lights around the object, they were flashing intermittently. This object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. I could not determine the exact size or shape of the object, because of the intensity of the light. The object then turned and proceeded in a north easterly direction and disappeared from sight.
