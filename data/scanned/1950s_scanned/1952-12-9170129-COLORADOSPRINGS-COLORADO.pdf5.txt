The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved line and instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on it to show how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch contains two smaller sketches - one showing a person on a road and another showing a person with a curved horizon in the background.

Transcribed text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
