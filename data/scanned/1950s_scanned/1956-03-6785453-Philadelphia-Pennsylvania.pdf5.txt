SEE SAUCER FROM ONLY TEN FEET AWAY: A laboratory technician named James Bassette, a resident of Lansing, Michigan, claims to have seen a "flying saucer" from a distance of only ten feet while walking along the Sycamore River. He reports that it was hovering about four feet above the ground on the edge of the Grand River, near the Waverly Road bridge. His attention was drawn to a "tiny object" which appeared to be tumbling or rotating. As he approached it, the object rose up from the ground and came down upon him at an angle. He was an average-sized man but he said the object appeared to be at least eight feet in diameter and was shaped like a flattened bowl. It made no sound and as it came toward him, it seemed to be luminous. He estimated it was about four feet in diameter. He said he became frightened and hurried away. He ran about four feet from where he first observed the object and heard about four faint ticking sounds coming from the direction of the object, but all contact or experience ended as he rushed about 25 yards from the scene. He claims the object then silently moved away and disappeared.
