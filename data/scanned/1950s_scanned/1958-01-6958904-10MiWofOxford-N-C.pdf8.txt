The OBJECT was sighted by an employee for Pine State Dairy, Oxford, N.C. as it started. The illuminated object came down and it landed approximately 200 hundred yards in front of him and one hundred feet off the ground.
He watched the milk truck and watched the object move from his left to the right about five or six miles before it came to a halt. It then went into OXFO, N.C. and reported the illuminated object was 100 to 200 yards above the Oxford radio tower and moving towards Henderson, N.C. The officers stated that it appeared to move about one or two feet at a time, then it moved back towards them slowly while still spinning.
The officers state that they had to make their rounds down town and would observe the object later. Upon arriving again upon the scene it was high and still moving west to east.
Sergeant XXXXX, Oxford, N.C. stated that he observed the object roughly seven or eight hundred feet off the ground.
Charles XXXXX, Durham, N.C.
Mr. XXXXX who was notified by Sergeant XXXXX of the Oxford Police, stated that he interviewed many persons on the scene who had observed the object. He stated that he was only a bright star in the east.
Mr. XXXXX and Mrs. XXXXX concurred with Mr. XXXXX.
In the opinion of this organization, object sighted was the planet Venus.
