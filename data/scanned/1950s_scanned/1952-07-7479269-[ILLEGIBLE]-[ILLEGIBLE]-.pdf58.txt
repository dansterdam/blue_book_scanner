The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a set of sketches and instructions related to a UFO sighting report. The instructions ask the reader to label the apparent position of the object when first seen and at the last point seen, as well as to trace the apparent path of the object between those points. The sketch labeled "Sketch B" shows a diagram with the horizon, observer's position, and overhead labels. The sketch labeled "Sketch C" shows the observed features of the object, such as its apparent shape, direction of motion, and other details. The sketch labeled "Sketch D" shows the apparent size of the object relative to the sun and moon.

18. On the following Sketch B, label a at the apparent position of the object when first seen and b at point last seen. Trace the apparent path of the object between points a and b.
If possible label 1, 2, 3, etc., along the traced path to show the successive positions of the object after equal intervals of time during the sighting.
19. In Sketch C please show the observed features of the object such as:
A. Apparent shape, (were edges pointed or rounded),
B. Apparent direction of motion (show by arrow), and
C. Other details, exhaust, trails, tail, surfaces, etc.
20. The sun and the moon are shown below as they appear in their correct relative size. In this sketch D, show the apparent size of what you saw.
