Dear Sir:

I embarked on the Cunard Liner Caronia at South-hampton, England, on September 30, 1952. 

On October 5, 1952, at 5:12 p.m., time of the local longitude, I was standing on the starboard side of the ship by the swimming pool on the deck which is immediately above the promenade deck. This deck is perhaps twelve feet above the promenade deck, and there is an offset in the ship at that point so that it was perhaps fifteen feet inboard from the starboard side of the ship. While standing there with my wife, I noticed a group of people below me, also on the starboard side and perhaps forty feet away, standing immediately under the starboard wing or the stern-bridge of the ship, and staring off at some object in the air on the starboard side.

One of the individuals had a pair of glasses. I was curious to know what they were looking at, so I began to look in the sky.
