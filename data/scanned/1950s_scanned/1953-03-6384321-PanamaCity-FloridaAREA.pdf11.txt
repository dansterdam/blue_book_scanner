Unidentified Flying Object Report (INTERIM*)
LOCATION: Panama City , F1or1d.a
date of observation: 25 March 1953
date of report: 25 March 1953
TIME: 6:50 P.M. OFF. Tyndall AFB, Florida

OCCUPATION: housewife
SUMMARY: (Ose concise summary of report, including observations, actions taken, and conclusions)
On 25 March 1953, Mrs. Hopkins observed one (1) unidentified flying object which was circular and silvery, and hovered over Panama City. This was the only one who reported this event, and her observation was made from inside her house looking out the window. Since the object was quite low, Mrs. Hopkins could not determine the distance or the size.
COMMENT BY THE PREPARING OFFICER: Since there were a minimum of thirty (30) jet aircraft simulating low altitude flights in the general vicinity of Panama City at the time of the observation, this object could have been the reflection of a jet observer station that possibility.
