Those Little Spacemen Didn't Appear Yesterday
Some local residents, including photographers, scanned the skies all day yesterday in hopes of seeing the silver cigar-shaped object reported over Brush Creek at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. 
Those interested in the sighting, including Black and Van Allen, said when interviewed the "occupants" before jumping into the saucer were about four feet tall in height, and that a little man about three and a half feet in height and two other occupants in the saucer. Then the "saucer" took off, without a sound.
It was far above as the function of the
ARD showed it was accelerating rapidly. As they lifted up, it appeared to turn on its edge.
