The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document discussing the observation of an unidentified flying object.

the object appeared to be composed of an extremely bright light, and it was very similar to a star, although it was not stationary. it varied in intensity from time to time, from a position above the main body of the object and its variations in intensity or pulsation by the object itself.

the object maneuvered to the west of us at all times during the period of observation. its most significant characteristic was the diminishing and increasing in size and shape with the main body appearing to be oval in shape with a lower protrusion also oval which appeared to be similar to a searchlight. the object changed hue from time to time, and the variation in intensity of the overall illumination, in other words when the object turned toward us, the brilliant portion was visible.

there were two distinct or pulsating lights just above the main oval that at times appeared red and green.

the object went through three types of maneuvers - altitude changes, horizontal changes, and oscillating or rocking motions. the horizontal speed was roughly estimated in excess of 1000 miles per hour. the distance of the object from the aircraft ranged from a roughly estimated 50 to 150 miles.

the object appeared to hover, change altitude and move horizontally, constantly unlike any aeronautical device known to this observer. in appearance, it most closely resembled a large dirigible that has been brightly illuminated.

the red and green lights mentioned above lead this observer to believe that the object was man-made and the manner in which it maneuvered definitely established that the object was controlled.
