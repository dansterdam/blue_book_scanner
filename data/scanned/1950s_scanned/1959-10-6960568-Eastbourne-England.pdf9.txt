I share a dog photograph of it and the negative of the photograph.

Sir, if you wanted the negative I will you send to copy in have and take some measure to send to me about the photograph and what I do to you could help me in the terms I ask for.

The letter I have wrote was not and on your own and I beg you must not say what I could to tell.
I am very sorry.
