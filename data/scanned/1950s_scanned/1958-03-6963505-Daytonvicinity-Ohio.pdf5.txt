"UFO Scare Here
Blamed on Venus
By OLIVER W. BROWN, JR.
DAYTON (sic) STAFF WRITER
Dayton today had its own "flying saucer" which a local scientist said was merely Venus and was not unidentified.
The object, variously described as green, yellow, red, white and blue, startled many Daytonians for a short time this morning.
This morning's phenomenon was reported by Dayton police, the State Highway Patrol and the Air Force to the control center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
A Guard at the Mound lab in Miamisburg watched it through binoculars and called it to the attention of his associates.
"It's so prominent, it looks like a search light on an airplane," he told the others. "Its now appearing for enough away from the sun that it's visible for two hours or so before sunrise."
Kenneth Kissell, a scientist, said he was observing the same object through his telescope Wednesday night and identified it as the planet Venus.
