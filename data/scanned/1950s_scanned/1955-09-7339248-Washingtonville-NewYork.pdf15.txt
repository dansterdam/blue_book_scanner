SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS

1. To corroborate the statements made by pilots of Colonial Airlines, a follow-up investigation was conducted at Poughkeepsie, New York. The following agencies, however, did not observe the sightings reported by the pilots:
a. City Police Department
b. Civil Defense (CDC)
c. Civil Aeronautics Administration 
d. Vassar College Observatory
e. Mid-Hudson Bridge Authorities

2. A check with D/I, RADC did result in the report of an object sighted by two residents of Washingtonville, New York, approximately two (2) minutes after the sighting reported by Colonial Airlines. The similarity in description and time interval possibly identifies the object, however, the ground observers could not actually observe the path of the object.

3. A check with Capt. Wm. K. Stewart, Air Force Base at Poughkeepsie, revealed that a Captain flying touch and go landings in a T-33 jet aircraft at Stewart AFB, Capt. McGovern, on 07/30/52 Sep 55, he noted a bright flash in the sky. As he was not looking in the direction of the flash, he attributed it to lightning. But after thinking it over, he did not report the sighting and made no further effort to find out what the flash could have been.
