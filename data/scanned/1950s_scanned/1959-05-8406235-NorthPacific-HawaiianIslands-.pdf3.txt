THREE PLANETS NOW VISIBLE

Venus, Mars and Jupiter are visible on May evenings as the Southern Hemisphere approaches.

BY JAMES STOKLEY

WASHINGTON, May.--The three bright planets, Venus, Mars and Jupiter, are visible in the evening sky this month. All three are best seen in the South on May evenings.

Venus, which appears about three times as bright as the planet Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is now low in the West after sunset. It sets about three hours after the Sun. After that, it will be in the sky earlier in the evening, and will be in the best position for viewing in the middle and late summer months.

Mars is also in the South, but is a reddish-orange object higher in the sky than Venus. It is still a prominent object in the evening sky, but is gradually becoming smaller and dimmer as the Earth pulls away from it in its orbit.

Jupiter, the largest planet, is higher still, and appears as a brilliant white object. It is best seen in the South on May evenings.

In addition to Mars and Venus, even Saturn is visible on May evenings, but it is low in the West and sets soon after the Sun.

Looking to the right of the meridian, the star groups Virgo and Libra are prominent in the South. The bright star Arcturus, yellowish in color, is to the northwest. Other conspicuous stars in the South are Spica, Antares, and Altair.

On May 15, Jupiter will be in opposition. This means that it will rise at sunset and set at sunrise, since the Earth will be between it and the Sun. At this time, it will be closest to the Earth, and will appear largest and brightest.

DIMENSIONS OF JUPITER

Through a telescope, the planet Jupiter reveals many interesting details. Its equatorial diameter is about 88,000 miles, more than 11 times the diameter of the Earth. However, its average density is only about one-fourth that of the Earth, indicating that it is composed largely of gases.

The planet rotates rapidly, completing a full turn in less than 10 hours. This rapid rotation causes the planet to bulge at the equator, so that it is not a perfect sphere. The polar diameter is about 5,000 miles less than the equatorial diameter.

Jupiter has a number of satellites, or moons, the four largest of which were discovered by Galileo in 1610. These moons, Callisto, Ganymede, Io and Europa, range in diameter from about 2,000 to 3,400 miles.

The movement of these moons is one of the most interesting features of Jupiter's system. Their positions and eclipses can be observed with a small telescope. This study has enabled astronomers to make accurate determinations of the mass of Jupiter and the dimensions of its orbit.
