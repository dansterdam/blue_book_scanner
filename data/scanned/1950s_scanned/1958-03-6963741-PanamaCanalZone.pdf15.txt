This was such a rapid movement, that the crack radar, which was installed at Taboga Island was unable to track it with the aspect of the objects. The track radar can only indicate the presence of an object but cannot define its speed or altitude. The oscilloscope observed an estimated speed of 1600 to 2700 miles per hour. The possibility that the sightings might have been weather balloons was considered and ruled out for the following reasons:

1. On 10 March 1958, Capt. Hartlann made another report concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object by Search Radar located on Taboga Island, Republic of Panama. The following information was obtained in regard to this sighting:
