Text extracted from the document:

TO: CONTROL SYSTEM. The control system is centered in the gyro-stabilized platform that forms the inner hull of the device. This control system is large enough to accommodate a small pilot and may be remotely controlled from the ground. It is possible to put the model into any flight attitude desired. Banks up to 45Â° are possible, but will not affect the device. The stabilization is such that the control system maintains equilibrium and orientation regardless of the vehicle's attitude. Three controls are provided, namely: fuel metering, climb and dive.

RELATIONSHIP TO DESIGN FOR DESIGN. The inventor claims that the designs that have been made for the device are similar to those of present aircraft, that and this is flying, and that the design is now in the process of being put into effect.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER. The inventor has presented this office with a full statement of his claims for the device. As a technical office, we are not in a position to evaluate these claims. However, he has requested that the identity of the device be kept confidential. The idea and its details have been presented to this office for further government consideration. No further information from this source is available at this time.
