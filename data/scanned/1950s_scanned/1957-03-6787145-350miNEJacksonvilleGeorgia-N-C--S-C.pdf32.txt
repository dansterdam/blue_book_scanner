AF Accused of Hush-up on Saucers
PHILADELPHIA, APRIL 3
Air force senior officer in the Marine Corps accused the Air Force of "hushing up" the truth about unidentified flying objects, it was disclosed last night.
Donald E. Keyhoe, director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, said the officer, whom he did not name, will shortly tell the truth about the Air Force's policy of silence.
Keyhoe declared last night he will formally ask the Air Secretary this week to turn over to his org anization the project report on "flying saucers" which the Air Force has been steadfastly refusing to disclose.
Keyhoe said the officer told him the Air Force has possession of the project reports, and that the service has been "almost 20% certain" of the existence of interplanetary vehicles but has refused to admit this fact.
The committee, he said, intends to compel the Air Force to make public the information it has uncovered.
Keyhoe charged that the accused officer told him the public has never been told that Air Force jets have on many occasions tried unsuccessfully to intercept "flying saucers."
He also related he had a radar sighting between a jet and an object, and it was seen to "disappear". Neither the plane nor the object were ever seen again, Keyhoe said.
