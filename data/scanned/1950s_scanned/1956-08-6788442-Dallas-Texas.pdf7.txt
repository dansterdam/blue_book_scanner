The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Dallas, 'rex.

"Mien mounted at 7.00 k tine. 
"nein about 7.70 at lime.
"Should I call the sheriff's office."
