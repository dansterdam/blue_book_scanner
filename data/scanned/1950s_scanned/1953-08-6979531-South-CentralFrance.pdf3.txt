Transcription of the text in the document:

ON 17 AUGUST 1952 AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED OVER SOUTH-CENTRAL FRANCE (APRX 44.75N/0.30E), BY TWO PILOTS OF THE 55TH FIGHTER BOMBER SQUADRON, 20TH FIGHTER BOMBER WING, ON ROUTE TO THE UK FROM GERMANY, ITALY.

PERSONS INTERVIEWED WHO OBSERVED THE OBJECT WERE:

CAPTAIN WALTER G. CARTER, AD 732153
LT LT. THOMAS E. SAUNDERS, AD 1229891

BOTH OBSERVERS ARE CONSIDERED RELIABLE, EXPERIENCED PILOTS.

NO OTHER AIR TRAFFIC WAS KNOWN TO BE IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.

UNUSUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.

INSPECTION OF FLIGHT CHARTS OF THE LOCATION DISCLOSES SEVERAL RESTRICTED AREAS IN THE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING. IT IS CONSIDERED LIKELY THAT EXPERIMENTATION DEALING PLANE IN THOSE AREAS MAY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY THE TWO PILOTS.
