The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically a report regarding a sighting of glowing meteors or fireballs observed in the Terre Haute, Indiana area.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Canada, Vol 7, page 195 (1913). Glowing meteors such as that observed by the witness are not uncommon. Those less bright in luminosity (37,38,39 meteor cells) and only the biggest, slowest moving fireballs have not turned away by 60 miles, seem to fall into the bright fireball class and probably continued to a much lower altitude. The distance of 37-39,000 feet), which would have appeared as smoke in the sky, is not unusual for such a roll. 

5. Since Mr. ____ sighting probably lasted a relatively long time, it is possible that the sound reached him shortly after the meteor disappeared. The characteristic sound might be delayed such a slight if other conditions were such as to retard the sound for a short interval of time in between the sighting and the occurrence of sound.

6. It is suggested that Mr. _____ who is conducting extensive studies on meteors of the fireball class, be forwarded the address of Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, Director of the Institute of Meteoritics.

7. The addresses of Dr. _____ and Mr. _____ are as follows:

For the Commander:

BILLIE C. EVANS
Deputy for Damage and Components
