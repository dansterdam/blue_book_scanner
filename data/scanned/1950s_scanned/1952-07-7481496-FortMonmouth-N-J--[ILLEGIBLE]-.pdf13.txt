TRANSCRIPT:

saw this light to descend
around 1952 to 1953. It
slowly started moving away and
then suddenly went straight up
at a great speed. It seemed to
be a round bright light about the
size of a basket ball. It traveled
a straight course and had no
trails or wings or anything like
that and some neighbors (whose
name I cannot read) also witnessed
it and told me they saw about the

same thing. I would not have
mentioned this except that it seemed
strange and I am curious to know
if anyone else happened to see
something like this around that time.
