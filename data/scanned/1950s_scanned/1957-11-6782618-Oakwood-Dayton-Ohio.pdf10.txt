Mr. ________ was sitting in his car watching the sky. He observed an object which at first appeared to be a red blinking or flashing light, but which he then saw was an oval or disk-shaped object high in the sky. This object was stationary and did not move for the several minutes he watched it. It appeared to be metallic in appearance and reflecting the sun's rays. The object was about the size of an aircraft but he could not estimate its altitude. There were no other observed aircraft in the area at the time. The object suddenly disappeared, apparently straight up at a very high speed. This sighting lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes.
