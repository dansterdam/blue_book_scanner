NOTE: Mr. Little, the student pilot, Bradford Air Service, Adams Field, Ark, stated in the interview on 30 March 1950, that he saw the objects, he estimated them to be tanks or a refueling operation, but was not sure what they were, and
manager Andrews chances are right, but it has been long enough for anything. The objects never landed and he was not attempting to land the plane, and had his hands full.
Mr. Little, the student pilot, Bradford Air Service, Adams Field, Ark, stated in the interview on 20 March 1950, that he could honestly say he saw the play of the objects Mr. Andrews claimed to be landing the plane at the time.
