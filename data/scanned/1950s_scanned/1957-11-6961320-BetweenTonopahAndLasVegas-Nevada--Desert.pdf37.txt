HE WAS NEAR TONOPAH, NEVADA, ON U.S. HIGHWAY 95, ABOUT 10 MILES WEST OF LAS VEGAS. SUDDENLY HE OBSERVED TWO OBJECTS WHICH APPEARED TO BE IN MOTION NEAR THE GROUND IN THE DISTANCE. THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE AN UNUSUAL SHAPE, DISC-LIKE WITH RED LIGHTS ON THE UNDERSIDE, AND WERE MOVING IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION IN RELATION TO HIS POSITION.
