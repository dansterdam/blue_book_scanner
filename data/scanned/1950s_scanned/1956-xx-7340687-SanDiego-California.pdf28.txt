There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing a lengthy block of text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

FIREBALLS FLASH OVER OREGON -- DAYLIGHT

Case 126. Chile Craco, Jan. 9, 1956. According to the report, this observer was driving along a highway during broad daylight (1:30 p.m.) when he noticed a bright light high in the sky, traveling at high speed and leaving a long trail behind it. He said the object appeared to be on fire and was traveling from east to west. The observer stated he watched it for about 30 seconds before it faded out. He said the object was illuminated by a brilliant white light and seemed to be cylindrical in shape. The observer claimed there appeared to be several "fireballs" or smaller fragments also streaking through the sky, all following the same general path as the original larger object.
