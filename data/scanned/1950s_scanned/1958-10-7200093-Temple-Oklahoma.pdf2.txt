Mr. stated that on 10 October 1958, an object appearing to be a celestial balloon was sighted in a small location at Temple, Oklahoma. He further stated that the object had a white, luminous glow and was approximately the size of a basketball. He said that the object was observed for several minutes and that it was the direction it came from that was the direction it went. 

When asked if the object was still in their possession they produced a folded, clear type, soft plastic, rectangular sheet measuring approximately 6 1/2 x 9 inches. The original object was now lost and the investigators requested that the plastic sheet be placed in their custody. The investigators had no desire to have the object and returned it to them.
