Genevieve Peppe - September 8, 1959

Description: I was monitoring the movements of a bright object in the sky. It would appear and disappear, and they seem to be alternately rising and falling in vertical motion. It sometimes would stand still and then move very rapidly to another point in the sky. The object was a bright, silver-colored, circular shaped object and emitted no visible tail or exhaust. The entire maneuver lasted approximately 1 hour from the time I first noticed it until it finally disappeared from view. I called several neighbors to witness the object but it disappeared before they could see it. No sound was audible from the object. The sky was clear and visibility was excellent."
