appeared to be solid, rather than transparent, but could offer no theory about construction details. SOURCE estimated that the object descended from an altitude of about 5000 feet to between 1500 and 2500 feet, turned west toward the San Andras Mountains, and disappeared at approximately 15 degrees from the horizon, and 270 degrees from true North (Refer to Figure #1). The object appeared to be between three and five miles ahead of the first car parked along the road. Approximately two minutes later, SOURCE observed the object make an identical appearance, although slightly south of the path of the first. SOURCE stated that the object appeared to be about the size of a pea held at arm's length; he stated he believed it to be about 500 feet long; he noticed no ports, heard no sounds, noticed no smoke or vapor trails, and said it was sharply outlined with nothing fuzzy about the silhouette. SOURCE stated that it did not appear to change shape at any time, did not stand still, did not flicker or seem to pulsate. As the object passed, SOURCE noticed a distinct rise in his body temperature, as though he had been exposed to a "giant sun lamp", and later stated that he had incurred a sunburn. (This statement was later retracted). During this time, SOURCE discussed the phenomena with two other motorists, one of whom, as did SOURCE, made notes; the other allegedly took photographs of the object. SOURCE took down the names of these two men, although he neglected to take down the license numbers of their automobiles. A subsequent search for the two men failed to disclose their whereabouts, nor could they be further identified, no other reports of such a sighting were made by anyone else. Although the day was dull with scattered clouds and a 2500 foot broken high overcast, SOURCE stated that he had observed the two flights of the object for a total of three or four minutes; he later estimated the speed of the object to be between 1500 and 2000 miles per hour. SOURCE has never been married. SOURCE stated that his car started again quite easily, although the battery had been steaming.

Imperative:
            did these speeds and for that long time duration through broken clouds or at low levels ?!?!?
