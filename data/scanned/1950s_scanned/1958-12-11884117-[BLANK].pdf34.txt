MEMORANDUM FOR COMMANDER, AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER

THRU: AFCIN-4E
AFCIN-4T
SUBJECT: UFO Program

1. After some four months of working with the UFO Program, as outlined in AFR 200-2, I find certain deficiencies in this Program which in my opinion must be corrected if we are to fulfill adequately those requirements assigned to us.

2. In order to appreciate the deficiencies in the UFO Program as presently constituted, certain background facts are necessary. These are:

(1) The Objectives of the UFO Program are to first, determine the possible threat of UFO's to the security of the United States and its forces; second, to determine the technical characteristics of UFO's; and third, to identify all UFO sightings.

(2) Reporting and investigation of UFO's is the responsibility of Commanders of the Air Force Bases. This is supplemented by the 4602d AISS.

(3) Collect all data and evaluate all reports of UFO's emanating from the ZI and overseas areas. ATIC may independently, or in participation with pertinent USAF activities, conduct supplementary investigations.

(4) The Office of Information Services of the Secretary of the Air Force (SAFIS) will handle public relations and press releases pertaining to the UFO Program. The Office of Legislative Liaison will handle Congressional inquiries. Both of these agencies look to ATIC for specific answers pertaining to sightings and evaluations thereof.

(5) Prompt reporting and rapid identification of UFO's is essential in the Air Force and public interest.
