The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically an Air Intelligence Information Report dated 21 Oct 1953 concerning an unidentified flying object sighted near Ft. Snelling, Minnesota.

Text from the document:

I. SUMMARY: An unidentified flying object was reported by three (3) laboratory technicians at Ft. SNELLING, Minnesota on 15 Oct 1953. The object was observed for approximately 12 minutes and was estimated to have flown at an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet between 1015 and 1033 hours. 

The object was first observed as a small, cigar-like smoke trail heading southward at high speed. It was observed to make a sharp turn to the west and then continue on its course heading on a westerly direction. The entire observation was made visually and through 8x binoculars. The object was described as being a bright, metallic-like color which at times appeared to be emitting smoke or vapor. During the observation, the object at times appeared to be diving and then climbing rapidly in an erratic flight pattern.

II. COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: Technical personnel who observed the object consist of two electronics engineers with over ten years experience each in aerodynamics, gyros, and servomechanisms. A third observer was a technician experienced in radar-engineering work. All three observers are considered fully qualified to make such observations and their descriptions are believed to be accurate.

That information has been obtained from SOURCES is believed to be reliable. The estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet is based upon the estimated size of the object and the known angle of elevation during the observation. No specific estimates were given in the vicinity of 40,000 feet, but upon inquiry all estimated altitudes were within the 10,000 to 15,000 foot range.
