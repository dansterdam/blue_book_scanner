Enclosure to Investigativc Observers
Washington, D. C.

OR 23 February 1954 at 1:45 I was waiting for a chance to get to the Washington airport when I noticed the object high in the sky. It appeared to be a jet airplane flying at a very high altitude for about 7 minutes. It made no sound that I could hear. I called several others who were near me to look at it. They agreed with me that it was a jet airplane flying at a very high altitude. After about 7 minutes, the object increased its speed and climbed straight up and out of sight. I called to my secretary, who was inside the building, to come out and look at it but she did not see it as she came out just as it disappeared from view.

OR 25 February 1954. It was about the same time in the afternoon and in about the same location. I was again waiting for a chance to get to the Washington Airport when I noticed the object again. This time it appeared to be slightly larger than the first time I saw it. It also appeared to be a jet airplane but it was flying at a tremendous speed and making no sound. After appearing to be stationary for a few seconds, it suddenly increased its speed and climbed straight up and out of sight.

As the object passed it seemed to reflect the sun's rays, and this perhaps caused it to appear slightly larger than the first time I saw it. The object changed direction and went straight up and out of sight; appearing to be of tremendous speed. I called to others who were near me but they did not see it as it had disappeared so quickly. The speed of the object was such that I could not estimate it, but it was far in excess of any jet airplane I have ever seen.

I may have seen a similar object another day but I cannot say for certain.
