On 9 January 1953, the writer interviewed a US Air Force Captain who stated he was an eyewitness to an unusual aerial object observed in Guatemala on 10 December 1952. The object was first sighted at approximately 1845 hours local time, at an estimated altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet, and was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes.

According to the Captain's statement, the object was circular in shape, metallic in appearance, and did not emit any exhaust or contrails. Its movements were described as rapid and erratic, with sudden changes in direction and speed. At times, the object appeared to hover momentarily. No sound was heard associated with the object.

The Captain further stated that two other US Air Force officers also observed the object, as well as several Guatemalan civilians. He indicated that the incident had been reported to US military authorities. The writer was informed that similar aerial phenomena had been observed on other occasions in the Guatemala area.

The writer has no additional details regarding this incident. This report is forwarded for your information. It is requested that the identity of the US Air Force Captain not be divulged.
