OBSERVATION: Reference Marine pilot observation of balloons in Wonsan area
reported FEAF Intsum 651, 6 Apr 52, this Hqs has received no previous report of
the sighting or use of such balloons. An F-4 report recently received (Arl 5
AF, IR-17-52; 6 Mar 52) stated that "Globe-shaped orange-colored objects
recently reported sighted by UN aircraft were in reality a type of Wi II
Japanese balloon to be elevated "to frighten UN planes from areas", and were
being manufactured in Mancnuria. One possible explanation of the presently
reported sightings, if accurately described, could be that the enemy is experi-
menting with a new defense measure against low-level UN intrudiction efforts.
However, the size of the balloons (10-15 ft. in diameter) would seem to preclude
any great altitude capability.
