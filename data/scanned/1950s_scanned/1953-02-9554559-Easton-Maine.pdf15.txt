The image appears to contain a chart titled "THE KOCH CHART FOR ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS" that provides information on the effects of altitude and temperature on aircraft flight. The chart includes a graph with various altitude and temperature readings, as well as explanatory text about how to interpret the chart.

THE KOCH CHART FOR
ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS

TO FIND THE EFFECT OF ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE ON YOUR AIRPLANE'S FLIGHT PERFORMANCE:

READ THE INCREASE IN TAKE-OFF DISTANCE AND THE DECREASE IN RATE OF CLIMB FROM STANDARD SEA LEVEL VALUES HERE 

EXAMPLE: The diagonal line shows that at 40% increase in temperature (e.g. from 59°F to 83°F) and an altitude of 10,000 feet, the take-off distance increases by 30% and the rate of climb decreases by 40%.

This chart indicates typical representative values for "personal" airplanes.
For exact values consult your airplane flight manual.
The chart may be conservative for airplanes with supercharged engines.
Also remember that long grass, sand, mud or deep snow can greatly reduce your take-off distance.
