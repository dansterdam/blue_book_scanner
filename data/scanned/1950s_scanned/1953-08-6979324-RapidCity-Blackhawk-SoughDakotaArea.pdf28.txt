Dear sirs,

Last week we were informed that the investigations committee on UFOs of the U.S. Air Force, Project Blue Book, hastily published a book about the U.F.O.'s - sights which were reported during about 15 years from several states of the U.S.A. 

We are informed too, that "Project Blue Book" had published a book on U.F.O.'s from the late 15 years of investigation. By our information they would have published a book about it. We would asks if you could send us those reports and/or this book. If this are not possible, can you tell us the way, how we can get that?

Ho thing that you can comply with our requests and sign, looking your answer.

Sincerly,
