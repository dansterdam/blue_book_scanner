SUMMARY: (Last paragraph reads: Summarc. Case under investigation)
One unidentified object was observed visually for approximately one and one-half hours by Ground Observer Corps personnel located near San Raphael, California, on 25 July 1952. The object was disc-shaped, bright white in color and appeared to travel at an estimated speed of 150 M.P.H. at an altitude between 10,000 and 20,000 degrees. One of the observers said the unidentified object may have been an astronomical light possibly coming from the middle of the object.
The observers were located at the G.O.C. Post in Novato, Calif.; at the time of the sighting. The observers were S/Sgt. George G. Owens (USAF retired) and Sgt. Nicholas Martucci.
The Weather Officer, 4th Air Division (Def) reported the weather in his area as scattered clouds at 10,000 ft. with winds at 20,000 ft. were 130Â° at 7 knots.
Information from the Control Center, 4th Air Division, indicated that 2 jet aircraft were vectored to investigate the sighting but no contact was made.
No physical evidence of the sighting was reported. No identification action was taken.
Opinion of Reporting Officer: Based on a review of the observer's report, it is the opinion that the sighting was an astronomical light or instrument such as a reflecting satellite or other object. The extreme altitude and reported speed of the object is not believed to be characteristic of known aircraft.
