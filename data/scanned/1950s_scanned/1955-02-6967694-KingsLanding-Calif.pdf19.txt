Magazine Says Russia Has A-Powered Bomber
The Russian nuclear-powered bomber, which reportedly is capable of a range of 20,000 miles, has interested the United States Government. According to the report from Moscow, the Russians have developed a bomber that can stay aloft for indefinite periods through atomic power.
The magazine said a number of other details of the bomber's construction and capabilities were given by the report. These include:
The bomber is powered by two atomic engines which the Russians have been testing and improving for some time. Its over-all length is believed to be less than 100 feet and its wingspan is about 140 feet.
The fuel tanks are fitted one behind the other, giving it a long, slim fuselage. The engines are placed directly behind the cockpit.
An air-to-air refueling system, radio-controlled remotely from its base, is said to permit the bomber to remain aloft constantly and refuel in the air.
The Air Force and Defense Establishment are known to be intensely interested in the Russian bomber and are endeavoring to learn all possible details about it.
While the report on the new bomber has not been officially confirmed, the magazine said it came from usually reliable Russian sources and had been widely reported and discussed.
