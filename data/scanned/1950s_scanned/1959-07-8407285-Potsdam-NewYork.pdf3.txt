There is a photograph present on the page. The photograph appears to be of a newspaper clipping with a headline related to UFO sightings.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

```
about twenty miles from Maurea ( St. Lawrence

( Off Blacksburg this is Emor)

I reported perhaps others who seen the phenomenon

I am enclosing the clipping It is a very simular

description of what we saw

The reason for retorting it is that the same

aberation was made by often in northeastern

U.S L ones seen by these pilots in eastern U.S.

I also my astoonex's sounds celebrate it

is a little difficult to describe something

not seen before

30/2 was the clipping minutes 
and about twenty minutes ( Thur

admiring the minute)
