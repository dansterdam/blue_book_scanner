Ambassador * * * visits Ontario cities
Ambassador * * * has recently visited on a tour of Southern Ontario cities and met with officials of the Department of Commerce on April 17 and is scheduled to speak at a dinner meeting of the Toronto Board of Trade Club on April 21.

Comments: In his large official speech in Windsor the Ambassador said that peace with the Soviet Union is still the aim of U.S. foreign policy and he emphasized that this policy is the natural result of our national interest and that the policy of the U.S. Government really represents the desire of the American people. He noted that she high standard of living enjoyed by Americans is endangered by excessive armament and because the people of the U.S. are so far removed from the direct effects of war, made by the progress of science to develop weapons of vast destruction.

In interview on April 22, the Ambassador will speak on the pattern of foreign policy emphasizing that U.S. policies and actions are all parts of a program designed all aimed at preserving world security.

Flying Saucers Exhibit Increase
A report of the sighting of another flying saucer was stirred up considerable interest in the press during the past week. USAF stations at North Bay, Ontario, received two hundred and fifty reports of flying saucers within a 24-hour period, which followed the usual pattern of changes in direction and disappearance.

Comments: About 30 reports of sightings of mysterious objects have been reported during the past few years. In one instance in 1950 the objects were reported to have made a sudden shift in direction and to have moved at a tremendous speed. The Air Force has a routine procedure for the investigation of these incidents. The present flurry of reports is in that category.
