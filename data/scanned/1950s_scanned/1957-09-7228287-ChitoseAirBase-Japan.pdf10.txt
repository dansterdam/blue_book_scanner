1. The dark blotch on the photographs accompanying the report on the UFO has these characteristics:
a. It represents an area on the film entirely devoid of detail or exposure effect.
b. The area has no significant edge.
c. The area is vignette or has no definite outline.
d. Proportions indicate the object is a great distance away.
2. If this were a dark flying object, these things would be true:
a. There would be the body of the outline as indicated by the print there would be some detail visible in this area of the film at the indicated exposure.
b. There would be a definite outline, parallel to the object.
c. If the sky was at all hazy or if the object was a distance away, a light or a distinct halo would have to be visible, indicating the base or sky.
3. From these photographs it is concluded that in the processing of this film, some error in handling has occurred, resulting in a dark and indistinct area, devoid of detail, leaving a clear and partially clear area on the film. This area, in printing, is identified with the light outline of the printer to pass onto the paper and expose it to this clear area, inadvertently, or the film during the development.
