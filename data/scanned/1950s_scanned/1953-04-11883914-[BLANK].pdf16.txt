Box 9575
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter report describes progress for the period from November 10, 1952 to December 10, 1952.

Sighting reports up to and including July 25, 1952, have been processed. Except for reports dated 1947 and 1948, all sighting reports up to and including June, 1952, have been evaluated. The sighting reports for 1947 and 1948 were returned from Harvard University on November 20. Because the reports and the forms which had been filled in and placed with the institution over a year ago showed that these reports will not be available for use, the evaluation of these reports will not be accomplished.

Two evaluation conferences of two days each were held during the report period. During the report period, evaluation has been more difficult than formerly because the amount and quality of data in the average report have increased. Evaluation conferences will be scheduled in the future as reports are available.

The rotation system for handling sighting reports, whereby no more than 100 sighting reports are permitted away from ATIC at any one time, has functioned with a minimum of delay.

The preliminary analysis of 1952 sighting reports will continue. 1952 will not be analyzed on all sighting reports dated before 1952 will continue to be processed and evaluated. Results of this analysis will be given to ATIC before January 1, 1953. By about January 15, 1953, all sighting reports dated before August 10, 1952, will probably be processed and evaluated, ready for IBM analysis.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, The Ohio State University, gave advice concerning several sighting reports during the report period.

Very truly yours,
William T. Reid
Supervisor
