TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

The following report is submitted covering the incidents surrounding the sighting of an unidentified flying object at Greenville, South Carolina, on 9 May 1952.

On the night of 9 May 1952, at approximately 10:20 p.m., Group Sgt. L.L. Mogren and 4 other Airmen from the 28th Air Police Squadron, stationed at Donaldson Air Force Base, Greenville, South Carolina, observed an unidentified object in the sky.

The object was observed for a period of approximately 5 minutes. It was described as circular in shape, about the size of a nickel held at arm's length, and was a bright white in color. The object moved rapidly from north to south, made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the west, and then returned to its northerly course at a tremendous rate of speed. The object was observed to fade rapidly from view.

The weather was clear and the visibility excellent. No known aircraft was in the area that could be identified as the object sighted.

Mr. L.L. Mogren, of the 28th Air Police Squadron, submitted a written statement covering the details of this incident, a true copy of which is attached.

A CERTIFIED TRUE COPY.

ARTHUR E. PALMER, Capt., USAF.
