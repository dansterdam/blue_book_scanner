The image contains no photographs, but there is a sketch consisting of two oval shapes with a line indicating direction and a compass rose depicting orientation. The ovals appear to represent the purported UFOs with an arrow indicating their motion from West to East. There are also handwritten notes on the wind direction near the bottom right of the page.
