METEORS
"This entity, Capt. George E. Foster, Master, reports that at about 0752
GMT, (1752 hours), on 11 Dec 1952, in lat. 39 deg. 56 min N, long. 143 
deg. 08 min E., Japanese fishing vessel Ama, approximately 240 miles
west southwest of Tateyama lighthouse, observed an unidentified object
traveliing east-northeast at an estimated speed of 1500 to 2000 mph. The
object gave off an intense glow, white to light blue in color, and left a faint trail. The course of this object was about east-northeast. This
phenomenon occurred on a moonless night, with a ceiling of 2000 ft. and
good visibility. Temperature outside was 78 F.
Seamen aboard the Ama have observed somewhat similar objects on two
previous occasions, about 1949-1950, when they were navigating the waters
between Japan and the American West Coast. The objects observed on those
earlier occasions gave the impression of being somewhat larger, travelling
at lower altitudes, and leaving more pronounced trails. The observer says
that "the object appeared to be the biggest and brightest he had ever seen
from these previous observations"."
