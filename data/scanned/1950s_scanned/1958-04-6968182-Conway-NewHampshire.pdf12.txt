19 April 1958
Conway, New Hampshire near Syracuse, New York

On 19 April the crew of a B-47 observed a round, silver object in the sky above them. The altitude of the B-47 was 32,000 and excellent VFR conditions existed. The observation took place between Syracuse, New York and about twenty miles southwest of Pittsburgh AFS, New York. At first, all crew members thought object to be a balloon, but object did not disappear as rapidly as expected. The object was clearly visible for twenty minutes.

Enlargement of the photo showed a perfectly round, transparent like object similar to plastic balloons. U.S. Weather Bureau and Navy charts showed a high altitude balloon in the area.
