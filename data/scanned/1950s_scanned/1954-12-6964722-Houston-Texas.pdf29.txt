Waukegan Trio Sights Fast Moving Sky Ball

Homeward bound members of an American Red Cross volunteer group, Mre. Dellamore, Mrs. Saunders and two young girls, companions were puzzled last night by a "trailing and moving sky ball" they described as seen in the sky over Waukegan, moving from south to north.

"We did not know what it was," said Mrs. Dellamore. "And none of us knew what it was."

Mrs. Dellamore said the sky ball seemed to travel faster than an airplane but not so fast as a shooting star. "It had no tail of fire and didn't know what it was," she added.

Mrs. Dellamore said the two other women were passengers in her car, which she was driving between Gurnee and Chicago. Martin and Orchard Aves., in Waukegan, when the unidentified object in the sky was seen."
