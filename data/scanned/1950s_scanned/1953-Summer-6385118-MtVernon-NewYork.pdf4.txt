Dear Sir:
I assume U.F.O.'s have been seen in the vicinity of Mount Vernon, New York, on August 31, 1965, at about 9:45 P.M. Suddenly, while my neighbors and I were standing outside, my attention was drawn to a strange looking object in the sky. It was round, luminous and was traveling at a rapid rate of speed, making no sound whatsoever. The object had the appearance of being surrounded by a halo-like glow and was visible for about one minute, during which time it traversed the sky for approximately 45 degrees. Suddenly, with no perceptible change in its speed or direction, it disappeared from sight. This object had the same general characteristics as those described by many reliable witnesses of U.F.O. sightings, both civilian and military, and I am convinced that what I saw was of extraterrestrial origin.
I was unable to make any measurement of the object, nor to determine its precise altitude or distance from my observation point. However, from its apparent size and the speed with which it moved, I would estimate that it was a fairly large craft, possibly 50 to 100 feet in diameter, traveling at an altitude of several thousand feet. It is regrettable that I was unable to obtain a photograph of the object, as I had no camera available at the time. I trust, however, that this report of my observation will be of interest to you and will add to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of U.F.O.'s.
I would be most grateful for any comment or information you might care to provide regarding this sighting.

Sincerely yours,
