AIR INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION RECORD
(This Record must be Completed on Receipt of a Report)
AGENCY: 31
PROJECT NO. 10073
DATE: 6 June 55 (RECEIVED)
FROM: ASKAFS, Air Technical Intelligence Center
TO: Director of Intelligence
Headquarters USAF 
ATTN: Collection Operations Div. 
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

USABILITY OF REPORT: VALID
SPECIFIC:
VALUE: PROBABLY TRUE
FULFILLMENT OF REQUIREMENT: PARTIAL

1. The targets which moved and then became stationary are believed to have resulted from a possible temperature inversion that would justify false echoes on ground targets. However, this report is the first to detail so long an all-borne sighting of pyramids of UF0's, and it is surprising to find the radar operating normally on a target of this type.

2. The fact that 15 targets originally appeared on the PPI scope, but only 2 were observed on the AI radar, tends to substantiate the spurious response theory. Also, it seems probable that the 2 AI targets were part of the original 15 targets. It would be possible for the radar to malfunction during the flight and still check out after the flight but it would be unlikely.

3. There is not sufficient data upon which to make a firm evaluation, and any additional information would be welcomed. This is a very interesting report, well prepared, and the incidents which happened cannot be satisfactorily explained.
