Here is the text from the document:

On Sept. 27, 1957, at about 11:25 P.M. in a clear night I was driving to my home at 255 East 29th St., New York City. I looked up at the stars on the south side of 2nd Ave. and observed an unusual waiting for a change in the shape-lights. The object seemed to be a circular-ellipsed object streaked across the sky from east to west (traveling in a constant course), and was whitish-green in color. The length of the sighting was about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, and it moved faster than and was brighter than a meteorite (which I have observed in the past). The object left no trail. After it disappeared, the sky was clear and there were other stars visible in the same area. It was at a medium altitude and seemed to be in the vicinity of La Guardia Field.
