Cincinnati, Ohio

Case 18a, Class 22, 8 Aug 13 1956 - 2246 Jones Jones watching a clear sky sighted two objects which looked like stars, but were moving. One object was moving slightly faster than the other. Both objects appeared to be approximately the same size and brightness. The objects made no sound. Both objects disappeared into infinity and Jones was sure they were not conventional aircraft. The objects were sighted for approximately 5 minutes. After the objects disappeared, Jones continued to watch the area of the sky for about 3O minutes but saw no more objects. It was assumed the appearance was that of a welders torch. As to the identity of the objects, Jones could furnish no further information.

While watching the object Jones then saw another similar object appear in the same part of the sky about 20 minutes or so after the first two had disappeared. This third object also disappeared into infinity and made no sound. Both the initial two objects and the third object disappeared into infinity and Jones was sure they were not conventional aircraft.

There was no moon and the objects were silhouetted against a clear sky and looking like "welders torch". The objects were first seen about Cold Spring, Ky, at about 1025 pm and were seen for about 5 minutes.
