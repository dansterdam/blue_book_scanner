The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line to illustrate how an object appears above the horizon (skyline) when you first see it. The second sketch shows a larger view with two positions marked "A" and "B" to demonstrate how to complete a larger sketch based on the object's position.
