Transcription of the text in the document:

"THE INCIDENT HAPPENED ON AUGUST 3rd, 1955, ABOUT 8 PM, IN OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT. I WAS SITTING IN MY LIVING ROOM WATCHING TELEVISION WHEN MY WIFE CALLED ME TO THE WINDOW. SHE SAID SHE HAD JUST SEEN A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY. I HURRIED TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED UP AND SAW A BRIGHTLY-LIT OBJECT HIGH IN THE SKY. IT WAS ROUND AND LUMINOUS, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A QUARTER HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. IT MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND THEN SUDDENLY SHOT OFF AT A TERRIFIC SPEED AND DISAPPEARED. I CALLED MY NEIGHBOR, MR. BROWN, WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR, AND HE ALSO SAW THE OBJECT. WE BOTH WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT AN AIRPLANE, HELICOPTER, OR ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT. I AM QUITE FAMILIAR WITH ALL CONVENTIONAL AERIAL VEHICLES, AND THIS WAS NOTHING LIKE ANY OF THEM. IT SEEMED TO BE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL AND MADE NO SOUND WHATSOEVER. THE INCIDENT LASTED ONLY A FEW MINUTES, BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY THE MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SKY. AFTER IT DISAPPEARED, I DECIDED TO REPORT THE INCIDENT TO THE AUTHORITIES. I RECEIVED A VISIT FROM TWO MILITARY OFFICERS WHO TOOK A DETAILED REPORT FROM ME. THEY SEEMED VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT I HAD SEEN AND TOLD ME THAT SIMILAR REPORTS HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THEY ADVISED ME NOT TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT WITH ANYONE ELSE. I AM STILL PUZZLED BY WHAT I SAW THAT NIGHT AND WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE IN THE AREA WITNESSED THE SAME PHENOMENON."
