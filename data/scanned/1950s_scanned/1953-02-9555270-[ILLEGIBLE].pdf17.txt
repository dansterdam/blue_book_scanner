NARRATIVE
On 12 Feb 53, I observed an unidentified object with binoculars, for a period of 5 to 10 minutes. The object appeared to be about the size of a star, as near as I could judge it. It was moving in an erratic manner at a high rate of speed, constantly changing direction and altitude. It was brighter than the stars around it. There was no change in the intensity or brilliance of the object during the period of observation. When I first saw the object, it was at about 80 degrees of azimuth from my position, and an elevation of about 30 degrees. Over a period of 5 to 10 minutes it moved to about 60 degrees of azimuth, and 45 degrees of elevation, where it disappeared from view, still moving. There was no sound associated with the object, nor any trail or exhaust. This is the only unidentified object I have observed.
