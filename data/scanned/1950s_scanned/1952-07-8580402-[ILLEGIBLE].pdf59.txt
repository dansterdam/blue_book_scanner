The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line representing how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and the second sketch shows the position of the object when the observer last saw it. The text instructs the reader to place an "A" at the position where the object was first seen, and to draw a picture to show the motion that the object made.

SECTION D

22. In the following sketch, imagine your eye at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. Place a "Y" to show where it was when you last saw it.
