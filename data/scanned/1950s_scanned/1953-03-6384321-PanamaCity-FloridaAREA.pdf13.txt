ATIC-B-53
25 March 1952

SUBJECT: Flying Saucers

On Wednesday, 25 March 1952, at about 3:00 o'clock (Central Standard Time) I observed an object in the sky at a distance which I could not determine, but the object was flying straight and level from Green toward Panama City, Florida. I first sighted the object while sitting in a chair looking out the window. It was shining in the window, but was not spinning. When I looked at it so that the object was not blinding in the window, I could see that the object appeared to be disc-shaped and was definitely of a greater size than a star or any other flying object I have seen. It held a steady course in the sky for about three (3) seconds, and then rushed to the front door in an attempt to get a better look, but the object had disappeared. It could have been possibly a very fast jet aircraft.
