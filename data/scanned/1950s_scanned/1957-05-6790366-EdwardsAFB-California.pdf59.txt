We left this master station heading south for one mile when we turned east for approximately 1 to 1.5 miles. At this point we turned north and traveled about 1 mile before we turned west again. While traveling this circuit, we observed and tracked an unidentified object which appeared to be traveling erratically in the sky. The object continued to the Ashland station and overhead and seemed to accelerate. From this time travel to the Ashland station had become normal and no further observation of the object was made. The time when we first observed the object was approximately 10:00 p.m. and it was observed for approximately 25 to 30 minutes before it was lost out of sight.
