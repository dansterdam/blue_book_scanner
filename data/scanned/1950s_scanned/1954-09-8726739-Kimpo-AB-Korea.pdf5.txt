12. The preliminary analysis of this office reveals that there is apparently no explanation to this sighting. The fact that a weather balloon was released

during the time of sighting has no apparent bearing on the sighting, since the balloon was never plotted in a southerly direction. The object observed,

The object was travelling on a southerly heading against the last wind at that

these reasons seem to eliminate the assumption that the object was the weather balloon released by the F-1L weather station. The radar station

had no plots in the F-1L area during the time the object was sighted.
