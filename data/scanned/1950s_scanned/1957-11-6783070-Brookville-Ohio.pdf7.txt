The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, and instructions to imagine that the object was seen high above the horizon. The second sketch shows two different perspectives of a landscape, with instructions to place an "A" at the position of the object when it was first seen, and a "B" at its position when seen later.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. 

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position of the object as when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as a sample of how to complete the larger sketch.
