"No one was home to be contacted at the uego house. 

The report plays with words here. What is visible is water vapor or rain of very small particles. Ori tional investigation from the house of G. E. Sheffield was also made. There was no specific claim that the smoke came from the U. S. Steel Company plant."

(2) Test Harrison obtained a model made of paper plates and a bowl which was shown to the sergeants along with a verbal description.

(4) The sergeants did take notes during the investigation and interview. However, it should be noted that the terrain interefered and the interviewers did not feel they were to go on record as this thing since there is no record requiring exact record on their part in the future.

(5) The ATIC feels that definite steps are should be pointed out that the apparent purpose of the UFO Research Committee, like most private organizations, is to disorganize the U.S. Government's and public's impression.

(6) The UFO Research Committee is claimed to be a scientific organization. However, there are no indications of a high level of credibility within the organization.

(7) The ATIC stands firmly behind the investigators in this case. True, there were some physical changes in the area, but could have occurred from normal activity. The collected evidence was sufficient for the Air Force when in the judgment of these experienced men the collected evidence was significant.
