MOST CLEARLY ACTIVE OF ALL OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED REPORTS
UNDER DESCRIPTION - AT 10:05 PM FINALLY LOST FROM VIEW ON THE HORIZON
MAN WHO FIRST SEEN AS OF WHERE HE WAS [word unreadable]
THERE IS NO DOUBT WHATEVER IN MY MIND ABOUT THE REALITY OF THIS OBSERVATION. HOWEVER DISTANCE ESTIMATES QUITE UNCERTAINTY. IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ROUGHLY CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND TO HAVE BEEN OF VERY BRIGHT LUMINOSITY AND QUITE UNLIKE ANY KNOWN AERIAL PHENOMENA 
THIS OBSERVATION WARRANTS THE MOST CAREFUL ATTENTION OF THE AIR FORCE AND UNLIMITED EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND RARITY OF THE CHOSEN PHENOMENA. I AM ACT ABLE TO DISCUSS IT 23 MARCH 1953 I HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED IT TYPICAL AND UNTECGNOIQICAL OF THEM AS BEING QUITE REASONABLE. CERTAIN OF MY STATEMENTS MAY SEEM PRETENTIOUS BUT I BELIEVE THEY ARE FAIR AND TWO OTHER LIKE FORCE PHOTOS
