CSAF ITEM COUNCIL
FM AFDIN-STC WILLIS

THIS INFORMATION WAS REPORTED THROUGH A PERSONAL LETTER BY MR. AND REQUEST COMMENT OR EVALUATION.  TIME: 0330, 11 OCT 51
SUBJECT: WHILE I WERE FLYING AT 10,000 FT. OBSERVING THE GRAB BAG BALLOON WHEN I SAW
A BRIGHTLY GLOWING OBJECT TO THE S.E. OF U. S. AIRPORT. AT THAT TIME WE WERE A FEW MILES NORTH OF MINNEAPOLIS AND HEADING EAST. I POINTED IT OUT TO PICK AND WE BOTH MADE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATION:
"THE OBJECT WAS MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST AT A HIGH RATE AND VERY HIGH. WE TRIED KEEPING THE SHIP ON A CONSTANT COURSE AND USING REINFORCING MEMBER OF THE WINDSHIELD AS A POINT, THE OBJECT MOVED PAST THIS MEMBER AT ABOUT 50 DEGREES PER SECOND.
"THIS OBJECT WAS PECULIAR IN THAT IT HAD WHAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A HALO AROUND IT WITH A DARK UNDERSURFACE. IT CROSSED RAPIDLY AND THEN SLOWED DOWN AND STARTED TO CLIMB IN LAZY CIRCLES SLOWLY. THE PATTERN IT MADE WAS LIKE A FALLING OAK LEAF INVERTED. IT WENT THROUGH THESE GYRATIONS FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND THEN WITH A VERY RAPID ACCELERATION DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST. THIS OBJECT, PICK AND I WATCHED FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES.
