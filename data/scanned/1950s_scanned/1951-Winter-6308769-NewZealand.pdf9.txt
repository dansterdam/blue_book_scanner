"A reply to:
SOUTH-AUSTRALIAN-

GAH/JGW/73147

28 APR 1951

Mr. 
Kalapoi, New Zealand

Dear Mr. 

Your letter of 2 March 1951, together with photographs, has been received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center for analysis.

A study of the photographs indicates that the object shown is a lenticular altocumulus cloud. This type of formation is not unusual and the photographs are not considered to be of particular significance.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center would like to obtain the use of your negatives, if you still have them, for the purpose of making enlargement prints. The negatives would be promptly returned to you.

Your interest in the unidentified flying object program and your desire to be of service is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

CC: Lt Col Smith, AFOTN-X
