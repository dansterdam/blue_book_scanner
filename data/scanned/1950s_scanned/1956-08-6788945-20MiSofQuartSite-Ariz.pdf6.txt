There is no photograph or image present in this scanned document. The document appears to be a typed report from Project Blue Book, likely describing a UFO sighting.

As an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I will now output the text found in the document:

On 21 August 1952, at [REDACTED] was interviewed at [REDACTED]. The main points are as follows:

About 9:50 P.M. on 20 Aug 52, [REDACTED] was driving east on [REDACTED], [REDACTED], California, when he observed a brilliantly lighted object in the sky. It was about 1/2 the apparent size of the moon, and oval in shape, and estimated to be about 20 miles away and 2,000 feet in altitude. It was a brilliant golden color, like a large fluorescent bulb, and was completely silent. It remained stationary for about 3-4 minutes, then suddenly shot straight up at a tremendous speed, far exceeding the speed of any known aircraft, and disappeared from sight. It was observed by [REDACTED] and his wife, who corroborated his account.

[REDACTED] is a [REDACTED] and appeared to be a credible witness. He stated that this was the most amazing thing he had ever seen, and that he was completely convinced that it was not an aircraft of any kind, but some type of unidentified flying object.
