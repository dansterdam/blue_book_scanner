The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed letter on Project Blue Book stationery. The letter describes an incident where the author and their colleague observed an unidentified object in the sky that exhibited strange behavior, such as a sudden flash of light and rapid movements. They state that this object was not an airplane, as there were no red or green lights, no contrails, and the object's movements were significantly different from an airplane. The letter is dated December 12, 1952 and is addressed to the United States Air Force Intelligence Division in New York.

Dear Sir:

Mr. [redacted] and myself are teachers at the [redacted] last night we started from the station origin. Suddenly we noticed a meteor-like flash to the appearance of the flash we saw over-like object moving from the right to the left. The object continued moving slowly at first, then suddenly shot away toward the right in an erratic path, crossing through the sky, and headed toward the right in an erratic path. It continued to move swiftly away toward the right.

Mr. [redacted] and myself served in the armed forces. He was an ensign in the navy and I was a soldier GI.

We were led to believe this object was not an airplane because:
a. There were no red or green lights or flashing of lights
b. There was almost no forward motion or turn
c. The changes of course were so marked and swift that we be-lieve it could not have been an airplane
d. The changes of course were so marked and swift that we be-lieve it could not have been an airplane

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]
