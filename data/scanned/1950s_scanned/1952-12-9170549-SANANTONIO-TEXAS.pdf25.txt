My first impression was that it was a "taillight" of an airplane. Since it was in the plane of the horizon, I eliminated the taillight idea. Stopped my car while still keeping the object in sight. Stepped out of the car and looked no sound or wind could be detected. The object was a deep orange red. It shot upward in pulses from right to left at about 45 degrees vertical. It shot light pulses intermittent flashes. Suddenly it tracked across the sky toward the south at about an angle of 50 degrees or less with the white side showing. There was no vapor trail at any time. The object appeared to be about midway through this roll showed no light. It finally took up a position to the northeast of me on the horizon and tapered off until completely lost. All this happened in 5 minutes. At this position I would drive through the intersection. I believe there was no doubt in my information. I watched until 7:43 P.M. or a total of 15 minutes later.

Note: I watched across the highway to a gas station and called the attendant's attention to the object. This was 5 minutes after the object vanished in my northwest. He confirmed it's movement. Do not know attendant's name or type of gas sold in his station.
