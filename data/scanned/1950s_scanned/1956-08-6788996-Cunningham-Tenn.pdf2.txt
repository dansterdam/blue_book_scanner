The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text describes an incident in Clarksville, Tennessee, where the witness reported a sound resembling that of a helicopter, but no visual confirmation of an aircraft was made. The document discusses the possibility that the object could have been an unauthorized helicopter, a dirigible, or an experimental device.

The text of the document is as follows:

directly over his home in Clarksville. The sound resembled that of a helicopter, but when the object sought could be found none could be seen. The account of this witness was related in the ATIC Form by the original source. 6. Original source stated that the object could have been an unauthorized helicopter from Ft. Campbell, a dirigible in the area, or an experimental device of some sort.

In light of the above information, evaluation of this HQE is possibly aircraft (helicopter).
