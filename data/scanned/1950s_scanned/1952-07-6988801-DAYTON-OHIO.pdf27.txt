Text from the document:

FLYING SAUCER OVER NEW YORK
(Major George Gorman claimed to have chased a round saucer-like object while flying his F-51 over Fargo North Dakota on October 1, 1948. His account was confirmed by the control tower operator and Police Lt. Sherlock. The saucer moved at an extremely high rate of speed, made a turn that Gorman's fighter could not match, and at one point flew directly at Gorman, only to pull up at the last possible moment. The object emitted a pulsating glow and at times appeared to disappear completely. Gorman was unable to get close enough to the object for a visual identification.)
