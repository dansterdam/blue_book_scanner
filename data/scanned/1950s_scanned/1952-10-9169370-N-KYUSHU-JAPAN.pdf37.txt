AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by 1st Lt LC CORLEY 

The foregoing was a true and complete narrative of the flight of OBJECT observed on 27 October 1952.

Radar Observer  

Amendment to Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952 by 1st Lt Charles R. Dondon, Radar Observer:

Upon picking up the light visually, the Radar Observer attempted to pick up and lock on the target with the radar. Although no return was picked up by the radar, the interference appeared in the approximate azimuth of the object as seen by the pilot and the hand control. The pilot then lost sight of the object. 

This took place shortly after take off and sighting of the light. The Radar Observer did not have time to check the calibration of the set.

After the Pilot and Radar Observer identified the object as a star, the Radar Observer confirmed the star to be the same position and that interference could be produced by moving the hand control rapidly in azimuth, elevation, and sensitivity and gain.

This rapid movement was very similar to the tactics used by the Radar Observers in attempting to pick up the unidentified object.

The foregoing was a true and complete amendment to the narrative of the flight to confirm the sighting from 1952 to 2031 on 27 October 1952.
