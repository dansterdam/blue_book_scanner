THE CASE:
THIS REPORT REACHED HEADQUARTERS AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE INCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY GROUND RADAR IF IT HAD OCCURRED. HOWEVER, CHECKS WITH RADAR STATIONS REVEALED NOTHING. THIS CASE REMAINED UNSOLVED.

THIS INCIDENT WAS OBSERVED BY A FISHERMAN NAMED WALTER C. NUDD, HIS WIFE AND THREE FRIENDS WHILE FISHING FROM THE SHORE ALONG THE COAST OF CONNECTICUT NEAR OLD GREENWICH ON APRIL 10, 1955.

WHILE FISHING, NUDD AND HIS PARTY OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY AROUND 8:50 P.M. APPARENTLY HOVERING OR STATIONARY. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 2 FEET IN DIAMETER.

WHEN FIRST OBSERVED, THE LIGHT WAS ABOUT 30 TO 40 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT THEN SUDDENLY MOVED RAPIDLY TO THE EAST AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 600-800 MILES PER HOUR. AFTER TRAVELING ABOUT 10 DEGREES IN AZIMUTH, IT STOPPED SUDDENLY AND HOVERED FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES. IT THEN MOVED BACK ALONG THE SAME PATH AT THE SAME SPEED, STOPPED AGAIN, AND FINALLY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

THE SIGHTING LASTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES. NUDD AND HIS PARTY WERE ADAMANT THAT WHAT THEY OBSERVED WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT, METEOR, OR ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AERIAL OBJECT.
