9. REMARKS:
A. On 9 October 1951 at 1327Z a radar operator at the Okinawa Ground Control Intercept station, call sign "YB" (260 31' 55" N, 127' 47' 15" E), detected and tracked an unidentified aircraft which approached the station and then turned away. According to the radar operator, AFSC 27290, he was tracking what he thought was a B-29 type aircraft for some time and suddenly it increased in size on the scope and he received a strong reflection. He states that the radar blip was easily distinct from the other known aircraft blips in the area and that the target appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed which he estimated to be in excess of 600 mph. According to the operator, the course of the target was erratic, first approaching the station and then turning away. He states that the track of the blip was always at a 90 degree angle to the direction of the movement. There were no other known aircraft in the vicinity. As soon as the operator went to track the target with the range only switch, the target disappeared from the scope. This occurred several times during the course of the tracking operation.
B. The PPI light beam scope was operating on a PPI scope 40 miles in diameter. The operator first picked up the target at 35 miles range traveling at a very high rate of speed. The target remained in view on the scope for approximately one minute and then faded from the screen. The target appeared as a sharp, intense blip on the scope and the radar operator states the noise level was just bac
