CERTIFICATE

I, 9/3/52 Shockman, Harry D. AF 39213213, do certify that:
On 9/23/52 at approximately 2325 hours I observed, at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, two unidentifiable objects that were moving at a very high rate of speed in a northerly direction and which were not ordinary aircraft. These objects made erratic circles and swerves and disappeared from sight each time I observed them. They appeared to be flying at an altitude of between 5,000 and 10,000 feet.

At this time I observed one small, almost round object approaching the center of the scene from an angle estimated to be about 10 o'clock. After another sweep of the objects, this one also disappeared from sight. What appeared to be a fluorescent glow surrounded the objects, and a pulsating red light was probably visible on the smaller object, which seemed to be in the rear. However, this was not as distinct as I observed on the larger objects. Flight conditions were stable.

My second observation about two minutes later was of three objects about the same size and shape as the previous ones. They were moving in an erratic pattern and were about halfway between center and edge of the scope. Flight conditions stable.
