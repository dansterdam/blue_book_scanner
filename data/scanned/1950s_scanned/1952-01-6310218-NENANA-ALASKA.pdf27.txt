APPENDIX II
Nenana, Alaska - 22 January 1952

1. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
At 10202Z on 22 January 1952, a radar station at Murphy's Dome, Alaska, observed an unidentified radar return. The target was going away from the station on an azimuth of 210Â°, at a ground speed of about 1200 mph when first observed, but appeared to reverse its direction and returned toward the station. The set was adjusted so that the target could be observed in 5 minute intervals and it was observed to make a turn of approximately 180 degrees, and again going away from the station. Just before it faded, it appeared to be making a turn back toward the station.

At 1030Z an F-94 was airborne to search for the object. At this time the object was again being tracked by the radar station and the F-94 was in close proximity, but continued to track the F-94. 

At about 11002 as the F-94 was approaching Nenana (near Fairbanks), the radar observer in the F-94 observed the target, one faint and one bright. The aircraft was at 30,000 ft. and the target was at 25,000 ft. The targets appeared from the light to be a high speed above/below flight. One target was lost at a range of 200 yards.

Approximately one hour later, again near Nenana, another contact was made by the F-94. In this instance, the target was two bright spots and level. When the searchlight was turned on, the target was pulled up and the contact lost. The size of the object or objects was estimated to be 100 feet in diameter. During the encounter, the radar was inoperative through some unknown cause.

During the two airborne contacts the F-94 was being tracked by the ground station but the object was not being locked up.

The weather was clear but no visual sighting was made. On the same night, the same crew had visually identified a C-54 at 6-7,000 feet, and a small civilian aircraft from 300 to 500 yards. There were no clouds in the sky but it was a dark night.

No malfunctions were found in either radar set.
