The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a text document with information about a reported flying saucer sighting in the nation's capital.

THE FLYING SAUCER FAD NEARLY MADE A COMEBACK IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL TONIGHT.
ACCORDING TO RESIDENTS IN THAT AREA, A BRILLIANT FLASHING OBJECT FLASHED ACROSS THE SKY OVER WASHINGTON, D.C. TONIGHT. THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT OBSERVERS, INCLUDING OFFICIALS AT THE NAVAL OBSERVATORY. SAYS THE REPORT: "SAUCERS MAKING A COME-BACK?" REPORTS POURED INTO POLICE STATIONS, NEWSPAPER OFFICES, AND RADIO AND TV STATIONS FROM PERSONS WHO WATCHED THE STRANGE AERIAL DISPLAY.
POLICE AND MILITARY OFFICIALS INVESTIGATED THE PHENOMENON AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD TERMED IT "MERELY A WEATHER BALLOON." AUTHORITIES OFFICIALLY ACCOUNTED FOR THE SIGHTING. REPORTS ARE STILL BEING CHECKED HOWEVER, AND NO DEFINITE ACCOUNT HAS BEEN GIVEN AS YET.

OBJECTS BELIEVED TO BE SATELLITES HAVE SOARED THROUGH THE SKIES IN THREE STATES AND THE NATION'S CAPITAL.
TWO FLASHES OF LIGHT WERE SIGHTED IN THE WEST ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK THIS EVENING. OFFICIALS SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN REFLECTIONS OF SUNLIGHT OFF SATELLITES OR MISSILES. THEIR ALLURING TAILS SAID TO BE "37-38" MILES IN LENGTH. THESE BRILLIANT LIGHTS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN MANY SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY.
