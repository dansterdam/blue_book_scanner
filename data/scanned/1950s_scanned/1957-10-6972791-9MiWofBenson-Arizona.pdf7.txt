The text of the article is as follows:

LANSCOM AIR FORCE BASE, Mass. - The Air Force said today that it will make further tests soon of the first apparent breakthrough into space, which undoubtedly prepares the way for a rocket to the moon.

The first test flight of an experimental rocket which reached a height of 135 miles above the earth's surface and which the Air Force said "could get to the moon" ended in an explosion over the White Sands, N.M., on Sunday.

The rocket experiment showed that the artificial meteors created by an exploding rocket can be detected by radar - a development which the Air Force said could be useful in helping to guide future rockets to the moon and other planets.

HE SAID the rocket would take about 10 minutes to reach the 220-mile distance to the moon and would create a gravitational problem since the moon's gravity would exert a service.

The report said that the rocket, which bore a 40-inch aluminum head, was developed by the Army Ordnance Missile Laboratories and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.

PEOPLE ROCKET
This rocket, known as the Rockair which bears Oct. 15 at the White Sands range, reached an estimated maximum altitude of 135 miles. Its speed was calculated at about 4,000 miles an hour.

The initial announcement of the Rockair experiment was that it had been a "completely successful" flight. However, the announcement said that the rockets' motors exploded as the missile reached the top of its course, during the coast period between the propelled portion of the flight and the return to earth.
