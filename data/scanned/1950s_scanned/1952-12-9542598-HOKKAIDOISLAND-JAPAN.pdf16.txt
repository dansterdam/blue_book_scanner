STATEMENT

I was the pilot on the F-94 and 2nd Lt. Halford C. Jauday was my radar observer on a scramble from Chitose AFB, Japan, at 18:25, 25 December 1952. We were scrambled to investigate an unidentified target that had appeared on the radar scope. The target was first observed at a distance of 20,000 to 25,000 yards and we were directed to close in. We did so in a rectangular search pattern from an altitude of 20,000 to 24,000 feet. The target remained fairly stationary and we were unable to close in more than 10,000 to 12,000 yards. It appeared to be a definite, solid object shedding a grayish white color as opposed to a white color to a white glow to a white color. The object maintained the same relative brightness and size as it would have appeared from a distance of 10,000 to 12,000 yards. It did not appear to have any lights and remained silent and vertical. Ground control radar contact was maintained throughout the operation. Our ground control had visual contact with the object at the same time. Although we expended all our fuel in the vain attempt to close in on the object, we were unable to estimate the range, except to say that it was beyond the 20,000 to 25,000 yard range of our radar. I was unable to estimate the size of the object, except to say that it was larger than a normal aircraft. I was unable to determine the exact speed of the object, except to say that it was definitely faster than our aircraft and that we were unable to close the gap between us and the object. At the termination of our fuel, we returned to base. I could not estimate the exact time of the incident, except to say that it was approximately 30 minutes from the time of scramble until the time we returned to base at 18:55. During the entire time we were airborne, ground control had continuous radar contact with the unidentified target.
