MEMO FOR FILE: 
Radar Scope Photo Bilox~, Mississippi
6 April 1952
The attached photograph was obtained from the Director, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, on 16 April 1952. This photograph is the only one available and must be returned to the Director, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, at the conclusion of the analysis. 
The photograph was taken during radar operations at Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi, on 6 April 1952. The radar set used was a SCR-584 and the scope photograph was taken by Captain Randall M. Selff, 3902nd Radar Evaluation Squadron, Keesler AFB, Biloxi, Mississippi.
The photograph shows an unusual radar presentation which Captain Selff considers of interest. He described the presentation as follows: 
"The radar presentation shows a series of evenly spaced, parallel lines, each line being composed of a series of dots. The lines are oriented in a northeast-southwest direction and appear to be at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. The lines are approximately 5 miles apart and extend across the entire radar scope, which has a range of 120 miles."
No further information or evaluation is available at this time. The photograph is being forwarded for any analysis or comments the Director, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, may wish to make.
