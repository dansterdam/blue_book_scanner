Dear Major:

This note is to let you know I am happily ensconced here in Boulder and to bring a few points to your attention.

First, what is my contract number? I am afraid I left that information in Cambridge, and I will need it when I send in my next voucher.

I recently had a very interesting trip to Pasadena, and while there, by utter chance, I ran into the publisher of the now defunct magazine, 'Saucers'. He is a young student and oddly enough a close friend of a graduate student in astronomy at Harvard. (Don't tell Winezell) they showed me some movie/Kod amateurish shots, one in the incident of December 10, 1957, and another being July 26, 1959, both of which seemed like balloons to me, but the second I am not sure of. The second shows very fine color movies of Venus in the daytime, and for this reason alone, I think they are worth while. Do you have this caseâ€”July 26, 1959, Corpus Christi, Texas? I enclose one enlargement. The image is real, as it appears on a frame after frame, but it might very well be some light on the fuselage of a plane.

I have recently been presented with a publication by our friends in Akron and Cleveland. It is entitled Electro-Magnetic Effects Associated With Unidentified Flying Objects, and it is quite well prepared and presented in a non sensational manner. I am afraid we are going to hear more about this. If by some chance you have not received a copy, I will send you mine for testing.

Have the stereos of the Louisiana case come in yet?
