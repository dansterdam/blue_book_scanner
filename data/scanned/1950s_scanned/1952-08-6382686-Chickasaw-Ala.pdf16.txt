STATUS REPORT OF 29 August 1952
1919th AACS Squadron Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama
I went on duty at the GCA trailer at 1900, 29 August 1952, and was to stay out there all night as a trailer guard radar operator. Sometime past nine the tower called and asked me to scan to the north and on a 360 degree angle. I turned on the radar locator of the AN/FPN-1 set to the north. There was nothing out there on the scope. I called the tower back and asked them what it was all about. They said to go ahead to stand watch on the 360 degree angle, that the officer of the day was up there, and to report anything at all that I saw on the scope. A little bit later I noticed a return, not of two distinct, but of one about four (4) miles on a bearing of 260 degrees. It did not move. When I called the tower and told them of this, they told me to continue watching it, which I did. I watched it about half an hour. The rest of the team (GCA Team) came out and we turned the new set, an AN/CPN-4, on to see if we could see anything. Nothing was visible above or through the ground clutter on the new set. As far as we could see, it did not move and did not get any more definite. None of us are very familiar with the AN/CPN-4 scope and couldn't notice any difference. I discontinued watching about 0030, 29 August 1952.
