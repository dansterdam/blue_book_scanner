"Following is a report from a letter received on August 23, 1956:

Report of unidentified flying object near Cincinnati, Ohio, at 9:55 p.m. on September 12, 1955. The object was described as round, white in color, and about the size of a regular passenger aircraft. It was observed for several minutes hovering and moving around, then it accelerated at a very rapid rate and disappeared into the sky. No sound was heard. 

The witness, a man in his late 40's, was a reputable citizen and his report was considered reliable. He stated that there were no other witnesses to this incident. Due to the lateness of the hour, he did not attempt to get any photographs.

So from the data at hand, this appears to have been an unidentified aerial phenomenon. There is no further information available regarding this incident.

Sincerely,
[redacted]"
