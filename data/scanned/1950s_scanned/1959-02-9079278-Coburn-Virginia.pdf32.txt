ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 19, 1959 AROUND MIDNIGHT, MEMBERS OF THE CUMBERLAND COUNTRY CLUB, CUMBERLAND, VA., AT THE LAKE OF THE COUNTRY CLUB, ABOUT 9:30 P.M. OBSERVED A SMALL, HOVERING TYPE CRAFT WITH A REDDISH-WHITE LIGHT AND A STEADY RANGE OF THREE OR FOUR TIMES THE SIZE DIAMETER OF THE FULL MOON, WHICH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 1000-1500 FEET IN THE AIR. THE CRAFT HOVERED FOR ABOUT 5-10 MINUTES AND THEN SHOT STRAIGHT UP OUT OF SIGHT. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS: SLIGHTLY MISTY, HUMIDITY, FAIRLY COLD, THERMOMETER SHOWN AS 40 DEGREES. THERE WERE NO SOUNDS HEARD, AS WAS NORMAL FOR MOST OBSERVATIONS OF THIS TYPE. A SIMILAR OBJECT HOVERED AND WAS OBSERVED BY ALL THE MEMBERS WHO REMAINED AS THEY CONGREGATED AT THE LAKE. THE SAME OBJECT WAS OBSERVED AGAIN CLOSE TO 1:00 A.M. FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MINUTES. THE MOST OF THOSE WHO OBSERVED IT WERE QUITE AWED BY THE SIGHT OF THIS OBJECT.
