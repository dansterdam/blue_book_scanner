The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a handwritten document text describing an observation or report of some kind. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the full text from the document:

"The round object had been was a black, side. All around that were somewhat hazy, floating white, puffs of smoke. It was 3 to 5 minutes before it started to move. It was warm and midummer morning.
From 9:15 to 9:30 a.m. the date (1) April 13, 1954.
It was about 3:00 a.m. on the 24 when the object was first observed, size of a large head, white, which lifted up and down, and up and down, at times, seem to change to another position, always coming back to the same spot."
