"At 0015 EST on 12 October 1950, a first target, M-17 at 25-30 miles, appeared at 270 degree radial. Then at 0023, a second target, M-17 at 35-40 miles, appeared at 315 degree. These targets appeared and faded in rapid succession (within 2-3 minutes)."

"Called ATC; they had no report of an Aircraft at this time - 0023."

"Notified Atlanta; they had no flight plans on anything coming from that direction."

"Arrow (Fighter Aircraft) airborne at 2330 E.S.T. and vectored on 250 degrees; Angels (Altitude) 2500. There were three perfect intercepts on the scope on N-35, but no joy (Fighter Aircraft made no contact)."

"Very shortly after pancake, various targets again appeared through the area. They gave good paints (Targets) on the Radar Scope but faded completely at times and then would reappear."

"TAPE still had no report for us, but had alerted all guards and were beginning to get suspicious out in case they were needed."

"We did not report these additional plots to Nobody (Call sign for Air Defense Command Control Center, Selfridge Field, M.I.). Until October (Call Sign Orlando) called in Summers at this time and explained that the same Radar Race (activity on the Radar Scope) had been noted but considered of no importance at the time."
