The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten letter. The letter appears to be from a person named "Capt. Walter Gurthentin, Jr." who is writing to the Air Force Esa in Dayton, Ohio. The letter discusses a newspaper article that the writer had previously reported on and provides some details about his observations of what he believes to be a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The letter contains no image, only the handwritten text.

Dear Sir,

In a recent newspaper article, a discussion of the previous six or seven years ago when I reported a sighting and I am still quite positive that mine is probably one of the sio.

I think I made one error in my report. I believe I was mistaken on the direction of movement. It seem moved from east to west and it was moving very fast. I know it was not a conventional aircraft and it could not possibly have come from AMB to SDV.

Haven't had a bit of luck in reporting this in 8 years and still feel convinced that I saw something unusual. I have seen aircraft, astral bodies and all types of natural phenomena, but this was unlike anything I have ever seen or heard of before. This theory doesn't hold up. 

If I did not keep a copy of my report, would it be at all possible for me to get a copy of it? And check it.

Yours sincerely,
