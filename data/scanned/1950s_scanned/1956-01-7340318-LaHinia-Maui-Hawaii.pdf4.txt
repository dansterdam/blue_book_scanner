11.  Director of Intelligence, DCS/o, Hq. 7th Air Force, APO 915.

          Observer is mature, sincere, intelligent and respectable. She has read the book
      "Flying Saucers Are Real" but states she does not believe in it. Unable to identify
      or analyze what she saw, she reported sighting to CAA authority.

          This is not the first or most recent sighting by named observer. (Four (+) in
      1952 and six (6) since 6 January 1956.)

          Observer was surprised that a dime held at arms length would cover the moon
      (near half phase). This discounts considerably her estimate of the size of the UFPCBs.
      It is my opinion observer has been seeing exhaust and/or navigation lights of local
      aircraft. Diffusion and refraction of such lights passing through the dense
      atmosphere close to the earths surface accounts for observers generous estimates of
      size and color.

          It is impractical to check air traffic for even this one (1) sighting;

          a. CAA has no record of such a flight.
