OCR Text Output:

ON 6 January 1953, between the hours of 0152 and 1318 hours, personnel from the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Turner Air Force Base, Albany, Georgia, who were on a training mission from their base, reported a highly luminous object visually observed west of Dallas, Texas. This object was observed by all personnel on board the aircraft and ground observers at Dallas, Texas. One report would indicate the object was as large as a DC-3 aircraft. It had the appearance of an extremely bright, reddish-orange light and appeared to be disc-shaped. The object was observed on several occasions during the period mentioned and maneuvers indicated it was under intelligent control. No sound was reported by any of the observers. The object disappeared from sight in a vertical climb at a tremendous rate of speed. Some of the pilots and observers feel this to be the kind of object that has been described in numerous "flying saucer" reports.
