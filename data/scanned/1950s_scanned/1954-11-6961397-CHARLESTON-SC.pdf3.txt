SEA-DART EXPLOSION x 
Convair Jet 
Blast Baffles
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 6 (AP)â€”A sudden, unexplained explosion ripped open a Navy Sea-Dart fighter as it was being moved to a test area at the General Dynamics plant of General Atomic Division at Sycamore Canyon yesterday afternoon. 
The crowd, including a host of Navy and General Dynamics officials, watched in awe as the 30-foot-long fighter suddenly disintegrated and got into position for a high-altitude test-
The explosion, which occurred in the vicinity of the tail assembly, was believed to have been caused by an internal failure of the aircraft which had been undergoing ground checks before the test.
Lt. Charles E. Richbourg, 32, who was standing near the fighter, was thrown into the air by the force of the explosion and struck the ground about 30 feet away. He suffered a broken neck and other minor injuries.
Richbourg, a test pilot, still was strapped to his escape seat and descending by parachute when Convair Company divers immediately went into the cold water to rescue him. 
The aircraft wreckage plunged into the water about two minutes later.
The flyer, who joined the Navy in 1941, survived his fatal experience uninjured, except for minor bruises to his face and hands. He has been hospitalized for observation.
Company and Navy officials intend today to investigate the cause of the mysterious crash.
