The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It does not contain any photographs, only text. I will now transcribe the text from the document:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

HEADQUARTERS OF CHARACTER:

TO: Whom It May Concern:

I have on five occasions sighted a mystifying flying object. The first sighting was on the night of January 29, 1953. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and gave off a brilliant light. It changed direction abruptly and then disappeared. I saw this object on four other occasions. The object is quite different from any aircraft I have ever seen. It is not prone to talk much. It told me about his experience for several days after the incident that occurred.

Known with a large number of the neighbors, including some who have known him intimately for many years, stated that he has always been considered a very reliable and truthful person. None have ever known him to be otherwise. The man is quite normal and friendly in his behavior. He is of good reputation in the community.

As far as I know from my own investigation, I would say that the report of Mr. Conway is substantial and reliable.
