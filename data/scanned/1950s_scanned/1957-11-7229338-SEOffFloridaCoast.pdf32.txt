ALAMOGORDO, N.M., NOV. 5-- (UP)-- AN ELECTRONICS ENGINEER REPORTED
SEEING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ON AN ISOLATED DESERT HIGHWAY
NEAR ALAMOGORDO IN SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO YESTERDAY.

J.A. STRIPE, 42, AN ENGINEER IN AN UPPER AIR RESEARCH PROJECT
AT THE AIR FORCE MISSILE DEVELOPMENT CENTER NEAR ALAMOGORDO, SAID
10 AUTOMOBILES STOPPED OR WERE STOPPED WHEN THE OBJECT APPEARED
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON ON U.S. HIGHWAY 54, BETWEEN WHITE SANDS
PROVING GROUNDS AND the AIR FORCE MISSILE DEVELOPMENT CENTER.

EARLIER IN THE DAY, OFFICIALS AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS SAID
TWO ARMY PATROLS REPORTED SEEING A SIMILAR OBJECT OR OBJECTS ON
SUNDAY.

SIMILAR REPORTS CAME SUNDAY FROM LEVELLAND, TEX.

A DISPATCH FROM HONOLULU SAID A NUMBER OF FIJI ISLAND NATIVES AND
A WHITE CLERGYMAN REPORTED SEEING A SIMILAR OBJECT IN THE SOUTH
PACIFIC SKIES LAST MONTH. THE STRANGE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED FOUR TIMES
THE WEEK OF OCT. 13-19. ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT REPORT
ISSUED IN FIJI. CAPTAIN THE ISLAND GROUP

IN A TAPED INTERVIEW FOR NEWS DIRECTOR AT
STATION KAIG IN ALAMOGORDO, REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT APPROACHED FROM
THE NORTHEAST OVER THE SACRAMENTO MOUNTAINS. HE SAID THE FIRST
INDICATION THAT SOMETHING WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY WAS A GRADUAL FADING
OF THE RADIO IN HIS AUTOMOBILE.

THEN, HE SAID, THE CAR ENGINE DIED, AND HE NOTICED THAT SEVERAL
OTHER CARS ON THE HIGHWAY HAD STOPPED. STOKES SAID HE NOTICED THAT THE
OCCUPANTS WERE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CARS AND POINTING TO THE SKY.

LOOKING UP, I SAID IN THE INTERVIEW, â€œI SAW A LIGHT-
COLORED, EGG-SHAPED OBJECT MAKING A SHALLOW DIVE ACROSS THE SKY TO
THE NORHEAST.

THEN IT WHEELED AND MADE A PASS AT THE HIGHWAY, ACROSS THE ROAD
MORE THAN TWO MILES AHEAD.

IT THEN MOVED AWAY TOWARD THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS NEAR WHITE SANDS
PROVING GROUNDS TO THE SOUTHWEST.

AS IT PASSED AT ITS CLOSEST POINT I COULD FEEL A KIND OF HEAT
BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND.

IT HAD NO VISIBLE PORTHOLES AND THERE WAS NO VAPOR TRAIL. SMOKE
OR FLAME VISIBLE.

STOKES SAID HE REMEMBERED THE DETAILS PRECISELY BECAUSE HE PULLED
OUT A NOTEBOOK AND JOTTED DOWN EVERYTHING HE SAW.

WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY CAR AND CHECKED THE ENGINE, I FOUND IT
INTACT, BUT THE BATTERY WAS STAINING. IT STARTED WITH NO TROUBLE
AND I HEADED FOR A PHONETO NOTIFY OFFICIALS AT THE AIR FORCE MISSILE
DEVELOPMENT CENTER AT ALAMOGORDO.

(AN AIR FORCE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER TOLD UNITED PRESS LAST
NIGHT HE HAD NO INFORMATION TO REPORT.)

SAID HE NOTED LATER, AFTER HE REACHED HOME, THAT HE HAD
SEVERE SUNBURN.

HE SAID MOST OF THE MOTORISTS WHO SAW THE OBJECT WERE ENGINEERS
OR TECHNICIANS WHO WORK ON ROCKET PROJECTS AT WHITE SANDS. HE IDENTIFI
TWO OTHERS AT THE SCENE AS OF LAS CRUCES, N.M., AND A
MR. ALSO OF LAS CRUCES.

SAID THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 500 FEET IN LENGTH,
WITH A SHINY SURFACE LIKE MOTHER OF PEARL.

OFFICIALS AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS, WHERE MISSILES ARE TESTED,
SAID TWO SEPARATE MILITARY PATROLS REPORTED SEEING AN UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING OBJECT (OR OBJECTS) SUNDAY OVER AN ISOLATED AREA OF THE PROVING
GROUNDS, NEAR TRINITY SITE WHERE THE FIRST ATOMIC BOMB WAS
EXPLODED IN 1945.

THEY INVESTIGATED THE SITE, BUT FOUND NO MARKINGS.
THE HONOLULU REPORT SAID THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS REPORTED
