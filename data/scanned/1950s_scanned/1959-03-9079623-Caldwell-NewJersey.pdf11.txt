SUBJECT: "Moon Objects"

TO: ATIC-424
Attn: Maj. Friend

1. The photograph you submitted for analysis was scrutinized for possible classification of its "moon objects". The photograph was of good quality and the analysis was studied and found to be quite interesting. The "moon objects" did not appear to be foreign objects or Phenomena which would have significance. The quality of the photograph is good and reflects his work of a professional photographer.

2. Before this office can offer an explanation for the "moon objects" it will be necessary to require the original negative, preferably together with the remainder of the roll film.

3. Should you desire further analysis of this photography, it is requested that contact be made with this office for assistance in forwarding the film for further analysis.
