APPENDIX VII
Nenana, Alaska - 22 January 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
At 10020Z on 22 January 1952, a radar station at Murphy's Dome, Alaska, observed an unidentified radar return. The target was going away from the station on an azimuth of 219Â° at a speed of about 1500 mph when first observed but appeared to reverse its direction and returned toward the station. The set was about to lose the target but after this change was made, the target appeared again and was observed a gain going away from the station. 

At 10202 an F-94 was airborne to search for the object. At this time the object was going away from the station at a high rate of speed so the F-94 was unable to close this distance but continued to track the F-94.

At about 1100Z the F-94 (while approaching Nenana, near Fairbanks), the radar observer in the F-94 observed two targets, one faint and one bright. The distance was 21,000 ft. and the bright target appeared to be traveling slowly and was the F-94. The contact was lost.

Approximately one hour later, again near Nenana, another contact was made by the F-94. In this instance the target was kept dead ahead and level. When this target was a range of 300 yards, the pilot pulled up and the target was lost. The rate of closure during the run was 100 knots even though the F-94 had flaps down. No other contacts were made and the aircraft was released at 1340Z.

During the two airborne contacts the F-94 was being tracked by the ground station but the object was not being picked up.

The weather at the time was very good. The moon was high and the sky was clear. On the same evening a few hours later, the same crew had visually identified a C-54 and a C-47 aircraft from 500 to 600 yards. There were no clouds in the sky but it was a dark night. 

No malfunctions were found in either radar set.
