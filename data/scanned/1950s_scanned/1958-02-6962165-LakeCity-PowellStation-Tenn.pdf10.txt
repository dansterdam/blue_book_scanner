Moonwatch Observations of Satellites: 1958 Alpha, 1958 Beta One, 1958 Beta Two, and 1958 Gamma
By 
Leon Campbell, Jr.*

Since the launchings of the U.S. artificial earth satellites 1.3, 1958 observations have been participating in the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's visual observing program. This program has recorded a total of 59 observation points, these observations being made between March 19 and March 26 of 1958. In addition, the first sighting of 1959y was reported on March 27, 1959.

All observations listed in the following catalogue were listed in the Smithsonian Observatory's computer program for determining satellite points. Some very few other observations are used because the timing of the observations was not to the second or the position of one observing was useful since, having been made during very early twilight or the satellite had just passed almost overhead, certain preliminary orbital elements were useful.

It will be understood that at this time, only days after the 1958 and 1959 launchings, the observations reported of 1958 and 1959 are preliminary values and not yet confirmed by computations and analysis as they may easily develop that some of these sightings must be discarded later.

The observations (by telephone and cable) from MOONWATCH stations in the United States, Australia, Union of South Africa, and Japan. The faintness of the objects and the small inclination of their orbits to the horizon presented conditions that only the most acute observers could recognize and observe. Of the 235 observations associated with this project. 126 of these located in the United States and 104 in other countries.
