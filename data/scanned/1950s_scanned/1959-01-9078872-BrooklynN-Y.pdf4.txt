The image contains three sketches or illustrations. The larger sketch on the left depicts a road or street scene with buildings and trees on either side. A person is standing on the road. The smaller sketch on the right shows a landscape with a curved horizon line and a sun-like object in the sky. The middle sketch shows a larger version of the curved horizon line and sun-like object from the right-hand sketch.

Here is the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
