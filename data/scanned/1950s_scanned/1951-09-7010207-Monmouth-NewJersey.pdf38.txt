There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, containing descriptive text about a balloon observation.

that is the balloon was 1000-2000 ft altitude that a PPi scope would not 
the balloon having the velocity caused by the horizontal components of wind.
Therefore, it is not expected that any faulty ballast release would result in
high horizontal velocities. His final analysis was that if high horizontal
velocity were indicated on the scope that this would not be the result of a balloon.
Dr. Behmer was queried on signal strength of a balloon and would it give
signal strength of a B-29 or B-35 at 20,000 yds. He stated that if the balloon
was painted silver as many of them are and it was at an altitude of 5000'or hg
higher, that signal response would be equal to that of a B-29 or B-35 at 20,000 ft.
His comment was that in general these balloons were used for soundings of between
30,000 and 110,000 ft (extent of Benet's knowledge). He also stated that sun
could make a balloon look as if it were oscillating.
2. Combined meteorological and oblique incident wave front.
A wave front such as this could give a signal response giving great
apparent speed on a radar scope, even though the actual speed of this wave is
low.
