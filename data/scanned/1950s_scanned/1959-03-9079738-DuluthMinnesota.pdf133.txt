II. SUMMARY: On 23 March 1959, at approximately 0800 CST, the witness (Lt. Chapman) was proceeding in a security patrol car on the north perimeter road of the Duluth Municipal Airport. He observed three bright, shiny silver-colored, round or disc-shaped objects hovering and maneuvering in the air over the airport. The objects were approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the ground and about 1/2 mile southwest of the witness' position. The objects were completely silent, with no visible means of propulsion. Lt. Chapman stated that Lt. Colonel GALLAHAN, the 148th Fighter Interceptor Squadron Commander, also observed these objects.

III. DETAILS: The three objects first appeared in sight at approximately 0800 CST, March 23, 1959. Lt. Chapman estimated their size as approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. The objects hovered and maneuvered silently for about 10-15 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and climbed out of sight at an estimated altitude of 25,000 feet. No exhaust or contrails were visible. The objects were observed to be silver-colored and round or disc-shaped. Two of the objects flew in tight, circular maneuvers, while the third object remained stationary.

Upon completion of his patrol, Lt. Chapman immediately reported his sighting to Lt. Colonel GALLAHAN. Lt. Colonel GALLAHAN stated that he had also observed the objects from the control tower and had called the radar station in an attempt to get a radar fix on the targets. However, the radar could not pick up the unidentified objects.

The two (2) targets that performed the circular maneuvers were lost after approximately 10 minutes, while the third stationary object remained in sight for a total of 15 minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

The practice of intercepting unidentified aerial objects was discussed, and GALLAHAN stated that to take a photo of such objects, a 35MM camera would have to be on constant alert at the control tower, and that the pilots were not equipped to get close enough to take a photo. GALLAHAN expressed the opinion that the objects were not aircraft, but were unidentified flying objects.
