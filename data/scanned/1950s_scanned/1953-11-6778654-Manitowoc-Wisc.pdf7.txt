The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marker and a dotted line indicating the position of an object above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger view, with a person standing on a road, and two smaller sketches - one showing a detailed view of an object's position, and another showing a more simplified view of the horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
