Analysis and conclusions:
A. The metal strips found in several locations surrounding Coeburn, Va. are identical to one type of chaff used for jamming radar.
B. Due to the time lapse of up to three months between the sightings and the investigations, it is rather difficult to draw a valid conclusion as to the nature of the reported sightings. However, it is the considered opinion of the analyst that several things contributed to these sightings:
(1) The presence of a large number of open coke ovens in the area.
(2) The prevailing weather on most of the subject evenings.
(3) The apparent inability of some witnesses to determine when an automobile was traveling along a road located on top of a ridge.
