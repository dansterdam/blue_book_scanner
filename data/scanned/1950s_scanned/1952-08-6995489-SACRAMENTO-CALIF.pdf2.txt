1. A sketch illustrating how to draw a curved line to show the height of the observed object above the horizon.
2. A sketch illustrating how to place an "A" at the position where the observed object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where it was when you last saw it.
3. A sketch that appears to show the motion of the observed object, with an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end.
