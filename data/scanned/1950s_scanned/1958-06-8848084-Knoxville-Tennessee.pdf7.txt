JOINT MESSAGEFORM - CONTINUATION SHEET
FROM: COMDR, ATIC
4. CATEGORY PLOT (Aero Chart, WAC, No. 289) and analysis indicates sun approximately at 45 degree elevation and to the East; object descending to SW, and over large body of water, continuous to the reflection or light; and peculiar reflection of sunlight off some aircraft fuselage in the distance. This well-known type of reflection behaves an erratic in a brilliant halo of light, generally washing out its wing and tail surfaces - giving it a thin, slender, cylindrical appearance. Gen. Brandt's description of a pencil-like appearance and brilliant white color tentatively supports this.
5. Checks here with appropriate agency do not indicate any balloons, no reports of any UFOs or anything unusual from radar, AACS, GCI or other units and persons in that area and time. Your checks will probably require military and civil aircraft flights checks for the area. (APR 200-2)
Remote possibility of daytime "bolide" being checked out here, but improbably.
6. SIGNIFICANT to point out that instead of an electrical report being made of incident for expeditious action, incident was reported by routine 112, without copies to ATIC. UFO not reported until 12 July 58, all in general non-conformity with APR 200-2 for immediate reporting and transmission of UFO sightings. Therefore, action taken by you and command indicated should be secured this center.
