STATEMENT

It was 0415 on the 25th day of May 1953 we were coming back from Kirkland Lake, there were four airmen and myself. We turn on to the road to the base. Just then we saw a light on the left of the hill, then it went right over the hill. It stayed there for short one minute; then it started up the hill. It was a big orange ball, after we got up to the hill we didn't see it.
