A flying saucer was reported to have landed yesterday, in the region of Mosjoen, about 300 kilometers northeast of Trondheim. The pilot, a young man, was seen by two sisters who were picking berries in the mountains, according to a local paper. An offshoot of Mosjoen police force confirmed the fact that the two sisters, aged respectively 24 and 32 years, who are not believed to have understood the saucer land. 
According to them, the pilot wore an aviator's overall with no buttons. At the top of his head he had a kind of clear bowl. He got into the machine again, and took off fast and vertically. 
The ladies did not dare to get closer to the machine, and can give no further details. In spite of their statement, the local police will go tomorrow to the landing spot in the hope of finding some trace of the flying saucer.
