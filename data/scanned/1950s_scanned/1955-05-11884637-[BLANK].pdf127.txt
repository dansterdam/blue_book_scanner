EXPLANATION AND COMMENTS: No photographic or other physical evidence (other than the observer's verbal report) has been submitted in conjunction with this sighting. Little is known about the actual physical characteristics of the object except that it was described as a bright, elongated object with a red tail. The initial report made no mention of size, altitude, or speed. It is possible that the object was a meteor or other astronomical phenomenon, but without more specific descriptive data, its identity cannot be definitely established.
