STATEMENT

On the morning 4 December 1952, I /Ic 'Walter Hope, and I /c/20 Arthur A. Vallerie, had witnessed an incident which we were adjusting a scope when we heard one of the operators call that he had an unusual object on the scope and that it was moving very fast. It was to the screen and saw an object moving approximately 20 degrees per second. We checked the scope about 100 miles out. We observed the object for several minutes and it was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. After a few sweeps disappeared. To my knowledge this was no radar malfunction.
