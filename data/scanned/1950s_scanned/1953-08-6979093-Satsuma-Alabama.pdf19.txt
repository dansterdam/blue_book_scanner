WORLD SCIENCE REVIEW
SATSUMA 17/18 AUGUST 1953, MEXICO

Mexican Adventure

Flying Saucers are still news. World Science Review is frequently asked to publish articles on this continuous topic and we here give, without comments or necessarily agreement, the author's report on one of the investigations made during a recent tour of the American, where he addressed numerous meetings and spoke on thirty radio and T.V. circuits about flying saucers.

SALVADOR VILLANUEVA is about 5 ft 2 in tall, dark-skinned, 55 years old, and has a wife and seven children. He neither smokes nor drinks, and is respected in his community, being a driver - moving large loads of materials for the building of roads and railways.

For some time he feared to tell of his experience though him described or read (now and then) others have had the phenomenon. One day, however, while delivering some newspaper in the town, a reporter began a series of articles on flying saucers. He used Villanueva`s name as the authority, since that day he has told his story to newspaper reporters, and his accuracy as a reporter. He has come through all dealings all with full marks.

Breakdown
On August 17, 1953, at 7:20 p.m., Villanueva was employed by a people of Texas tourists to drive them from Mexico City to Brayson Border. Everything went well on the trip until they had just passed Monclova, which is about 180 miles from the Border. Suddenly the car began to slow down and finally stopped. Examination showed that it had broken from the differential. The driver said that the car would go no further and that it would be necessary to get a lift.

The Texans were angry. They demanded immediate help. Villanueva said he would summon help and stepped out of the car. He became aware that he had company - two strange men were already by his car. They were good-looking and much taller than he, perhaps over 6 ft in height. They had bright blue eyes, light hair and fine features. Villanueva asked whether he could help them.

"Yes, we have come near here to invite the two visitors to shelter with him in the car." When they were inside they continued the conversation:

"Where do you come from, if I may ask?"
"We come far - very far!"
And they smiled.
Still before there was nothing wrong
until, as the night descended, his strange new friends showed by their manner that they were much too nervous for an ordinary man, not only their world but ours. The spoke of things that he had never heard before. And people that made Villanueva a little disturbed, hurriedly at a question that was creeping into his mind.

"Are we not of this planet? We come from one far distant. But we have come to help you."

Of course, he did not believe them right away. At first he felt they were mad. But the second man's smile told him. Several minutes later during the night he came to the conclusion they were telling the truth. By the time dawn broke he was a very confused man.

Invitation
After sunrise, his companions said they would take him to their spacecraft. He said he would like to see them, since he was still hardly believing, hoping to find a conventional airplane or vehicle and them. They led him away through the bushes and suddenly the ground gave way beneath his feet, and he was sinking into muddy people. Sometimes almost to his knees. But he made no effort to get free. They kept a firm grasp on each of his arms.

After a while they stopped and the feeling that he was approaching something invisible became very strong. Suddenly, the ground gave way entirely, and to his great astonishment, there stood, a magnificent silvery craft, shaped like two saucers joined together. It was enormous.

His companions smiled and invited him aboard. He hesitated only a moment, then followed them into the craft, through an opening which appeared and closed behind him. Once inside, he was taken to a room where he was interviewed at length. The men in front of him seemed to understand his tongue perfectly, though he could not understand theirs. They showed him many things that left him utterly amazed.

After about three hours, during which his strange hosts had explained many things to him, they escorted him back to the place where they had first met him. As they reached the spot, the craft rose silently into the air and disappeared from sight.

Villanueva stood alone, stunned and wondering what had happened to him. He retraced his steps, found his car, and drove it to the nearest town. There he told his story, but it was received with ridicule and disbelief. However, the next day, the two visitors returned and he invited them to his home, where they stayed with him for two days. When they left, they gave him a small object, a souvenir, he says, and assured him that they would return.
