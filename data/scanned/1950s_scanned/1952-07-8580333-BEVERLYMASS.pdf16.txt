The image appears to contain a photograph of what the caption describes as "A Coast Guard Photograph" of "Flying Saucers?". The photograph shows an indistinct image in the sky that seems to be a flying object or objects.

The text in the document states:

WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 - Coast Guard headquarters reported today that a Coast Guard air station at Beverly, Mass., Coast Guard air station in Salem, Mass., had sighted mysterious objects in the sky yesterday.  The officer in charge stated that the sighting was the first daylight one ever made by a Coast Guard station and that he has ordered a report on the matter.  The report said that the objects were commonly described as "flying saucers."  However, officials who view the pictures say they do not show any reality of flying saucers.  The pictures are officially released only for the fact that the original had been shown to other newspapers and magazines, it was stated at Coast Guard headquarters in Denver.
