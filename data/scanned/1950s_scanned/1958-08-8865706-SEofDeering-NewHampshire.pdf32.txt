Transcription of the text:

cannot be identified as the correct time. The conditions are to be considerable under this direction. The movement was so slow and deliberate that one observed it for several minutes. The object was bright-shiny in appearance, somewhat shaped like a football, but flattened on the bottom and top. It appeared to be about 500 feet high and about 50 feet in diameter. The object's speed was very slow approximately 20 mph and it traveled in a straight line to the southwest. There was no noise, smoke or exhaust visible. The object at times seemed to flicker or pulsate with a steady glow. After being observed for several minutes the object suddenly increased its speed and disappeared in the southwest direction. The weather was clear, visibility excellent. No clouds in the sky and the wind was calm.
