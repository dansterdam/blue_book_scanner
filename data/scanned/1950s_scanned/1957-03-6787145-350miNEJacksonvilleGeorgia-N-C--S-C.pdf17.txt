STATEMENT

On 9 March 1957, at 0110 hours EST, I was copilot in a C-47 aircraft flying approximately 35 miles south of Columbia, South Carolina, at an altitude of 3,000 feet. At this time we sighted an object which was estimated to be 500 feet above our altitude and approximately 2-3 miles in the distance. The object was a fiery ball, round in color, with a white trail. As we approached to within 1 mile, the object remained stationary. Suddenly it started to speed up, and as it did so, the light was turned off. There were no exhaust or other means of propulsion visible, and the object seemed to cease to exist, leaving no trace.
