The image contains a photograph of what appears to be an unusual radar sighting. The photograph shows a blurred or obscured object in the sky, which is the subject of the report described in the text below the image.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

1. USAF, ACOTN-BKNG, 10 JUNE 55, UNUSUAL RADAR SIGHTING

1ST LT (AGSM-34/V. D. EWING 1/26 JUN 55
AICO, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO
TO: ACOTN-BKNG

The 4h unidentified targets reported to in this report, they all indicated on the radar scope, increasing in size and finally disappearing completely. The targets were very small, and the most prominent one would be considered about the size of a tank. The fact that the targets were small, indicates that the objects were small. Like wise, the fact that they increased in size and then decreased, is no assurance that the targets were real, as the same effect can be caused by reflections. While the report says nothing definite as to the nature of the targets, it does indicate the possibility of some phenomena which must be considered.
