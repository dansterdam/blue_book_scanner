Ball of Fire Seen In Southern Skies
Object, Visible 500 Miles, Quickly Burns Out
NEW ORLEANS, June 28 (UP) - A great ball of fire visible for 500 miles burned for a few seconds high in the southern sky tonight and then diminished out, leaving a curving trail of glowing vapor.
Col. H.M. Decker, chief of the Civil Aeronautics Administration here, said the sighting object was reported from Tuscumbia, Ala., Houston, Tex., and a plane 200 miles southward over the Gulf of Mexico.
Bert Rynear said: "It looked like a tremendous globe and was emitting a brilliant orange-red light. It was burning out as it fell, followed by a white vapor trail. It made a hissing sound and then a white puff of smoke."
At Cape Girardeau, United States Weather forecaster here, said "the object appeared to be tremendous brilliance in the western sky at 7:45 p.m. C.S.T. It was more brilliant than any meteor I have ever seen." He added: "It was continuing its flight for two or three seconds. It left a long, white smoke or vapor trail which is something I have never seen a meteor do."
