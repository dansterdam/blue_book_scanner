The image appears to contain a graph or diagram, but no photograph. The graph shows a curved line with angle markings from 20 degrees to 330 degrees on the x-axis, and what looks like a scale or measurement system on the y-axis. There are no human faces or identifiable individuals present in this image.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and provide the text found in the document:

160*180*140*130*120*110*100*90*80*70*60*50*40*30*20*
