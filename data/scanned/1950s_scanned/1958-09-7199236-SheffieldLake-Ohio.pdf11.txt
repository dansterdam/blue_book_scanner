Dear Sir:
This is a request for the official conclusion on my UFO report.
My sighting took place on September 21, 1958, at my home in Sheffield Lake, Ohio. It was investigated on October 3 and 4 by Sgt. Hof and Sgt. Haistad, both of the Air Technical Intelligence Center.
I was assured by the sergeants that the conclusion would be available to me within thirty days. They also said that if the case is in the "known" category I will be furnished with the evidence which indicated that conclusion.
Please send the conclusion as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
Mrs. [Redacted]
