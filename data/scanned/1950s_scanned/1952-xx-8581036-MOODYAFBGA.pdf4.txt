1. According to the SOURCE, at approximately 2320 hours to 2323 hours on 23 July 1952, he observed one (1) unusual flying object which was round in shape and appeared to be a bright light. He estimated the size of the object to be approximately three and one half (3½) feet in diameter. The object was yellowish-white in color and maintained the same color throughout the entire period of the sighting. Only one (1) object was observed. The SOURCE could not determine the aerodynamic features of the object. No trail or exhaust was observed and the propulsion system could not be determined. SOURCE stated during the first interview that the speed of the object was approximately fifty (50) miles per hour. During the second interview he stated the speed of the object was about one hundred (100) miles per hour. No sound was heard coming from the object. SOURCE observed the object in a northeast direction at an altitude of about one (1) mile. The distance was estimated to be one (1) mile. The object traveled for about one (1) minute in a direct course toward the point of observation. Approximately one quarter (¼) a mile away from SOURCE and at an altitude of about two hundred (200) yards, the object ceased to travel abruptly and came to a very complete standstill for about one (1) minute. The object then rose in a vertical position at an extremely high speed for one (1) minute and disappeared. The color of the object faded as it disappeared. No other unusual features were observed by the SOURCE.
