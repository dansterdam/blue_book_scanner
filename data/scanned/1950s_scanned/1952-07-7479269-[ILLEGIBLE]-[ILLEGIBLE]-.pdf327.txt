As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

19. Lt. Brinkle, a ground observer, came to the station from Westfield, Mass., and reported this:
At about 4:10 a.m. EST he observed two large, bright white lights, one directly above the other, moving very rapidly in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 500-1000 mph. The lights appeared to be at an altitude of 25,000-30,000 feet. After being visible for about 1 1/2-2 minutes, they disappeared from view.
Lt. Brinkle said that they were much larger and brighter than any aircraft lights he had ever seen. In his opinion, they were definitely not conventional aircraft lights.
20. Capt Donovan and 1st Lt. McCarthy of the F-94 squadron located at Mitchel Air Force Base were dispatched to investigate the area, but were unable to sight the objects. They did however, observe a bright, seemingly stationary light which they were unable to identify.
