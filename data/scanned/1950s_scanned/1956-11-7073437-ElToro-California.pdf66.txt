EL TORO, CALIFORNIA - 7 November 1956

On 7 November 1956 at El Toro, California, a radar tracking film was taken of a bright light object which was observed in the sky. The film and other data pertaining to the sighting was forwarded to Project Blue Book for analysis.

The object was first detected on radar at a range of about 70 miles from the radar unit. It was tracked for a total time of about 4 minutes, during which time it exhibited high speed, abrupt changes in direction, and a great variability in altitude. Estimated speeds ranged from about 500 to 1800 miles per hour. At one point the object appeared to stop and hover, then accelerate to high speed.

The radar tracking film, along with other data, was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis and evaluation.
