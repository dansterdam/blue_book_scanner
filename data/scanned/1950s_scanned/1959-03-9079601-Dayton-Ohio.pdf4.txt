The text extracted from the document is as follows:

By the altitude and the length of time of the observation, the size of the objects and the rate of acceleration, I seriously doubt that these could have been anything other than UFOs, that is, objects not of known or conventional aircraft design. The distance of the closest object was estimated to be approximately 400 yards, and the distance to the farthest was about 1,000 yards. The objects were observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes and during most of this time they were in motion.

The way they accelerated and the sudden maneuvers indicated they were capable of a performance far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. They seemed to have no visible means of propulsion, there were no exhaust or trail, no sound, and no blinking lights as one would expect from conventional aircraft.

From the examination of the observers, their reported sightings, and observations, I can state that these were definitely not conventional aircraft and must be listed as unidentified flying objects.
