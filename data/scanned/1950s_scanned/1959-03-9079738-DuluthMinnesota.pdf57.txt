SIR:

The subject is an unusal circular shaped object sighted by me on 29 March 1959 near Duluth, Minnesota. The object was observed for approximately 4 minutes before it disappeared.

The subject was dark in color, appeared to be spinning, and was rapidly moving in an erratic manner. The object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter.

The attached information sheet is submitted for your review. For your information, your office will be informed of any further developments.
