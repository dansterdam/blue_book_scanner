No Case (Information Only)

SOURCE: FLYING SAUCER 10/54 (O, 4)

On October 3rd, 1954 about 7 o'clock in the evening all of my family and some of the neighbors saw eight U.F.O.'s which were flying due west in two groups and in V formation. They had a white light with a bluish tinge around the edge. These craft were flying about five thousand feet altitude and were silent. As soon as the UFO were out of sight I called the tower at Lockheed Air Terminal in Burbank, California (I was living in Pacoima, near San Fernando, at the time) and asked the man at the tower if they were aware of the UFO and he said yes, but that was all they would tell me. Later I found out through a friend who was a ham radio operator that the Lockheed Air Terminal called the Air National Guard at Van Nuys and they sent up a F 90 jet which chased these UFO, but could not catch up with them.
