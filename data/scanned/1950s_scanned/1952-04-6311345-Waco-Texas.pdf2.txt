The phenomena sighted by an observer is described as a group, such as a solid oval or disc-like object, All attempts to examine it closely with binoculars were thwarted by rapid changes in altitude and direction. The object was positiv e or the accuracy of the observer's observations. There was no sound associated with the object. The observer believed the object to be about 1500 yards from his position.

After about two minutes, the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared in the distance. The observer has had considerable experience in identifying aircraft and celestial objects and states that this was neither. The observer is considered reliable.

The only known factor that could have been misleading to the observer's visual perceptions is the presence of a possible illusion caused by mirage effects. However, the observer is positive he was not subjected to a mirage or illusion, and that this was a real object seen through a windshield and immediately vaporized.
