The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, discussing the nature of a "stony conglomerate" object. The text describes various properties of the object, such as the presence of flint particles and the lack of valuable pieces. The document also mentions signs of Indians using the material and compares the object to pieces from the deep western strike. The text is dated March 19, 1958.

March 19, 1958

Attention: Dr. Max Salzman
Dear Sir:

You know I didn't think to explain the weakness of the structure of this material. It contained the secret of an otherwise, hopeless mass.
(1) It was a stony conglomerate.
(2) Some of these particles are crumbly.
(3) By far the most important, is the pockets of flint in the conglomerate. As you well know, a particle of flint the size of a marble, when heated, blast many feet in every direction. Particles of flint found are many, many times the size of marbles. They show the marks of heat and blast. This is my cause for thinking; the attack was no more severe than the main body of material. I have found no valuable pieces, except as collectors items. Many particles found, have a tendency to go into what looks like granite and some crystal.
There are signs of Indians using some of this material, therefore the strike goes away back. Of course from the air you can get a better picture of the strike where from than I. Some of these pieces might be compared with pieces of the deep western strike. Not that it would prove anything. I would like to know what kind of a structure this thing used to go over in the same general area twice. Will discontinue correspondence here.
