WAR?
"How fireball? If it is, it would form brilliant flash meteoritic disroveries:  The appearance that dramatic scientific scientists would generally be caused by a cause  Such fireballs could be thrown by meteorites falling in the form of shooting stars, Just as these of white Sandis Proving the disturbance of atoms is not enough cause the impact of the fireball. The green fireballs, however, offer two suggestive:
1. Evidence of fiery green spun missiles fired from a spaceship.
2. Fireballs of some kind other place during a meteor shower, as explained in official explanation of 1948. The spearance of green fireballs could well be detected by radar, as is slightly odd more during the night than during the day."

"Spatial objects before," says DR. Menzel, of Harvard University, " already know of several places to look much attention. We were able to take a look at the photographs of the Russian satellites. They are so small and faint that they could not be seen with the naked eye. If the fireballs are extraterrestrial, they would have had a sound flame, we many would be mistaken for green fireballs. Sightings were immediately any identified in space, or in some meteorological inversion. Probably most of them are just a common sight."
