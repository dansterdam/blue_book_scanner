TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

STATEMENT

We had dropped down to about 3,000 feet to investigate, and after making a few circles over this unknown, which GCI was painting, and asking a few questions, we came to the conclusion that it was some kind of weather balloon, and it just slowly drifted off after a few minutes. But I could not, GCI said they were then painting the light, we made some passes but could not pick it up visually, and we could not tell on the radarscope just what this large object was, and it could not be seen by the naked eye except as a rather small light. Then they said they were no longer painting it on the scope, so we didn't think too much about it, except that here was another UFO report that could not be explained satisfactorily, and we did not understand how GCI was painting this large object, and it could not be acquired visually. So that was the extent of the incident.
