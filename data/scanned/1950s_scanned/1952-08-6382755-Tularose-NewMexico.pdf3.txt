The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document.

On Sunday, the 31 August 1952, about five hours my family and I were driving from Cloudcraft to Alamogordo to attend the movie. Just after passing through the tunnel on highway 82, which is about eight miles east of Alamogordo, my officer boy said "look at those two bright stars". On looking up to where he was pointing, which was in the Northwest sky there were two very bright objects approaching us from the west at a tremendous speed as morning stars. One appeared to be slightly smaller than the other, and was perfectly stationary.

We then pulled into a cut in the mountain, which obstructed our view. Then we had passed through and looked again to see that they had disappeared.

In just a second my wife said "Look, there's one of the lights left", quite a distance and was still descending. To confirm this I descend until it was out of sight on a level with us. It continued in this direction until it disappeared from our view behind a mountain. It seemed to be traveling at a much greater rate than an airplane or any other object we have ever seen.

So did not see what happened to the other light that was there when first observed.
