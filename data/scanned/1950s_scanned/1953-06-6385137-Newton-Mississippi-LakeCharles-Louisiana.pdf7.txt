AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
On the night of 2 June 1953, at approximately 2350 hours, Lt. 
Identified a red light near a small jet aircraft or other object while flying a Convair T-29 training aircraft over the Greenville, Mississippi AF Base training area. The pilot made several rapid changes in altitude and direction while attempting to close on the object, but was unable to close within a range of approximately 5,000 feet. The pilot's attention was distracted by another small light which appeared a few minutes later and continued to maneuver in the area. Neither object was positively identified or explained. The pilot and observer were unable to get closer than 5,000 feet to the objects before they disappeared from view.
The pilots had the aircraft navigational lights and were in contact with the aircraft control tower during the incident. The lights observed were unconventional in color, speed and maneuverability as compared to conventional aircraft. No sound was heard from the objects, and they disappeared and reappeared without any apparent means of propulsion observed. The report further states no aeronautical explanation for the sighting could be found.
This object was reported to the Keesler AAF Radio Station by the pilot and observer while in flight. The pilot stated he did not believe the object was a conventional aircraft and could not be identified.
