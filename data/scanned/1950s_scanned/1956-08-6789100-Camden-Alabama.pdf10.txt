No Case (Information Only)
3 August 1956
East Hartford, Connecticut

Case 181, East Hartford, Conn., Aug. 8, 1956 — Five
objects emanating a pinkish glow in the sky between
9:30 and 10:10 p.m. were reported by Mrs. Mary Calac*
to the local press. She said that she and three others
watched the unidentified objects from her lawn. One was
headed north, one northeast, one south and one west.
Another object followed the one heading west with a
flashing white light. All objects appeared round, she said.
Another object was seen by a retired city fireman, who
said that he saw an “oblong aluminum-colored” object
about 8 p.m. He said that it appeared to be going at
least four times as fast as any jet plane he had ever seen.
"It wasn't a plane, I'm sure of that” he said, "And yet it
wasn't a reflection. It was a solid, with a sort of a smoky
crown around it?”
