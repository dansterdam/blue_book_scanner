Gentlemen:

After spending the night of January 3rd at the Sleepy Hollow
Motel in Mankato, Kansas, my wife and I motored east on
Highway 36.

I started out with the headlights on but switched to the park-
ing lights after a few miles. We were driving at approximately
60 miles per hour when my wife said, ”What is that?” and
motioned to the right.

To say I was surprised at what I saw would be an understatement.
At about 45 degrees to the right and at a distance I thought
to be less than a mile there was an airplane and a large one.
Possibly a street cruiser. It appeared to be in flight not
far above the horizon, and I was afraid it would land before
we got to a point where we could take a good picture, and we
drove possibly 3/ 4 of a mile before stopping on top of a low
hill.

What was so astounding about this plane was its appearance.
It was entirely a luminous red in color and the outline of
its form was clear. Extending above the cockpit to a dis-
tance equal to that from the cockpit to the nose of the
plane was an aerial with a white light at the top. The aerial
was not red or luminous but its form was clearly outlined.

When we stopped we could see that the plane was not flying
but was stationary above the horizon.

Between the point where we first saw the plane and where we
stopped my wife had been adjusting the camera for a picture.
As we stopped she lowered the window and got the target
centered when she said, "I've got this adjusted for a moving
object so I'd better readjust it."

While she was doing this I saw that another aerial extended
up half way from the cockpit to the tail but was not lighted
at its tip.
