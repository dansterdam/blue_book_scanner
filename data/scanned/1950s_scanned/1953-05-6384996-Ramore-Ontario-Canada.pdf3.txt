STATEMENT

Between 0415 and 0430 on the morning of the twenty fifth day of May 1953 I was returning to the base with four other men. A/3C Radford, A/2C Smith, and A/2C Benson. We noticed a light that seemed to be on a collision course with us. As we first saw it, it was about 1 thousand yards to the left of the site. I didn't think it was much of it. It thought it was just a star. But as it came closer, it took the shape of a round object, maybe 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It seemed to be oscillating or wobbling as it moved. As it got to the main gate A/1C Sirins saw it just over the trees. He seemed to be apprehensive and asked if anyone else saw it. We all saw it and were amazed. It appeared to be very high and seemed to be only about 100 yards away. As it got closer to the Power Plant, the object seemed to move to a position on top of the light at the Power Plant. The men decided to go up on the hill to get a better look. I went to tell someone. I went to bed.
