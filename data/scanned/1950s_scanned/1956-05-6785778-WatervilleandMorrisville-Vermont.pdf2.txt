AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 3-2, 4602D AISS 33-0708-1-56 Part 1 of 1 page
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A telephone call to the Burlington Airport control tower was made to determine if there were any aircraft in the area on the dates and times of sightings.
2. Phone call was made to the Burlington weather station. No balloons released were sighted on the dates and times in question. It is possible that balloons could have been released at some altitudes, but sightings on both dates were from the NW on both dates, and it was possible for balloons to travel from the north central part of the state into the area.
3. A check was made with the 764th ACAW Squadron, St. Albans, Vermont, intelligence personnel informed that no aircraft were scrambled or airborne from their station on the dates of the sightings, but no entries were made which would identify the objects sighted.
