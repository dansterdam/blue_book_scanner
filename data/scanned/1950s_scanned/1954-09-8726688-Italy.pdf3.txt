Netherlands - 4 Aug 54
Ten firemen observed two flying saucers over the Hague on the night of 4 August between 2100 and 2400 hours. They moved at incredible speed, at times remaining motionless for as long as 30 seconds. They were flat ovals with a sitting gray light. ATIC Eval: Possible several light phenomena

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked increase in UFO sightings throughout Europe. ATIC attributes the majority of these sigthings to two main reasons. 
    1. The European press has been quick to publish, in detail, UFO sightings with has resulted in influencing a great number of persons for personal publicity.
    2. Me. D. Keyhoeâ€™s book was recently translated into various foreign languages and went on sale at newsstands throughout Europe during the summer of 1954.
