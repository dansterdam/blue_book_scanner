DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.
SUBJECT: C-2495 - UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WITCH FELL IN WATER OFF OCRACOKE, N.C., NOV. 20
TO: Chiefj Air Technical Intelligence Division
Intelligence Operations Group
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio
1. Reference our AF Form 28 Augusta 1950, same subject as above.
Attached large scale maps of the area in question were obtained and the correct spot rather than that shown on the map was located by Bill Magellan and myself. The object was found to have crashed into the water about 10 fathoms of water. A search for the object would entail diving operations at this depth.
2. It is suggested that all documents pertaining to this case be filed in the event the future status of Project Blue Book proves to be a mystery.
3. All documents referring to this one are returned herewith.
WILLIAM M. KELL Lt Colonel, USAF
Deputy Director for Estimates
