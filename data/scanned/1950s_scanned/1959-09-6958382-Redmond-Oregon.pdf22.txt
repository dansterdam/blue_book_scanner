1823 zulu. Scrambled 1 F-89 from Portland for control of this site. 
1829 zulu. F-89 returned with negative results.
1949 zulu. Senior controller at 25th Air Division ordered scramble of H-19
helicopter from Kingsley Field.
2151 zulu. H-19 landed at Redmond with negative results.
2155 zulu 25th Air Division ordered track 1to JB-129 scrubbed.
2203 zulu. Air Defense exercise terminated by 25th Air Division 
2230 zulu. Helicopter ordered to return to Kingsley Field

Note: Several scrambles, intercepts, and ---air clrwwds were performed by control of this radar site as part of the exercise during the period reported.
The Senior controller on duty at the time the object was first reported was Captain Gordon R. Poland, AO 1863779 who was transferred overseas to Iceland Air Defense Sector, APO 81, New York by special Order A-198, this  hq, dated 1 Feb 1960. Three other directors who were on duty from 1500 zulu to 2400 zulu on 24 September have been interviewed and recall the following:

1. The radar return bearing track No. JB-129 did not move during this period. 
2. The radar return was in a position close to gap filler the antenna located on a mountain at, 8,010' level.
3. Repeated passes were made by the interceptors at levels from 40,000 down to 12,000 feet. The interceptors being directed through our radar return KB-129. No interceptor received a radar return on his airborne radar. At altitudes below 12,000' msl visual search was conducted under VFR conditions with negative results.
4. Since 24 Sept 1959, several instances have been observed by this Hq wherein no moving radar returns appeared in the same location as those of JB-129. It is their opinion that under certain atmospheric conditions, radar echoes from the gap+jln+   antennas in that location are received.
