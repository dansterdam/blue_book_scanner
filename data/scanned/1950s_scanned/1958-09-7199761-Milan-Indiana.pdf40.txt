There is no photograph present in the image. The image shows a handwritten document that appears to be a letter. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document.

Dear Sir:

Our man, mornin Sept 27th at approach of 25-30 A.M., was traveling toward my farm toward A large light in the sky moving with a bright red of purple from east to west. It appeared to be a metallic cigar-shaped and probably 500 ft high. As I watched it seem to circle into the moon and then divided again with two lights leading the other two. They did not pause nor alter course while collecting this.
