Note:
a sighting was reported at 8:35 p.m., CST, on March 6, 1958, at Ogallala, Nebraska, by two citizens - Mr. Bob Jacobs and Mr. Warnecke. According to the report, they observed a bright light in the sky which made a sharp turn, as though to pursue another object which was flying at a much higher altitude. The light maintained a steady course, flying in a southerly direction, and appeared to be some 4,000 to 5,000 feet in altitude. The witnesses estimated the speed of the object as being approximately 1,000 mph. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 seconds before disappearing from sight.
