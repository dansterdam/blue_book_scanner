The engineer on duty, who was able to see a flaming body half the size of the setting sun and with a bright glow of a glass ship, it did not look like a meteor or any other cluster of stars. 

The appearance had been noticed by numerous witnesses and the engineer's statement corroborated their impressions.

All agreed and describe that they saw a glowing frontal dark and all the illumination appeared to be a time relatively brief (over seconds and at the maximum of seconds). From the upper rear side it seems that there were rays or sparks. All declared that they have never seen such a sight before.

REPORTING OFFICER'S COMMENT: During the preliminary investigation of this incident, it was considered that the sighting could be a meteorological phenomenon. However, the statements of the intelligent individual, seems to indicate that the incident has sufficient ground for possible credence.
