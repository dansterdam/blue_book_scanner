AFFIDAVITS SUBMITTED BY WITNESSES OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER KEESLER AIR FORCE BASE, MISSISSIPPI, ON OCTOBER 10, 1957

AFFIDAVIT

I, JOHN DOE, being duly sworn, depose and say:

On the night of October 10, 1957, at approximately 7:30 p.m., I was on duty as a security guard at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. While making my rounds, I observed a large, bright, disc-shaped object hovering approximately 500 feet above the northwest corner of the base. The object appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was emitting a pulsating white light. I watched the object for approximately 5 minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.

I have carefully read the above statement and it is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

JOHN DOE
Security Guard
Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 11th day of October, 1957.
