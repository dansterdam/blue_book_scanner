Flying Saucer Watched from Colville's Observation Tower
Strange Object in Sky Monday Morning
Three Colville skyvatchers report seeing a flying saucer in the skies early Wednesday morning. They are Mrs. Gerald Willett and Mrs. John Link, on the 'ground at the time, who saw the object from the tower.
The women said they first observed the strange object at about 4:30 a.m. and watched it for nearly two hours. They said it seemed to move at times and then stop, and that it appeared to be a lighted object in the sky.
Mrs. Link [sic] (Mrs. Willett) called the attention of her husband, who was in the tower, and he too watched the object. It seemed to move at times, Mrs. Link (Mrs. Willett) said, and at other times it appeared to be stationary. 
The area in which the object was seen is said to be between Old Dominion mountain and Campbell peak. Skyvatchers in the area are familiar with it and say this is the first time they have ever seen anything like it coming from that direction.
