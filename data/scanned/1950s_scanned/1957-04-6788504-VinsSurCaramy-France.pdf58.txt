Vin's Sur Caramy (France), April 6, 1957.
The witness was a young man named M. Roger Medon, a civil servant employed by the French government administration.
On April 6, 1957, at around 6:00 p.m., M. Roger Medon was walking in the forest near the village of Vin's Sur Caramy, in the department of Var, France, when he suddenly observed an unusual aerial phenomenon.
M. Medon states that he saw an intensely luminous object, which he described as being circular in shape and surrounded by a luminous halo. The object was stationary at first, then it began to move at high speed, making sudden changes in direction. 
After a few minutes, the object disappeared rapidly.
M. Medon reported his observation to the local gendarmerie (police station), who in turn informed the competent authorities.
This case was investigated by the French air force and was included in the official files of Project Blue Book.
