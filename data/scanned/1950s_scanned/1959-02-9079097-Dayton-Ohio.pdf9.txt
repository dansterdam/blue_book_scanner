The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a point marked "A" which represents how high the object was above the horizon when first seen. The second point marked "B" shows how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second and third sketches depict visual perspectives of the object. The middle sketch shows a road with buildings on either side, and a person standing in the road. The third sketch shows a perspective from the ground looking up at the object in the sky.

The text mentions that the larger sketches are meant to show the position of the object when it was first seen, and how that position changed over time.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
