The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically the "SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112" form.

I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

II. RELIABILITY: Source was a reliable, observant and preserved sort of individual and seemed somewhat confused when questions were asked. Before answering questions, he stated that a medium-sized object that was white in color was observed

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was looking north-northeast when objects appeared. He was looking northeast when objects disappeared. They were observed for a period of thirty minutes.
Objects appeared to be round or rotating. Brightness was like that of an automobile headlight at a mile or rotating object - some hold at some light. Movement of objects was erratic, appearing to stand still and then suddenly appear in a different area. One of the objects disappeared suddenly.
Objects were estimated from 35 degrees from the north and rotated in a circular path to 20 degrees east and 30 degrees from the horizon when they disappeared. He estimated the distance from objects at 15,000 feet.
