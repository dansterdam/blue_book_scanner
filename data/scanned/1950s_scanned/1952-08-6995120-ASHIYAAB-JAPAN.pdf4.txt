Air Intelligence Information Report

Ir. Central Tower Operator did not report his sighting for 2 nights of July to the control tower, believing that the tower was not open, and the information was therefore volunteered in this report. This report was not available as a confirmed or documented sighting at the time of the incident.

It was believed that the gripping of lights seen were due to extremely distorted atmospheric conditions, which are frequent at this time of year, and are regarded as to be a natural phenomena, and not necessarily connected with any strange aerial phenomenon observed in the vicinity at the time.
