The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon line, and instructions to indicate the object's height and position relative to the horizon. The second sketch shows two larger illustrations - one depicting a road with buildings in the distance, and another smaller illustration depicting a silhouetted figure against a hilly landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. This is a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
