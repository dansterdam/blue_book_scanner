VISUAL SIGHTING OF UNINOENTIFIEO FLYING OBJECT NEAR SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, 16 JUNE 1954.

On 16 June 1954, at approximately 2130 hours, the following was reported to the Military Air Intelligence Unit at Hunter Air Force Base, Savannah, Georgia.

At approximately 2120 hours, on 16 June 1954, a private pilot, Mr. X, was flying his private plane some 15 miles southwest of Savannah, Georgia, and at an altitude of 3,500 feet. At this time he sighted an unidentified flying obiect which appeared to be about 5-6 miles southwest of his position.

Mr. X described the obiect as round or discoid in shape, and approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. The obiect was observed to be moving in a southerly direction at a very high rate of speed, estimated to be in excess of 600 mph.

The obiect appeared to be emitting a bright white light from its underside, and to have a faint bluish glow around its periphery. Mr. X watched the obiect for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared from view, seemingly accelerating suddenly and at a tremendous rate of speed.

Mr. X immediately reported this sighting to the Military Air Intelligence Unit at Hunter Air Force Base, Savannah, Georgia. An investigation of this incident was initiated by the Air Force.

After a thorough investigation, including interviews with Mr. X and a check of Flight Service records, it was concluded that the obiect sighted was not an aircraft or any other known aerial vehicle. The sighting remains classified as an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBIECT.
