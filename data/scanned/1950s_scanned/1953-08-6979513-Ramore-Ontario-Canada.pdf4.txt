STATEMENT

At about 22:00 hrs, 13 Aug 1953, my attention was called to a very bright glow in the sky. This object seemed to be of some shape as it appeared then to be again. It was a pillar of light standing as bright as the sun for about 2 1/2 minutes, when it gradually faded, dimmed and disappeared. The object was seen, unknown, shape, size, color, and did not make any appreciable sound, weather, clear.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 18th day of August 1953.
