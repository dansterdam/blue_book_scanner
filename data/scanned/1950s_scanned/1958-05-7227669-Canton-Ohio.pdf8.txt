The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a memo routing slip from the USAF (United States Air Force).

Here is the text from the document:

MEMO ROUTING SLIP
NAME OR TITLE: Major Le J. TACKER
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: SAFIS-3 - OSAF 
REMARKS:
1. Larger here is a letter from an individual reporting after a UFO. This gives him credit for not sending it to Keesler Base Provost Marshal here. Suggest the following answer:
1. Our preliminary conclusion is that it was a balloon launched at night, probably from Warren, Ohio, by the Weather Bureau. Information shows that balloons were launched at Warren were in the direction of Canton from Warren. Further, his description of the object and the movements indicate the balloon movements characteristic of a balloon in flight.
2. We are adding his report to the many others we receive in our continuing investigation of aerial phenomena.
3. Thanks for sending it to the Air Force.

(Sgd) W.P. Marshall
