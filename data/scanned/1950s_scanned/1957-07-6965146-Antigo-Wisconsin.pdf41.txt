25 July 1957 
Clackamas County, Oregon

July 25, 1957: While driving northeast along Springwater Road, in Clackamas County, Oregon, R.S. Pallette, manager of Pallette Box and Lumber Company saw a circular object moving silently overhead. He stopped his car, and he and his wife got out and watched the object for almost two minutes. They said the object appeared to be disc-shaped, silvery, and moving very rapidly. It suddenly disappeared into the sky in front of them. 

The object seemed to be of a bright glowing nature, and was tilted at a 45-degree angle. The family reported the sighting to the Blue Book Center at Altoona, Pennsylvania. The object was seen to be rotating or spinning and was followed by a tail-like projection as it suddenly disappeared. The object made no sound, and did not seem to disturb the surroundings. The sight has been reported by many observers over a wide area.
