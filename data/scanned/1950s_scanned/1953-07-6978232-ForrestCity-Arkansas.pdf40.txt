The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a scanned document from the Ohio State University, specifically from the Emerson McMillin Observatory. The text in the document appears to be a letter dated July 27, 1953, addressed to "Dear Capt. Ruppelt and Lt. Clasen" discussing observations and information related to the Project Blue Book UFO investigation.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY
COLUMBUS 10
27 July 1953

Dear Capt. Ruppelt and Lt. Clasen:
Greetings, Captains, and glad to have you aboard again. (Pardon the Navy expression.) Here are my comments on the last few items that were sent to me on 18 July. Of these three items, one concerns a sighting in Arkansas on 11 July. The question we should like to have you answer on this one is whether or not a little can be added about its width. The other two items deal with our previous forms "G" and "D" which you should know about already, and we have this additional information.

The shape on the film on one has been a disputed one, and certainly an unusual one if it went into the overcast. Fireballs have been known to break out of the overcast, but it would be unusual for one to come through the overcast. So perhaps the direction of motion, the rate of motion, and such matters as the apparent diameter should be followed up. Again, the information we would like is on our Form D.

We shall be in New Mexico on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (28,29,30) and will take the cameras along to Holloman Air Force Base for the calibrating tests on the 29th, as you told us. I shall be on the watchout for phenomena over their range as I shall of course do on any legitimate occasion when I have a chance to observe something down. I shall of course do the same legitimate observations at other locations before I leave.

Cordially,

Allen Hynek
