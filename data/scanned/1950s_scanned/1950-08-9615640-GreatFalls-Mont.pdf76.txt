The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an outline of procedures executed to obtain the finished product of 8 x 10 glossy paper photographic prints. The text describes the process of using 16mm motion picture Kodachrome film, creating panchromatic cut film negatives, and enlarging these negatives onto 8 x 10 projection printing paper.

The text in the document is as follows:

The following is an outline of the procedures executed to obtain the finished product of 8 x 10 glossy paper photographic prints.

1. Original film was 16 mm motion picture Kodachrome film.

2. This 16 mm Kodachrome film was then processed and printed in a Panchromatic cut film. This Panchromatic cut film was processed by normal methods in Eastman 2-75 developer.

3. These 4 x 5 cut film negatives were then enlarged in a Omega D-2 Enlarger onto 8 x 10 projection printing paper.

The degree of enlargement is all caused by holding constant. Development times for the intermediate negatives and the projection prints are held as constant as possible. The finished prints have a grainy appearance due to the extreme enlargment of the original 16 mm film. The part in the film from which the enlargment is made appears to be the last top of the print which is the image of the motion picture camera used to take the original photographs.
