I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On the night of 24 February 1952, at 2315 local Korean time, the navigator of a B-29 observed an unidentified aerial object. The B-29 was picked up by searchlights and about 45 seconds later the navigator sighted an object approaching from 7 o'clock. The object was estimated to be over anything at this time. The object did not appear to be illuminated in front and had a reddish glow. The object maintained this course for four or five minutes and then made three times the length of the object with both the tail blast and the object bright in color.
When first observed the object appeared to be climbing at 45Â°, however, it leveled off at approximately 4,000 ft. from the B-29 and turned toward the B-29. As it approached the B-29, the object continued to close in and made a rapid turn and headed down, passing under the B-29 at a steep angle. As the object began to descend the flame diminished in size and got brighter. The navigator estimated that the object came within 3000 ft. of the aircraft and his appeared to be the size of an automobile (Assumed to mean the same size as an automobile viewed from 2,000 ft.).
The B-29 was flying at 22,000 ft., altitude and at a speed of 200 knots. The characteristics stayed with the aircraft for approximately four minutes and weak inaccurate flak was encountered during the entire incident.
Weak electronic signals were picked up by the electronic counter-measures operator for a short time.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
More details on the sighting have been requested from FEAF. Since the object resembles a surface-to-air guided missile, the incident has been referred to the ATIC guided missiles group.
