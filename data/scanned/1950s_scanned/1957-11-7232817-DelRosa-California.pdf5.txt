The Air Force says its investigation of "flying saucer" reports in the past 10 years have produced no concrete evidence that such objects exist.

The Pentagon issued this report today in reply to a growing number of reports - from various parts of the country - that mysterious objects, sometimes described as circular discs, have been seen in the skies.

"We have found no physical evidence of the existence of unidentified flying objects, parts of them or their control systems," the report said.

But the Air Force did acknowledge that "there have been a large number of reports" of strange objects in the skies, many of which could not be explained immediately.

No Evidence of Saucers

As evidence, the report says, the Air Force has never found a saucer, nor even a minute fragment.

The report says that in the instances where the objects were observed reasonably close up, such as a distance of 25 miles or less, the observers reported that the alleged objects were silent and gave no evidence of any kind of power unit or propulsion system.

There have been suggestions that the alleged objects may have been jet aircraft, meteors, balloons, astronomical bodies or the products of optical illusions or imagination. But the Air Force said its extensive investigations have given no confirmation of these hypotheses.

The Air Force statement said there is no physical evidence that the reported objects were anything more than the "results of misidentification of known objects."
