Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Mr. the report you mentioned did not seem to be in the file I received. I have looked it over very carefully and can find no mention of a report of a sighting near Mt. Vernon, New York. I am very sorry about this, but apparently the report you mentioned was not included in the material sent to me. If you have any further information on this sighting, I would be most interested in receiving it.

1) As noted, I do not have a report about the sighting in the vicinity of Mt. Vernon. As stated above, it was not included in the material I received.
2) If the sighting had been reported, more information would normally be expected, such as date, time, description of object, direction of movement, etc. Without these details, there is little I can do to pursue the matter further.
3) I do not foresee that some additional search would uncover a report of this sighting. Unless you are able to provide me with more specifics, I am afraid I cannot be of further assistance in locating any information on this incident.

I would appreciate it if you would furnish me with any additional details you may have concerning this sighting. Remember, it must be fairly recent (within 6 months) and no later were yet available.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
M/Sgt, USAF
