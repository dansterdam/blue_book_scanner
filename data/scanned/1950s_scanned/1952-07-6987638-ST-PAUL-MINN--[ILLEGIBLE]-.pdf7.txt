The image appears to contain a handwritten document page, but there is no photograph present.

To the naked eye it appeared to be a bright light, like a careening flight of a plane, about as bright as jupiter at present, or less. When the object almost disappeared in the trees in the west, it reappeared briefly for a second or two. The telescope looked like two exhaust flames when he saw it about 1/2 to 20 or 30 seconds. The telescope is a 6 1/2 inch diameter reflector. Type with about a 1/2 inch eyepiece, giving about 95 power. Astronomically, this observation is unusually and so a little difficult to follow exactly right. These 2 seconds is only for a couple of seconds as it passed. We note significantly that at about 11:30 flying in at almost the same speed 2 thought at the time there might have been some great height, varying some.
