AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
USOB AREA REPORTED: N/A
DATE OF REPORT: 10 AUG 55
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

JOHN FLYNN, Major, USAF
PART ONE: Description of Sighting by Witness
PART TWO: Investigators Summary
II. SUMMARY:
At 06/19302 AUG 55, Det 3 was notified by Headquarters, 4602d AISS to conduct a follow-up investigation in Page, New York (GROUP HJBL 0843) at 31/0230Z JUL 55. GUARDS had immediately notified the New York military channels, and this information was passed through normal channels. SOUCE estimated that the sighting, which consisted of four (4) spherical objects, was approximately 7000 (2130 meters) in size. These objects moved in groups of two, one group moving due west, and the other, east to west. The objects appeared to be at an extreme altitude and were observed for approximately 15 minutes. This sighting was corroborated by the wife, and the landladyof the Source. The landladywas not available at the time of the interview, taking the role of a "yeoman" for all other husbands' statements. SOURCE was of the opinion that the phenomenon could not have been aircraft, and was more likely characteristic of something supernatural. The probability of the fact that the sightings were indeed of light was questionable, and possibly substantiated by a statement from the Palisades Amusement Park Company, Palisades Park, New Jersey.
