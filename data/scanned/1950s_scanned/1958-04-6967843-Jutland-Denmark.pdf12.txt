The document includes a photograph that appears to be a dark, blurred image with a bright circular object that could be interpreted as an unidentified flying object (UFO). It is centered and slightly towards the upper portion of the image against a grainy background.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

Apr 1958
Sussex, England

SUSSEX "FLYING SAUCER"

The photo on the right was taken in April 1958 at Southend-on-Sea, Sussex, England, by a man who prefers to remain anonymous. The saucer is said to have been traveling at a moderate speed at the time the picture was snapped. We have no further details as yet. The picture was submitted by R. B. Godfrey-Bartram of Sussex, England, to whom we give our thanks.
