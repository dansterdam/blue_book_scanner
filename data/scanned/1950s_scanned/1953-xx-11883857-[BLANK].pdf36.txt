5. Number of Individual Sightings Reported

6. The Value of Obtaining Additional Information Immediately

If the information cannot be obtained within seven days, the value
of such information is greatly decreased.

It is of great value to obtain additional information immediately
if previously stated criteria have been met. Often, if gathered quickly,
two or three items (weather conditions, angular speed, changes in tra-
