AF FORM 112 - PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED
ON 26 APRIL 1950 - 2330 HOURS, 20 OCTOBER 1951
APPROXIMATELY SEVEN (7) MILES SOUTH FROM BUENA VISTA, COLORADO, A STRANGE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED CROSSING THE TERRAIN FROM EAST TO WEST AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT APPEARED TO BE CIGAR-SHAPED AND GLOWED WITH A BLUISH HAZE, GOING NORTH TO SOUTHWEST AND IN A DESCENDING CURVE. I WOULD ESTIMATE THE ANGLE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 30Â°.
THE OBJECT STAYED WITHIN MY SIGHT APPROXIMATELY 20 SECONDS - THE INITIAL LIGHT THAT ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION WAS BLUISH-GREEN IN COLOR AND VERY BRIGHT. AFTER THE LIGHT WAS DESCENDING, IT LIT UP THE ENTIRE SKY, BUT THE LIGHT WAS CONCENTRATED ON THE OBJECT ITSELF.
THE ONLY DEDUCTION I COULD DRAW FROM THE APPEARANCE WAS THAT THE OBJECT HAD CHANGED COLOR AS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PARTICLES CHANGED.
WITH A VISIT TO THE SITE I NOTICED A VERY ACCURATE DIAGRAM OF THE DIRECTION THE LIGHT WAS TRAVELING. THE DIRECTION I GAVE PREVIOUSLY APPEARS TO BE NORTH RATHER THAN SOUTHWEST. THE TERRAIN IS SUCH THAT NO OTHER EXPLANATION CAN BE GIVEN AS TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT WAS TRAVELING.
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS DECLASSIFICATION AFTER 12 YEARS
