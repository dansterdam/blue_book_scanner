Transcribed text from the document:

I received all the readings necessary, when I was about some place in South Central Alaska, did not think anything of it but as I watched number of these things rapidly passing by and I watched to see these things he didn't maneuver to speak of. Some of them merely seemed to come on over to win. He also saw them - in order to judge the catch grass which at the threshold on one point the they had to be turned quite rapidly in order to follow their base. they were moving in a northwesterly direction from the air station, and immediately picked up a number of these objects travelling together as if in formation. There would be groups of three or four and even single objects travelling at a very high speed as in order to follow the threshold had to be turned quite rapidly to its base. reported our discovery and Chief was called in (later he made a Chief Warrant) came up and upon taking the glass immediately sighted - his report like our statement based on with the pair of binoculars brought down from the traffic control tower.
