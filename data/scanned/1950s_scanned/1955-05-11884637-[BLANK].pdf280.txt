The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather presents a table titled "TABLE IV  CHI SQUARE TEST OF KNOWNS VERSUS UNKNOWNS ON THE BASIS OF SHAPE". The table displays information about various shapes, including the number of "KNOWNS", "ADJUSTED KNOWNS (K)", and "UNKNOWNS (n)". The table also includes the degrees of freedom for the chi-square test at 5% and 1% significance levels.
