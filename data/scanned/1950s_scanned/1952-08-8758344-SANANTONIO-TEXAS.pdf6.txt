The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report that describes a sighting of "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS" over San Antonio, Texas on August 7, 1952. The text provides details about the sighting, including the size, speed, and maneuverability of the objects, as well as the duration of the observation. The report also mentions that the objects displayed "COLOR SIMILAR TO WHITE-HOT COALS" and that the objects' propulsion system was not observed. The report concludes by stating that the sighting was "NO MATERIAL", meaning it could not be definitively identified.

4 ROUND, UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS THAT GAVE OFF COLOR SIMILAR 
TO WHITE-HOT COALS WERE OBSERVED OVER SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS* OBJECTS APPEARED APPROXIMATELY
33 INCHES IN DIAMETER, FLYING AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF 700-1000 MPH AT ALTITUDES VARYING 
BETWEEN 15,000-20,000 FT. OBJECTS APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS 
OF APPROXIMATELY 25 MINUTES.  NO SOUND, PROPULSION SYSTEM WAS NOTICED. SPEED ESTIMATED BUT
OBSERVER STATES THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JET AIRCRAFT THAT MOVED SLOWLY, 
NO SPEED MUST HAVE BEEN GREATER AS FAST AS THE OBSERVED OBJECTS. OBJECTS GAINED SPEED 
RAPIDLY, MADE SHARP TURNS, AND THEN ACCELERATED VERTICALLY IN A CLOCKWISE TURN. 
NO TRAIL OR SMOKE. NO APPARENT REACTION BY PLANE OR OBJECT. BY VANISHING SUDDENLY, LIKE AN
EXTINGUISHED LIGHT.
