1. S. Extracted from First Air Force "Perintrapn" for 27 May 1952:
Patrols in the Far East reported a number of light which were observed and
d 5 miles. The P-51 crew stated that the light which was visible from at least
5 miles, was small, white and glown, and appeared to be at about 15,000 feet.
The light was in sight for several minutes and then suddenly went out.
COMMENTS: 1. There have been a number of balloon sightings over this
area. It is possible that this was a light from a balloon and not an aircraft carrying searchlights
over the Northwest target areas of Korea, though none have been reported in the
area.
