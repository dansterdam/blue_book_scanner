Dear Sir:

On Saturday, Jan 24, 1959, I was walking in Prospect Park, near the Music Grove. As I continued walking, I noticed a light in the sky. This light was perfectly clear and stationary. I watched it for several minutes and noticed later it was my custom I looked up expecting nothing. As a matter of fact I looked up a slight object, moving very slowly, leaving no jet traces or movements. But I was hard to tell which way it was moving. Two or three minutes passed and I could not decide in which direction it was moving. I said it was a plane. The object stood and asked where are you from and walked away. I followed but I looked again and said I didn't hear anything. Then I took a chance and went across the street and looked at it and it seemed to be smaller of light. To me it was a guesses. I shopped my hands over my eyes to see better. Again I took a look but he seemed to be on the point. But he saw me as I did. But he was not even for a brief second. I had it in view for over forty seconds. each time I looked at it, it seemed their traces or streams way up; and I heard their engines or power from where they were a plane. What was it? It couldn't have been a balloon. Its size was too great. And its nature seemed a free flight object. If any confirmation on this sighting to kindly let me know. Are UFO's still about?

Sincerely,
/s/ 
D/R

P.S I observed a night sighting in 1954 at 9 PM but with no witnesses. (July)
