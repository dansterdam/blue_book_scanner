1. The following information was received from the 25th OSI District, Detroit, Michigan, in a spot intelligence report dated 4 August 1952:

"Refers to following article on page 2 of 23 July 1952 edition of the 'Traverse City Record-Eagle', Traverse City, Michigan:

'AT LONG LAST 
FLYING SAUCER CLOSE TO GROUND*

10:30 a.m. - Flying saucers or one description or another have been reported in nearly every state during the past few years and at last Oceana, Michigan saw what they believe d was a flying saucer.'

Mrs. J.D. Detroit, who was vacationing at the Otsego Club near Gaylord, Michigan, and her mother, Mrs. Leotis Cobb, both of Detroit, who were visiting in Oceana on Lake Huron saw what they believe d was a flying disc during Sunday about 1:30 P.M.

'The white light, when first noticed, was approaching from the south and gradually rising to a northerly direction. It appeared circular in form and as it passed through the sky, left what they described as a vapor trail behind it. The light first came into view at an estimated height of about 3000 feet and as it neared the observers, appeared to be about 1000 feet high. Estimating speed, Mrs. Detroit said it looked like a jet moving at a very high rate of speed. She added, "It made no noise, just seemed to be coasting. When it passed over us, it turned a silvery color, then faded into the distance".'
