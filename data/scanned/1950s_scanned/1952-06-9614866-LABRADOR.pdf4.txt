SWORN STATEMENT
FOR OFFICIAL USE - JUNE 25 1952

I, Lieutenant Fred L. Rinker, was checking passes at the entrance to the installation at 1800 hours, 9 June 1952. At this time a local civilian employee, Mr. ------- (name deleted), came to the gate and stated that he had just seen an unidentified flying object. He said that he was checking the livestock, when he noticed a bright light in the sky. This light seemed to hover for a few seconds, then it took off at a very high speed, making a sharp vertical climb. Mr. ------- said that he was quite certain that this was not a conventional aircraft, because of the manner in which it moved. Before I could get inside to report the incident, however, when I saw Mr. -------, he stated that he had already reported it to the officer of the day.

The object appeared as a long, bright light in the sky and traveled in a straight, level path. It seemed to gain or visible mass as it passed from southwest to northeast. I can see no reason to doubt the sincerity of Mr. -------'s report. The time of the sighting was approximately 1730 hours, 9 June 1952.

In my experience in the U.S. Army Air Forces during the war, I have seen many types of aircraft, both conventional and unconventional. I can state that this was not a conventional aircraft of any type that I have ever seen. It appeared to me to be some type of unconventional flying object.
