1. In reference to telephone call received from Sgt Bollig, your headquarters, at 0320 hours, 2 March 1959, concerning three unidentified lights sighted at approximately 0110Z, 25 February 1959, the following information is submitted:

2. The tower operators on duty at the time of the sighting reported that three lights were observed. After the lights had been closed there were three 2-1/2 in the area at the time on a high ranging mission. The tower operators made no report to the tower that there was nothing unusual to report. Furthermore, no statements were made to the tower supervisor because he did not want the personnel concerned involved in an investigation.

3. The names of the tower operators would not be given by the control tower supervisor because he did not want the personnel concerned involved in an investigation.
