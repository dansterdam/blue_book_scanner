The text in the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Noiseless

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as wings, protrusions, etc. Also indicate the direction the object was moving. Please do not add or draw beside the drawing to show the direction it was moving.

[A handwritten sketch of a star-like object is present in the form.]

18. The shape of the object was:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
   b. Like a light star
   c. Sharply outlined
   d. Other

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
