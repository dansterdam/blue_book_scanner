Dear Colonel Harty:

As I am sure you are aware, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena has received many reports of unidentified flying objects. In attempting to evaluate these reports, we often find that classified or confidential information is necessary for a proper evaluation.

Therefore, I am requesting your cooperation in the following:
1. What is the classification of the report?
2. By whom was it classified?
3. Why was it classified?

Your assistance in providing this information will be greatly appreciated. We are most anxious to have as complete information as possible in order to make a thorough and impartial evaluation of the reports we receive.

Yours truly,
MAJOR DONALD E. KEYHOE, USMC (RET.)
Chairman
