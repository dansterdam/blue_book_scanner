There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. I will now proceed to produce the text content from the document:

The 23 February 1953, at approximately 5:20 p.m., EST, 7 unidentified lights were sighted by five civilians, including a 13-year-old girl. The lights were maneuvering in the air over Easton, Maine. The lights were observed for approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds. 

The lights appeared to be located in the approximate treetop level. The lights were described as reddish-orange in color and were observed to make slight maneuvers in the air, hovering and darting back and forth in an apparently controlled manner. The lights seemed to flicker or pulsate at times. The lights appeared to be flying in loose formation, with the individual lights widely separated from one another.

Upon reaching the above-quoted timestamp, we noticed that the movement of the lights became more rapid. The lights were then observed to accelerate rapidly and disappear from sight, apparently traveling at a very high rate of speed. The duration of the whole sighting was approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

I would like to add that I am a former T/S with 2175 hours and I am familiar with aircraft performance. I have substantial relevant experience in STO during WWII, with the above-named aircraft performance.
