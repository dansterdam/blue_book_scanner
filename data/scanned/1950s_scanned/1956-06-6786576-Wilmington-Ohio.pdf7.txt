20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
(Circle One): a. Head of a pin, b. Pea, c. Dime, d. Nickel, e. Quarter, f. Half dollar, g. Silver dollar, h. Baseball, i. Grapefruit, j. Basketball, k. Other ________________

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.): a. Certain, b. Fairly certain, c. Not very sure, d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The text from the scanned document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
Sharply changed direction, moved zig-zag across sky in a small area, then disappeared over horizon.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.
Approximately 10-15 feet.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
Disappeared over the horizon.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The object appeared to be made of some type of metallic material, possibly stainless steel or aluminum. It was approximately 10-15 feet in diameter and appeared to be disc-shaped or oval in shape. It would be similar in appearance to a large dinner plate or serving tray if placed in the sky.
