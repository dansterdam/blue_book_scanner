UNCLASSIFIED

16 DECEMBER 1957

An approximately 1000 feet object in the sky southwest
of this airbase at about 1 minute duration. The object
appeared to be hovering at first, then went into a very
fast climb. We were unable to get a return on our search
equipment, but it appeared on the radarscope: a high intensity
trace of a visual case operations. However, we were unable to
determine the possibilityo of technical or air matter. The
object was continuously tracked with the APN. The object's speed
ranged from 100 to 700 knots. The object changed direction was made
every minute. The object seemed to be "pulsing" or "blinking" and
such changes in characteristics but we could never find a final
determination of the object.

It again went outward, and the object seemed dimmer. It was the most
unusual object I have ever observed. It appeared to be the size of
the B-24 aircraft, but outward from it, it was blinding looking, at
the end there were never any trails, or vapor trails on. A star
give us never seen it after. The distance of the object, I have never
seen a star of clouds at such. The location of the object.
