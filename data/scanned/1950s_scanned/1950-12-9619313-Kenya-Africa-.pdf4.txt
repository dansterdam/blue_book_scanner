"10 in upper and lower poles. It spun rapidly and then dropped like a stone. I noticed a bright spot on the spinning, or a destructive illumination while hovering.
It sailed out for 100 yards. where this occurred and could not be seen in the distance. I should imagine it was in the air for 2 to 3 minutes, for simplicity. The colour of the suitor had a certain greenish tint and did not change. When it gained altitude again it looked orange and quite clear.
The object seemed to hare been spinning at a very rapid rate, almost too fast to see. I thought it some thing like a flying saucer. It was an utter surprise to me and I do not know anything similar about. Of course one could say it mere description of the flying saucer."
