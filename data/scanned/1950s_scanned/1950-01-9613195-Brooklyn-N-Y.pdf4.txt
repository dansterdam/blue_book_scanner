Dear Sir:

On January 3, at about 2200, M. - and I observed what we believed to be "flying saucers".

It was visible for a period of about three minutes, at an estimated altitude of 3000', bearing about 33O degrees from a point in Brooklyn, in approximate Latitude 40°-41'N., Longitude 73°-58'W.

It was in the clouds, remaining stationary and emitting a bluish-green fluorescent glow. For a period of about 30 seconds, the intensity of the glow was very marked.

If this information is of any value to you, I shall be pleased to continue to be on watch for these objects.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
