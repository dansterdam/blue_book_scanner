PART 10
EVALUATIONS

And now for our evaluations to date. We have considered 
six hundred ninety-eight incidents,, since the beginning of the 
investigation in 1947. The breakdown or probable causes of these 
incidents is as follows:

a. 237 sightings - or about 34 percent - were of celestial
bodies (stars, planets, etc)

b. 70 sightings - or about 10 percent - were balloons.

c. 84 sightings - or about 12 percent - can be accounted
for by aircraft, birds, airborne debris, etc.

d. 35 sightings - or about 05 percent - were rockets and
flares.

e. 91 sightings - or about 13 percent - were not evaluated
due to insufficient data for analysis.

f. 181 sightings - or about 26 percent - could not be
evaluated and remain unexplained.
