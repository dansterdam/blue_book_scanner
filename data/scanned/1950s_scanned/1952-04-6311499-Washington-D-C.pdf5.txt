Your letter of 7 May concerning one negative was not received and analyzed by our photographic section. Their conclusions are as follows:
a. The image density is sufficiently dense that the negative is difficult to interpret. It appears to have been exposed with a diagonal light source.
b. The image in question appears to have been caused by a slight distortion, creating what is known as a "button-mark" which develops to produce a relatively sharp central image with a surrounding hazy area.
c. A density measurement on the edge of the film shows that the base density is normal, indicating the negative has not been markedly overexposed.
It is our conclusion that this negative does not indicate the existence of any unusual or unidentified aerial object. The case is being returned to you and is so annotated.
Sincerely yours,
