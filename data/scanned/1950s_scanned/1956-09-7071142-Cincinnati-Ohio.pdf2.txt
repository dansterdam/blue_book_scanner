Dear Captain Smorey,

I have carefully examined the report of your sighting of an unknown aerial object on 9 August 1956 in the Cincinnati, Ohio area. The substance of your report indicates that you observed an aerial phenomenon which appeared to be a disc-shaped object traveling at high speed and making a course reversal. 

Your observation is of interest and is being included in the records of the Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects organization for further study and analysis. The characteristics you described, such as the high speed, abrupt course change, and metallic appearance are suggestive of the type of phenomena that have been reported in numerous other reliable sightings. 

While the nature and origin of these objects remains unknown, the accumulating evidence from credible observer reports continues to indicate the existence of aerial phenomena which do not conform to any conventional aircraft or known natural phenomena. Further investigation and careful analysis of all related data is clearly necessary to gain a better understanding of these puzzling occurrences.

I appreciate your cooperation in providing this report, and I assure you that it will receive our full consideration and study. Please feel free to submit any additional information or observations that may come to your attention.

Sincerely yours,

C.R.I.F.O.
