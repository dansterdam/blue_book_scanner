I have a sighting report of an unidentified flying object which I believe should receive your consideration. The object appeared to be at a high altitude, was circular in shape, and distinctly luminous or self-illuminating. It was observed in clear weather at approximately 8:35 p.m. on February 24, 1953 in the Forrest City, Arkansas, area. The object was visible for approximately 3-4 minutes before disappearing. I shall be happy to furnish any additional details you may require regarding this incident.
