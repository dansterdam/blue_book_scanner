Dear

This is to acknowledge your letter of 13 August 1958 concern-
ing an unidentified flying object sighted by your son on 10 August
1958 at Collinsville, Illinois. Your letter contained insufficient
data to result in a valid conclusion. However, the color of the
object strongly suggests a bolide or fireball.

For your information I am inclosing latest Department of
Defense Fact Sheet dated 5 November 1957 on the subject of
unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely, 

Enel			LAWRENCE 3. TACKER
