788th AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON 
Waterloo Air Force Station
Iowa
19 December 1956

SUBJECT: Unidentified Balloon

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. Subject balloon was found by Mr. in a roadside ditch about 12 miles north 7 miles east of Cedar Falls, Iowa. Mr. found the balloon 12 December 1956. He stated that the balloon was not in the ditch previous to that date.

2. The balloon envelope indicated that the balloon may have been of cellular construction. The remains of the envelope were in shreds which were 10-15 feet in length. The shreds were examined minutely and it was concluded that the shreds were not from the base assembly.

3. Futile attempts were made to identify the remains of the balloon by the Operations and/or Intelligence section of:
a. 20th Air Division
b. Central Air Defense Force
c. Western Air Defense Force
d. Air Defense Command

4. Mr. stated that he had found a balloon similar to this one in 1949 but that it was not as large as this one and it bore General Mills markings. He further stated that he had disassembled the metal portion in hopes of finding indications of a reward such as he had received in the case of the 1949 finding. The subject balloon did not contain any such markings or indications.

5. The finding was at first suspected to be one of the balloons launched from the Vanrelle California Launching Site; however, WADF investigation eliminated the possibility.
