Approximately constant with the direction from which it came. This direction was from a particularly direction, while the object itself was from a general area to the northwest, appearing to be about 10' above the horizon gradually to some 30Â°.

The object is to be described as a flying wing, elliptical, or any other term used when describing aircraft which have seen and heard, such as many people claimed to have seen. The object was in view for about 2 seconds. It was observed to be silent except for a very slight whining noise, comparatively high pitched, which did not resemble the sound of a jet, but was more like the whining noise to be said, I believe, often associated with some type of auxiliary power plant on a jet aircraft. The speed was estimated to be in excess of 700 mph.

There is an observation that there was no trail or exhaust of any kind visible. At no time did the object change course, speed or altitude. It was sighted during daylight hours, and the sky conditions were clear.

I was, in fact, a practicing attorney of some years, and I believe the information outlined above was as accurate as I could make it. I hope the foregoing is of assistance to you.

DO NOT be moved by any Y.A.F. record, because all that occurred is simply a rough idea in the Navy. I readily and firmly believe that people do not want to discuss this and openly support the fact that they are extremely reliable and consistent for a National Defense Program, and believe them, from the bottom of my heart, that the service men concerned have seen what they have reported and believe in L.A.F. if, as it seems to be, the object of an extensive official inquiry.
