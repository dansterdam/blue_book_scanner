THE HOLLY RIVER SAUCER
H. G. MOLLOHAN: Well, as I understand it, the fellows saw a red light way down there on the ridge, this side of the river. 
BARKER: Was it on top of the object?
HANK MOLLOHAN: It was on the top of the hill, where the object was down.
BARKER: And it was sticking up? 
HANK MOLLOHAN: Uh huh.
BARKER: And where was he, when he saw it? 
HANK MOLLOHAN: He was in the road, over there what they call the Old School House, down the road.
BARKER: And you weren't with him at that time?
HANK MOLLOHAN: I was with him, but he was looking through the glasses. You see, we was had one pair of glasses. I never could locate the exact place where they said it was, the best we could.
BARKER: Did they find any signs?
HANK MOLLOHAN: They said they didn't find any signs at all.
BARKER: When you were up at the site?
HANK MOLLOHAN: We were up the next day.
BARKER: And what did you find?
HANK MOLLOHAN: We couldn't find anything. We were people had been trampling around, probably the police had done it, or somebody. 
BARKER: Are there open places where something that big could land without breaking any branches?
HANK MOLLOHAN: There are places where there isn't heavy timber, grown up places where they could set straight down, like a helicopter. But as for as an airplane landing, I don't think they could do it.
BARKER: What was it your neighbors said?
HANK MOLLOHAN: He said it just looked like a radar thing, a big rod with a thing on top of it.
BARKER: Well, you know for what they say, it was about two miles, as the crow flies, They came over here the next day in a pick-up truck to find out what was seen, if it was anything like what they had seen.
BARKER: How did they describe what they had seen?
