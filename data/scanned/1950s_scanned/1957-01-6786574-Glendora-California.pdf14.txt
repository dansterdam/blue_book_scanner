NORTH ANDOVER HAS NOCTURNAL INTRUDER

January 28, 1957: CST member _________ of North Andover, Massachusetts, describes in detail an observation by his father. At 10:15 p.m., Mr. _________ had put his car in the garage and was walking to the house when he saw "an object giving off a light blue luminescence...in a shallow climb and traveling at a speed approximately that of a fast jet plane." The object was circular and appeared to be "slightly larger than a basketball." Its distance was estimated to be slightly more than a half-mile away and its estimated altitude was 1,500 to 2,000 feet. No structural detail was seen. The object was silent and left no trail. Visibility was good, with scattered clouds at about 20,000 feet. There was no moon and only a very slight wind.

"The UFO was traveling west to east and seemed to be rapidly spinning, like a child's top in motion." Its speed seemed to increase as it traveled away from the viewer. Growing smaller, it finally went out of sight. Mr. ________ had watched it for about 30 seconds.
