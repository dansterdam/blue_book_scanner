Capt. PAA
January 19, 1952

Definition implies the idea that Rappelt had toward the flying saucers from space and the interpretation of this, despite some discrepancy which he has and his views. He was not aware of the major objection hypothesis that I have proposed.

I am sending copies of this letter to, though I cannot through view show it with the same views. Sufficient the reader be informed that I am handling with care, lest he be falsely aware of his conclusions.

I have difficulties with the public relations to the view that there is any suspicion or controversy about what, as some persons believe. It is my opinion that there may be intelligent living in many places in the universe, perhaps on many planets, as is the case. If the interpretation of the vision of unidentified flying objects, sometimes called "flying saucers", by a number of reliable and technically trained observers during the past few years is correct, it would seem that travel through space by intelligent beings from some other world than this may be possible. If true, this interpretation would be of the greatest significance.

However, if the interpretations and conclusions are invalid, then the whole subject is not worth serious consideration. My reason for writing this letter is to explain my position and to reveal the considerations, doubts, and difficulties involved, and to seek your reaction. There have been many publications and much discussion about these possibilities; and I still feel that, no matter how unlikely they may seem, they should not be lightly dismissed. I am always aware of the possibility of self-delusion, and constantly strive to avoid it to the best of my ability.

I am tentatively scheduled to fly from Kansas City to New York on March 19, returning to Kansas City on March 22. I should have the good fortune to have you and may be allowed to meet with you to talk more about this. I will fly in complete confidence and hope that we might have a shorter to talk. I for one would welcome the opportunity.
