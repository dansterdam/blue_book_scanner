The image contains a series of photographs that appear to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text mentions that the photographs were taken by a Brazilian Navy photographer on Trinidade Island, some 600 miles east of Rio de Janeiro. The photographs show what appears to be a "flying saucer" photographed from an ALMIRANTE SALDANHA ship.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:
