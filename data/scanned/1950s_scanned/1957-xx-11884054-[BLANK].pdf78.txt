Aircraft:
With the large air traffic cries-crossing the skies over America, day and night, it is difficult for any citizen to see definite proof of a flight or CAA to keep a permanent record of aircraft movement. Therefore, it is thoroughly necessary to check aircraft movements immediately. We may check those through the CAA radio stations, radar, or many various ways, but we should check thoroughly, for when a report is received, and no aircraft can be found, this could be very significant.

Astronomical bodies:
Many observed UFO sightings are caused by astronomical bodies. The astronomial bodies that are mistaken for UFOs are usually the planets, stars, and moon. The suspicion of being an astronomical body is the bearing, the azimuth through sightness and navigation tables, and determine the locations of objects.

Meteors are not too difficult to evaluate because they seem to appear suddenly, a bright streak across the sky at high speed, without sound, or course changing, and lasting only a few seconds. Six observed for more than 10 seconds, horizon to horizon, six observed is the average. However, unusual meteors reported, and they appear to have had very unusual characteristics.
