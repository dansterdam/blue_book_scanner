REPORT ON UFO SIGHTING

Place: Boianai
Date: June 23, 1959
Weather Conditions: Patches of low cloud, otherwise clear. Moonlight.
Description: (as told to observer June 23, 1959 at Boianai.)
On coming out of the house at one o'clock on Sunday morning (21st June) I saw this light (white) about 500-700 yards away almost in a north-easterly direction. The light appeared to be about 40-50 feet in diameter and seemed to be coming from some object stationary in the air. The light ended from what seemed a great height and I watched it for the space of about three minutes, gradually moving and descending in a parallel position to the coast. It stopped at a point a little to the east of the station and a height of about three-hundredt feet. There it remained stationary for perhaps half a minute, and then the light suddenly became brighter and the object started to move away from me, slowly at first, but gathering speed it disappeared from view into the clouds.
When first sighted, I thought it to have been a light similar to those dropped by planes during the war.
P.S. Underneath the object I saw about four round black spots.

NOTE: All this information was volunteered without any knowledge of previous sightings of UFOs, and when explanations were offered, I considered it more like an invented "saucer" and was not, for instance, the shape of the object was like an inverted "saucer" and was not, for instance, quite certain in his mind that it was more like a "saucer" than anything else.
