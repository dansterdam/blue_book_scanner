TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT FROM THE IMAGE:

July 7, 1952

Dear Sir,

The object that I observed on the evening of July 4, 1952 was a large blue-white light which was hovering at a very high altitude. It seemed to be under control and moved slowly at first, then accelerated and moved out of sight in a few seconds.

This sighting was observed by several other people in this area and we all agreed that it was not any known type of aircraft. I work for the U.S. Air Force and have observed many different types of aircraft, but this was something I have never seen before.

The object was silent and did not trail any smoke or exhaust. It simply appeared to hover, then accelerated and disappeared from sight. I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately 50-75 feet in diameter.

I am sending this report to you in the hope that it may be of interest to your project. Please let me know if you require any additional information regarding this sighting.

Sincerely,
[ILLEGIBLE]
