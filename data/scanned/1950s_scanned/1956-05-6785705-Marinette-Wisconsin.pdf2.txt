HEADQUARTERS
4602d AIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SQUADRON (ADC)
COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO

AISOC
SUBJECT: Marinette, Wisconsin, UFOB Sighting

TO:
Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATIC
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. Reference "Marinette Case" and telephone conversation of 15 May 1956 between Captain G.T. Gregory, ATIC, and S/Sgt Deffinbaugh, this headquarters.

2. Forwarded herewith for action deemed necessary is ATIC Form 164 completed telephonically between UFOB observer, Reverend Dr. _____ and Flight 3-14, L6023 AISS.

3. Review of the attached form indicates that this sighting was possibly astronomical in nature. The following items would substantiate this hypothesis:

a. Unrestricted visibility of the heavens with the exception of a few scattered clouds.
b. One object, although moving behind a cloud, was still visible with a change in color indicating this was not a reflection but a self-illuminated body.
c. The short duration of sighting of each object or group of objects coupled with the distance traveled again indicates meteors.
d. The fact that the observer did not have sufficient time to see the object(s) through binoculars indicates the celerity of the objects.
e. The color of the object(s) is that of meteors.
