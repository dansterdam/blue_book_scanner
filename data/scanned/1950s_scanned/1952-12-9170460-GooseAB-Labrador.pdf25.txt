AF FORM 112—PART II
(Revised June 1953)
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM LABRADOR
PROJECT NO.
IR-67-52                        PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. On 15 December 1952 at approximately 2331Z an unidentified flying object was sighted by aircrews of an F-94B, pilot Captain E. W. Johnson, and T-33
aircraft, pilot Lt. M. S. Morris, in flight about 10 to 20 miles West of Goose AB. Base, Labrador. The object was pursued for 25 minutes or until 2352Z when it faded at a distance of about 150 to 175 miles from base.

2. The description of this mysterious object as beyond the speed of 270 to 280 degrees from Goose AB, while at altitude varied from 1,000ft to 24,000 feet. The higher aircraft were travelling at about 375 knots at altitude and increase, but could not close; thus no estimate of the speed of the object could be made.

3. The object itself was observed to have two red/bright lights on the side, but faint to be red (which could have only been presumed at best) with small, ringing, or propulsion or rocket exhausts (very bright); no sound was heard, and the random stop. Head on its motion changed the shapes assumed one that too object shifted or actual maneuversability in making orbits like an “S” turns and smaller segments and ascents.

4. Although the object was observed visually, saw from operator in tug F-94B ascertained a moment [illegible]-on to an visual with MIT at first visual observation. It is considered possible that they both target during the period of time, although the radar observer’s “tail chase report was in agreement with the pilot's visual sighting.

5. No aerial photographs or GCI scope photographs were available. No gci contact was made with the object.

6. During the time of this sighting the following aircraft were in the
vicinity of C-54s and C-55s, and F-86s. One of these aircraft was silhouetted by the interceptors. The C-54 and word the report very unusual sighting from the Control Tower.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

1. Weather was CAVU with winds of 220/5 on the surface, 270/25 at 14,000
Feet, 250/25 at 24,000 feet; visibility 30 miles.

2. This incident is Captain Johnson’s second encounter with an unidentified flying object in the Goose Bay area in less than 30 days. He had visually two more sights on a similar object on 23 November. The main differences in the two reports are increased speed, and the degree of maneuverability. Captain Johnson is an experienced combat pilot with 1502 hours total flying including 650 hours in jets.

3. Lt. Morris is also an experienced pilot with 1379 hours flying time,
including 254 times in jets. A crew chief flying with Lt. Morris verified his account of the sighting.

4. Both aircrews, although debriefed separately, reported substantally the same visual observations.
