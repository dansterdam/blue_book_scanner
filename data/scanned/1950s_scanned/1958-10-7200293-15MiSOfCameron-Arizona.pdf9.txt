LANDING IN KENTUCKY 
A saucer shaped object landed in a rural area near Stephensburg, Kentucky. The object was reported by a Mrs. James E. Goad, who, with her husband, was passing the area. She saw a bright, metallic object sitting in a nearby field. She thought it had crashed, so she stopped and called her husband to investigate. He approached the object and after examining it for about 10-15 minutes, he called a neighbor to come and see it. The neighbor arrived and together they walked around the object. The object suddenly took off at a high rate of speed, straight up, with a "whirring" sound. After leaving the ground, the object hovered for a few seconds, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. The witness stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape, looking much like an ice cream cone. According to the witness, it was about 30 feet in diameter and 12-15 feet in height. It was smooth and highly polished in appearance. After leaving the ground, the object hovered over the field for another 45 minutes. It then moved away at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight. No unusual odor or radiation was detected at the landing site. The ground where the object had rested showed slight grass indentations and traces of an oily substance that had dried up. An investigator was unable to find any other evidence at the site.
