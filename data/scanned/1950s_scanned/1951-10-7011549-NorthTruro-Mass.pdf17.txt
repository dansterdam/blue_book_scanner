IR-47-51E

The weather information does not
support temperature-invers-ed anomalous
propagation. There probably are other
discrepancies in the upper atmosphere 
which could also cause anomalous 
propagation.

The possibility that meteors entered
the atmosphere and were detected 
cannot be disregarded, and may be
the answer to this report. A meteor 
would cause ionization of the air 
which would increase the target detectability. 
Short duration of the condition support this theory, 
rather than anomalous propagation.
