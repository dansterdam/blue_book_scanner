DRAFT
SUBJECT: UFO Program
TO: APTR (General Walsh)

1. Since 1947 the Air Force, and more specifically the ATIC, has been responsible for a program designed to determine if unidentified flying objects were a national threat or had any scientific value. This program at its inception was designed to determine if UFO's were hostile, and had any possible scientific value. A tertiary objective was to determine the nature of each of these objects with the passage of time the absence of positive indication that these objects were hostile or had any scientific value, and the coming of the UFO's the third objective began to take on more nature. Today this objective has grown to such an extent that we are fast reaching the point where the till was the dog. This is a possible great danger to the Air Force prestige and certainly a danger to the intelligence community.

2. The attached study offers as a solution transfer of the UFO project to ARDC with aims toward eventual complete elimination as a special project. I concur with the views outlined in the study that such a move would be beneficial to both the intelligence community and to the UFO program. Disassociation with intelligence would do much to strip the aura of mystery from the UFO program, and the same disassociation would eliminate a project from intelligence which is more or less open to public inspection.

3. It is suggested that the attached study be approved and forwarded to the Air Force Chief of Staff with a recommendation for consideration and possible implementation.
