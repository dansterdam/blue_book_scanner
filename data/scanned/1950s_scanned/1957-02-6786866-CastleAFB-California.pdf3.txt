Atmospheric phenomenon. FF 
CAUSES OF SUCH RADAR RETURNS, BUT ALL EVIDENTLY ARE YET UN
PROVED. ONE OF THE RADAR OBSERVERS HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME 
TYPE RETURNS WHILE WORKING AT A CAR SOUTHERN AE BASE.
FAMOUS 14/1361/KC-97F WAS CONTACTED IMMEDIATELY IN THE LOCAL
AREA. THE ONLY PERSON ABOARD OBSERVING ANY THING OUT OF THE
ORDINARY WAS THE RADIO OPERATOR,A A/2C MUCCILLO, WHO, FROM THE
RIGHT SCANNERS POSITION SAW WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE SHOOTING
STARS. A/2C MUCCILLO REPORTED SEEING APPROXIMATELY 5-10 OF
THESE OBJECTS, BUT SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THEM
FROM OTHER "SHOOTING STARS" HE HAD OBSERVED THAT NIGHT AND 
ON OTHER FLIGHTS.
10. NO OTHER AIRCRAFT BESIDES FAMOUS 14.

BOMG. THE OBSERVATIONS FROM FAMOUS 14 WHICH WAS IN THE
PALMDALE AREA DOES GIVE EVIDENCE OF METEOR ACTIVITY, BUT THE
COARSE OF THE SIGHTINGS ON THE SCOPE DOES NOT CORRESPOND
SATISFACTORILY WITH THE OBSERVATION FROM FAMOUS ARM GCI WAS
NOTIFIED, BUT COULD NOT PICK-UP THE "TARGET" ON ITS RADAR SET.
ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENON COULD POSSIBLY EXPLAIN THE RADAR RETURNS
SEEN AND THE CONSIDERABLE SPEED WITH WHICH THEY WERE OBSERVED
(APPROXIMATELY 5,622 MPH.).
