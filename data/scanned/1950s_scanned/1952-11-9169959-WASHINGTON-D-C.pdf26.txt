The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a declassified UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"FFEBRUARY 10,1952 - PARIS, Va 12:35 E.S.T. - Two separate green fireballs penetrating our atmosphere, always have excited fascination. Concave the earth - like watching a B-B shot. Most unusual of all is their green color. The vivid shades, as green as a traffic light or neon sign, are so acutely green that "conservative observers might pass off the green fireball as merely green meteors, which fall early in November," says Dr. LaPaz.

Actually, they're like no bright star seen before. Finding them with the Shields is about like watching a 6-inch moon through bright green starshells during a bombardment of red-hot B-B shot.

Such facts lead to one conclusion: If the green fireballs are real, they are of an absolutely new type. Their coming may mean that the solar system (including our earth) has lately reached a new corner of the universe where totally unexpected events are occurring.

GREEN FIREBALLS may continue to fall and science may even have a hint of the "unexpected events". For 15 years, Dr. LaPaz says, scientists have speculated on the possible existence of what they are calling "extraterrestrial" material. Such material, if any could be found, might be radioactive like the natural matter. But it would be neither built backward, just like ordinary matter.

Where the nucleus of ordinary atoms has a positive charge, its nucleus would have a negative charge. And where ordinary electrons we a negative charge, counterbalance electrons would have a positive charge.

This means just one thing: the instant contact between this "extraterrestrial" matter and terrestrial explosion would occur!

"Could this be the explanation of the swift, missiles penetrating our atmosphere, always have entered jaegadly concave the earth - where big sudden last fall's fireball display did occur during the annual visit of the Shield audience above." 

Fact 2: Green fireballs have been observed only once before — in 1948, when they were reported seen over the Baltic Sea and Sweden.
Military commentators then were quick to suggest that the Russians might be testing advanced types of missiles originated from Germany at their nearby Peenemünde.

Suppose the green fireballs do give away some gigantic new secret of guided missiles or space travel? Who is responsible?

Again, because of the nearness of U.S. scientific centers, the temptation is great to say they're ours. But Dr. LaPaz says this: "If the Russians possessed missiles capable of intercontinental flight, it would be natural for them to make ranging tests over the Southwestern U.S., where we have important targets."

Why They Disappear

If the Russians have such rockets, it would also be perfectly natural for these devices to be made self-destroying, so that we could find only tiny fragments of them. How can we solve the riddle?

"We must try to do as we have done with countless celestial objects before," says Dr. LaPaz. "We must find a piece of one and examine it in a scientific laboratory."

But to search effectively, we must have aid. Is it possible, he wonders, that some person has picked up fragments of "strewn field" yard by yard, and foot by foot. And even then, if the fireballs are contraterrestrial matter, we shall have no success.

"But if we do find bits of metallic alloy which could burn with a green flame, we may well have a piece of a green fireball."

And from this piece we can surely say whether it originated in space, or in some frighteningly advanced laboratory.

"For science, and for our own safety, we should make such a search soon."
