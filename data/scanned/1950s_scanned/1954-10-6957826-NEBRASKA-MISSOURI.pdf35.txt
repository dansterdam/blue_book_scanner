Article from French newspaper, "France-Soir", dated 14th October 1954

The military commander (governor) of Metz studies the
report of Commander Cottal, who saw a luminous craft
caught in the beam of a searchlight.

By special reporter Henri Pignolat

The military commander of Metz, General Navereuil, Commander of the Sixth
District listened this morning to a report by Commander Cottel, specialist of
terrestrial anti-aerial forces, on the presence (last Sunday) of a mysterious
craft, which appeared during a three-hour period in the beam of a powerful
army searchlight, in the sky over the city. It can be very well imagined,
with what care and caution the Commander of the FAA has edited this report.
Commander Cottel was in charge of the radar post, installed at the army
stand of the Commercial Fair at Metz which just closed. This post had a
powerful searchlight which swept the sky over the city during the fair. A
dozen men were around the apparatus when, on Sunday night, the beam of light
suddenly focused upon a motionless globe in the middle of the sky, "scintillating
like a ball on a Christmas tree," asserted the Commander.

The beam was directed straight upward. The "thing" seemed to be 10,000
meters off. This is, at least, what experts alleged. There was no mistake,
it must be stated.

"It is a sonde-ball," said one of the searchlight operators.
"Impossible, this must have a diameter of 50 meters." Everybody agreed,
but who can tell for sure?

The Radar Apparatus Did Not Record Anything

Since one did not dare to believe in flying saucers, it was decided to
clean the lenses and even to change the carbon-electrodes in the searchlight.
