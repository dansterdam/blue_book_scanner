OFFICE OF 
CIVIL DEFENSE
OLEAN, N.Y.
April 25, 1960

Public Information Officer
H/Sgt. William Falls, AFS 
Niagara Falls, New York

Dear Sir:

My name is Bob Barry, Civil Defense Director for the City of Olean. I am checking on an editorial concern regarding a UFO sighting (Unidentified Flying Object) on the night of November 16, 1959, in the Niagara Falls area which involved two jets from Rome AFB.

I am writing for confirmation and other necessary information pertaining to the details of this incident. The Associated Press Digest shows we were investigating at a slow rate of speed toward Niagara Falls from the direction of the direction it was descending. The object was silently hovering and visible to the naked eye. The moon was visible in another portion of the sky at the time.

Your base allegedly received a report from one Youth Torster, of Buffalo, N.Y., concerning this occurrence. I am not quite certain as to whether he sighted the object and called your base, or if someone conducted an interview and relayed the base. 

The report further states that two jets from Rome, New York AFB were also allegedly airborne between 9:30 P.M. and 11:00 P.M., perhaps earlier, I am not sure.

The report ends by stating the UFO was trailed the jets. As the object with the two jets followed.

I would appreciate it very much if you will check this matter out for me and secure the necessary information regarding the incident. Kindly contact me via letter at your earliest convenience. I will await your reply.

Thanking you in advance for your help in this important matter.

Kindest personal regards,
Bob Barry
