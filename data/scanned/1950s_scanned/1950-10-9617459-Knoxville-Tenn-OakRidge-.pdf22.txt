REMARKS:
At approximately 1:30 P.M., on October 16, 1950, while working at Blair Gate, I saw an object in the sky over R-25 traveling in a straight line and going very fast. The object was white and seemed to be the size of a baseball at the distance it was from me. It seemed to be very high.

At exactly 2:55 P.M. on October 16, 1950, the object disappeared from the northeast at a considerably lower altitude and traveling a lot slower than before. I stopped a car which was coming in the gate in order to witness the object. As I watched the object, I pointed it out to the driver and Hank, who were coming in to work. I watched the object for several minutes. This object was slowly circling in a wide circle and spinning very fast, the color changed slightly around the edges. The object drifted towards the northwest and then suddenly shot straight up into the northeast and going very fast. We watched the object disappear into the northeast.

This information was phoned in to Headquarters immediately by the undersigned. About fifteen minutes after the object disappeared into the northeast, an F-82 Fighter plane showed up in the area where the object was last seen but a appeared to be thousands of feet higher than the object reported.
