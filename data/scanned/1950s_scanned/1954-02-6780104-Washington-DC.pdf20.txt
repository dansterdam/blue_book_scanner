INCIDENT
24 July 1948
The glow reminded of a blue fluorescent factory light. The exhaust was described as a red-orange flame, the lighter color (orange) being predominant about the outer edges. thought the flame flared out from a nozzle in the rear which he thought he perceived. The flame extended some 50 feet behind the object as it pulled up into a cloud. No disturbance was felt from air waves, nor was there any wash or mechanical disturbance when the object passed. No sound was heard.
Co-pilot attention was drawn to the object by a remark. His description of the object and its maneuvers was very similar to that of except that he did not observe a cockpit in front nor did he see any radar "scopes". His drawing and description also indicated windows or openings on the side. He estimated the object passed at greater distance than did Capt. He saw the "exhaust" as a parallel wide flame which appeared to come from the entire rear of the object rather than from a nozzle never growing any wider than the width of the object itself, although he noticed the increased length of the flame as the object "pulled up".
The night was clear with a bright moon and broken cloud coverage of 4/10 at 5,000 ft. Both estimated the object to be in sight approximately 10 to 15 seconds, considered sufficient time for experienced pilots to determine whether the "light" was a reflection on, caused by some atmospheric or astronomical phenomena -- or was a material object.
