"Those Flying Discs--

'Saucer-Like' Object
Reported In Alabama

Birmingham, Mar 9 - Sighting of a strange "saucer-like" object in the sky over Alabama was disclosed today by a man and his wife. Military intelligence has been informed of the report and is investigating.

The "saucer" was reported by L. C. Phillips, an employee of the Dupont plant near Louisville, Ky., who was on a visit to his wife's home in Medley-ville.

Phillips reported that he and his wife were riding on a dirt road near Bear Creek when they observed the strange object.

"It was a very pretty sight," Phillips said. "Something like a silver dollar, only much larger. And it was going with a speed that was just incredible."

He said the "saucer" was going up and up at an angle of 45 degrees until it was about the size of a pinhead and then it disappeared. 

"It made a sound like a small motor and had a light bulb," he said, "white with a greenish tinge. It was not making any noise until it was about to land on us, and then it made a humming sound."

Phillips said he and his wife searched the area but were unable to find any trace of the object.

"It was a very pretty sight with following lights and streamers," Phillips said.

There is no military unit stationed at Medley-ville, intelligence officers said, and they are investigating the report of the "Air Force saucer" sighting."
