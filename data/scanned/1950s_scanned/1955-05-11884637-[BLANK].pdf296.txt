The text below the image provides a description of the object, stating that it "flew in a straight line except for some changes in direction accomplished in a manner like any standard aircraft turn." The objects are described as being "shaped like conventional aircraft" and having a "glow surrounding it and was glowing itself."

objects flew in a straight line except for some changes in direction accomplished in a manner like any standard aircraft turn.

The objects were shaped like conventional aircraft. The unaccountable feature of the objects was that each had a red glow surrounding it and was glowing itself, although it was a cloudless night.

Case III (Serial 2013.00, 2014.00, and 2014.01)
Two tower operators sighted a light over a city airport at 2020 hours on January 20, 1951. Since a commercial plane was taking off at this time, the pilots were asked to investigate the light. They observed it at 2026 hours. According to them, it flew abreast of them at a greater radius as they climbed. It flashed some lights, which blinked some, which time it blinked some more lights. This caused the two tower operators to attempt to watch the object. However, it turned toward the plane and flew across, instantly appearing on their other side flying in the same direction as they were flying, and then in 2 or 3 seconds it slipped under them, and they did not see it again. Total time of the observation was not stated. In appearance, it was like an airplane with a cigar-shaped body and straight wings, somewhat larger than a B-29. No engine nacelles were observed on the wings.
