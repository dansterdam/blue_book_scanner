INFORMATION REPORT

CLASSIFICATION

UNCLASSIFIED

FROM

ASST. NAVAL ATTACHE, HAMBURG

RECORD NO.

981-57

DATE

18 December 1957

3. Source Information: Source is Professor Doctor ---, ------, University of Hamburg. Source was very cooperative as well as objective in respect to this incident. His final conclusions are limited to the opinion that this object was not a meteor but was something constructed by man for some purpose which is not known.

Prepared Officer's Comment: Rather extensive digging operations were conducted at site by German Army Engineers - a hole about ten feet deep with expanded radius was dug, the earth sifted and no metal discovered. The theory that this object was a ship's signal device has been suggested, however the nearest ship ---- could have been no closer to point of impact than one and one half miles, which would seem to negate the idea that a ship was the point of origin. The hole has been refilled and the incident is considered closed by local authorities.
