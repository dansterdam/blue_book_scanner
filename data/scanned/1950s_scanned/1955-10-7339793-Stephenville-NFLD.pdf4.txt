THE FLYING SAUCERS AS MENACING ROW YEAR

Although aviational mishaps were frequent and even deaths occurred in the year 1955 in the United States and other countries, we do not consider these as ordinary aircraft accidents as the explanation given by the authorities is not convincing enough. In spite of their suspicions and explanations, the public is not satisfied with the answers provided by the officials. The happening of a number of such incidents has already led many people to entertain the view that there is something unusual about them and they may be connected with the appearance of mysterious flying objects - commonly called "flying saucers" or "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs).
