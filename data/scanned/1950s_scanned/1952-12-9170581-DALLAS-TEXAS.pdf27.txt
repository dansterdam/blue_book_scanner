SUBJECT: FLYOBRPT

Statement by AN/APA/11 operator on 21 day December 1952, Convair flight on ship 44-92054, type B-36:

While flight testing AN/APA/11 radar on nose of B-36 oh, 12-21-52, I encountered a spurious target during work with fighter aircraft. Thinking that it might be cloud trouble, I asked pilot (C. I. Davis) what kind of cloud cover we had around this region. He replied that there was none and the spurious target was still there. To confirm the return, I asked the pilot to turn the ship. The spurious target again triggered the ALG and made a very firm lock on. At this point I asked the ARC-33 operator for confirmation on target. He confirmed that he had seen spurious target at same range. The spurious target persisted from 2000 to 4000 yds but varying in azimuth of 60Â° to the right or left of the ship's course. It did not behave as you would expect if asked the pilot to maneuver the ship after lock on to prove trackability. This showed the target to be very stable and unaffected by maneuvering of the ship. I had spent some 30 minutes with this target and when I did turn off the set, the target stayed with us down to about 8,000 ft. At this point the target was no longer seen.

This target did not look like normal return that you get from other aircraft. The only thing that I have ever seen resembling it was spent 20 ml shell cases which I have tracked before on the APA/11. I am quite certain this target system in unknown.
