UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: (Date)

TO: 7FOR-12-25
PAGF ONE 
The full moon looks much larger when rising than when overhead. However, this object, which was seen from an aircraft, is probably incorrect, and that the object was a "moon" or reflector eldsed.
It is requested for any information you may have to this case to aid in the solution of the case.
II. Dr. Ellis was in the U.S. Navy during W.W. II at a location where launching of large balloons had been carried on from that area. He is familiar with their appearance and is convinced that the unidentified object was not any type of balloon that he has ever seen.
Photo will be mailed as soon as available.

THIS IS A TRUE COPY
