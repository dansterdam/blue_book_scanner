Dear Captain Surran:

I am enclosing a fragment from an object that struck the roof of the trailer house of Mr. and Mrs. on Tuesday, June 3rd, between 9 and 9:30 PM.

Mr. brought this object to us last nite following a radio broadcast concerning a similar incident which occurred near Russell, Missouri. Apparently the object struck with a loud report or a "rifle" shot and Mr., when he went out to investigate he found many fragments. This being the largest piece.

As this is time he and his wife felt that this possibly was a fragment from a meteor. After hearing the broadcast they felt it should be turned over for investigation.

Will you please forward this to the proper department for investigation and let us know who the results are.

Yours very truly,
C. F. Kelley
Post Supervisor
