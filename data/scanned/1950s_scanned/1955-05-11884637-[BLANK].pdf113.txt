There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that contains text describing various categories used to classify UFO sightings, such as "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION", "PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS", and "UNKNOWN". The text provides detailed explanations for each classification category.

METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA LIKE SMALL TORNADOES, WERE COLLECTED INTO A CATEGORY CALLED OTHER. A SEPARATE CATEGORY FOR THE UNCOMMON NATURAL PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH LIGHT REFLECTIONS OR REFRACTIONS, SUCH AS MIRAGES, SUN DOGS, INVERSION-LAYER IMAGES, AND DISTORTIONS CAUSED BY AIRBORNE ICE, WAS ESTABLISHED WITH THE TITLE OF LIGHT PHENOMENON. CATEGORIES FOR INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS, AND UNKNOWN WERE PROVIDED FOR THE SIGHTINGS THAT COULD NOT BE FITTED INTO THE PRECEDING IDENTIFICATIONS. AN EXPLANATION OF THEIR USE FOLLOWS:

INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION - THIS IDENTIFICATION CATEGORY WAS ASSIGNED TO A REPORT WHEN, UPON FINAL CONSIDERATION, THERE WAS SOME ESSENTIAL ITEM OF INFORMATION MISSING, OR THERE WAS ENOUGH DOUBT ABOUT WHAT DATA WERE AVAILABLE TO DISALLOW MAKING A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THIS CATEGORY OF IDENTIFICATION WAS NOT USED AS A CONVENIENT WAY TO DISPOSE OF WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED "POOR UNKNOWNS", BUT AS A CATEGORY FOR REPORTS THAT, PERHAPS, COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL KNOWN ASPECTS OF NATURAL PHENOMENA. NO REPORTS IDENTIFIED AS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION CONTAIN AUTHENTICATED FACTS OR IMPRESSIONS CONCERNING THE SIGHTING THAT WOULD PREVENT ITS BEING IDENTIFIED AS A KNOWN OBJECT OR PHENOMENON.

PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS - THIS IDENTIFICATION CATEGORY WAS ASSIGNED TO A REPORT WHEN, ALTHOUGH IT WAS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT THE OBSERVER HAD SEEN SOMETHING, IT WAS ALSO OBVIOUS THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGHTING HAD BEEN OVERDRAWN. RELIGIOUS FANATICISM, A DESIRE FOR PUBLICITY, OR AN OVER-ACTIVE IMAGINATION WERE THE MOST COMMON MENTAL ABERRATIONS CAUSING THIS TYPE OF REPORT.

UNKNOWN - THIS DESIGNATION IN THE IDENTIFICATION CODE WAS ASSIGNED TO THOSE REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS WHEREIN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT AND ITS MANEUVERS COULD NOT BE FITTED TO THE PATTERN OF ANY KNOWN OBJECT OR PHENOMENON.
