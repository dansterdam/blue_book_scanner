The object was seen in Massapequa Park, Long Island, on 7 October 1957. The witness was a woman who observed the object for approximately 45 minutes. The object was circular in shape, silver in color, and hovered at an altitude of about 150 feet. At times it seemed to oscillate or wobble. The object had no visible means of propulsion, yet it moved silently across the sky. The object vanished suddenly, as if switching off a light.
