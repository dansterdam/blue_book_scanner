Venus - So Bright - Causing Quite A Stir

VENUS, THE BRILLIANT STAR, has upset some observers and,
astronomers alike with its unusual brightness, clear visibility and
strange behavior. The Venus disk reflects an unusual amount of light,
making it about 5 times as bright as usual. This has caused much discussion
and some alarm among skywatchers. Many believe the earth is passing
through a cloud or mist that reflects light from Venus in an unusual
manner.
