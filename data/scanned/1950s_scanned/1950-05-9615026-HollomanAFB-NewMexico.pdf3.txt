1. Per request of Dr. A.O. Mirarchi, during recent visit to this base, the following information is submitted:
2. Sightings were made on 27 April and 24 May 1950 of aerial phenomena during morning daylight hours at this station. The sightings were made by Lt. Evans, USAF, Research and Development Division, and several members of the theoretical division and theodolites. It has been reported that the objects are sighted in some numbers; at least eight have been visible at one time. The individuals making these sightings are professional observers. In both cases photos were taken with Askania's.
3. The Intelligence Air Materiel Command will supply 27 April pictures and made a report, a copy of which I am enclosing with this film for your information. It was believed that triangulation could be effected from pictures taken on 24 May because sightings were taken from two stations. The films were rapidly processed and examined by Data Reduction. However, it was determined that sightings were made on two different photographs and that triangulation could not be effected. A report from the Reduction Unit analysis of these films from the sighting are enclosed.
4. There is nothing further to report at this time.
