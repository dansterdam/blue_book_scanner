AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FILE 2-a, 4602d AISS
PAGE 2 OF 2
THREE MEN AGREED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN AS HIGH AS 60,000 FEET SINCE THEY COULD ORIGINALLY DETERMINE THE ALTITUDE WITH THE NAKED EYE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 10,000 FEET. POSITIVE ESTIMATE AS TO THE DEPTH OF FIELD FROM THE OBSERVATION POST IS UNKNOWN, BUT REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS FINALLY LOST TO OBSERVATION.

TOOLS:
1. AISSF-4, FIELD COPY
2. INFO SHEET FORM A

THE NEAREST USAF FACILITY TO THIS POINT OF OBSERVATION SHOWN ON THE MAP WAS 25 MILES BY AIR OR 30 MILES BY ROAD. HOWEVER, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS A COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND WAS WITHIN 2 MINUTES OF FLIGHT TIME OF THIS FACILITY. THIS TENDS TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING AN AIRCRAFT FROM A NEARBY AIR FORCE BASE OR OTHER INSTALLATION.
