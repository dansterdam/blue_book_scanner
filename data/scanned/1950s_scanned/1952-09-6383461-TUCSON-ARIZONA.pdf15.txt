1. All six objects appeared to be of the same shape, size, and color. They were traveling in a tight formation, with the three front objects slightly higher than the rear three. The objects 
were observed for about 15 minutes, and there seemed to be no appreciable change in their formation or speed during this time. The objects disappeared from sight suddenly, rather than slowly drifting away.
2. Time sighted: 13 minutes, 11.30 located for about 60 seconds.
3. Manner of observation: Visual only.
4. Location of observer: 16 miles south of Tucson, Arizona.
5. Identifying details: Aircraft identification or registration, aviation fuel consumption, and noise; no such data available. There is a preliminary opinion that the objects are possibly a flight of six jet aircraft. The source is considered to be reasonably reliable.
