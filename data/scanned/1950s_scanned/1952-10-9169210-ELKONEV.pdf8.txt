The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with hand-written notes and calculations.

1) 10800 Z RAOB at LAS - velocity, trajectory, and declination of 910 MB from 940 MB to 210 MB.

2) 10800 Z RAOB at LAS - pressure, temperature, and water vapor content from 940 MB to 210 MB.

3) Base (press. at LAS) is 940 MB.

4) Above 910 MB, lapse rate is normal up to 400 MB (as per a RAOB given).

The document contains various calculations and notes, but no photographic images.
