The bottom portion of the document contains an image that appears to be a grainy, monochromatic picture. Due to its quality and the lack of distinct features, it's difficult to ascertain exactly what is depicted in the image. It seems like a blurred or noisy photograph that might represent the sky or a similarly uniform background, but without clear details, no specific subject is recognizable.
