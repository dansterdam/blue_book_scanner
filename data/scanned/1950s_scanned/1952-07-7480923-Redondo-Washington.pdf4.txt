So I thought this one was a real one thought he was going to attack. I guess I saw it coming pretty good from out of the corner of my eye, and when they turned it on me I could see it very clearly. It didn't look like an ordinary plane, and I could tell it wasn't too high up. But I'm telling you this thing moved more like a balloon, that is to say it didn't have the speed we would expect from a jet plane or anything like that. Just going along like a balloon-crazy, but that's no ballon. Just a theory of my own. Whatever it was, it sure had me worried.
