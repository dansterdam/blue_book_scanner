Dear Colonel Bush:

This is to advise that on December 3, 1957, a Mr. George, New York, telephonically advised this office that while working on December 3, 1957, he witnessed an object in the sky approximately eight miles north or northeast of Rome, New York. Mr. George stated that this object was falling in a northeasterly direction from north of Rome with an orange tail in the sky approximately eight miles north or northeast of Rome. Mr. George advised that this object was the same as he had previously observed about six weeks earlier and that he had telephoned reports concerning the previous observations on both occasions. 

This information was furnished telephonically by this office to Mr. Raymond A. Marin, Special Agent, Office of Special Investigations, Naval Depot, Scotia, New York. This is being furnished for any further action you deem necessary.

Very truly yours,
