WBEN-TV......2
Mrs. Miller: And both of you saw it? At the same time?
Miller: How close were you to it do you think?
We turned a little bit to pass to the south of it, and we were probably 2 to 3 miles from it.
And the thing was just astanding there?
Just about standing; it was off our wing-tip.
Was there anyone else on the flight with you?
Oh, we had Miss Reynolds, our stewardess was with us.
Did she happen to notice it too?
She came up. We called her and she came up and looked at it later on after this had taken off at this terrific speed...
How long was it stationary there?
We couldn't say that it was actually stationary...
(several talking at once)
... from the time we were off the ground at Albany, until we were about 15 miles by air Schenectady and it was off on our wing-tip, and we watched it, just go through a ninety degree change in position, so strange to our eyes that it took to go through a ninety degree change in position.
Miller: Bruce?
Foster: How fast would you say it appeared to be going? Did it speed very rapidly during the time that you saw it?
The initial speed I would say probably was 800 to 1000 miles an hour. How fast can it... it's hard to say, just to compare the speed.
Neff: Certainly much faster than another airplane would.
Mrs. Miller: Faster than a jet?
Neff: Couldn't be a jet, not at that altitude because their speed is so critical...
Miller: Bruce... (garbled)...?
