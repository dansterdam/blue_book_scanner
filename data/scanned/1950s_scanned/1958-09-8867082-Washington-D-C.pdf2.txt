The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch depicts a compass and a curved trajectory line showing the motion of an object or objects in the sky.

The text output from the OCR:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
While I was watching the "star" it moved slightly to the west (my right) then it made a dip in its silhouette, as if it were a tiny disk-like object: then I lost sight of it. It seemed to move in a seemingly northerly direction; however, some change in the media may have distorted its appearance.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
