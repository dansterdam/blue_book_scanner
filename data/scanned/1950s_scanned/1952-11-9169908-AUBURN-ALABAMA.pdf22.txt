The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch appears to depict an oval-shaped object with two smaller circular shapes inside it, which the observer described as "this object that I have attempted to draw was sighted, November 8, 1952 at approximately 5:00 P.M. Central Standard Time, from Auburn, Alabama." The text provides a detailed description of the observed object, including its size, movement, and appearance.

This object appeared to be shaped somewhat like a balloon with a silver or aluminum collar or an aluminum cover. After looking at this object for about ten minutes, the observer stated that the object was no longer visible.
