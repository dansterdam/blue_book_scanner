11. COMMENTS
Due to the brevity of sighting (5 seconds) and the difficulty in the recovery of the primary report at this headquarters, and therefore, the impossibility of interrogation, an evaluation of the telemetry formation, no subsequent investigation was directed. A heliocopter could possibly have caused the sighting.
