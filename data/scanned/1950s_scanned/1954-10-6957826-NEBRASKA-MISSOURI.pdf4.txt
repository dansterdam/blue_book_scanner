Mr. M. Boy, a professor of mathematics, from Lusieny, discovered, over the
Saint-Germain-le-Livet woods, a silvery disc of seven or eight meters diameter
which rose quietly into the sky while turning around its own axle. After it
dived toward the ground from an altitude of approximately 600 meters, it took
off in a horizontal direction in a sort of dizzy attitude.

A "special advisory group", namely, the owner of a cafe, a rugby player, and
a champion swimmer, have also seen, above the chapel of Brouilly in the direction
of Montgelas in the department of Rhone, a flying saucer, moving like a ball used
for playing.

A bell-shaped object, three meter high, moving in bands of 12 meters in
an orange gleam and emitting sparks of greenish light, was observed for an hour,
on the railroad tracks from Svreux to Laviers, by an artist, his apprentices
and an agricultural worker.

A luminous mushroom, which moved rapidly and noiselessly, has been seen
Monday night at half-past 2300 hours, by Mres. Drouillard, at La Roche-sur-Yon.

A "flying cigar" of metallic appearance, from which three red-balls became
detached, has been seen by Mr. Roger Thevenin and Albert Daury, police officers
of the city force at Riom (Puy-de-DÃ´me).

Another "cigar", surrounded by an irridescent gleam, has been observed at
Bonpas in the oriental Pyrenees Mountains. It was discovered by Mr. Sebille,
a baker.

A craft of oblong shape, described big figure S's in the sky, and making
a noise like pressurized vapor, has been spotted by three young hunters over
the city of Gaillac (Aveyron). The same craft is alleged to have been observed
at Pont-de-Salars.
