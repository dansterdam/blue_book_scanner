The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing a textual description of a luminous flying object observed over Iran on March 21, 1951. The text describes the object as a "luminous green, red, and yellow object, about two meters long, moving from W to E at about 500 meters altitude" and states that it was a "Probable METEOR" based on the evaluation.
