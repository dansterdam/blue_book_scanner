There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten or typed text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will attempt to extract all the text from the document:

The object passed overhead at an altitude estimated to be approximately 1000 yards or less. The color of the object was white or slightly luminous, and the shape was something like an ellipse. It appeared to be approximately 40-50 feet in length and 12-15 feet in width. The object appeared to be in a horizontal position as it passed over, and it traveled at a high rate of speed, estimated to be between 600 and 700 miles per hour. The object made no sound and left no trail. The duration of the observation was approximately 3-4 seconds. The sky was clear, with only scattered clouds present. The object was observed first by one witness and then by several other witnesses in the immediate area. The object passed overhead and disappeared in the distance toward the northwest. The witnesses were impressed by the speed and size of the object, and they stated that it was not like any aircraft they had ever seen before.
