The text of the document is as follows:

At 0930 AM I was called from my office by a group of enlisted men standing in front of my office at 315 located at Brooks AFB. We saw an object that was in the sky. I just observed this object which at first glance appeared to be something drifting. It was pointed out to me that this object was hovering and it was then I noticed that it was just hovering in approximately the same spot and a seemed to wobble occasionally. It maintained this hovering position for approximately 5 minutes and then suddenly the size appeared to grow considerably and two more of these same objects traveling at a tremendous speed appeared to come towards the first object and also seemed to hover. All three of these objects then appeared to go into a steep climb and disappear from sight. The first object was described as being in a round or saucer like shape and still continued to wobble. I was the scene and called Base Operations and asked if they had picked up anything on radar and they said no. The only equipment they had was an APQ 13 which whether or not was in operation at the time I could not ascertain. Approximately five minutes after these objects were last observed it did not disappear until 1010 AM and when it did it also left on a heading of about 270_. I would estimate these objects were between forty (40) and fifty (50) thousand feet. No noise was heard and there were no obvious trails made by the objects.
