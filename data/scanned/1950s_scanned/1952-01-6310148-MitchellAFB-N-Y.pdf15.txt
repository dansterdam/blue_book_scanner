23 January 1952

The following is a statement made by Lt James W. Zeittroger, USN, COMBASE, NAS in connection with the sighting of an unidentified flying object:

"At about 0630, 23 January 1952, and while flying at 3000 feet approximately, I subisctead to a course of 225 degrees in an attempt to catch up with an object which I had visually sighted at a distance of approximately 5 miles. This object was traveling in a southly direction at an indicated air speed of approximately 310 knots. As the object approached, I observed that it was on a heading of southwest (about 210 degrees) and traveling at a speed of approximately 500 knots.

The object was seen from above and from the side. It appeared to be several in shape, had a dull finish, and possibly 20 to 30 feet in diameter. As it approached me, the object appeared to be less than 5 feet in thickness and possibly 20 to 30 feet in diameter. After completing his turn to a position for identification, the object proceeded to climb straight up at a fantastic speed. Approximately 2 miles from me and reaching an altitude of possibly 20 to 25 thousand feet, the object made a sharp turn to the right and disappeared from sight at a distance of approximately 6 to 7 miles southwest of Mitchell Air Force Base."
