Director of Astrophysical
Ohio State University
Columbus, Ohio

Dear Dr. Hynek:

My name is Hayden Hughes, I am the associate director
of the International Unidentified Flying
Object, which is a research unit with kind quarters in Old
home City. The purpose of our organization is to study and in-
vestigate UFO sightings over the United States and try to un-
cover the flying saucers RBS real or not.

This IHUFO has a panel of men known as the technical
advisory board. This men are highly recognized men in the fly-
ing saucer field. They help us come to a conclusion on our in-
reports that are sent into us by members of our organization.

We are now volunteering to organize a panel of men that
are authorities in different fields. After our evaluation board
has come to a conclusion, the flying skill be sent on to our
panel to analyze ruminate way. Our goal here is that one
day it could have so much facts and true information to end
all the mystical stories or non-existent saucers are Valid they
will be provided in our regularly publication even if the fly-
ing saucers stories would false or the flying saucers.

We were considering if you would become a member of our
scientific panel since you are highly recognized as an astrophysi-
cist.

We understand that you are a very busy man, but we would take
no more than we hope about sixty minutes. We could provide op-
a flying saucer to take the place of the examination.

Trusting to hear from you in the near future.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Hayden Hughes
