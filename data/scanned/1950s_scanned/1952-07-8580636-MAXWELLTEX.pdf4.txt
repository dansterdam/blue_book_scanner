10. 25 June 1952, Japan/Korea area.
This is not a single report but a collection of 13 radar reports which occurred in 1951 and 1952. No adequate explanation has been given by the regular experts for any of these and therefore this item as far as any judgement as to their cause, this is one strictly for the radar experts.

11. 22 July 1952, Maxwell, Texas.
Evaluation as possible meteors is not tenable if object seen to climb from 8,000 feet, to 14,000 feet, then to hover, and to fly in erratic manner, to over 5,000 feet. It was reported by four air police and a staff sergeant. This is clearly a case which should have been followed up further. Proper classification: insufficient followup, or insufficient information.

12. 22 July 1952, Uvalde, Texas.
This is an interesting case, with two witnesses. Chief witness was the weather observer for Trans-Texas Airlines, who was thoroughly familiar with planes, weather balloons, etc. Object observed for approximately 100 degrees at one time, with a pulsating and rotating movement. No sound. Object seemed to climb higher, and every second and move from in front of a cumulus cloud to in back of it, thus giving some estimate of distance. Object observed in broad daylight. It is too bad that this one was not much more thoroughly investigated since there were two adult witnesses and one 24 July 1952 incident occurred.

13. 24 July 1952, Carson Sink, Nevada.
Sighting just three to four seconds in duration, too short a time to make any definite observations. Witnesses were highly qualified (limited data).

14. 28 December 1953, Marysville, California.
A one-witness case. Even though observed by a fairly qualified witness it is very strange that there were no other witnesses since the object was said to be very strange.
