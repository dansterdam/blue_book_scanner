Transcribing the text:

from Hillsboro N.H. along a road that runs through the Battle and I observed an air force plane flying over what I estimate to be 500 ft more or less. As he was coming over the hilly country side, there was a time, that as he was hovering (a unusual space pilots), twenty minutes or so we could see the plane and the plane was still in the place where he was hovering, then I was able again, and about the same time those planes were still in the same place hovering higher than at first.
It was really a strange, and they in the plane. It would suddenly descend - this plane I seen - to give about 500 feet - a tremendous speed, then as quick as a flash it would jump up again - a marvelous going on - as I turned the other side to answer the door in question - as I turned the scene (and the plane was there and an absolute stant - which a moving flying saucer, those were simply non existent, they are really planes bearing something entirely new and all vistiably not in our vocabulary. Our eyes were Bulching - look - what is that; those seemed nothing like ordinary planes - I suddenly turned by head - this going back and forth - a most strangest happening - no bird - no jet - this going around the place, behind or through buildings, as I could not understand this at all.
The cause was plain - no wings - no tail - just round orange. Remember we watched down on the object and come to the entire cottage outside with identical color and size video.
