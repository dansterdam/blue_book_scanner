SUPPLEMENT TO REPORTS MADE ON OCTOBER 17, 1952.

Subject: B. 1952.

On looking out the bedroom window around 7:00 P.M., my wife observed a bright light in the sky coming from the southwest. At first it appeared to be an airplane, but it soon became evident that it was not. It was a distinct shape, changing colors rapidly, changing from white to red to green, etc. 

It hovered all night until midnight when I retired. I estimated its height at about 100 feet altitude. It flew across Smith's Creek, remained stationary at an altitude of about 50 feet. I watched it until it disappeared in the haze.

I do not believe it was an airplane, as no body or wings were visible, also no sound from usual aircraft was audible. It was perfectly silent. The object appeared to be oval shaped. It made no sound.

Since I viewed it from over a quarter of a mile away, it appeared to be simply a light, but the distinct changing colors and hovering convinced me it was not an ordinary aerial light. However, it disappeared after several hours, and I have no explanation for what it was.

Subject: 21, 1952.

SUBJECT: Night during the past night (Tuesday, October 21, 1952) a new zig-zag device appeared in the sky. It was stationary and seemed at first to be a star, but it soon began to move in a zig-zag pattern, the zig-zags becoming smaller and smaller until it finally disappeared. No sound was audible. It was observed from about 8:50 P.M. to 9:30 P.M.

At 9:10 P.M. (Oct. 21, 1952) the object was pointed southward from the north with a definite motion from the north to the south. However, no trail or exhaust was visible. Its motion seemed to be in spurts, but continuously southward, until it finally disappeared at about 9:30 P.M. I have no explanation for this zig-zag motion and disappearance.
