The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an aircraft-like object, which resembles an airplane. The object is depicted in a side profile view, and there is an arrow pointing right from the rear of the object to indicate the direction it was moving. The drawing is simple and does not include any complex details or annotations other than a few labels like "SUN."

Acting as an OCR, here is all the text output from the image:
