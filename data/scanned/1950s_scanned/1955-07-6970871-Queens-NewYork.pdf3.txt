REPORT NO. 93-UFOB-4-25
PAGE 3 of 3 PAGES
The text in the document states that a pattern was described by the source as very possible, and it was not unusual for it to be visible from the relatively short distance of approximately 100 miles. It also states that it is the investigator's conviction that these lights were the four spherical objects observed, indicating a misunderstanding on the part of the source concerning distance and azimuth.
The document is signed by John Vrana, Captain, USAF Charge.
The Approving Officer's comments state that the opinion of the Preparing Officer is that the sighting was caused by searchlight activity described in this report.
