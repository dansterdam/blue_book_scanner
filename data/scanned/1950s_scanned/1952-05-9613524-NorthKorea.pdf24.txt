STATEMENT

I was flying wing on a fighter sweep of North Korea when I called him a bogey at 9 o'clock position, object flashed in the sun. I quickly called him to roll up in a right turn as object was going under us from the left to right, when I saw object again it was almost cut of right and seemed to be rolling with puffs of white (2 or 3) behind it.
