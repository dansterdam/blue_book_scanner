FROM: 11-15-53 
SUBJECT: IR-15-53

Director, Operational Intelligence

R/I Japan Air Defense Force Comments:

Reference earlier reports: 12-4-52, IR-5-52, IR-3-53 all dated 33 December 1952 (Colonel Blanchard, 47th Fighter Escort Wing), attached. The above report revisions contain virtually identical conditions observed, reporting, evaluating, photographing, object sighting, attitudes and/or alighting aircraft, descriptions of object sighted and weather conditions of object in each case.

20th Weather Squadron (this headquarters) prepared a weather study on it, applying standard procedures. This information has been referred under separate cover. It has been suggested that no unusual atmospheric conditions existed at time of sighting.

Atmospheric phenomena, as indicated in Major Williams' statement, has been subjected to further study. But the phenomena has been unable to develop any definitive conclusions of factors which may have contributed to this condition.
