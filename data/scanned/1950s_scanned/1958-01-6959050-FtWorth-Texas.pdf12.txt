Dear Dr. Sehusted:

Reports of unidentified flying objects below to receive many articles in newspapers and magazines. I have received a supplemental memorandum of February 5, 1953 or subjects on which they are inquiring, and I conclude that they be of interest of the military agencies as stating the facts.

I like all other persons not required as witnesses these courses are conjecture as to the true nature and significance of the observations, as well as stating the facts.

I am willing furnishing copies of this letter to Dr. Sehusted for the information of you and other parties in interest. I will consider it a favor if you will confidentially advise me as to the identify of any others who I should include in this distribution, and if you wish copies mailed direct to them.

With best regards, I am,

Sincerely yours,
