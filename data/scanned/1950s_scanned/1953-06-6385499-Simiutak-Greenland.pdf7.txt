AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 25-36-53 
PAGE 2 OF 2

1. An unidentified aerial object was sighted over a Thule Force, Greenland site on 24 June 1953 at 2345Z.

2. The 5th Weather Detachment at "Narssaup" AD advised that the 2415002 pilot balloon at Thule had disappeared from view. It was tracking at 18,000 feet and was last observed at 15,000 feet.

3. The object was described as being circular, silver in color, and about 30-40 feet in diameter. It was traveling at an estimated speed of 900 knots and heading in a westerly direction.

4. The observer continued to watch the object for five minutes until it disappeared from view. It did not trail and seemed to be at an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet.

5. The 5th Weather Detachment at "Narrsaup" AD advised that the 2415002 pilot balloon at Thule had disappeared from view. It was tracking at 18,000 feet and was last observed at 15,000 feet.

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officers
1. Considerable evidence to be considered in a preliminary evaluation are:
(a) The object was observed through binoculars by trained observers. 
(b) It appeared to be a unique and unusual object.
(c) The flight characteristics observed are indicative of a "guided" or "controlled" object.

2. The possibility that the object was in some way caused by the "weather phenomenon" under observation, i.e., the lost pilot balloon, cannot be eliminated.

3. Although the speed of 900 knots is generally considered excessive for presently known aircraft, the possibility of extremely high performance vehicles cannot be discounted.

4. Complete analysis of the incident is being forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Project Blue Book.
