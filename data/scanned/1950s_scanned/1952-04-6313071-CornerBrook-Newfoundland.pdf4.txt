AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE, 4-15-52
12-1/x/52
SUBJECT: Unidentified aerial objects observed by the weather observer, Corner Brook, Newfoundland.
1. METEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS: None noted which would have a bearing on this incident.
2. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None.
3. INTEREST OR IDENTIFICATION: None.
COMMENTS BY INFORMATION SOURCE: 
"Flying Saucer" was sighted in the sky when the weather observer, who has over 20 years experience, was checking with his binoculars an object (possibly a weather balloon) which he had noticed at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The object moved at a high rate of speed and changed direction at a sharp angle. It was under observation for about 1 minute.
In the draft of an article which he prepared for publication in the local paper but was advised not to publish by his Commanding Officer, he states that the object may not be considered a "slight wildling motion."
