STATEMENT

About 10:20 PM on the night of June 2, 1953, my wife called me from the house to identify some objects in the sky. When I located the objects in the sky, there were two objects and seemed to be at a very high altitude, changing speeds at will, and moving in all directions. The objects, as I saw them, were yellow in color and were round. However, all I could see was the yellow color taking the shape of some round objects.

There were three objects in the air at one time traveling in different directions, i.e., circling, flying directly overhead, and zig-zagging motion. The total number of objects seen was six but there is a chance the three in the air at one time returned.

I called our next door neighbor, Capt. [redacted] US Army, to see his opinion on the sighted objects. My wife, [redacted], and myself were unable to identify the objects so I called Kelly Air Base and informed the Air Police Officer of the Day that such objects were in the air. After watching these objects for about an hour I again called the OD of the Air Police at Kelly for some information on these objects and he stated that he had informed security at Kelly of my sighting.
