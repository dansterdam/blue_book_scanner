At the time of the sighting I was
driving in San Jose Calif. with my
oldest brother. We were returning
to San Jose from a pleasant hunting
trip in Britty. We were on the
return trip and had traveled perhaps
and join me) it was approx. 11:17 A.M.
and the weather was as clear as a bell.
I was sitting on the passenger side,
looking out the window - when out of
the corner of my eye I saw a flash.
As I looked up I saw what appeared
to be a meteor-like object streaking over
the trees and falling downwards at a
tremendous speed. It disappeared behind
some trees and I could not see
where it landed, but I yelled out to
my brother that I spotted what 
I thought was a meteor. I don't know
my eye's off of it for a couple of seconds
that my brother had seen it. This
was not was not too mention.
