The image does not contain a photograph, but rather diagrams and text. The diagrams show the position of an object relative to the observer's line of sight, with an "A" marking the initial position and a "B" marking the final position. The text describes the motion of the object, stating that it traveled very smoothly and steadily, and mentions seeing a series of round objects.

22. In the following sketch, imagine your eye at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. Place a "B" to show where it was when when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

Traveled very smoothly. When object appeared to be rotating, it seemed to me to be oscillating or teetering and to have a wobbling up and down motion, but the motion was very steady as if on an invisible axis. There were also a number of round objects forming a V-shaped line coming in at one side, at a lower elevation, and dropping straight down behind the original object. The line of round objects was flying in a steady regular pattern, all maintaining perfect spacing. The round objects disappeared but the original object continued on toward the horizon. I watched it until it was lost from sight, but would prefer not to estimate the time as it is difficult to be sure in an incident like this.
