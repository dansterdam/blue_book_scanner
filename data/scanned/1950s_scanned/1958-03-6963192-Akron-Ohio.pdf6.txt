Box 235
Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio

Dear Mr. Gilmartin:

Thank you for sending us samples of the material turned over to you by Mr. . We have analyzed the material and find that it is strips of foil known as "Mylar", which is used in connection with radar operations as a jamming device, and also to drift from air vehicles during various exercises.  

Your interest and cooperation in this matter is sincerely appreciated.

Sincerely,

LEE H. STRAHL
Deputy Chief
Air Intelligence Office
