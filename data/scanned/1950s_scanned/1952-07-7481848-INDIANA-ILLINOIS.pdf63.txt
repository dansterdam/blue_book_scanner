The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch of an object and its direction of flight. The sketch is accompanied by a text box that indicates "No sound, exhaust, or vapor trail."

The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, apparently behind some hills.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? No, some hills presumably.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: brilliant white or blue-white
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or coin's length in line with a known object and note: how much of the object would have been covered by the head of the match. If possible, estimate this in degrees at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? It was about five or six times the apparent diameter of the moon. I considered this carefully at the time, and I must report the accuracy.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you now-such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially outline trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. No sound, exhaust, or vapor trail.
