By/From Command:
This report is in reference to a sighting of an unidentified object observed by observers at Det #1, 5025th ATSq, APO 970. The object was observed to be moving at a high rate of speed, and if hovering, would appear to be moving rapidly. The object was under observation for some time, and if it had been a nearby object, would appear to be much larger than it appeared. Since weather balloons are known to have been used in this vicinity, Det #1, 5025th ATSQ, dated 24 June 1952 is reported in IR-32-124.
