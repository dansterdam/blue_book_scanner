The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a UFO report document. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Like a rushing sound
b. Color - A bright, almost white color, possibly iridescent or silvery.
17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially unusual trails or vapor trails. Please place your name on your sketch.
The object appeared to be round or spherical in shape, with no definite projections or appendages visible. There was no noise or vapor trail observed.

8. The edges of the object were:

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
There appeared to be only one object. It was traveling in a slightly downward direction at a high rate of speed, and seemed to disappear in the distance.
