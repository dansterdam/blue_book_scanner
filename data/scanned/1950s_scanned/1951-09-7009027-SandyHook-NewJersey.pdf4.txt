Flying saucer report 11 September 1951

A P-33 Jet fighter landed at Mitchell at 1145 yesterday, the 10th of September. The pilot reported that they had seen in the sky over Sandy Hook a round object moving at a terrific rate of speed. With an arc light like motion it was within their field of vision for about two minutes. They were traveling at 400 miles an hour, at a height of 20,000 feet. The object was approximately 12 to 15 feet in diameter, and crossed in front of them to Asbury Park, where it veered out to sea. They believe that the object was being influenced from the object because it had that effect, that is it, slowed, whatever it was. They reported this to operating officer when they landed, and wonder it got to the ears of one of the local newspapers on long island?

Col: Yes, you are right, is that correct?

Maj. D. I would suggest that the basic facts be on the press inquiries. (I Leave that the facts as reported to me by the pilots) The pilots made no mention of the fact that they saw a flying saucer, but merely reported that they had seen a strange object, moving it a speed they estimate to be in excess of 500 miles an hour, in an arc-like direction, over Sandy Hook. In response to the press inquiries, we gave the facts as related to us by these pilots, and as required by regulations, when I was queried on this matter.

Col: Yes, I'm getting it, go ahead.

Maj. D: I think I've given you the basic facts of the matter. I don't know how hard reached the newspapers were, but as required by regulations, when I was asked to check the story by the press, I checked it, I found out the report to be true and I released the story, as given to me by the pilots.
