THE UFO INVESTIGATOR

Missile Flight
Safety Chief Reports
Sighting of Large UFO

According to Mr. Wagner, missile flight safety chief, an entire UFO was visible from Las Cruces, New Mexico, to El Paso, Texas. This large UFO, estimated to be about 50 feet in diameter, was first seen in Las Cruces and was observed moving toward El Paso. The sighting lasted for about 15 minutes, and it was observed by many people.

Mr. Wagner reports that visibility was excellent, and the sky was clear. He and his assistants observed the UFO through high-powered binoculars. The UFO appeared to be under intelligent control, and its maneuverability may have involved some type of propulsion system unknown to us.

According to Mr. Wagner, his entire staff was greatly concerned by this sighting, as they were responsible for the safety of missile flights in that area. They felt that the UFO posed a potential hazard to flight operations. The UFO was observed to make sharp turns and to accelerate to high speeds, something beyond the capability of any known aircraft.
