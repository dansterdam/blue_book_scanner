OPERATORS COMMENTS: THIS REPORT FROM CLARK SEEMS VERY SIMILAR TO REPORTS RECEIVED RECENTLY FROM OTHER COMPETENT CIVIL AND MILITARY OBSERVERS REGARDING HIGHSPEED MANEUVERABLE OBJECTS OVER SOUTHWESTERNUSB. INTENSE WHITE LIGHTS OF APPARENT WEG DURATION OVER 3 SEC DURATION OVER A PERIOD OF MINUTES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED. OTHER VISUAL SIGHTINGS INDICATE SPEEDS OF MORE THAN 15,000 MPH. SOME THINK SIMILAR TO EXHAUST OF AIRCRAFT OR MISSILE TESTS REPORTED IN THIS AREA. USUALLY HAS NO TRAIL AND MADE NO SOUND AS REPORTED BY OBSERVERS. SEVERAL AIRCRAFT HAD NO AFTER JATO POWER TO ATTAIN SIMILAR SPEEDS RECORDED. OBJECT VAS NOT READILY IDENTIFIABLE BY CREWS AS TO SOURCE OR FUNCTION, CANNOT BE CORRELATED WITH ANY TYPE OF AIRCRAFT OR MISSILE KNOWN TO BE OPERATIONAL.

"AFTER CONSULTATION CREW CLARK, AMC OBSERVER ON DUTY AT THAT TIME IS NOT HERE UNDERSTOOD TO BE AND AS OPERATOR SAID OBJECT DISTANT SOUTH OF SRT. FLASHING BLUE GREEN LIGHT AND MAKING RAPID MANEUVER WAS NOT AIRCRAFT OR FAMILIAR OBJECT - AND HE ADVISED OBJECT WAS SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN A C-47. NO VAPOR TRAIL OR SOUND DETECTED."

COMMENTS OF PROJECT OFFICER:

A total lack of detailed information on flight path, size, shape, and color of object as well as lack of specific details on how the relative speed and size was determined makes further analysis of this report difficult. No photographic evidence is available from this sighting. The complete lack of technical details in the report is unfortunate for detailed analysis.
