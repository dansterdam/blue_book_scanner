1. On two occasions on the night of 29 January 1953 • B-29 crews observed a spherical shaped object paralleling their course. The object was described as being "the color of the gun with occasional bluish tint". Details of the report may be obtained from the aircraft.

2. Since the objects followed the aircraft for uns of one minute and five minutes, it can be safely assumed that they were propelled (i.e., not soaring or free-drop missiles). Therefore, it is requested that the shape and color of the reported flame be analyzed for the possibility of the object being:

1. A review has been made of descriptive material regarding the observations made the night of 29 January 1951, by members of B-29 crews of tobe-lika fiery objects flying courses similar to friendly aircraft for short durations..

2. This group concurs that the objects appear to be propelled but from the descriptions and the time durations cited it is not considered that the objects are conventional jet engines, conventional jet engine with afterburner, pulsejet or rocket propelled. Slight credence, hovers, is given to the possibility of a ranjot powered helicopter or a modification thereof *, with provisions Incorporated for directing a along a section of the trailing edge of the rotor blade, creating the fuzzy edged, luminal changing of flimress and orges, globe shaped phenomena observed recently by members of the B-29 crews In Korea.
