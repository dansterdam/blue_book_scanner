AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IR-072-F
Date: November 23, 1951
At 0430, 6 November 1951, a light was sighted and arrived at 0443Z. The light was bright and visible, was off and on, and flashed green and white. It was flat above and convex below, and was estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter. There was no sound or trail, and it appeared to approach a plane at high speed and then pull away. No radar contacts were recorded, and it was reported that the light could have been a flash of lightning. A low search was instituted, but no clues were found.
The overall evaluation of the investigation by Captain Orin was that this instance appeared to be an unidentified aerial phenomena, and many illusions which easily could be confused as a pilot. The U. S. Coast Guard did not utilize these objects in any way, and vessels only in cases of distress or emergency.
