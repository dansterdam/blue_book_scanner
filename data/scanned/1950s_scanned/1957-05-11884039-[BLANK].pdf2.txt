Eliminate AFOIN-X and the Scientific Advisor, AFOIN-4.
The briefing book prepared by AFOIN-4 for General Lewis and Colonel John D. Kettingham, USAF, dated 14 May 1957, regarding certain recommendations, was handed to AFOIN-X by Colonel Llewelyn, USAF, on 15 May 1957.
AFOIN-3 has expressed to AFOIN-4 that an Air Force release to the public, as accompanied by consideration for controlling the number of inquiries received by them, is required for this SAYRE case. Approval with PIO/OTVOI considerations is required for printing and subsequent release to the public. Requests for government printing and subsequent release to the public should be made.
This action will require a further endorsement of this DCS/O request for preparation of General Lewis to sign.
