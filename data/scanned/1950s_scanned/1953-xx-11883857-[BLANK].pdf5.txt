14 JAN 1955
SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Flying Object Guide

TO:
Commander
4602d AISS (ADC)
Ent Air Force Base
Colorado Springs, Colorado

1. Attached for your convenience is the "UFOB Guide"
(Unidentified Flying Object Guide) which was prepared as a result
of the conference hold on 17 and 18 November 1954 between the commander
and staff of the 4602d AISS and personnel of ATIC.

2. The "UFOB Guide" is divided into two parts. Part I contains
the criteria for use in determining the feasibility of making follow-
up investigations. Part II contains hypotheses or examples for use
in identifying the objects or phenomena reported.

3. It is suggested that, after a reasonable period of use, a
part III be added to the "UFOB Guide" incorporating the definitions and procedures as agreed upon in the conference and as outlined in
your letter subject "Report of Visit of ATIC Representatives" dated
23 November 1954. This could then be printed or mimeographed and would serve both the 4602d AISS end the ATIC as standard operating procedure.
