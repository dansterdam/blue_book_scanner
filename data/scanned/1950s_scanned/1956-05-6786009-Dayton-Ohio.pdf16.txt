UFO SIGHTED BY PROSPECTORS
Case 161-56 Salt Lake City, Utah, May 10, 1956-
Two prospectors reported seeing an unidentified object which they say "lit up the sky over Public and the Great Salt Lake." On May 12, the Desert News and Telegram reported that the sighting occurred about 7 PM that night "while working in the air in the western part of Millard County, from near Toppin. Robin
Langston and Mr. Sittner, and their son Don, all of Toppin, stated that they were staring at an unidentified object which suddenly lit up the sky like daylight."
One of the prospectors, "I had a pair of 8X30 binoculars with me and looked at the object through them. The object looked 'like the bottom of a saucer' except that it was slippery rather than entirely round. It was the brightest silvery thing I have ever seen," said Langston.
The object remained stationary for about 2 minutes and then disappeared out of sight. A strong wind was blowing in the incline to the west and continued for about 74 degrees angle and disappeared out of sight.

Said Langston: "This makes me certain that it was not a balloon." There was nothing hanging down from the bottom, either. The men reported that they were about 2,000 ft. high and that the object was about 3,500 feet.
