There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with instructions and questions for the observer.

O. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

1. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

2. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?

3. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

4. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The text appears to be typed/written on a blank page with some instructions and questions for the observer to fill out.
