The image contains a hand-drawn diagram of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The diagram includes labels such as "FORWARD MOTION", "ELECTRIC FLOW", and "CONTROL PANELS". There is no photographic image present in this document.

How it seems to me that such a ship would be very hot inside and there would be some discoloration to the outside, due to the intense heat which would naturally be generated by something of this kind. No doubt that the heat would be very great and to that extent it would be rather hazardous to receive too near an approach. This must obviously be a very fast performance machine and as an average could would be made to attain a second velocity which is about twice the speed of sound. This would mean that it should exceed the velocity of our conventional aircraft by a considerable extent. I am enclosing a rough sketch of how the ship looked which I saw and I hope I have not bothered you too much with your very busy work which you have to contend with. I do hope that all of the information given will receive earnest consideration. It is very best regards.
Sincerely yours,
