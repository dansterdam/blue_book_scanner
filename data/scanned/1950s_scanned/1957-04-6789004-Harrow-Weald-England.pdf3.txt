THE COMET THAT WAS TO PASS BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN. 
NOT KNOWING WHERE THE COMET COULD BE LOCATED WE WERE 
SEARCHING THE ENTIRE SKY, OBJECT FIRST OBSERVED 
APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES ELEVATION FROM HORIZON IN THE SSZ. 
OBJECT MOVED APPROXIMATELY 35 DEGREES ELEVATION FROM 
NNE IN THE NE. D. DESCRIPTION OF FLIGHT PATH OF OBJECT 
WAS SIGHTED IN A STRAIGHT LINE, JUST OVER THE TOP OF JUPITER, 
RELATIVE TO EARTH AND LINE OF SIGHT. AFTER PASSING JUPITER
THE OBJECT BEGAN MANEUVERING AT SHARP 25 DEGREE ANGLES, FIRST 
MAKING A 45 DEGREES ANGLE CONTINUING A LEVEL FLIGHT IN A 
DIRECTION. CHANGES IN DIRECTION WERE SHARP AND DEFINITE,
OCCURRING ONLY CHANGE IN COLOUR FROM THE NORMAL RED TO A 
FLIGHT ORANGE. ONLY AT THE APEX OF EACH ANGLE. CHANGE OF COLOUR 
WAS ONLY A MOMENTARY CHANGE EXACTLY AT THE POINT OF THE ANGLE
OF THE CHANGE OF DIRECTION AND IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO RED.
THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW BY DIMINISHING IN SIZE DUE TO
TRAVELLING AWAY FROM WEST. LENGTH OF TIME IN SIGHT WAS 
APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 6 SECONDS. MANNER OF OBSERVATION:
A. GROUND-VISUAL. B. OPTICAL AIDS-NEGATIVE. A. TIME

PAGE THREE RUDOLTA 122
AND LOCATION OF SIGHTING: A. 25:55 HOURS ZULU (<35 LOCAL), 23 APRIL
1957. B. LIGHT CONDITION-NIGHT. 5. LOCATION OF OBSERVERS:
HARROW-WEALD, MIDDY ENGLAND. G. IDENTIFICATION OF OBSERVERS: 
A. CIVILIAN-MRS. [REDACTED] AGE 25, [REDACTED]
HARROW-WEALD, ENGLAND. E. MILITARY- S/SGT RICHARD L.
[REDACTED] 75 TAC AIR BASE GP/C, APO 244. RELATIVITY 
KINSMAN. 7. THERE WERE NO CLOUDS, NO MOON AND THE ATMOSPHERE 
CLEAR, VISUAL EVIDENCE OF OBJECT WELL DEFINED. AT THE TIME OF
SIGHTINGS, THE COMET WAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
WHICH STARS TO C. SEEN QUITE WELL IN AND THE ATMOSPHERE
CONDITIONS, A VERY SLIGHT BREEZE WAS BLOWING. F. CONCLUSIONS:
COMET PASSING EARTH WAS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF 
VENUS, THEREFORE, OBJECT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE COMET.
THIS IS HERE TO ADDITIONAL MENTIONS CARRIED BY A JETCRAFT 
WINGS AND TAIL AND THE SOUND WAS EMITTED FROM OBJECT
