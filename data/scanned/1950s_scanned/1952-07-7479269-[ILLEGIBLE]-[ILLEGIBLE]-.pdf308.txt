The image does not contain any photograph or visual elements. It appears to be a handwritten text document, likely a page from a Project Blue Book report.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

P1.  At 0240 on the morning of 1 July 1952, received an object visible streaky overhead and granted it out to my fellow observers. They saw it also. Then a second object moving from about due easterly northeast. It was similar in character and granted it out to other observers. Though it. was moving at the rapidity of a jet plane, it was constant in its lighting and changing with a pulsating movement. It faded from sight before long, about 3-5 miles away and altitude approximately 10,000 feet. Weather was perfect, clear, and should continued visibility with a breeze coming out of the east.
The object moved in a straight line well past the horizon.
