MEMO FOR RECORD -
SUBJECT: Object Sighting, 6 November 1957

1. a. On 6 November 1957, Mr. - of Monroeville, Ohio, reported that he and his wife had observed an unidentified flying object while driving northeast on U.S. Highway from Painesville to Monroeville. This object was hovering over the highway and then disappeared. This case was investigated by the Civilian Defense and the Air Force and according to the report appearing in the Civil Defense Report, it appears to have been a reliable sighting.

2. Facts for Consideration.
On 29 November 1955, Major Friend and M/Sgt Hill visited Mansfield, Ohio to contact Mr. - concerning a February sighting by him and an object described by Mr. Moore. I find it necessary when conducting investigations of such phenomena to explain that I am not connected with the Civilian Saucer Investigation (CSI) and this material is sent solely for your information and retention. The contents are not to be reproduced in any manner without prior approval. I would appreciate your recording this information and returning the "blank tape" and return postage.
