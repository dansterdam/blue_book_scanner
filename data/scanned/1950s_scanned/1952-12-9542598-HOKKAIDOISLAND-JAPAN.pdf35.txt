DEC. 29, 1952 NORTHERN JAPAN
AT ABOUT 7:30 P.M., AN AIR FORCE RADAR BASE IN NORTHERN JAPAN RECEIVED A CALL FROM A D-26 CREW.
WE'VE JUST SIGHTED A UFO. IT LOOKS LIKE A CLUSTER OF LIGHTS -- RED, WHITE AND GREEN.
MOMENTS LATER THE AIR FORCE RADAR MEN PICKED UP THE UFO. BUT BECAUSE OF THE SPEED NO INTERCEPTION COULD BE MADE. AT 7:45 P.M. AN F-94 PILOT RADIOED IN, REPORTING THE SAME TYPE OF DEVICE. THE CALL WAS OVERHEARD BY COLONEL CURTIS LOW, COMMANDER OF A FIGHTER ESCORT WING IN JAPAN.* COLONEL LOW WAS FLYING HIS F-84 JET FIGHTER AT 27,000 FEET.
THREE MINUTES LATER THE STRANGE OBJECT, EASILY IDENTIFIED BY ITS RED, WHITE AND GREEN LIGHTS, HE CALLED GROUND CONTROL AND WAS ASKED TO TRY AN INTERCESSION.
AS HE CLIMBED, COLONEL LOW SWITCHED OFF HIS LIGHTS. THE OBJECT'S LIGHTS DID NOT CHANGE -- PROOF THAT IT WAS NO CANOPY REFLECTION.
CLOSEALY BELOW HIT CLIBED TO 30,000 FEET. WHEN HE GOT CLOSER, HE SAW IT THAT THE OBJECT'S LIGHTS WERE REVOLVING CONSTANTLY IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION -- A STEADY ROTATION EVERY 12 TIMES.
BESIDE THE SHIFTING COLORS, LOW COULD SEE THREE FIXED SHAFTS OF WHITE LIGHT SHININGAN UNUSUAL APPEARAPPEARING ONE AFTER THE OBJECT WAS ROTATING. BUT THESE DID NOT CHANGE COLORS - PUZZLING.
ABRUPTLY, THE OBJECT SEPARATED INTO SIX DISTINCT PARTS -- CIRCLING LIKE SATELLITES ABOUT A SUN. THE WING COMMANDER SAW BRIEF COMBINATIONS -- RED-WHITE AND GREEN-WHITE. BUT THE THREE WHITE BEAMS, REMAINEDCONSTANT.
AFTER WATCHING THE DEVICE FOR A MOMENT LONGER, COLONEL LOW OPENED HIS F-84 TO PULL POWER -- DIVING IN AT OVER 600 MILES PER HOUR. HE TRIED TO CLOSE THE GAP. APPARENTLY HIS UNIGHTED PLANE WAS NOT SEEN FOR A SECOND OR TWO. THEN THE UNKNOWN INCREASED ITS SPEED, GRADUALLY PULLING AWAY. IT DISAPPEARED IN 22 SECONDS.
FIVE MINUTES LATER, CIRCLING AT 35,000 FEET, THE WING COMMANDER SAW THE OBJECT AGAIN. AS BEFORE, IT WAS AT HIS LEVEL, BUT NOW MOVING PARALLEL WITH THE F-84. THIS TIME, AS A TEST, COLONEL LEFF HIS LIGHTS ON WHEN HE TRIED TO CLOSE IN. IMMEDIATELY TURNING WEST, THE STRANGE OBJECT SPEEDED UP, SO SWIFTLY THAT IT VANISHED IN FIVE SECONDS.
