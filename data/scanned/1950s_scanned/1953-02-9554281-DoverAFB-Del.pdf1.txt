"This object changing colors hovered at 30-40 thousand ft. over the AFB. Object appeared to be metallic in color and maneuverable. Two attempts made unsuccessful attempts to close for closer observation. Object could not be identified as any known aircraft or astronomical phenomenon. The plant "Jupiter" in the NW horizon position at the time could not account for the observed phenomenon. No records of the USAF or of the US Navy Jets being in the area at the time. The identity of this object remains unknown. Further analysis and investigation appears indicated to determine the nature of this unidentified aerial phenomenon."
