Am attaching all the correspondence from the case, except the TWX - which was turned over to you during my last visit to Washington. I thought it would be best if you would review my letter to the MC62 requesting they re-enter the case - as you may desire from the correspondence they might the objects seen by the good reverend are meteors. Perhaps I have phrased the letter in an excessive manner, in an effort of being hypnosis may be misconstrued.

If you desire a review of the situation and get specific answers to your original TWX question, I will be glad to furnish the information being too blunt.

I will follow up on the case. I think the best thing to do is to correspond directly with you. I can say that I happened to be talking to you at ATIC and got interested in it because of its astronomical implications, and thus I need not disclose my connection with the project. O.K?

If I may digress to the general matter, may I submit the following suggestion as being some possible value resolving the satcer hypothesis: Is it possible for you to contact and consult with astronomers (not the population at large) and determine whether there was any unusual meteoric activity or astronomical phenomena for the night of the sighting which could have been mistaken for a saucer observation? This is definitely not to question your professional integrity or opinion. I'm sure you consider and will be your usual alert self to all the evidence indicating you have exhausted all sources to approve or disapprove the hypothesis. This is in keeping with our policy of getting all opinions, evaluations, analysis, results of investigations, etc. -- "on record".
