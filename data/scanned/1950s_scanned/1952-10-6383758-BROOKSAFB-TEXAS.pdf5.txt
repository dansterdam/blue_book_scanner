STATEMENT

At about 0915, 9 October 1952 I observed several people standing in front of a building. I looked up in the sky and saw a round object. As I watched this object, it seemed to get smaller and move up in the sky. This object seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. At that time I became interested and went out in front of the building. I had already called several other people and they came out and observed this object with me. This object seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed across the sky and remained in sight for approximately 15 minutes. At one point I became convinced that it was a weather balloon and so remarked. Immediately, though, it was a weather balloon and so remarked. Immediately, though, it seemed to veer suddenly and go straight up and out of sight. At that time I came to the conclusion that this was not due to my eyes, since we were looking almost directly at it. There were no clouds in the sky, it was a clear day. I did not perceptibly change color or shape as I watched it.
