"BOY 'SEES' FOUR ON SPACE SHIP
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - An 11-year-old boy identified as Everett Hughes, a student in the Holston Grade School, is getting more exciting television reaction to the small fry saucer he reported to the sheriff. His school principal and a newspaper reporter interviewed the boy who said he saw a strange silvery object 10 feet from the window of his home when a "there and round shape ship" crossed the road. 
Out of the unidentified flying ship, said the boy, came four German soldiers in war regalia. He said it took off like a helicopter after the four got in. His story had such a ring of sincerity to it that the Knoxville News-Sentinel and Photographier Bill P. Evanschitzky are planning to interview the boy later to the pasture. 
"I saw something which I seem to see all the time," the boy said, "About 10 feet from where Everett was standing in the thick grass. Everett did not point it out." 
"It was in the shape of a fat cigar or a slender egg. I think it was about 24 feet wide at the thickest portion.""
