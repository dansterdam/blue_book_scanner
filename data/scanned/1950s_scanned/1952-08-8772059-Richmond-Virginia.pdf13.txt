AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS (UFO)
LOCALITY: Near Richmond, Virginia
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 7 August 1952
SUBMITTED BY: U.S. Air Force, Fort John Custis, Va.

Persons observing the Richmond, Virginia, UFO on 7 August 1952 were Lt. David M. Groner and 2d Lt. Donald H. Ware. Their observations were made between 8:15 and 8:45 pm, EDT, while tracking a routine weather balloon release from Fort Eustis, Virginia.

The objects sighted were 3 circular brilliant lights about the size of a dime at arm's length, white in color, and traveled in a westerly direction at a fairly high rate of speed. They were slightly above the normal level of commercial air traffic. The objects were sighted for approximately 25 minutes and were last observed heading towards the horizon. The objects remained in sight for approximately one minute.

The observers stated that the only object visible to them was the distant Venus. They also noted that no jet trails or other aircraft were visible in the sky at the time. Estimations of the altitude and speed of the objects were impossible due to lack of definite reference points.

This report indicates that the Richmond sighting involved the observation of several unidentified aerial objects which could not be explained in terms of known aircraft or astronomical phenomena. The case remains unresolved.
