Case VII (Serial 2728.00)

A Flight Sergeant saw an object over an Air Force base in Korea at 0842 hours on June 6, 1952. The object was first seen tumbling and spinning actions. It was on an erratic course, first flying straight level, then changing course and disappearing into the sun. It reappeared and was seen flying back and forth across the sun. At one time an F-86 passed between the observer and the object. He pointed it out to another man who saw it maneuvered near the sun.
