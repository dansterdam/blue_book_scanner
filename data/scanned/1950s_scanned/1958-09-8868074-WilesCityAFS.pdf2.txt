1. These four messages report radar sightings from three (3) stations in the general area over a period of 2 (two) hours. It is probable that the same object or phenomenon caused the four different radar sightings. The object appeared to orbit in a relatively small area. An additional possible weather balloon was reported in the area by a weather station.
2. Although fighters were unable to identify an object, the possibility exists that a weather balloon could have caused the radar paints. Some other cause such as weather or anomalous propagation phenomena is also a possibility.
