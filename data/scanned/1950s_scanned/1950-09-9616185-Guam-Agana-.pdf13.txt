COMMENTS:(Use reverse if necessary)

1. The enclosed correspondence is the latest of many contacts which the Air Force has had with Mr. *****. This individual has submitted letters and reports to the Air Force since 1950. This person has been concerned with a space craft which has been following him around.

2. The contents of the source are as follows:

a. The so-called flying saucer has been following him around since 1950.
b. The so-called flying saucers are inhabited.
c. The weapon used by these space travelers is a "stunning ray" of some type which renders one helpless when fired.
d. That for some unknown reason they have selected him (Mr. *****) as a contact or guinea pig, and have stunned him with the ray some 50 times.
e. It appears that this source is either perpetrating a hoax for a joke or a more underhand reason, or is a paranoiac in need of medical care.

5. The ATIC conclusion is that this report and the previous claims of Mr. ***** are hoaxes.
