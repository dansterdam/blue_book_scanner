UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 25 August 1954

The document describes an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) that was sighted on August 25, 1954. It states that the object was seen to be approximately six (6) miles from the observer's position, and that it appeared to be a "free fall" rather than an accelerated drop. The object was described as having no visible means of propulsion or visible lights, and its speed was estimated to be similar to that of a B-17 fighter plane in flight, having been observed to pass by three (3) times, or approximately 1,000 miles per hour.

The document further states that the observer, who is a member of the Cleveland Astronomical Society, has never sighted any object in the sky that he could not satisfy himself with its identity as an amateur astronomer. He advised that he was a member of the Air Force from November 1942 to November 1945, and that he had as a minimum four (4) or five (5) sources in aircraft identification.

The document concludes by stating that no further investigative action is contemplated by the District Office unless specifically requested by the Command.
