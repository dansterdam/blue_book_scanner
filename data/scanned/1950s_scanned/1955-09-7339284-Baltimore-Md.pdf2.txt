AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-11-1952d AT39

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORT: (Contd)

10. In an attempt to secure the opinion of local astronomers, the investigation disclosed that the astronomers of the Baltimore area were unable to offer any information. However the Observatory's astronomers were still on Summer leave. Finally, the Director of the Maryland Academy of Sciences stated that to his knowledge nothing unusual in the way of astronomical behavior had been observed at the time of the phenomenon described. He thought it possible that the lights sighted may have been aircraft.

11. A later check with the Baltimore Filter Center revealed that a Miss Jean Laudlow of the CCG unit in Baltimore had called the Filter Center and reported observing two bright lights east of her post flying toward the north at about 2255, 9 September 1952. She observed the object through binoculars and distinguished what seemed to be pulsating or flashing lights. The object was called until 2302. at which time it faded from sight.
