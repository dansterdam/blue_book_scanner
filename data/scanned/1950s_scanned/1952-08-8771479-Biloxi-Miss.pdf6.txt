The document is an "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" and contains detailed textual information about a reported UFO sighting, including the location, date, description of the object, and other details.

The text in the document is as follows:

2. The object had a flaming white light surrounding the center, which appeared to be the shape of a flying saucer, and was observed for approximately 30 minutes.
3. The object was observed by several witnesses to be hovering and then flying at a high rate of speed.
4. DETAILS:

i. COMMENTS:
A tentative conclusion is that the object observed may have been a "flying saucer," as the description fits that of a typical "flying saucer" sighting. However, the high speed of the object, in excess of 1000 mph, is considered to be beyond the capabilities of current aircraft. Further investigation is required to determine the exact nature of the object.
