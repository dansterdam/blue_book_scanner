The text in the document is as follows:

Location: Camp Lucas C (Camp Lucas), Michigan
Date: 6/20/56
Time: 7:15 a.m.
WX: 60-70Â° massive veil, 1-5 miles, winds 3-5 SFC and H-5 to 10 knots
Description: Saucer, size of a quarter, color changed from a bright white to reddish-brown as it moved in a circular oscillating motion, which was a bright red just before it left. The object was sharp-edged and silent. Saucer-shaped object fell from clouds and the edge of the clouds. Time above visible: (2.5 sec) about 3-5 degrees. (Cover)
Investigator: (AFOYN-H39, phone 69219) - Failed one
Astronomical Phenomena (meteor, comet, planet, etc.) - Ruled out - object only moved 1 or 2 degrees in 30 minutes.
Radar Analysis (AFOYN-H1) - None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) - Ruled out
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. - Ruled out
Other - Probably a reflection - however, there is insufficient data to form a valid conclusion.
Evaluation of source Reliability - 

Analysis and Conclusions: The object moved only about 1-2 degrees in 20 minutes. If the reported visibility is correct, this object must account for the small size and slow movement. The disappearance of the object is not explained and the wind direction below 10,000' was not given. Therefore, it is not known if the wind direction is consistent with the motion of the object. The data is insufficient to form a valid conclusion.
