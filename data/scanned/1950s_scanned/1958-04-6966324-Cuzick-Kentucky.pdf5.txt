On June 2, 1958, a worker in the FED machine Parts Building at Bethany, Ohio, named Clarence B. Daisey, who lives at Bethany, Ohio, reported the following:
On June 1, 1958 his father-in-law, Clarence E. Cubick, Ky., who is about 12 miles south of Richmond, Ky., observed a fiery object cone-shaped and resembling the nose of a missile, along with what he described as being vapor trails. This occurred on May 30, 1958 and at that time he notified his father on May 30, 1958, and his father notified the Air Force Hotline. The Air Force command at Bethel, Ohio also on June 21, 1958 notified Mr. Conashan of the Cincinnati FBI office. The Cincinnati FBI office visited this office and was given information pertinent to the case. This office offered to continue our activities in this case and requested to be advised of any possible developments. This will conclude our activities in the case unless subsequently requested to continue by the Air Force.
