III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS: "On the evening of 11 January 1956, at the approach of night, an object of the approximate size of a medium bomber was sighted east of the field at about 6,000 feet. It appeared to be spherical in shape, silently moving across the sky at a rapid rate in a northeasterly direction. The object seemed to glow slightly and at intervals it would suddenly increase in speed and disappear. It was called Paredell to see if they had an aircraft in the air, but Paredell said they did not have any planes up. I then had the object in sight -- he said what they had seen looked different from anything that was up. The object moved rapidly and when it would suddenly increase speed it would disappear from sight. It was in sight for about 10 minutes. The position was approximately 10 miles east of Oscoda, Michigan over Lake Huron, moving in a northeasterly direction."
