IR-14-9-52

1. Description of Sbjact: Observer first noted a loud, metallic sound, and then observed a bright, stationary light which appeared to be in a fixed position in the sky. The light was observed for approximately 15 seconds, and then was lost to view. The observer could not determine the size, shape, or color of the object. The object was reported to have been observed at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet, and was observed to rise vertically at a rapid rate of speed until it disappeared from view. No unusual atmospheric conditions were reported.

2. Location: Backyard of a private residence located in Fresno, California. The observer was standing in the backyard when he observed the object.

3. Observers: A civilian male observer, 32 years of age, employed as a public school teacher. He was well-qualified as an observer, and has been an amateur astronomer for many years. The observation was made in a serious and careful manner, and the observer was very cooperative in furnishing information for this report.

4. Time of Observation: Approximately 7:35 p.m. PST, on 14 September 1952.

5. Weather Conditions: Clear sky, with scattered high cirrus clouds. Visibility was excellent. Winds were light and variable - less than 5 m.p.h.

6. Miscellaneous Factors:
a. Physical evidence: None.
b. Investigative Action: Insufficient. To determine if this was a valid report, it was determined that a fairly large amount of air traffic was in the area at the time.
c. Recommendation or Conclusion: The observer could not provide any further details on the object observed. In view of the lack of physical evidence and the fact that there was a considerable amount of air traffic in the area at the time, this report is classified as insufficient for full identification.
