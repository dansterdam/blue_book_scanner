Dear Sir:

Enclosed please find a clipping from one of the New York papers. The difference being that this object was just passing by us for routes unknown. The object appeared to be hovering for a considerable length of time, and I am wondering if you would be interested in having details about it - or perhaps even using them for fuel. As far as I am concerned, I am not waiting to you about the flying objects seen over the New Jersey coast (CAN DID) , and I would just like to write about space government and classification between the people and the government. The little of them I have left, is very strange.

So that I would like to have permission to have my sighting released, along with the look also deals with unexplainable objects.

Very truly yours,
