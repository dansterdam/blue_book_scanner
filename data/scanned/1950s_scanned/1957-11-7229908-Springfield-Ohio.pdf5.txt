The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with text written in cursive across the entire page.

Here is the text that I have extracted from the document:

letter the air was calm and there was a slight mist with a thin haze in the sky. At about 7:30 pm the object was first sighted in the northeast. It appeared to be a bright light, larger than a star, and traveling at a high rate of speed. The object continued on a straight course and was observed for about 2 minutes. The object then suddenly increased in brightness and appeared to brighten the area around it. It then appeared to be going directly away from the observer. The object then faded from sight. The weather was clear with no clouds. There were no sounds or trail associated with the object. The observer says it was definitely not an aircraft, meteor, or any other common aerial object. He says it was the most unusual thing that he has ever seen in the sky.
