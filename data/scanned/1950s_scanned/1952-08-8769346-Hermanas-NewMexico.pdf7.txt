There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically an "Official ATIC Report" from El Paso, Texas.

The text in the report describes an incident where an Air Force colonel flying a jet observed 2 objects in the vicinity of Hermanas, New Mexico on August 24, 1952. The objects appeared to be round in shape, silver in color, and approximately 6 feet in diameter. The colonel observed the objects to be approximately 2 miles from him between the hours of 1000-1100 MST. There was no visible means of propulsion, and the objects seemed to change shape while in a right turn. The second object also seemed to change shape when it accelerated very rapidly. The objects disappeared 3 minutes after first being observed, but then reappeared after approximately 7 minutes, at which point one object seemed to climb straight up to 2,000-3,000 feet and was joined by the other in close formation. The ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) checked all possibilities of known objects in the air in the vicinity of the two sightings with negative results, and the conclusion was "Unknown".
