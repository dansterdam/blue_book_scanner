Columbus, Ohio - 22 December 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT
On 22 December 1951 at approximately 1030 -55T, an F-84 pilot sighted an unidentified object five miles east of Columbus, Ohio. The object, which was silver in color, was traveling at a high rate of speed on a lateral axis. The object was on a reciprocal heading and higher than the F-84. The pilot made a turn in an attempt to intercept the object but lost it in the sun.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
At approximately 1000 EST, a weather balloon was released from the Columbus Municipal Airport. The winds aloft which would have normally carried the balloon over the area of the incident were low, and it is believed the balloon was still in the area at the time of the incident. Further information on the balloon launching has been requested.

III. CONCLUSIONS
No conclusions can be made until more information on the balloon launching is obtained.
