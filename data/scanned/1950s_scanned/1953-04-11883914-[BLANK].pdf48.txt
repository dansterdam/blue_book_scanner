SPECIAL REPORT
ON
CONFERENCES WITH ASTRONOMERS
ON UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS
to
AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
by
J. Allen Hynek
August 6, 1952

This special report was prepared to describe the results of a series of conferences with astronomers during and following a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Victoria, B. C., in June, 1952. It recounts personal opinions of a large number of professionally trained astronomical observers regarding unidentified aerial objects. In addition, it reports sightings by five professional astronomers that were not explainable by them. Representing the opinions of highly trained scientists, these comments should prove particularly helpful in assessing the present status of our knowledge of unknown objects in the skies.

PURPOSE OF INTERVIEWS
The desirability has been established of inquiring of professionally trained astronomers of considerable scientific background as to whether they have observed unidentified aerial objects and, if so, what their opinions are concerning them.
