SUBJECT: Memorandum of Facts Concerning Unidentified Objects Sighted in the Great Falls, Montana Area on 29 July 1952.

1. Tuesday, 29 July 1952, at approximately 12:50 hours, MST FOUR (4) unidentified objects were sighted over Great Falls, Montana. USAF OFFICERS reported that these objects were traveling very fast, silently and in an irregular pattern. They saw for three (3) to four (4) minutes. The objects appeared to be metallic and elliptical in shape and ranged in size from 30 to 40 feet in diameter. All objects were reported to have been traveling at an estimated speed of 1,000 miles per hour. The objects were estimated to be 10,000 to 12,000 feet in altitude. All objects were observed to be traveling in a straight line and at times made abrupt changes in direction. The OFFICERS were able to track these objects on the RADAR equipment at the Base. At one point the objects were estimated to be 50,000 feet in altitude. 

2. These flying objects were observed from the Seattle, Washington area (General Chidlaw) and the Plan 62 Video Circuit was activated. This circuit is designed to provide instantaneous visual contact on any unusual flying objects. However, the objects disappeared from view before the visual contact could be made.

3. At 12:00 hours MST Thursday, 31 July 1952, the local radio station received a phone call from a private individual who reported seeing similar flying objects over Great Falls, Montana at approximately 22:00 hours on 29 July 1952. The objects were sighted for several minutes and the individual was able to observe the performance characteristics reported above. As informed, the radio station KMON made an announcement of the radio sighting ASAP. The Commanding Officer was immediately informed of this incident.
