                  Curtie tale - Affair Case

1. As reported in a letter from Curtie Tale, a civilian, it was stated that on 2 Dec 1957 at about 3:20 PM, while on a hunting trip, he observed a silver colored object which he described as a ³silver sphere², about 30 ft in diameter, hovering about 300 ft above the ground, and that the object made a sound similar to that of a jet aircraft.

2. One copy of DD 1397 dated 9 Dec 1957 forwarded for appropriate action. 

3. Captain Williams, by-direct wire, opined that the report was of no intelligence value, and recommended no further investigation.

4. Belief is that, ballistic - a sighting - a time estimated. With flight path description given, it appears to be similar to previous sightings of weather balloons, a fairly common occurrence.

5. Since all basic information has been covered, this case shall be closed as a routine sighting.
