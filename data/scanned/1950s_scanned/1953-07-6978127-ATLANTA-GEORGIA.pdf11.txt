Space Story Hoax: Pilot Real Thing To Earthling
ATLANTA, GA.--A newspaper story that a bright object had been sighted near Atlanta was a hoax, according to Air Force officials. One man who reported seeing the object later admitted he had fabricated the story. The Air Force stressed that any authentic reports of unidentified flying objects are promptly investigated, but that the Atlanta incident was a hoax. In addition, Air Force officials said no one was injured when the supposed object was reported. They explained that this type of hoax, designed to create public excitement, is a disservice to the community and to the Air Force program investigating genuine reports of unidentified flying objects.
