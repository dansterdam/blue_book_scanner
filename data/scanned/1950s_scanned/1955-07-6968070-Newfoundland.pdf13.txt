THIS STARTED TO SET THE STAGE FOR WHAT PHENOMENON WAS NOTICED. ALL UNK OBJECTS
SIGHTED ON THE RADAR WERE WITHIN THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR RADAR SET11*
STANDS FIRST IN ANTHONY G SCRINPACE AO 514143 INC ELECT OFF, 6443
ACRON
ATw 74091077, THE NAVIGATOR GAVE US A HEADING OF 313.2 DEGREES
PART TWO JUST AFTER WE TURNED TO THIS HEADING SCHINCK READ HIS 
RECT OF THE OBJECT AND I LOOKED OVER WHEN HE CALLED IT IN AND THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD HELP IF I VERIFIED THAT HE SAW BECAUSE I SAW THE
SAME THING AT APRX THE SAME POSITION. ENGAGE IDENTIFIED BOTH OF US
MY CURSOR. ENGAGE DETERMINED THAT I WAS APRX 17 MILES CLOSER TO
TO THE OBJECT SO HE HAD ME GIVE CHANGE. THE OBJECT AT THIS TIME WAS 
APPRX 58333 FEET MY ALTITUDE WAS 18, 383 FEET. THE DISTANCE WAS APRX 
3.5 MILES. WHEN I FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECT, IT MOVED TO THE LEFT IN
A VERY PRECISE MOVEMENT AND A VERY FAST MOVEMENT. THERE WERE NO
LOW INCIDENT OF DESCASE IN SPEED. IT WAS A VERY DEFINITE FAST
MOVEMENT. IT DID THIS TWICE. WE TURNED TO A HEADING OF 633 DEGREES
AND THAT PUT THE OBJECT AT 12 O'CLOCK OUR POSITION. WHILE TRACKING THE
OBJECT, IT MADE SEVERAL TURNS TO THE NORTH AND SEVERAL TURNS TO THE
SOUTH WHICH WERE VERIFIED BY "ENGAGE".WE CLOSED OUR DISTANCE TO
THE OBJECT TO APRX 15 MILES AND AT THAT TIME I INCREASED MY POWER
AND TRIED TO INCREASE MY SPEED BUT DUE TO RUNNING LOW ON
FUEL, I HAD TO EXERCISE MY POWER ONCE MORE. OUR INDICATED AIR
SPEED WAS APPROX 313 MILES PER HOUR. WE NEVER LOST CONTACT WITH THE
OBJECT UNTIL APPROX AT 09103. WHEN WE GOT WITHIN 112 MILES OF THE OBJECT,
IT STARTED A DEFINITE CLIMB TO AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF BETWEEN
35,333 AND 48,939 FEET. AT 953297, WE LOST CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT

PAGE SIX
BECAUSE THE SUN WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US. AS THE SUN ROSE HIGHER,
THE LIGHT BEGAN TO GET DIMMER AND DIMMER UNTIL WE COMPLETELY LOST
SIGHT. IF WE HAD NOT SEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE OBJECT, WE WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY A BRIGHT STAR, BUT THE VERTICAL AND LATERAL 
AND VERTICAL MOVEMENTS OF THE OBJECT KILLED THAT BELIEF. THE OBJECT
WAS SIGHTED BY AT LEAST 5 OF MY CREW MEMBERS.
AT 96252 AS WE WERE MAKING CONTACT WITH OUR RECEIVERS, WE SIGHTED AN
OBJECT WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT AT APX 103,9692 FEET. IT WAS BELOW AND TO 
TO OUR LEFT HEADING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. IT WENT FORWARD TO OUR
LEADERS POSITION AND TURNED AROUND AND CAME DIRECTLY BACK FROM THE
HEADING OF 299 DEGREES. MY SECOND NAVIGATOR CALLED MY ATTN TO THIS
OBJECT, BUT I DISREGARDED IT THINKING IT WAS JUST ANOTHER ACFT.
AFTER I PASSED CUS PO 101, WE LOST CONTACT.
JR AEO 1355AD7 COMD KC-97WARS (TDY ETAFB) SIGNED LT HOMER B SPEER,
PART 5 WE TURNED OFF AFTER COMPLEITION OF REFUELING, THE TIME BEING
APPRX 073072, AND TOOK UP A HEADING FOR HARMON WHICH WAS 125 DEGREES.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, "ENGAGE" CONTROL NOTIFIED ME OF AN ACFT AT 7 
MILES OFF MY LEFT WING. I VERIFIED THIS POSITION BY VISUALCONTACT
SHORTLY AFTER. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, AT 13, COLCK TO MY POSITION, I
NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH 3 CREW MEMBERS, WE
DECIDED TO ENGAGE. 
WE MOVED VERY RAPIDLY. I DECIDED TO CALL "ENGAGE"
CONTROL TO VERIFY THE LIGHT. I TOLD "ENGAGE" CONTROL THAT IT WAS 
APPROX. 113CLCK FROM MY POSITION AT FROM 15,000 TO 29,533 FEET,
CONTINUED TO SKY 735 MILES. I TOLD THER THAT 173 WAS MOVING VERY,
RAPIDLY SOMETHING LIKE THOSE FLYING SAUCERS. SHORTLY THEREAFTER,
