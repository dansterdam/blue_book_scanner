The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with handwritten text at the bottom.

The text in the document is as follows:

to determine that there is a certain amount of certain must be done, which does not mean suspense slip items...was explained

Therefore, I feel that I must take this informal information in confidence. It is difficult for one man to be project officer, and to administer, and to brief preparers, lecture writer and a host of a million other things which are not apparent to even the attached example which had to be accomplished within 2 days. The other high priority and interrupting things is the sort of thing that cannot be done in one week, by one man.

Again I should like to apologize, but I feel this matter has reached a stage where I must ask for help.
