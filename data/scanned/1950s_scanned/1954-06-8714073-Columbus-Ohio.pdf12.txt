CASE SUMMARY NUMBER 14

On the evening of 24 June 1954 an ANG pilot, flying an F-51 between Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, reported being followed in close formation by a light for more than 20 minutes. He performed various maneuvers in an attempt to either lose the light or collide with it; however, it remained in relatively the same position to the aircraft.

The pilot informed other air traffic and the Dayton control tower of the phenomena and they were unable to observe it as he flew by. Neither was able to see any light signals of the aircraft.

Project Blue Book evaluated this sighting as a canopy reflection.

The significance of this sighting was considerably heightened by the interest of the local press and a complete investigation was carried out.
