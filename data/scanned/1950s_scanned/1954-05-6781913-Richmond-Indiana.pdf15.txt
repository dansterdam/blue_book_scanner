REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
On May 6, 1954, at approximately 8:00 P.M., the undersigned observed two unidentified objects in the sky over Richmond, Indiana.
The objects were first observed as small points of light in the western sky. As they approached, they increased in size and brightness. One object was circular in shape, while the other was more irregular in outline.
The circular object appeared to be surrounded by a luminous halo. Both objects moved in an erratic manner, changing direction and speed abruptly.
After several minutes, the objects disappeared rapidly, moving in a northeasterly direction.
There were no other witnesses to this incident. The undersigned has had no previous experience in observing unidentified flying objects.
