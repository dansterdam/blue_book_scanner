The image appears to contain a letter or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). There is a faint silhouette or shape in the sky, which may be a depiction of a UFO sighting. However, as the image does not contain any human faces, I will simply describe the contents of the document without identifying any individuals.

The text of the document reads:

EVE 14 November 1958 

Mr. Sheffield Lake, Ohio

Dear Mr. [ ], 

Thank you for your letter of 10 November requesting information about your UFO sighting and your previous letter of 31 October. 

Your original letter stated that the investigation was conducted by two members of the Air Technical Intelligence Center. Therefore, the Air Force has been informed and is not under operation of this office. 

We have sent your latest query to the Center and you will be hearing from them soon, undoubtedly.

Sincerely,

DENNIS E. McCLENDON
Captain, USAF
Information Services Officer
