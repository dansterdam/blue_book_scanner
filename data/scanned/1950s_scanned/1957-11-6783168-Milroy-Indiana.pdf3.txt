"MILROY, INDIANA
11/19/57

To the Commanding Officer:
Air Force Base, Columbus, Ind.

I called long distance to report the object I saw in the sky. They talked to a Sergeant Redsolar, and told him all about it.

Did the same thing to the Rushville Republican in Rushville, but when they put an article in the paper they backed down on their work.

Sending you this written report, just in case Sergeant Redsolar didn't take it down right.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]"
