Nyaegeccho Ballston 

A cooperating observer reports the following: At 1910 G. M. T. Nov. 5, 1952, while flying off Shemya Island in the Aleutians (approx.) 85° altitude traveling in a westerly direction. Visible for approximately 20 seconds, it traveled horizontally a distance of approximately 20 miles. First observed as a bright ball of fire with a brilliant green-tinted flame, it slowed to a hover in its arc of flight as seemed to burst into two very bright lights of a reddish color, after which it disappeared at about 15° altitude. Weather was cloudy with bright moonlight.
