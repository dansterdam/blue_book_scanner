The image contains a few sketches, but no photograph. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and a straight line labeled "B" to demonstrate how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows a wider landscape view with a small figure in the center, and a smaller circular inset sketch in the corner. The text instructs the reader to place an "A" at the position where the object was first seen, and a "B" at the position where the object was later seen, to compare the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
