I observed the o[jec]t approximately 2300' - as I was on my way to work -- The Craft I saw -- a second personnel in the rear wrote it by the sky and -- should we go on so we lost the object. The speed was -- no way of know and I can recall only one blinking amber light on the nether side of the object, it approached in the design of a very large aircraft and what a altitude that my attention was that this was no aeroplane. What we saw after thought was an aircraft and later learned was reported to be an uncharacterized object "disc" the aircraft a short distance north where it was hidden from view by timber land. I also witnessed the craft from a variety of part of which a clear field indicated "TURBLNCE" [indecipherable]
