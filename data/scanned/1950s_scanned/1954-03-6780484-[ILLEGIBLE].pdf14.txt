UNCLASSIFIED
March 1954

Statement of R. E. Harrison to the Director, Per R. M. Harris

1. I am a Civil Service employee at Cleveland Air Force Base, Middle-town, Ohio, and work as an Electronic Altert Ground Control Interceptor Station. I have been on this job for three years.

2. On 25 March 1954, at approximately 10:30 p.m., I observed a bright light in the sky. I watched this object for approximately 30 minutes. It appeared to be oval shaped and about the size of a quarter-at arm's length. It was bluish-white in color and emitted a pulsing glow. I watched as the object made a rapid ascent and then a rapid descent. I saw three lights on the object - two on the outer edges and one in the center. These lights rotated around the object. Then I saw three pulsating reddish lights that appeared to be coming from the center of the object. After a few minutes, the object disappeared from sight.

3. I looked into the sky in the direction in which we observed this object. They were bright lights up in the sky. They seemed to be maneuverable and were not aircraft. They were emitting a glow and moving against the wind. They were in the sky for a few minutes and then disappeared.

4. There appears to be moving slowly all the time to appear at varying distances and then disappear.

5. While I was in the air, I saw a light to the rear and while the co-pilot also saw this light I was unable to make a positive identification of this object. However, as I watched, this light split into three separate white lights and then disappeared.

6. This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.
