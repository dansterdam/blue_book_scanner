While participating in search air force operations over the Atlantic Ocean on 3 July 1954, a USAF B-29 aircraft was sighted from Ramey Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, via the Azores Islands and Bermuda Islands. Aircraft 9179 was climbing the top of a 5,000-foot rain shower air mass at 15,000 feet on a true heading of 359 degrees at an average air speed of 17 knots. The aircraft passed about 17,670 ft west of Lajes Airfield, Azores Islands. The time was 0401422 about 2200 hours 3 July 1954 local area time. Captain Spain, the Radar Observer, was engaged in a radar weather search when suddenly he sighted this unusual radar return on his APS-23 Radar Set, a component of the K-system. His APS-23 Radar Set, a component of the K-system, had the antenna set at 4500 tilt with the beam pattern adjusted for 40,000 feet. His radar determination normally gives very little or no return. Captain Spain reset antenna tilt to 00 and gave a closer inspection to the unusual return pattern and rehecked his set. At this point, he turned his Q-15 scope camera on (engine running 50) After observing the return, 1:02 of three minutes, he asked his navigator to take a look. About five minutes after the first sighting, he called the aircraft commander and reported what he saw. The aircraft commander did not think the sighting was of importance and dismissed the matter. Captain Spain made a landing motion of the return, gave a video and antenna tilt. At 2100 antenna tilt, the objects faded, but not completely.
