25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

It was like a circular tail of a ship, moving in a straight line. There were 2 or 3 small luminous discs attached near the bottom, following it's course. I wouldn't say it was a star, because of it's speed and direction. It seemed to be affected by the wind, swinging from side to side. To me it was altogether different from anything I have ever seen in the sky before.
