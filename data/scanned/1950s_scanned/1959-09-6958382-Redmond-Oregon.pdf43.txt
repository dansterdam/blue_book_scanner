The Hon. Dudley C. Sharp. Page three.

In 1957, NICAP -- created as a non-profit organization to determine and make public the facts about UFOs -- offered Secretary Douglas, your predecessor, an eight-point plan of cooperation, including an offer to aid in preparing the American public for later disclosures about the flying objects. We now repeat our offer of cooperation and urge that you give it your serious personal consideration.

We believe that the public interest is best served by honest official statements disclosing the full details of all UFO cases investigated by the U.S. Air Force, and that concealing the facts will only arouse public suspicion and possibly wide alarm.

Respectfully yours,
[Redacted]

Major, U. S. Marine Corps, Ret. 
Director of NICAP
