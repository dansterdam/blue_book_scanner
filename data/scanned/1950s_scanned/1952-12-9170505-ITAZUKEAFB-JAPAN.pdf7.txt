Performing OCR on the text in the document:

AT 0630 HRS ITS TIME IT DECEMBER 1952, I WAS ASSIGNED TO REPORT A SIGHTING OF A UFO. I WAS READING COVERS THE RANGE FROM ONE HUNDRED MILES TO TWO HUNDRED MILES SOUTH OF THE TARGET AREA AT 0630 HRS ITS COMPARATIVE MANEUVERS OVER ONE THOUSAND MILES PER HOUR. THERE WAS NO AIRCRAFT OR AIRCRAFT LIGHTS WERE SIGHTED THAT I COULD BE SURE THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY MOVING SINCE IT APPEARED AS A STATIONARY LIGHT. IT COULD EASILY BE MISTAKEN FOR A PLANET OR STAR, ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE WAS NO APPARENT CHANGE IN ITS POSITION DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD. THE SIGHTING WAS OVER IN APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE. THE SPEED WAS ESTIMATED AS OVER ONE THOUSAND MILES PER HOUR. THERE WAS NO OTHER AIRCRAFT SIGHTED IN THE AREA WHICH COULD CONFIRM THE SIGHTING. A TYPICAL UFO SIGHTING WOULD APPEAR IF IT WERE A B-29 OR OTHER LARGE TYPE AIRCRAFT.
