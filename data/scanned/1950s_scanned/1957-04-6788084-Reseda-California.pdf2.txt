On 5 April 1957, California: Office address Los Angeles 45, California, telephonically advised DALLAS G. WEDDLE that he had observed an unusual phenomena and was writing a letter to Headquarters USAF explaining his observation. On 5 April 1957 at approximately 1900 local, he observed a bright sphere-like light surrounded by an elliptical light with length radius 1 1/2 times and width radius 1/2 times the size of the sphere shape core. The brilliance of the sphere shape was approximately five times brighter than the outer light, while the outer light was a delicate glow. The sphere shape core was bright golden in color, and no discernible details visible. The observer advised that his attention was directed to this object by its brilliant glow. He first observed it in a west by northwest direction at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. The object made very little movement, and what movement was made was toward the observers. The entire phenomena disappeared like the observers turning off a light, and no discernible details visible.
