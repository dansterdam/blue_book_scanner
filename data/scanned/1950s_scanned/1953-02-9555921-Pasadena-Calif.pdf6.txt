These three bright, round, white objects came over faster than a jet, then stopped, hovered, and moved away again with darting and swooping motions. Startled and excited, I reported this to an officer. He said it was probably aircraft from Edwards. I asked him why the objects moved and stopped so erratically if they were aircraft. He had no further explanation, but he did not seem much interested. I should have reported this incident earlier when it occurred, but I was not sure at the time just what I had seen. However, the incident has remained in my mind, and I now feel it should be recorded. The objects were about 46 feet in diameter and appeared to be about 3 to 5 miles away. Their motions and speeds were vastly different from any aircraft I have ever seen.
