There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a page from a document titled "SECTION VII Reporting" that discusses the reporting of flying objects and outlines various characteristics to be noted, such as number, shape, color, speed, acceleration, altitude, sound, and light brightness, among other factors. The text also mentions certain variable factors related to the observer's position and motion, as well as procedures for reporting unidentified flying objects.

SECTION VII
Reporting

In reporting flying objects, there are certain major characteristics which should be noted. These include:
(1) Number.
(2) Shape.
(3) Color.
(4) Speed.
(5) Acceleration.
(6) Altitude.
(7) Attitude.
(8) Sound.
(9) Light brightness.
(10) Maneuver characteristics.
(11) Range.
(12) Direction.
(13) Initial and final elevation.

Certain variable factors, such as the observer's position or motion during the sighting, speed of observer's aircraft, position of the sun relative to the observer, the angle of elevation of the object, and its bearing from true north as seen by the observer at the time of sighting, and the duration of the observation are important in determining final identification of the flying object.

An estimate of the number of feet at which an object is travelling above the aircraft's altitude may be substantiated by using the range capability of the radar gunsight.

Air Force Regulation 200-2, dated 12 August 1954, establishes procedures for reporting information and evidence pertaining to unidentified flying objects. The reporting format includes the following factors, which will serve as a guide to the observer in assessing the characteristics of flying object(s):

(1) Description of the object(s):
(a) Shape.
(b) Size compared to a known object (use one of the following terms: Head of a pin, pea, dime, nickel, quarter, half dollar, silver dollar, baseball, grapefruit, or basketball) held in the hand at about arm's length.
