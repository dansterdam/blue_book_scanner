Hq, 4602d AISS, Ent AFB, Colorado Springs, Colo. subj: Report of Visit of ATIC Representatives

a follow-up, field investigation of a UFOB report. These criteria will cover, among others, the following subjects:

     (1) Duration of sighting.

     (2) Number of persons reporting the sighting.

     (3) Distance from location of sighting to nearest 4602d AISS field unit.

     (4) Reliability of person or persons reporting the sighting,

     (5) Number of independent sightings reported.

     (6) The value of obtaining additional information immediately.

     (7) Existence of physical evidence (photographs, material, hardware).

b. It was noted that a single extraordinary circumstance might require follow-up, field investigation even though the general application of the criteria furnished by ATIC indicates that further investigation would probably yield little additional information,

c. In general follow-up field investigation of a preliminary UFOB report will not be warranted when the hypothesis suggested by the preliminary report of the incident cannot be tested by facilities available.

d. Exhaustion of Effort in the Investigation of UFOB's: Effort will be considered as exhaustive when every logical, physical hypothesis suggested by a qualified report of the incident has been tested by the facilities available.

a. Qualified preliminary reports shall be considered to be those which merit further investigation under the criteria set forth in paragraph 3 above.

5. Unsolved Cases: A case shall be considered unsolved after every suggested hypothesis has been tested by available facilities and a large percentage of the data in the report does not correlate with the characteristics of known objects or natural phenomena.

                                  2.
