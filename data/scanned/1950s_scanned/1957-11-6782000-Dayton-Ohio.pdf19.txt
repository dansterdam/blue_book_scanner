The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marked on it, representing how high the object was above the horizon when first observed. The second sketch shows a larger drawing with an "A" marking the position of the object when first seen, and a "B" marking the position when last seen. There is also a smaller sketch showing a person standing on a road with a curved horizon in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
