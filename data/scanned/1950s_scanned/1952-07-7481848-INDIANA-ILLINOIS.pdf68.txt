LONGEVIEW, WASHINGTON
August 24, '64

Major Easton M. Jacka, 
Dep't. of the Air Force,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

I have filled out the questionnaire sent me 
on August 18th and am returning it herewith.

I am also enclosing a copy of my first letter
reporting this sighting. After twelve years I
have no reason to change any part of this letter
except for two minor corrections which I have noted.

I shall recall with amusement some carefully
disguised questions in the original questionnaire
which seemed in effect if you had been drinking
before the sighting. My reply was that I hadn't 
been drinking before, but that I seem to be on to
the gag and afterward.

I was considerably "shook up", and still am
whenever I think about it.

My interest in this matter has not been renewed,
and I will be glad to have any further information
you may be able to give me.

Yours sincerely,
