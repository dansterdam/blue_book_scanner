Analysis and Conclusions: These witnesses seemed to have observed a satellite passing which they mistook for a UFO.

The timing of the event in relation to the satellite observation tends to confirm this conclusion. There is no evidence that this was anything other than a natural phenomena misidentified as a UFO.
