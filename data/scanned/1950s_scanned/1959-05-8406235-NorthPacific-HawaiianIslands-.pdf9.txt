20 May 59

This report is concerned with a possible air defense situation which occurred over the North Pacific Ocean near the Hawaiian Islands on 8 May 1959.

At approximately 1715 Hawaiian Standard Time on 8 May 1959, radar operators of a Pacific Air Defense sector control center detected a radar target at a range of approximately 900 miles north-northwest of the Hawaiian Islands. The target was tracked for approximately 30 minutes until it faded from the radar display.

During the tracking period, the target exhibited erratic flight characteristics, such as extremely rapid acceleration and deceleration, as well as abrupt changes in direction of flight. The target's speed was estimated to vary from 1,000 to 8,000 knots.

Several attempts were made to establish radio contact with the target, but without success. Attempts were also made to scramble interceptor aircraft to investigate the target, but the interceptor aircraft were unable to attain sufficient speed to make contact.
