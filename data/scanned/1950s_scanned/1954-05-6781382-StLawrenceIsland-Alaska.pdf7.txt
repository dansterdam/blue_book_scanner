Jets, Saucers Play Tag In Skies
A my haney watts
CINCINNATI, May 6 - An intensely interested crowd watched a jet interceptor plane
and a mysterious flying object - believed to be a flying saucer - engaged in maneuvering
over the skies of Cincinnati's eastern horizon Wednesday evening.
According to reports from these reliable witnesses, the objects were first sighted at
about 6:50 P.M. But for a couple of hours they put on a show that amazed and awed
the onlookers.
The jet, which was scrambled from an Ohio base, apparently was given the task of
attempting to intercept the saucer. The two objects maneuvered back and forth, up and
down, in a game of tag that thrilled the watchers.
The jet would make a run at the saucer, and the saucer would dart away at terrific
speed, only to reappear a moment later behind the jet, as if playing a game of "catch
me if you can."
The saucer, described as a brilliant orange-yellow color, appeared to be about 40
to 50 feet in diameter, and was moving swiftly and low on the horizon. The jet was
dwarfed in comparison to the huge saucer.
At one point the saucer hovered motionless for a few seconds, then darted away at
an unbelievable rate of speed.
From the accounts of the witnesses, the saucer appeared to be under intelligent
control and was maneuvering in a manner that would be impossible for any conventional
aircraft.
The incident was observed by Mr. and Mrs. Earl Clark, of 4975 Strathmore Avenue,
Norwood, who had gone to the Stratford Manor subdivision to watch the jets.
