o Description of what [ saw.
It was still light and one could see to the west
(citry east) in a clear northeastern sky an extremely
bright, white light moving in an arc swinging
or for about 30 seconds with no variation in altitude
or color whatsoever. When the light went out
a dark object appeared coming towards us. As
it came closer, its torpedo shape or cone and
fin like projection became evident. The 
swoosh type motion became evident. The
object came directly (from 20000 to about 2000)
as it came and gracefully took a north-
westerly 
(tempo) disappearing behind a hill of about
4000 feet altitude or places itself on the
same.
The object probably landed and stayed
for a short time on the ground at the western
tip of one of the Sandia.
