Transcript of text from the document:

I FIRST NOTICED PAUSED ABOVE WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE GARDEN CITY AREA AND SAW THAT BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING ERRATICALLY FIRST NORTH AND SOUTH AND THEN EAST AND WEST AT HIGH SPEED. AFTER IT HAD MADE THESE MANEUVERS FOR SOME TIME IT SUDDENLY TOOK OFF AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THIS WAS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST OBJECTS I HAVE EVER SEEN AND ITS SPEED AND MANEUVERS WERE AMAZING. IT DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY AIR CRAFT THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH. WHAT I SAW COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A FLYING SAUCER TYPE OBJECT. IT WAS ROUND AND FLAT AND EMITTED A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT WHAT I OBSERVED WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIR CRAFT OR ANY OTHER KNOWN OBJECT. IF THIS SIGHTING IS OF ANY IMPORTANCE TO YOUR INVESTIGATION PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
