The image appears to be a handwritten document, but it does not contain any photographs. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

the object was sighted at approximately 9:52 pm by several witnesses. the object was reported to be a round or circular craft approximately 30 feet in diameter and emitting a bluish-green light. the object was reportedly hovering over a wooded area and then accelerated upward and out of sight in a matter of seconds. the witnesses were unable to determine the exact altitude or distance of the object, but it appeared to be very high and several miles away. no sound was heard associated with the object. the witnesses were very shaken by the incident and reported that the object moved with incredible speed and in a manner that was unlike anything they had ever seen before.
