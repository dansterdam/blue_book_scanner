"EXHIBIT: 
7 July 1952 
C-5.141 
INVESTIGATION OF "FLYING DISCS" OR A HIGHLY REFLECTING MATERIAL OVER OKLAHOMA 
About 1:30 p.m. on 7 July 1952 a highly reflecting object was observed by the inhabitants of Enid, Oklahoma, and surrounding areas. The object was observed for approximately two and one-half hours, moving in an erratic manner, disappearing and reappearing at various intervals. The object appeared to reflect the sun's rays in an intense manner and was described as extremely bright and metallic in appearance. It was visible to the naked eye and through binoculars and telescopes. The object was generally seen low on the horizon and frequently obscured by clouds. Attempts were made to photograph the object but no photographs were obtained. The object finally disappeared at approximately 4:00 p.m. Subsequent investigations indicated no known explanation for the appearance of this object."
