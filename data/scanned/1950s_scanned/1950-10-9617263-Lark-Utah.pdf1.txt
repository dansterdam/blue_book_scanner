Civilian
Astro (METEOR)
Evaluated as a meteor observation.
Observer thought object was a meteor, but upon closer observation, believed it to be a object which appeared at first as a long, thin line or fire crossing the sky at a certain rate of speed. This line of fire lasted for approximately 2 to 3 seconds and then became a flaming object which suddenly broke away and shot in an opposite direction. The from end of the object broke away and the main body continued on in a straight line, disappearing from view.
