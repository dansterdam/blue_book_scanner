A. F. RADAR, PLANES FAIL
IN HUNT FOR LIGHT IN SKY
    CADILLAC, Mich., July 28.--(AP)--"A brilliant white light" was
reported in the sky near this Michigan resort town early today by
tourists and police. Air Force radar and interceptors could find
nothing.
    The first report was received by Sgt. Willard Irwin of the
Cadillac police from Willard Wood of Covert, Mich., who said the
object was moving north toward Cadillac.
    The object was seen east of Cadillac by Sgt. Irwin too, before
he notified Ptl. John Langley and M/M Earl Taylor.
    The patrolmen said they interviewed three Illinois tourists,
Allan Howe of Sterling and his wife and mother about the light.
