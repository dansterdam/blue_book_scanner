The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text spread across the entire page.

The text is as follows:

the moving material got by
the observer were found to be
very small bits of what appeared to
be particles of debris or paper or
other lightweight materials being blown
about by the wind.  although it was
dark the observers could just make
out the objects thru the starlight.
They stated the objects were just
slowly drifting with the wind and
did not appear to be
anything more than small debris
or particles.  the observers claimed
the objects were not travelling
or moving in any direct path just
drifting and floating as small
debris would be expected to do
on a windy night.
