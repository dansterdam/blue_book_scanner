CLERGYMAN SEES UFO IN SOUTH PACIFIC

Engineer and Gls Sight
500-Foot 'Flying Saucer'

ALAMOGORDO, N. M., Nov. 5 (UP)—An electronics engineer re-
ported seeing an unidentified flying object near Alagogordo in south-
ern New Mexico yesterday.

James Stokes, 42, an en-
gineer in an upper air-re-
search project at the Air
Force Missile Develop-
ment Center near Alamo-
gordo, said the object ap-
peared yesterday after-
noon on U. S. highway 54,
 between White Sands 
proving grounds and the 
Air Force Missile Develop- 
merit center.

He said the object ap-
peared to be about 500 feet
in length, with a shiny sur-
face like mother of pearl.

Earlier in the day, officials
at White Sands proving
grounds said two Army pa-
is reported seeing a sim-
lar object or objects on Sun—
day.

SEEN IN TEXAS
Reports came Sunday from
Levelland, Tex., of other
UFO’s.

A dispatch from Honolulu
said a number of Fiji Island
natives and a white clergy-
man reported seeing a similar
object let the South Pacific
isles last month, and on
Skies hang the string tie
the week of Oct.13-19,accord-
ing to an official government
report issued, in Suva.

Mr. Stokes, in a taped in-
terview for Terry Clark, news
director 5:t:ation KALG in
Alamogordo,  reported that
the object approached from
the northeast over the Sacra-
mento Mountains. He said
the first Indication that some
thing was out of the ordinary
was a gradual fading of the
radio in his auto.

Then, he said, the car en-
gine died, and he noticed
that several other cars on the
highway had stopped.

EGG-SHAPED
“Looking up,” Mr. Stokes
said, “I saw a light-colored,
egg-shaped object making a
shallow dive across the sky
to the northwest.

"Then it wheeled and made
a pass at the highway, across
 the area not more than two
 miles ahead.

“As it passed at its closest
point I coid feel a kind of
heat wave, but there was no
sound.

“It had no visible portholes
and there was no vapor trail,
smoke or flame visible.”

BATTERY STEAMS
“When I got back to my
car and checked the engine,
I found it intact, but the bat-
tery was steaming. It start-
ed with no trouble and I
headed for a phone to notify
officials at the Air Force mis-
sile development center at
Almogordo.”

Mr. Stokes said he noted,
later, after he reached home,
that he had a severe sunburn.

Officials at White Sands 
proving grounds, where mis 
siles are tested, said two sep- 
»rate military patrols report- 
ed seeing an unidentified  fly- 
ing object or object[s] Sun-
day over an isolated area of
the proving grounds, near
"Trinity” site where the first
atomic bomb was exploded in
19:5.
