CERTIFICATE

11 July 1951

On 10 and 11 July 1951, Sgt. - who is stationed at the Corona Experimental Station, about 13 miles southeast of Corona, New Mexico made the following verbal report to Capt. Hynek and myself.

About 2230, 9 July 1951 I noticed a red glowing ball of light about the size of a full moon to the west or southwest of the station low above the horizon. It called the civilian Security Guard, but no one else witnessed it slowly disappear in about 3-5 seconds. There was an after-glow for another ten seconds. No sound was heard that might have come from the object. Visibility was slightly poor and although some stars could be seen, there were dark clouds over part of the sky. The light was nearly circular in shape and uniform in the red glowing color.
