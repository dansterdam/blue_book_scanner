BENSON, Ariz., April 6 (AP) - Two Air Force pilots said today they saw a huge oval-shaped object about five or six times the size of a B-29 bomber at about 25,000 feet above them.
Chick Logan and C. M. Jasper, from Mariana Air Force Base, said they saw the object from the air.
Lt. Tucson, and Capt. Taylor, from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, said they saw it from the ground.
Logan said some people were flying in the Benson area at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
