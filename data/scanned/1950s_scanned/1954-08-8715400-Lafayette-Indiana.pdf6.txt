15 NOV 1956
Richinetts 27, Ohio
Dear Mr. [redacted],

The material which you submitted to W/Sgt Hill on 12 October 1956 for study and analysis is returned.

A thorough, critical analysis naturally required a certain amount of small destruction of the metal fragments, and some dissipation of the chemical materials.

The results of an analysis of this material which, indirectly or unintentionally, you purpose to be of some extra-terrestrial origin, as in the case of the so-called "angel's-hair" produced from a UFO, is as follows:

a. All material submitted is "man-made" or "man-fabricated."
b. Samples were examined microscopically, chemically and spectrographically.
c. Metal Samples:
All four samples were found to be ferro-chromium and magnesium. The composition obtained for these samples is:
Chromium 67 - 73 percent
Silicon 0.1 - 0.2 percent
Mg as Mn 0.3 - 0.5 percent
Iron Balance

The crystalline structure and non-oxidized condition of these samples point directly to the fact that a high-temperature melt must have been the origin. This can be accounted for by the fact that these samples were almost certainly obtained from a steel mill or steel foundry where chromium-bearing alloys are customarily added to steel melts.
