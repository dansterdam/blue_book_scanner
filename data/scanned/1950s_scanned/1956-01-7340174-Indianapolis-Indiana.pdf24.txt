My dear Colonel Evans:

My face as read: The day before that meeting I got out my log book. The year changed in the middle of this page, the dates were 1955- and in the middle began 1956. Consequently, my sighting of the previous report was on the night of January 5 that year. Try again and see what you come up with.

Very truly yours,
