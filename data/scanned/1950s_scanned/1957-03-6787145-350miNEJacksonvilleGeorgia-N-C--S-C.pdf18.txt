STATEMENT

On the night of 6-7 March 1957, Captain Belmont (410t) and Major Landis (43rd CAB RESE) were flying a training flight from England AFB, Louisiana to the Eglin AFB, Florida, passing Allaire, 3 C., at approximately 0130 hours and canceled our IRR flight plan enroute to the Eglin AFB. Approximately 30 minutes later, our aircraft was illuminated by a yellowish-green fire with a brilliant tail with a length approximately 40-50 feet long. This fire did not cast any shadows on our aircraft. The fire completely surrounded our aircraft for approximately 15 to 20 seconds and then extinguished itself. Both the fire-ball and the tail appeared to be globes of fire appearing to break off and gradually die out at the time the fire extinguished itself. This phenomenon was observed by both of us at approximately the same time and our impression was that of an aerial phenomenon rather than a mechanical failure or malfunction of our aircraft. Weather conditions were 17,000 feet, visibility 15 to 20 miles with light ground haze. Stars visible, no clouds and no moon.

Flying time: 1:55 hours
2500 hours military flying
1000 hours fighter rating (F-84, F-33)
300 hours helicopter flying time
Witness: Landis (43rd CAB RESE)

Upon landing there was no evidence of any unusual phenomenon. They had reported a report of an unusual sighting.
