1.   a. Oval
       b. Baseball
       c. Blinking Pinkish-Red for fifteen (15) minutes, turning steady white for 
          Fifteen (15) minutes, then dissipating with daylight.
       d. One
       e. /N/A
       f. No material substance discernible. Just a light
       g. /N/A
       h. /N/A
       i. /N/A
2.    a. Object was initially mistaken for an interceptor aircraft making a pass at

         b. Level at 11 O'clock
         c. Light at 12 O'clock
         d. Object first appeared to be fighter making a pass. The observing B-47 made
             a 10 degree bank to left, and object moved to position of 11:30 O'clock level.
             It appeared to be forward of lead aircraft.
          e. Observing bomber went into clouds for refueling. Upon coming out of clouds 
             fifteen minutes later, observing pilot noticed a steady white light, reported
             as a planet, in the same relative position of the other objects. Object 
             gradually dissolved with the coming of daylight.
             Forty-five (45) minutes intermittently
3.     a. Visual
         b. /N/A
         c. /N/A
         d. B-47, Tail # 7033, 30,000 Ft. altitude, 160 degrees true heading, 425 knots 
             true air speed, March AFB, Home Station
         e. 16202Z. 12 December 1954
         f. Night to Dawn
         g. 71-OON -- 156-20W        /symbol/
         h. /N/A
         i. Marquis H. N. Dyers, Captain, Aircraft Commander B-6
             Robert E. Nys, Captain, Pilot
4.     a. High Altitude haze
         b. Not available
         c. None
         d. Unlimited
         e. Undercast and high altitude haze
5.    None
6.    Initially assumed to be a fighter-type aircraft, but after constant observation 
         by co-pilot it was determined to be a planet.
7.    None
8.    Observing aircraft was in formation with other B-47's. All B-47's were 
         within sight of observing aircraft.
9.    The Unit Intelligence Officer, preparing this report, believes that, after 
         constant observation by the observing members over a period of time, the
         transition of colors from blinking red to steady white, the objects relative
         position with the bomber formation after the color change, and its final
         dissolution with the approach of daylight, the object sighted was obviously
         a celestial body. It is furthermore believed that the way this sighted
         object moved in its shape, etc., it could initially be mistaken as a 
         fighter-type aircraft by an untrained observer.
