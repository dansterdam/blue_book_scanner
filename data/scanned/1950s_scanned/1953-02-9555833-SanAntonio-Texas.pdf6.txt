STATEMENT

It was about 22:40 on the 27th of February 1953 when my way to work I noticed a circular bright light moving at a high rate of speed. At first I thought it was a star, but it did not move as stars are supposed to do, instead it moved and then stopped motionless for a few seconds. The light was very bright and circular in shape. As it circled the scene it would disappear for a few seconds. At short intervals it made a dive towards the ground but my car continued to move and I did not observe anything further. The night was too clear and I am not capable of estimating the distance. The light was very far away. The night was too clear and I am not capable of estimating the distance.
