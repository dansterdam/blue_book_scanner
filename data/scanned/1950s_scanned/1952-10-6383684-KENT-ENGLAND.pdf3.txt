I asked my wife to go down to the main deck, two decks below, and bring back a pair of powerful field glasses which I had. In the meantime, I walked down from the swimming pool and joined the group under the afterbridge. This group consisted of a man whose identity I do not know, his wife, a member of the Cabin Class orchestra (the man who played the bass viol, whose name I also do not know) and one or two other persons, one of them a woman. During this entire period of time while I was watching the object, there was a pink cloud much closer to the vessel than the object appeared to be and practically at the same angle from the ship and the surface of the ocean. I would estimate the position of this small cloud to be perhaps five miles from the vessel, and the object at all times appeared to be beyond this cloud. I have the impression, although
