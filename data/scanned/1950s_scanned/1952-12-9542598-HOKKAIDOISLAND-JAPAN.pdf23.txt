and 7:30 clock positions. The observer recalls that the upper beam located just off the center appeared to be exactly opposite the lower right beam and resembled a one-way street. He states that no time estimate was recorded on the observations except for an almost gradual change of direction during the 2 observations. The observer attempted to estimate the speed of RAMS revolution of the 3 color series in the body, and he is doubtful estimated it to be 4 seconds. There was no time estimate noticed during either observation.
Two sightings were made visually by the pilot of an F-94-C /js. Subject pilot was engaged in local area night flying. His first observation was made while he was at an altitude of some 23,000* when he noticed the object remained in his view vision to 33,000* at which point he was level with it. His second sighting of the object was also at 33,000* altitude. During the period, the pilot's estimated duration was exhibiting 330 knots, constant altitude of his flight path speed of 1.53 hours, covering a distance still unknown.
The observer's position at the time of initial sighting was to deg 57 min 13 sec N 114 deg 23 min 13 sec E. He was flying a bag heading of 010 deg at an altitude of 27,600*. At this sighting the object was higher than the observer at 9 o'clock position which was almost due north. The first sighting of the object was approximately 41 deg 32 min N - 140 deg 39 min E some 7 minutes after first seeing it.
The observer caught sight of the object for the second time just 5 minutes after losing sight of it. This was at 2000 hrs, & time and the source was still at 33,000* altitude, but heading 33 cm magnetic heading of 160 deg. During this second sighting, the object was still at the same attitude level as the F-94c pilot, but it appeared approximately 30 cm off to the right of the F-94's nose - distance still unknown.
The general area of these sightings was extreme northern portion of Island of Hokkaid≈ç, JAPAN.
