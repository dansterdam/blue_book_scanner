Page Two, Report #10-UFOB-10-55. STATEMENT OF WITNESS:

I saw a bright object orangish-yellow in color coming from the west and traveling to the east. It traveled across the sky in a downward path to be seen and was not sure that it was a meteor. The tail changed in color from orange to red and then to blue as it went along.
