AF FORM 112â€”PART II
REPORTED: 9 JUNE 1952
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DEF IN 600.4th AIRS, APO 970 52-350 PAGE 4 OF 4 PAGES
The balloon released was a natural latex (white) color. The rate of ascent on this balloon was approximately 600 feet per minute, according to the acquarters. This air is credible in that it is apparently based upon actual observation.
2. It is possible that the unidentified object could have been this 350 gram balloon.

1. The 350 gram balloon released 20 minutes previous to the sighting would have to be considered as a possible explanation unless it were leakage (which would preclude the rapid climb described).
2. There does appear to be an absence of evidence of any actual sighting in the case. Descriptions indicate that the object was probably a balloon, and analysis has been inconclusive. Views expressed are purely individual.
Verification of a disappear/re-appear of a free balloon is actually difficult, and falls into the category of almost impossible to substantiate. On the one hand, the object was probably a balloon, and possibly one launched by scientific endeavor.
