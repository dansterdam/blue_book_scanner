D/I FFAP COMMENT:

1. A check with Japanese observers has shown no increase in meteorite activity and no sightings of unidentified phenomena in recent months. 

2. Air Weather Service normally launches lighted weather balloons at night - reports of "lighted weather balloons" together with physical limitations of night vision might account for such reports.
