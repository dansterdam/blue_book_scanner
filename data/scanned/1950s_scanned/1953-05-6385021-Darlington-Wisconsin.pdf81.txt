The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing an incident that occurred on May 31, 1953 in Darlington, Wisconsin.

The text in the document is as follows:

Darlington, Wisconsin 
31 May 1953

I. DESCRIPTION:
Between 0320 CST and 1130 CST on 31 May 1953, eleven persons in the Darlington-Monroe area in Wisconsin sighted an unidentified aerial object. The object appeared as a steady white light coming generally out of the east and disappearing high overhead after 8 hours of continuous observation. It appeared low on the eastern horizon, much brighter than the surrounding stars. It was reported to hover and then move at terrific speeds by several local inhabitants, including several county sheriffs and Ground Observer Corps members. Two of the policemen pursued the object in their squad car without gaining any noticeable ground. A telescope was employed to view the phenomena by the GOC members. The weather during the time of sighting was unusually clear with a few scattered clouds carried on a north heading by the wind.

II. DISCUSSION:
A newspaper account of the sighting came to the attention of ATIC and as a result an officer and an astronomer were sent to the area of the sighting. They interrogated eight of the eleven observers in attempting to piece together the variety of reports. Estimates of azimuth and elevation readings were obtained from different observers at varied locations in Monroe and Darlington for evenly spaced time intervals during the 8 hour period. The description of the object turned out to be the same with all observers - bright white. The description of the maneuvers varied, however, some stating the object rose slowly, others saying it moved at great speeds, and then hovered. The latter description usually came from observers while riding in a car. All agreed that the object was too bright to be a star and moreover it was seen in the daytime.
