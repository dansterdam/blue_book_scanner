9 was standing at a 20 ft distance from the pile and saw a object at an altitude so low that I could not estimate its actual altitude. This object hovered over the area for about 3 to 5 minutes and then accelerated to a tremendous velocity and disappeared. I have sketched the appearance of the object on this page. The object had a triangular shape and a dull glow around its edges. It made no sound and all I could hear was the sound of the machinery from the pile.

30. Please mail the sketch. Use address:

This appears to be the transcribed text from the document, which describes the witness's account of observing a triangular-shaped object hovering over an area before accelerating and disappearing. The witness has provided a sketch of the observed object.
