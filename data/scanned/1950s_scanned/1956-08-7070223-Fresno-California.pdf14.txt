as a flying saucer then we are seeing one. I did not want to take lest they see me as I did not want to be a second of lightning. I watched it go below garage roof - time to crashed down to where something was about to lay - low - into - the - side - she - said - just plain vanished. I immediately started the motor as the sound and the object together- was disappearing - over - the trees - went - away - while we compared sighting we kept up constant rate but for maybe a return - NONE - about - fine - 30 - minutes - later - they asked - what is going on - me checked after I looked - it remained about - 20 minutes. We both agreed the object was something going on - object was SOLID. I made rough sketch & made 1 finger nail away. After making which did everything possible to figure out - what it was - allowing for most about - but seemed to be typical characteristic - of which we had been told to regard as important. I observed no other - skythings that I purchased the binoculars and have since exchanged them for 16X50 from 10X50.
