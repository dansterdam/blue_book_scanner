UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER HONOLULU (Story Page Seven.)

YOUR LETTER AND PHOTOGRAPHS - On Monday, March 5, 1956, William L. Bosshardt, Naval Air Station, Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii, was taking pictures of an unknown light or object in the sky from the tower of his station. After taking several photographs, he developed them and noted unusual objects in the pictures. These photographs were taken between 1825 and 1840 hours (6:25 and 6:40 pm) local time at Honolulu, Hawaii. 

The objects in the photographs are approximately as follows:
(1) Three objects in a triangular formation, each appearing to be about the size of a DC-4 aircraft when viewed at the same distance.
(2) One object appearing to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter.
(3) Several smaller objects, round in shape and varying in size from approximately 10 to 20 feet in diameter.
(4) All objects maintained a steady, hovering flight.

The weather at the time was clear and visibility was good. The photographs submitted indicate a very definite, unusual occurrence worthy of investigation. The investigation is continuing, and the photographs and additional information will be forwarded as soon as possible.
