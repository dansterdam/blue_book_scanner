There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing an "ABNORMAL REFRACTION" incident observed by the American SS Extavia ship off the coast of Portugal on August 29, 1953. The text provides details about the ship's observation of unusual refraction and mirage-like effects during that incident.

ABNORMAL REFRACTION
SOUTH COAST OF PORTUGAL
Second Officer G. R. Dunlap of the American SS. Extavia, reports as follows: On the afternoon of August 29, 1953, at about 1300 G.M.T. an unusual observation was made. The vessel was near land in that direction, but the land appeared over 500 miles distant, a period of abnormal refraction was observed. The ship appeared to be almost completely blotted out by high buildings observed bearing 151° although the actual land in that direction was Morocco, over 200 miles distant. Other smaller buildings were observed and also what appeared to be grain elevators. Later the vessel's height decreased to what was normal.
Clear sky, surface haze, barometer 29.95 inches, air temperature 75° F.
