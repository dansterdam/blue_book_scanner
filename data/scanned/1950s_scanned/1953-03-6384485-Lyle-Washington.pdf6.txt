IP-23-53 3

The case in which a sighting occurred is in an air response identification zone give by an Air Defense Command. This indicates the possibility of confusion with radar sightings causing a response in this area. However, the presence of an interceptor patrol in the area, however, indicates that radar surveillance would have been in existence.
