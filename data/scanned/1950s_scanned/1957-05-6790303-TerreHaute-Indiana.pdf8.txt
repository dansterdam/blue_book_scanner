GREEN FIREBALL OVER WESTERN JERSEY

May 29, 1957: In Washington, New Jersey, CGI member Juliia Hasker had taken her dog for a walk at about 11:10 p.m. Suddenly becoming aware of a bright light that had diminished, this Miss Hasker looked the north northwest and saw, about 65Â° above the northern horizon, an intensely brilliant green fireball. The angular measurement of the fireball was slightly less than that of the full moon. The fireball was surrounded with a halo that was circular in shape, for a very slight dragging protuberance at the rear. Trailing behind the fireball were some of the green and white "sparklies" Miss Hasker written "After an instant of viewing, she noticed that the width of the intensely bright green disk had increased to about one half the width of the moon's disk." For an instant (perhaps as long as a second) after the fireball struck the ground a distinct center with very small fine particles surrounding it. For an instant (perhaps as long as a second) after this, a shower of green and white sparkles hung in the air where the fireball had been. It had been in view for no more than six seconds. Miss Hasker's description of the typical green fireball type of UFO. We are indebted to her for an unusually careful and detailed report.
