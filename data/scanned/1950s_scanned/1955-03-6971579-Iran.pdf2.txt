Numerous reports of unidentified flying objects are being received from
widely scattered places in Iran. Reports have come from the Persian
Gulf area, Tehran, Gorgon and Tabriz. No conclusive details as to
description, aerodynamic features, etc. can be obtained; the descrip-
tions being given by observers all indicate free play of ideas of
individual cases.

In the Tabriz area there have been several reports of "flying saucers";
recovery of one unit caused considerable excitement. USAF MAAG officers
identified object as a type balloon used to drop crusade for Freedom
leaflets. Other reports from Tabriz area when sifted down indicated
other leaflet balloons have been seen and are the cause of numerous
spectacular reports of unidentified flying objects.
