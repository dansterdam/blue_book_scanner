STATEMENT OF ROBERT L. VICK

AT 0815, hours local, 11 October 1951, I was standing in front of the 525th Fighter-Bomber Squadron Hangar at Neubiberg Air Base, AGO 65, US Air Force, when an object appeared in the sky overhead. The object was motionless and appeared somewhat egg-shaped, and was illuminated brilliantly as if light was being emitted from within. It remained in one spot or moved at an extremely slow rate for about 10 to 15 minutes, then disappeared from view. The object seemed to remain in one spot or moved at an extremely slow rate for about 10 to 15 minutes, then disappeared from view.

The object's appearance and behavior was extremely unusual and difficult to explain, especially since it hovered or remained in one spot and did not conform to the normal flight patterns of known aircraft. While I watched the object, I tried to get others to observe it, but only a few airmen joined me. I am unable to estimate the size or exact altitude of the object. I can only state that it appeared to be approximately the size of a pea held at arm's length, and that it was estimated to be at an altitude of several thousand feet.
