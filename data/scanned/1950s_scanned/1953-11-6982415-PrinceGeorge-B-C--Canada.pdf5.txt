The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing a meteor observation. The text describes the observation made by Chief Officer D. A. Davis of the American MV. Jumper Hitch, who reported seeing a meteor on November 6, 1953 at 1:33-3:50" N, lon. 124°57' W. The report provides details about the meteor, including its direction, speed, and atmospheric conditions.

METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is co-operating with astronomers who are studying meteors. Observations of these phenomena are being recorded, and data on time and point of appearance and disappearance as accurate as possible, either by hearing and timing the sound of detonation, or by both visual and photographic means.

NORTH PACIFIC

Chief Officer D. A. Davis, of the American M.V. Jumper Hitch, reports the following meteor observation:

At 0440 L.T., November 6, 1953, in lat. 33°36' N, lon. 124°57' W. A bright meteor was observed traveling in a southeasterly direction very near the zenith. Heavy cirro-stratus overcast at the time, so the full extent of arc was not observed, but about 4 seconds elapsed between first sighting and disappearance. The meteor pieces seemed to fall away.

Wind: Heavy overcast, wind NE, force 5; barometer 30.09 inches.
