Text from the document:

The information given in this report, is well-substantiated from a credible source. This appears to be a ground observation, since there were no physical or chemical evidences obtainable (no traces or landing) which could be considered (except a reflected signal (echo?) by high buildings - grain elevators, store? etc.) if might be possible to more definitely establish the source of the observations. It is advisable to establish the source of the reflections.
