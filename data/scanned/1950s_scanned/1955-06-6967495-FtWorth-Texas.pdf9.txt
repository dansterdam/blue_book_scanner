The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and a point labeled "A" on the line, representing how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger view of the object's position, with points "A" and "B" marked to indicate the object's position when the observer first saw it and when they last saw it. The third sketch shows a person looking out at a landscape with a curved horizon in the distance.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this larger sketch.
