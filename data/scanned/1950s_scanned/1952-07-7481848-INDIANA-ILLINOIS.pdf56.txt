The image contains a hand-drawn illustration of what appears to be a UFO. The illustration shows a central nucleus surrounded by an area of glowing reddish color, with a tall, rolling gold-on-reddish (not emitting or dropping any remnants of regular combustion) ascending to be self-contained in a more or less stable condition, which seems strange to human experience according to the description provided.
