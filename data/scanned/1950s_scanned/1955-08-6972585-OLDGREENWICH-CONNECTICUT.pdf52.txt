OBSERVER REPORTS JET PLANE THAT FOLLOWED BY UFO! 
On March 5, 1955, at approximately 7:45 A.M. Mr. E. G. reported the following:
"I was on my way to work, traveling about 50 miles per hour, on the Connecticut Turnpike, in the vicinity of Old Greenwich, Connecticut. As I approached the curve in the highway, I noticed a jet plane flying overhead and slightly to the right. As I watched it, I suddenly saw an object following the plane at a distance of about 500 feet. This object was traveling at a speed far in excess of the jet plane.
"The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and seemed to be slightly larger than the jet plane. It was a dull, metallic color and had no lights or markings visible. It was traveling in a horizontal position and maintained a constant distance from the plane. 
"I watched the object follow the plane for about two to three minutes, then it suddenly accelerated and shot up into the atmosphere and disappeared from sight. The jet plane continued on its course.
"This is the only UFO I have ever seen, and I am positive it was not an ordinary aircraft. I have had considerable experience in observing airplanes, both civilian and military, and this object was definitely not an airplane of any kind that I am familiar with."
