Letter to Honorable (Cont.)

Cases will not be made public. Most of the air force sightings are routinely denied, not discounted, to avoid public speculation and disclosure of our security methods.

The Air Force has not conceded the unidentified aerial objects as factual, but rather that the air force is unable to identify them by normal investigative means. There is at present no pattern or design to the sightings which would indicate a test of our security, or threat to our defense.

A new phase has been initiated by the commanding General, Air Defense Command, to instruct our Intelligence to determine if the unidentified aerial objects contain any hostile intent, or other phenomena which would include them in our air defense system.

Sincerely yours,

James B. Jones
Major General, USAF
Director of Air Force Intelligence

JOE W. KELLY
