Statement of M. McCAHEY, attached to D.I.D. WOOMERA, taken at 2010 hours, 28th September, 1952, by J.M. McCAHEY, Assistant Security Officer, WOOMERA.

I accompanied[redacted] on 29th September, 1952, to the Woomera Test Open Air Theatre at about 2010 hours. At about 2030 hours we were seated on the left side of the theatre, facing the screen, and about third of the distance from the screen. A movement in the right hand corner of the theatre attracted our attention. I observed an object which appeared to be hovering or stationary. The object slowly descended until it appeared to be about 250 yards from us. It was moving on an even keel, horizontally from north-west to south-west, and at a height which I estimate to be about 1000 feet. The whole object had a whitish grey colour, the size appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and seemed to be cigar-shaped. It was moving on an even keel, horizontally from north-west to south-west, and at a height which I estimate to be about 1000 feet.

The object had moved some distance before I judged it to be about 1 mile away. I said "Do you see that?" The object then appeared to accelerate and disappear.  

The object was travelling faster than any jet aircraft I have seen. It is difficult to estimate the speed, especially at night.

I can only compare this object to any whether this object was an earthly object, but it was of a strange configuration and a strange colour, which did not appear to be any aircraft that I know of.

I have discussed this incident with m. because we have room for improvement today and a rough sketch which was not observed.
