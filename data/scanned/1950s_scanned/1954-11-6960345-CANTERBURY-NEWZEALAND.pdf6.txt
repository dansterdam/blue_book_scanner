Mr. XXXXXX
Kaiapoi, New Zealand

Dear Mr. XXXXXX,

This will acknowledge receipt of your three letters, dated 25 November and 6 December 1954, respectively. The information which you graciously submitted in the form of personal correspondence and new clippings/newspaper accounts of unidentified flying objects, has been recorded and will undoubtedly serve as a valuable supplementary material on this subject. For the purpose of our review, the articles and letters which were forwarded for our review, will not be returned to any press media and you may be assured it will be held in the strictest confidence by the undersigned intelligence center.

On 23 November 1954, the Air Technical Intelligence Center forwarded this cloud camera evidence back to you via surface mail, and all of the articles and letters recently submitted by you are returned. For your convenience, your attention is the "U.S. Air Force Summary of Events and Information Concerning the Unidentified Flying Objects Program." We hope you will find it to be of interest.

Concerning your specific inquiry regarding experimental cargo parachute drops, the article refers to poor visibility plus an additional hazard of increased wind velocities. The success of a mission of this type is primarily dependent on weather conditions. Many factors, such as wind velocity, size and type of the parachute (which partially determines the rate of descent), weight of the cargo, dropping height, etc. all contribute to the successful drop. As you may be already realized, during experimental missions, such unforeseen circumstances as sudden change in visibility and wind velocities can disrupt a planned drop. A drop conducted under these conditions would be unreliable due to possible damage or loss of the cargo released, which results in a monetary loss as well as wasted manhours.
