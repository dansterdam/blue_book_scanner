DEAR SIR,

A brilliant white glowing object appeared in the sky. It was disc shaped with a white illumination. It moved rapidly from east to west. It appeared to be very strong - some say as bright as a searchlight. It was visible for several minutes and disappeared over the Western horizon. Approximately 5 minutes after, the trailing object which had a red tail appeared like it was chasing or following it.

The objects were moving at terrific speed and turned up and down without making any turn. Observers report chasing for 35 miles of ground area before losing sight of them. Reddish glowing object about 2 minutes behind leaving a trail. Subject of Occult Elementory Schools.

I'd be glad to hear any results of your investigation of this case which was witnessed by many people. There were numerous witnesses to this phenomenon of at least 1520 minutes standing between Marsville, Ohio, Jerome, Ohio, and Wheelersburg, Ohio.
