The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes a UFO sighting.

along slowly, making this racket. It was metallic, like the metal of a silver dollar, and the soumded it to be six or seven feet across. She assumed it was flat, but wasn't actually sure of the shape. It was moving along about three feet high, which she thought was odd. When it got some 20 feet away from being directly above, it stopped motion and the noise ceased. After a few moments, it proceeded in the same direction as before and headed on, but the noise did not resume - it was completely quiet.

This woman's impression was that the object moved about 150 or 200 feet away and fell into some pine trees on a little rise. That night she and her husband wanted to look in the woods where she thought she saw the thing go, but the rain had washed away its tracks and it was too dark to make a thorough search. Whatever it was, she probably moved rapidly away at low altitude, and she received an erroneous impression of the object falling. According to the neighbors, with whom she talked, the two of them continued their search the next day, but found nothing. Finding nothing, and reading nothing in the newspapers, the husband called the Air Force office. He was most reluctant to do so, since people advised him against mentioning what he had seen. However, he agreed to let the paper publish their story anonymously. Later, the reporter called me (after he had investigated and determined for himself that they were sincere), and I went down and talked to them. We found nothing and we found no other people in the area who had seen or heard the device.

I'm inclined to think the woman saw something quite unusual. She is about 35 years of age, and has had a high school education. Furthermore, she is familiar with jet aircraft, since their landing pattern passes over the area.
