USAF UFO PROGRAM

I. Brief History.-
In the fall of 1947, the United States Air Force took official notice of the public interest in unidentified flying objects. Sightings had become the subject of public concern. The Air Force was designated to investigate and evaluate such reports.

B. On 30 December 1947, the Air Material Command established a project to collect and evaluate all information concerning sightings of unidentified flying objects. The objectives of this project were to determine if such objects constituted a threat to national security.

1. Determine if these objects constitute a threat to national security.
2. Determine if any scientific and/or technical information was available.
3. Identify and/or explain all UFO sightings.

D. As of 31 June 1959, after 12 years of investigation and analysis, the project was discontinued. The findings were that the Air Force had been unable to identify the objects as posing a threat to national security, although some individual sightings remained unexplained. The totals for the more recent years, however, are still far above the totals for the earlier years. The increased interest by the public has resulted in more sightings being reported.
