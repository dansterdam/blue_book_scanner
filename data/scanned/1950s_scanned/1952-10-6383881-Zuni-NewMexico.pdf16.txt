of the Air Force, dated 29 April 1952.

2. The following is forwarded for your information and dissemination:

On 15 October 1952, at approximately 1900 hours, Mr. BROOKS, New York, telephonically reported to this office that he had been on the roof top of a building watching searchlights from a nearby carnival which had been set up. He observed strange objects to the east and to the south, which he estimated to be some distance away. The objects were a bright blue color and gradually changed to a pinkish orange color and then back again to bright blue. There was no blinking effect given off by the lights so that it appeared to be a continuous display. He stated that the objects appeared and disappeared, that is, came into view and went out of view, and reappeared at intervals. The objects appeared to be at an eight mile range. The object in the sky was quite high in the sky, almost straight over head. He estimated that the objects were quite high in the sky, in the region of 6,000 to 10,000 feet. The spotlight on the objects came on after the objects appeared and went off when they disappeared. He estimated that the objects gave off a bright light. He estimated that they could not possibly have been airplanes as long and also they did not fall from the sky in the normal manner of aircraft.
