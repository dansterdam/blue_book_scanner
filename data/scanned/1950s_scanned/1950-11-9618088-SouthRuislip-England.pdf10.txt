WE WERE ON DUTY AT 0900 HOURS, FRIDAY, 10 NOVEMBER 1950. WHEN OUR ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE WEST, WE SAW A SILVERY OBJECT, WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING AT ABOUT 25,000 FEET. IT WAS NORMALLY CIRCULAR, BUT BECAME ELONGATED AS WE WATCHED IT. THE EQUIPMENT WAS WARMED UP AND CHECKED OUT AT ABOUT 0915 HOURS. THE RECORDING INSTRUMENTS WERE ACTIVATED AND THE OBJECT, WHICH SEEMED TO BE RECEIVING THE RADAR SIGNALS, WAS TRACKED. IT INCREASED IN SPEED AND THEN HOVERED AGAIN. IT CONTINUED ITS ERRATIC MOTIONS FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES. 

C. THE POWER WAS CUT (THE RADAR OPERATOR ON DUTY) AND HIS RELIEF TOOK OVER. AT FIRST CONTACT IT WAS ABOUT 35,000 YARDS DISTANT. DURING THE NEXT HALF HOUR IT CAME MUCH CLOSER, SEEMING TO BE ABOUT 10,000 FEET AS NEAR AS WE COULD JUDGE. IT WAS ABOUT 25,000 FEET WHEN IT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED, LEAVING NO TRACE. WE ESTIMATE ITS MAXIMUM SPEED TO HAVE BEEN IN THE REGION OF 1,500 MPH. ITS ALTITUDE VARIED FROM 15,500 FEET DOWN TO ABOUT 10,000 FEET BUT IT CONTINUED TO MANEUVER ERRATICALLY. THERE WAS NO CLOUD COVER AND VISIBILITY WAS GOOD AT THE TIME. THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 40-50 FEET IN DIAMETER. DURING THIS TIME THE PERSONNEL OBSERVED IT CONSTANTLY AND THEY DESCRIBED IT AS BRIGHTLY REFLECTING THE SUNLIGHT IN A WAY THAT SUGGESTED IT WAS MADE OF METAL. IT ACCELERATED SUDDENLY FROM REST AND THEN STOPPED AGAIN JUST AS SUDDENLY. THIS MOTION WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AND ON EACH OCCASION IT TRAVELED FASTER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. AFTER CHANGING THE RADAR OPERATOR, THE SET WAS OPERATING PROPERLY AGAIN, SO WE COULD CONTINUE TRACKING THE OBJECT. AFTER A MINUTE AND A HALF THE AIRCRAFT WAS LOST. WE WERE UNABLE TO PICK IT UP AGAIN IT WAS LOST AFTER A VERY SHORT TIME AS WE WERE UNABLE TO CHANGE THE RANGE OR ELEVATION TO KEEP IT IN VIEW. NO FURTHER CONTACTS WERE MADE DURING THE BALANCE OF THE DAY.
