Observation of MRS. [REDACTED]

We went outdoors. We were going to a show. The time was twenty minutes to 8:00 p.m. Our husband went to the garage. We walked the dog. We had a light dinner and came back in the house. At 8 o'clock, we went out in the sky, unusually visible, through the thick overcast sky. The object did not appear like a star. It seemed to be near. We called our husband to come and see. He observed it too. It seemed to be maneuvering, rapidly, and then it disappeared. But she claimed: Just as suddenly as it came, it vanished and disappeared.
