1. Reference the attached letter from AEB has requested. The information contained therein indicates a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

The reflected light intensity from the object suggests a location source. Resolution and degree of image acuity of the object falls between the point of illumination and the surface when it appears to be a sphere suspended in air such as a sphere suspended balloon.

2. If Mr does not the desire to see a copy of AFP 200-2, he can do so by dropping into 3379OI-CC.

3. The information contained in FTD Form 154 is the information used by Project Blue Book in its analysis and evaluation UFOs or sighting.

4. Every day the Air Force receives thousands of letters from students requesting information on UFOs for term papers and are partially able to supply this information as it can be made available in several public libraries. The list on the back gives some specific information on aerial and cosmic phenomena for them to use in their research.
