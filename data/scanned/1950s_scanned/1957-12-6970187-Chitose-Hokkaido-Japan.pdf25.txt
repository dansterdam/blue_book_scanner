16 December 1957
The night of December 12 someone came into operations and said that there was a strange bright object in the sky. They said it looked like a bright star. When I went out to look at it, I admit it did look like a bright star. But the light on it was rather large like a landing condition was 1 of our stations. Someone must have gotten the bright idea to turn our sdf antenna in that direction because we did have indications on the scope that we were picking up the object. Distance was about forty miles and its lowest attitude was about 45 degrees. Efforts were made to make contact but we could get no definite speed. On the few times its movements were discernible, it did seem to back down and north and east. Then when I went out to look at the light, it looked dimmer. Sighters were somewhat on it. When they got close to it, they were supposed to have said it disappeared.
