It takes level-headed people, like you, to run a magazine such as SAUCER NEWS. As a subject where there is so much confusing evidence to sort out, a clear head and a rational presentation must be maintained. There are some minds that will accept a mystic ally Richard Oden, there are some minds that will accept a machine-tooled presentation. But both minds must be reached with a reasonable, factual publication, void of hocus-pocus & far-fetched ideas about the Jews cancel each other out. For instance: All capitalists, or the ruling establishment, are really Communists. All the evidences about the Jews are promoted by communists! It is because they have so much influence with Air Force Intelligence, it couldn't escape them to do so.

this week. I received the December 1962 and March 1963 issues of SAUCER NEWS in which were articles on a 1957 sighting in New Jersey. In one of the changes you made it was made quite clear and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you. The edited sentences we asked for were used, and we are grateful that you so graciously complied with our request. Also, we ask you to consider this request - could you publish this article again, without identifying certain individuals mentioned? The reason for this is that the article is very good research, and we feel that the publication of their names would serve no useful purpose, and may cause some individuals to cease all further investigation and research.
All was meant to convey the idea that the phenomena, although objective, transcends our human limitations, and as the psychic component of experience.
In Part Two (the March issue, page 12) you published this statement: "The issue you have a request concerning, will be the last one to have this subject made readable - as the subscriptional numbers dropped substantially." We understand your position, but at the same time feel that the exclusion from the records of the unusual sightings would be a real loss to serious students and researchers.
