Streak of lightning across the sky and vanished. A moment later, however, it reappeared, ascended in a straight line so that the men were able to see clearly the unusual glowing object just below the. The object remained steady like a while that was suddenly illuminated. Finally it worked up speed once more and disappeared across the shore line.
There is no doubt whatever, it was a flying saucer they saw. The object for a time stayed as close to the ship as to allow photographers to be taken as that bright object had only dawned upon them. The crew had cameras on board but in the heat of the excitement, no one thought of using them until it was too late.
We judge it to be about twice the size of an average commercial airliner. It moved at a speed so great that it actually shot like a streak of lightning through the air.
A number of trawlers were fishing in this area where the object was in training. The weather was fine with bright sunshine and almost no wind, with clear atmosphere up to an altitude of 3000 meters, so it is beyond all doubt that the men on the spot saw the object.
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: The Norwegian Intelligence Service has been approached concerning this observation, and has no additional information to indicate the nature of this phenomenon.
