METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers in studying meteors, their appearance, and their disappearance as accurate as possible, either by bending and curvature or by relation to fixed stars, or both. Movements of trails and their direction of drift are of especial importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.
