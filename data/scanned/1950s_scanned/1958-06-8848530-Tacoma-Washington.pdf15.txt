Transcribing the text from the document:

WERE THE CASE FIRST OBSERVED: Appearing in the east 5:30 AM.1 The witness watched it for approxi- mately one hour, and described the ob ject as oval in shape, about 50 ft. in length. It appeared to be a solid luminous mass that was drifting at times and at other times appeared to be moving rapidly at speeds estimated to be 800 to 1,000 mph. At times it would stop and hover and then shoot out at a terrific speed. The observer states he felt the object was under intelligent control, and that on occasion it would speed up and then slow down. He states that the object reflected a bluish white light, and that he heard no sound from it. As the object was moving, it would change positions in the sky, and at times appeared to be at approx. 10,000 ft., and at other times at approx. 15,000 ft. The observer was outside, and was watching the object through binoculars. The weather was clear, and the observer had an unobstructed view of the object. The observer is a retired Air Force officer with over 15 years experience as a jet pilot.
