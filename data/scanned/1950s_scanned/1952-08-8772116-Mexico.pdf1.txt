The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from a Project Blue Book record card. The card contains various fields for recording information about a UFO sighting, such as the location, date, time, type of observation, number of objects, and a brief summary. The only information filled in on this particular card is the location "Mexico" and the comment "From American Consulate".

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:
