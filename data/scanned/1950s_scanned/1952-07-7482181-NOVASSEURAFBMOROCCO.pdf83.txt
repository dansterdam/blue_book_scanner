Dear Maj. Friend:

At the top of page three, Dr. Menzel states that the Air Force had other evidence that red objects were in the sky at the time of the sighting. I would appreciate it if you would carefully check the files and make available to me any additional information you have concerning that particular statement.

With best regards, I am

Sincerely yours,
