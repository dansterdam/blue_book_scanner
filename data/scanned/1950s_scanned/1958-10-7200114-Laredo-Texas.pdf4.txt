UNCLASSIFIED
(a) A rocket launched from the vicinity of the White Sands Proving Grounds.
(b) A satellite passing through the beams in a north-easterly direction.
(c) A meteor or meteors.
(d) Some unknown and unexpected objects.
C. INTERPRETATION OF THE FACTS
A knowledge of the location and path of the observed object is desirable if one is to distinguish between the above possibilities.
The range of about 170 and would position the observed object somewhere in the vicinity of the White Sands Proving Grounds. The observation of the object simultaneously by three of the four beams energized allows us to estimate the angular coordinates more exactly than if reflections were seen in only one beam. If the possibility of side lobe reflections are neglected, the object observed must have been at an elevation angle between 3.5 and 4.5 degrees and an azimuth angle from the radar between 312.5 and 313.5 degrees.
Conversion of these radar coordinates to a more meaningful form places the observed target probably within 5 nmi of a point in space defined as follows:
Origin: at the Air Force Missile Development Center, Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico
Coordinates: West 10 nmi
South 2 nmi
Height 6 nmi
