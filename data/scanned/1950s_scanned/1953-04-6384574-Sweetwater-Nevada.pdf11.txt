The estimate of the speed of the objects were
arrived at by our radarscope pip-step track at 1800 miles
per hour and the radius of turn of the objects.

The two other observers were Lt. John ______,
pilot, flying in the left seat and Lt. Frank White,
navigator, standing between Lt. ______ and myself. They
picked up the objects immediately upon being then out.

At all times during the observation, the objects
were at a less altitude than we were and
were between us and the ground.

As we completed our turn of approximately
360Â° and resumed our course, the object
blended into the background of hilly country
and disappeared from sight on approximately
the same heading as we were flying.
