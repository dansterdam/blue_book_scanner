The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a burst of rays or lines emanating from one end, appearing to depict a sighting of an unidentified flying object. The second sketch shows two larger views, one of a person standing on a road in a rural setting, and the other a smaller view of a landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are of the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
