The image shared does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, with the title "GREAT SMOKY MTS. (b.9)" and "U.S. AIR FORCE EDITION" printed at the top. The rest of the page is blank.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

GREAT SMOKY MTS. (b.9)
U.S. AIR FORCE EDITION
