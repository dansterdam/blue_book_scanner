While my wife, I were walking around the Chanute Air Force Base golf driving range, I noticed a bright light in the sky to the north and about fifty degrees above the horizon. I thought it was a searchlight and I called to my wife "Look, there's a searchlight up there". We watched it for about a minute and it seemed to be quite stationary, with a slight oscillation or waving motion. I did not notice any color change. The light was quite bright and around in shape like a lozenge. The light was slightly elongated, about six times longer than it was wide. I estimated the light to be about 2 to 3 degrees in size. The light suddenly became very bright and in about 5 seconds was gone from sight. We were both quite puzzled by what we had seen. Our best estimate of the duration of the sighting was about 60 seconds.
