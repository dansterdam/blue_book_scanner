like to know about them. 
Sometimes at night, my TV
acts up with strange interferences.
I used to think it might be a
short wave set in the vicinity.
I don't know if this information
is any use or not. Probably
would have dismissed it, if
the boy hadnt come in to
tell me what he had seen.
I had told his grandmother
the week before. Both occur-
ences were on Tues nights.
Mine Aug 11 -- Hers Aug 15.
Both times the object came
from the same direction.
Sincerely,
Mrs. ****** (cover)
