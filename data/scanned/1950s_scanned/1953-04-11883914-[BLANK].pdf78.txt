The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document regarding the analysis of existing sighting reports. The text describes the process of coding and analyzing the sighting reports using IBM machines, the estimated time needed to complete the analysis, and the discontinuation of the newspaper clipping service.

Analysis of Existing Sighting Reports

Work has continued on the coding of sighting reports to make possible an analysis by IBM machines.  The reports for 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1951 are nearly completed.  Considerable time was spent during August in conferences at which final evaluations were made on sightings for these years.  These final evaluations were needed to put into the IBM system for use in future analysis.  The final evaluation conference was conducted by ATIC and our personnel.  It is believed that this method of evaluation of sightings is adding greatly to the over-all analysis.  It is, however, taking additional time.  

It had previously been estimated that all of the backlog of files could be coded and placed in the IBM system by September 15, 1952.  However, during the past few months, sighting reports have been accumulating at an unprecedented rate.  In fact, the up-to-date 1952 file now contains nearly as many sightings as all previous years together.  Therefore, the task of coding and analyzing the file has approximately doubled during recent months.  

For this reason, considerably more time will be needed to put the sighting reports on a current basis and to complete the analysis.  Some of the IBM cards are now being prepared and preliminary analyses are being started.

Newspaper Clipping Service

As requested by ATIC, an order has been issued to discontinue this service on October 1, 1952.
