STATEMENT

Last fall about the last of September three of us were standing
at the mill at railroad Danby. we saw a strong glow of light coming from the foothills of the clipper Mtns. We thought this to be a bank of mines. This intense glow lasted about 20 minutes. It was approximately 4 miles from where we were standing. Time 9 P.m. The next morning "X", and myself discussed what it could be, but started it was no mine bank and it was something that did not belong there. The next day it happened again at the same time and lasted about 20 minutes. Until the sun had moved and the glow went out, however this time there was just two of us "X" and myself. We watched it through a telescope. Under the glass the glow was more vivid. two cylindrical shaped, round nosed, glowing objects were packed in a large deep gully. They were about 40' apart sitting approximately north and south. They were about two or even keel and we could see no signs of life. They were very bright whitish color light and as bottles. We thought at first it was a crashed airliner. The next morning we went out and searched the areas, and found nothing. At 4 p.m we again waited at RR Danby to see the glow but it did not occur. again. They had left during the night. I am quite sure I can almost pinpoint the place if I return to the area.
