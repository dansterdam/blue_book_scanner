An object in one flight. Object was first seen in the East, moving West-North-West. It was an amber color, rather large in size, and very bright. It disappeared rapidly from view.

Object color, formation, speed, and course of objects appeared to be more of an unusual aircraft rather than astronomical or weather phenomena. This case is probably bona fide.
