Dear Senator Lausche:

I refer to your inquiry concerning the interest of Mr. Earl J. Neff of Cleveland, Ohio, in unidentified flying objects. 

A thorough check of the Air Technical Intelligence Center files fails to reveal any reports of unidentified flying objects in the Cleveland area on the 10th or 19th of August 1958.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on the subject of unidentified flying objects, dated 6 October 1958. This fact sheet clearly outlines the Air Force position with respect to UFOs.

Sincerely,
