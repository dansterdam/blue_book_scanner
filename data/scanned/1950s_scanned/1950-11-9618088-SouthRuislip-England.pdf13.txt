STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

1250, 18 Nov 49. At approx. 7:45 p.m. on the 10th of September the writer was on duty at USCO hours 7 Friday. The Object Checking Operator phoned the Officer of the Day to report a visual sighting of what appeared to be a falling star or meteor. It is automatic that any "object" or "sighting" be recorded so the writer went to the control tower to check it. We thought it must have been a minor aircraft or similar. We looked at the object for some time and decided it was a very slow falling object streaking east to west. We decided to stay on it and got a track on the plotting board and followed it as far as it could be tracked. It was erratic and figured the ground speed from it. It appeared to automatic and the others will corroborate to the effect that it was a unknown object, very slow, not an aircraft or meteor and we couldn't identify it.
