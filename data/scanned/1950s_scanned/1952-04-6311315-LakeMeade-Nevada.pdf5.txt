The following statements concerning an unidentified object were made by MSgt L. Smith personally to L.A.J. Thomas, Intelligence Officer, 102nd Bomb Squadron on 7 April 1952:

While on a fishing trip to Lake Mead in Nevada with my wife and a friend, an unidentified object was observed. First saw this object between 0900 nd 1000 hours Wednesday, 2 April 1952. 

It was silver in color, very large and was not a conventional type airplane. It was similar for us to determine its shape. On arrival at our location asking for an approximation as to the size MSgt. Smith estimated the object to be "the size of a B-36 without wings." As it moved at a very higher distance than the portion observed we are all positive that there was an object there. After approximately one hour it suddenly vanished. Our observation was visual.

Our attention was brought to this object due to a flight of F-80's that went climbed at approximately 0900 hours where leaving vapor trails so I think they were at least 15,000'. The object appeared to us after their passing and remained for about an hour. It appeared to be at a considerably higher altitude than their vapor trails.

Our position at the time was at the eastern extremity of Lake Mead approximately 114 degrees, 24 miles south, 68 degrees, 15 minutes, approximately from observing the observation area.

Weather was CAVU. There were no disturbing weathe phenomena.

No physical evidence is available.

The reporting of this incident is relative to the program requesting information which may lead to the disclosure of the identity of unidentified objects
