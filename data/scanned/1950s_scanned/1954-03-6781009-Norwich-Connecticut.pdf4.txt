Transcribing the text in the document:

I had just completed the other long report enclosed when another sighting occurrence was brought to my attention.

It had been called to the attention of officials at the Air Force Station here on March 26th. This of course, had with it my name.

On Thursday, April 1, I received a phone call at 7:30 p.m. from an official of the Station in charge of the Sunday sighting. She replied in the affirmative, she was the one who had witnessed the phenomenon and whose sister-in-law had supposedly witnessed the same thing. I spoke only briefly, as her father-in-law had suddenly passed away.

The story she told me was rather disjointed, but from what I could gather, her husband had been outside their home when he was suddenly covered by a strange light. It appeared to him 3 or 4 Shadows on the ground close to his feet. 

I asked the woman the direction in which the object was moving, and I learned it was heading in a northerly direction. It seemed the object was luminous and about 20-30 feet in diameter, and no sound was associated with it. I estimated its speed through the air to be fairly rapid.

This is about to call it again. This time it was going to be a call of Verification to communications at the nearby U.S. Navy station which I know well, and whose veracity I would never question.

With this new information, I started to analyze the report again carefully,looking into the story as to its authenticity. I told the officer at the Station over the phone that from what she had told me, the object did not seem hostile at all. 

At 7:15 this evening, I was walking to my home when suddenly I was bathed in light. At first, I thought it was the moon, but soon realized it was an extremely bright light. It grew larger and brighter, and was moving at a tremendous speed. In a second or two it had passed over me, and as rapidly as it had appeared, it disappeared.

I questioned in my own mind about the object's being a jet aircraft though of course objects at high altitude move very rapidly. But jets are not this bright, nor do they stop and return in the same direction. This object made no sound at all as it passed.

The summary of all this is that it was not an aircraft of any kind, because of sound. The light was very bright and apparently the object was self-luminous, exhibiting no visible exhaust of any kind. Because of sound, it could not have been an aircraft of any kind.
