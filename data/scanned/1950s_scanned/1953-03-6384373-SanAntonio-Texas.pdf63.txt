The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a flying saucer-type unidentified flying object (UFO). The photograph shows a disk-shaped object with a raised central portion, flying in a southerly direction. The text below the photograph discusses the sighting of this object, describing how it executed a complete circle at approximately fifteen miles in diameter before continuing its flight in a southerly direction until it gradually faded out of sight, leaving no physical evidence of the sighting.

THE NORTH SKY HEADING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. JUST PRIOR TO DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FIRST LIGHT IN THE SOUTH SKY, ANOTHER LIGHT APPEARED IN THE NORTH SKY, FLYING APPROXIMATELY THE SAME COURSE AS DID THE FIRST. AT NO TIME WERE THERE MORE THAN THREE LIGHTS VISIBLE AT ONE TIME. AN UNUSUAL FEATURE OF THIS OBSERVATION WAS THAT AFTER EXECUTING A STRAIGHT COURSE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, A LIGHT EXECUTED A COMPLETE CIRCLE OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MILE IN DIAMETER THAN CONTINUED ITS FLIGHT IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION UNTIL THEY DISAPPEARED BY GRADUALLY FADING OUT OF SIGHT. THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE SIGHTING. NEGATIVE RESULTS WERE REPORTED FROM THE LOCAL AO WHERE THE INCIDENT AND THE MAKING OF ALL ATTEMPTS TO PICK UP THE LIGHTS ON RADAR.
