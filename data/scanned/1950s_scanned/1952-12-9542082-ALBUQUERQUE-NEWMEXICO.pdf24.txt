A military investigation on Kirtland tower, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was reported.
A MILITARY OPERATION: As to the object observed, according to the dimensions now available, this object was a circular round mass of arc in a diameter of 50-100 ft. or more, hovering over a certain area with a slight and oscillating motion, sometimes tilting or rotating on its axis. It seemed to be giving off a strange illumination and glowed in a weird fashion.
This object was traveling east to west in a curved path in a steady course which would indicate a controlled direction and in a manner that would contrast with an erratic zig-zag flight path. This description is rather detailed and the object was under careful observation for approximately 10-12 minutes. No doubt this was a military operation in connection with some aircraft or aerial device.
CONDITIONS: Mild, day to day, first sighting. The object from her was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It was reported to have moved very quickly up and down, been obscured by clouds at times, and disappeared behind the clouds on one or two occasions. After several seconds, I looked toward the horizon field, and I think I saw the light of an aircraft flickering and disappearing quickly.
