COMMENTS OF Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the sighting might have been caused by weather balloons released from Long Island, New York at GFOC since the reported velocities were insufficient to transport the object the required distance in the 40 minutes elapsed from the time of the sighting at 23:00Z and the time of the balloon release at 21:02Z.

2. The north and north-westerly winds tend to rule out, but the probability of balloon originating at Mitchell APB, which lies about 25 miles northeast of the location of the sighting.

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer: 
1. The following additional information was revealed by the Investigating Officer:
a. Piball balloons are released at 0000Z, 0900Z, 1200Z, and 2100Z daily from both civil and military locations in the New York City area, including Idlewild Airports release this type balloon at the above times.
b. Piball balloons under some conditions do not indicate correct balloon color depending upon sky conditions at the time of release. On a clear day as was 18 Jan 56 in the New York area, piball balloons would have been white.

2. It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting is explained by piball balloons released at Idlewild Airport (New York City area) at 1800Z on 17 January 1956. The following items are given in support of the above hypothesis:
a. Idlewild Airport is located fifteen (15) miles north-northeast of the SOURCES home. Winds at the time of the sighting were from the north and northwest as indicated at 15/2000Z.
b. At 2102Z, the time of the sighting and forty (40) minutes after the release of the piball from Idlewild, it has followed an approximate course that the subject balloon would have been approximately eight (8) miles west of the observer and at an altitude of 22,000 feet.
c. From the above figures we can obtain the angle of elevation of the balloon since its location is known.
