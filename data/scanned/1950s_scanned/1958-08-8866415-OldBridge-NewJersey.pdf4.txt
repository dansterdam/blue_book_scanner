                                         17 September 1958

Dear Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED]

This is to acknowledge your letter of 28 August 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object observed by you at Old Bridge, New Jersey, on 27 August 1958.

There is insufficient data on which to base a valid conclusion. However, the following is offered as a possible solution:

At 9:00 p.m., EST, 27 August 1958, the star Alpherats, which is a second magnitude star, was in the northeast, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.

At 9:00 p.m., EDT, same day, the planet Mars was just beginning to appear above the northeastern horizon.

In areas such as central New Jersey where industrial haze or exhaust fumes are present in the atmosphere, heavenly bodies can be mistaken for unconventional or unidentified flying objects. Therefore it is quite possible that you observed either the planet Mars or the star Alpherats on that date.

                                      Sincerely,

                                      LAWRENCE J. TACKER
