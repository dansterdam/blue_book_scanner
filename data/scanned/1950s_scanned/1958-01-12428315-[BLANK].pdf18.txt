ARNOLD: (Cont'd)
I believed it was our duty to do 
so. I don't know what's going
on in the sky. I don't think
it's anything for people to get
hysterical about. But there's
something going on besides Sputnik, 
I'm sure of that. It's something
we see but we can't explain. Now
that's my frank opinion!

EDWARDS:
Kenneth Arnold's sighting of
objects he claimed looked some-
thing like this ...
(TURNS SKETCH TO CAMERA)
... was the beginning...June
24, 1947 ... Mt. Rainier, Washington.
And it may have been quickly for-
gotten...a news oddity...except
that within the next 30 days, there
were 53 more reports of so-called
flying saucers. These was the
usual quota of crackpots climbing
on the bandwagon.
