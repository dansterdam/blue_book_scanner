The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an official document from the Project Blue Book archives. The document appears to be a transfer of the USAF Aerial Phenomena Program, addressed to Lt. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever of the Air Research-Development Command.

The text of the document is as follows:

SUBJECT: (U) Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

TO: Lt Gen Bernard A. Schriever
    Air Research-Development Command
    Andrews AFB, Wash., D.C.

1. Reference Air Force Regulation No. 200-2, subject, "Unidentified Flying Objects," dated 14 September 1959.

2. On 16 July the USAF assumed responsibility for a program of investigation of unidentified flying objects over the United States. This program was designed to determine if these phenomena constitute a threat to our national security, and first, if these phenomena were hostile, and second, had any possible scientific value. A further objective was to determine the nature of each of these reported objects.

3. With the change of the (CO-2) designation that has been no indication that the basic mission of this program has changed. After review of the twelve year record of the intelligence division of the project, it has been determined that the program has developed along lines progressively more scientific in nature.

4. It is my opinion that any future value to the Air Force lies in exploitation of these phenomena for scientific purposes rather than as an intelligence function. With your concurrence, I propose that the program be transferred to your command. This will provide the USAF program with three full-time USAF personnel and one scientific consultant in each agency within your command that you may deem appropriate.
