The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and an object above the horizon, with instructions to indicate the location and height of the object. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road, with two smaller sketches on the right side depicting a horizon line. There is also handwritten text providing additional details about the sketches.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
