The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of UFO reports and investigations conducted by the United States Air Force.

The text in the document can be transcribed as follows:

a. The reports will by regulation be forwarded to SAFOI for initial evaluation and storage. An officer with a technical background, and preferably with intelligence experience, will be assigned to that branch of SAFOI charged with this responsibility and will conduct this initial evaluation.

b. These reports which reach SAFOI which give indication of having possible intelligence value or scientific and technical possibilities will be forwarded to AFCIN and/or ARDC for further evaluation and/or exploitation.

c. The conduct of the program in the field (investigations) will still be the responsibility of the Air Force bases. At the bases it will still be preferably the intelligence function which will be responsible for these investigations.

3. The advantages of this transfer area:

a. SAFOI is familiar with the Aerial Phenomena Program.
b. Reports will be evaluated immediately at the office responsible for liaison relations.
c. The reports which show promise of additional value, either from an intelligence and/or scientific viewpoint, will be forwarded to specialized agencies for further exploitation. Those agencies are operating the method of operation the nature of reports which agencies such as ATIC and ARDC are required to handle would be cut to a minimum, allowing for more man-hours per report and consequently better analysis and evaluation.
d. The program will lose some of the aura of mystery which surrounds it due to its association with intelligence.
e. ATIC will be free to apply man-hours, previously applied to the UFO project, to other program more beneficial to the Air Force.
