Flight 1-3, 46024 AMR
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was caused by the planet Mars. On 7 September 1956, the planet Mars will be closer to the earth than it has been since 1924; its brilliance may have caused the sighting. 
2. On 7 September 1956, the planet Mars will be visible in the eastern sky at approximately 0400 hours (see 28 May 1956 message from Captain Phillip Reber) at an angle of 31 degrees from the horizon. The sighting occurred at approximately 0230 hours (see 2 Sep 26 message from Captain Phillip Reber). These hours are consistent with the position of the planet Mars as described above.
3. The position of the planet Mars is consistent with that reported in the sighting.
4. Although all of the object's reported characteristics appeared appreciably larger and brighter than the planet Mars, this observed phenomenon may be reasonably explained and accounted for due to the close proximity of the planet Mars to the earth. This astronomical anomaly is not inconsistent with service to the IGY.
5. Observation of any star or planet through a rift of haze or moisture will give the impression of erratic movement. This in no way indicates the object's ownership is other than the planet Mars.
6. It is the significance and intensity of the power of observation of sources that have prepared this wind, not necessarily the validity of being from the planet. This consideration is as important as the other hypothesis or UFO's meta identification criteria.
