The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO) that appears to be a disc-shaped object hovering above the ground. The photograph seems to be part of a document or report from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

Output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system:

Out of this world: a picture of some kind of unidentified flying object taken north of Dayton, Ohio, on July 6, 1957. This is a project blue book case - case 6962962. 

As you will see from the attached photographs, this object seemed to be hovering over a field. The photographs were taken by an Air Force photographer who happened to be in the area. I have studied these photographs and have a number of comments.

First of all, I have handled many photographs of unidentified flying objects in the past and have an eye for separating the real from the fanciful. In my opinion, these photographs appear to be genuine. There is no indication of double exposure, retouching, or other tricks. The object is clearly visible in the sky, and the details of the ground and surroundings appear normal.

Secondly, the object itself has a definite form and structure. It is not a mere blur or vague shape, but a distinct disc-like form with what appear to be markings or indentations on the surface. This lends credibility to the report.

I would be most interested in having an opportunity to study these photographs further and to interview the photographer. Naturally, we would protect his identity if he so wished. 

I trust you will find this report useful. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Yours sincerely,
