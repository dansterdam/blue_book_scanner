FLAMING OBJECT RASHES HOLE IN SIDE OF HOUSE 
Case 139. Lawrence, Mass., Aug. 11, 1955 - Possibly related to the "meteor" mentioned above is an incident that occurred on the night of Aug. 11, 1955. A reddish, flaming object, apparently several feet in diameter, was observed to come down through the trees and strike the side of a house, making a hole, and leaving evidences of having burned or scorched the house at the point of impact. The object was not yet identified, struck the side of a house occupied by Mrs. Riza Descoteaux, shortly after 10 p.m. The impact was severe enough to shatter a window and create a hole several inches in diameter in the clapboards, before the object fell to the ground. Sergeant Philip Desautels at police headquarters was notified of the occurrence by Edmund Rickard, whose wife was awakened by the noise and saw smoke and embers coming from her neighbor's house. Mrs. Rickard stated that she was on her porch when she saw a flash of light followed by a loud noise as the object came through the trees and struck the house. Mrs. Rickard identified the object as a "fiery ball" which it had fallen into the yard. Mrs. Rickard identified the object as a fiery ball some 3 to 4 feet in diameter, with a tail of flame. The hole in the house, several inches in diameter, was examined and found to exhibit evidence of having been burned through, rather than merely a hole punched through the wall.
