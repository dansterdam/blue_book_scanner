The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a classified document from the 4602D Air Intelligence Service Squadron, discussing radar sightings of UFOs over El Toro, California on November 7, 1956. The text of the document is as follows:

HEADQUARTERS
4602D AIR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SQUADRON (ADC)
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
EL TORO, CALIFORNIA

27 November 1956

SUBJECT: Air and Photographs of El Toro USAS UFO Sighting

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: AFOIN-4L1
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

1. Enclosed is a copy of AF Form 112 with radar scope photographs of the El Toro USAF UFO sighting of 12 November 1956.

2. Since evaluation of this sighting depends primarily on an analysis of the radar scope photographs, and since facilities for accurate interpretation of radar photographs are not available at this level, a detailed evaluation by your organization is being deferred until your organization can complete a thorough analysis of the photographs.

3. At the present time, it appears that the radar part of this sighting was caused by some type of local phenomenon which affected the El Toro USAS radar site. The visual sightings (which may not necessarily have been related to the radar sightings) seem to have been stimulated by imaginations stimulated by the unusual events of the evening and morning.

FOR THE COMMANDER:

CHARLES W. GODET
