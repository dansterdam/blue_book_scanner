January 12 sighting: We have no report of any burning object in this area. The neighbors observed the incident, but they did not observe any flaming object, and it was not obvious or identifiable to the air force through police.

January 14 sighting: It is believed that the objects observed through the telescope were jet aircraft at high altitudes.
