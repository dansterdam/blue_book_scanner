LOUISIANA WOMAN FRIGHTENED BY LENTICULAR DEVICE
August 21, 1955: At Chalmette, Louisiana, Mrs. chance d to look out of her window and saw much to her astonishment, a low-hovering object about the size of a plane, a black and a half away. Retaining slowly, it was a glowing white, as the full moon, and appeared to be a solid object. The slow moon-bright and eerie, and she stared mesmerized. As it looked like two suns, she put clearly detached. Her only she was uncertain, but the next day She had to pray the facts out of her nerves, and a there was great difficulty of the non-professional nature of the report, and the unwillingness of the observer to discuss the matter freely. Our correspondent suggested that this might be a saucerishpy.

An additional note of perhaps some significance concerning her report is that not only did the incident occur on the same date as the Hopkinsvillo, Kentucky "landing," but the object as described by Mrs. is almost identical to the object described by Mrs. Hopkins.(The two towns are approximately 500 miles apart in a straight line.)
