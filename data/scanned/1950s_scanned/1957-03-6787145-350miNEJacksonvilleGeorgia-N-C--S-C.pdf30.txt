The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report. It does not contain any photographs, but rather text describing a UFO sighting that occurred near Jacksonville, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina on March 6, 1957.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Another important incident had just been reported by Capt. Cecil D. McCreery, CAA-GCA Approach Control, JAX Approach Control office on the military frequency. (He was informed that this report was being sent to the Director of the AS, ATC, and to the Director of the ATIC, as well.)

According to Capt. McCreery's account, a CAA (FAA) pilot, Capt. Van Winkle, was flying at an altitude of 2000-3000 ft. along the South Carolina-Georgia coast at about 0500 Z, when he sighted an extremely bright object maneuvering around his aircraft. It first appeared as a brilliant green light, then "blinked out" - later reappearing as an extremely bright object with a dark silhouette. Capt. Van Winkle has reported this incident in detail, and stated that at one point the object came so close to his aircraft that he could feel the heat from it. It made a 90Â° turn and accelerated away at a terrific speed - disappearing from sight. He stated that the object was clearly larger than his twin-engine Beechcraft on which he was then flying. Capt. McCreery reported that Capt. Van Winkle seemed to be quite "shaken up" by this incident."
