There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

"Mr. J. Akeret, an engineer of the Auerbach Instrument Company, Zurich, recently visited the Cooper Electric plant near Cincinnati, in his preliminary investigation of phenomena associated with flying saucers. He believes that Americans can quite worrying. He described them as "illusions".

Professor Akeret is not alone among the "experts" who have belittled the "saucer" or plate-like disk stories. In his report to the U.S. Air Force, bearing the date Nov. 5, 1952, Dr. Marshall said that only two of the reports he had examined scientifically were worthy of the name "flying saucer." Dr. Marshall, Chief of the Balloon Branch, U.S. Weather Bureau, was charged to investigate the saucer reports.

Many similar sightings have been reported, not only by astronomers, meteorologists, and military and civilian pilots, but by thousands of reliable citizens. The objects Pluto, Pallas, and Juno, discovered in 1846, over Las Cruces, New Mexico, are said to have been seen before. It was oval shaped and "seemed to trail off at the ends." The object encountered a blinker-type ship, and about a half dozen windows were clearly visible at the front of the ship and along the side."
