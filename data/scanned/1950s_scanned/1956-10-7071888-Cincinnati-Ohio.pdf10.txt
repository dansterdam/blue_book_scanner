AF-UFO REPORT ORDERED DESTROYED
Evidence that the Air Force destroys or has an official UFO reporting system which has been given copy below reproduces the top part of an Air Intelligence Information Report. The Air Force has informed the two AP officers that this report is not routinely handled as a "real" UFO incident - indications of censorship previously unknown to NICAP.

Key points of sighting: 
AF witnesses: Lt. J.S. Belsham, USAF, Squadron Commander, 55th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, Lt. S.E. Standridge, USAF, Squadron Intelligence Officer, Lt. W.D. Elliston, USAF, Squadron Armament Officer.
What was seen: Two objects approaching their aircraft, which was in flight. The first object was observed to be the size of a pea held at arm's length (about one-half the size of the moon), similarly (resembled). Another similar sized object approached from another direction and approached the first one, then disappeared. Flight Commander Pollack was instructed to "very reliably" the Squadron Intelligence Officer, First Lieut. R.W. Malick.
The destruction of similar officially verified reports will reduce the number of UFO records. Regardless of purpose, deletion of such UFO records can only result in misinforming the public.
