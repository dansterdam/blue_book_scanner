"The man said that the object had approached his automobile from the south and that it was round and disc shaped. He said that it was about 30 feet across and that it seemed to be about 4 feet above the ground. The object was a dull metallic color and made no sound. The man said that it seemed to hover over his automobile for a few seconds and then sped off to the north at a very high rate of speed. The man said that he was very frightened by the object and that he drove his car to a nearby farm house to report the incident to the local sheriff's office."
