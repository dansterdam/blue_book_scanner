Unfortunately, there is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text contained in the document is as follows:

I thought that it was a plane coming in for a landing. The action at the time it first came into view was very slow and there was a change in color, the bright white to red & green, the same effect as when a plane is landing. But the light seemed to maneuver in a little different fashion from a plane, so that the light from the wings would not be determined yet. The light seemed to hover a little in one spot, and then move off rapidly. This continued for about 20 minutes, and the time I was relieved from duty, and left the area.
