The text in the document is as follows:

4602d Air Intelligence Service Sq. (ADC), AISOP, subj: Request for Balloon Tracking

CRZD P-6641 (9 Jul 56)     1st Ind

HQ, AF CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH CENTER, Air Research and Development Command, L. G. Hanscom Field, Bedford, Massachusetts

1. This Center has no record of balloon flights #18 or #19 having been launched from Vernalis NAS on 22 or 23 February 1956. However, during the two day period 22-23 February 1956, flights 1-1 through 1-5 were launched from this site. Of these five flights, 1-1, 1-3, and 1-4 terminated prematurely, while time of flight 1-2 and 1-5 launched 23 February 1956, and 1-5, launched 24 February 1956, remained within the 21 for the greater part of their time in the air.

2. We request that you inform us of the approximate location of the subject "unidentified flying object (UFOB)" sighting in order that we might inspect our available trajectory information on flights 1-2 and 1-5.
