The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a routing and coordination sheet from the Office of Record, relating to a request for information about "Unidentified Flying Objects" from the Fifth Air Force, ATTN: SPIT, APO 925, San Francisco, California.

The text in the document is as follows:

DEPT. TO REACH
SPITIT, Hq Fifth Air Force, 5 Nov 57, Subj: Information Requested

1st Ind
HQ/Capt G.T. Gregory/wn/69216
AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, Wright Patterson Air Force Base,

TO: Commander, Fifth Air Force, ATTN: SPIT, APO 925, San Francisco, California

Attached is a draft copy of a proposed "Identification to Flying Objects" which this Center is in the process of preparing, including drafting and revising. For this purpose, a copy of the suggestions and revisions sheet", and illustrations to be added to the guide are transmitted.

2. Because of current budgetary limitations and manpower restrictions, publication and distribution of the proposed guide on a USAFwide basis within the near future is unlikely. Therefore, the attached may be used as an "in-house" guide to the preparation of a document to be assembled by your office in any format desired or as reflected for the requirements of the Air Defense Command.

3. Also attached is Department of Defense and other material reflecting the "Aids to Identification" on the Air Force "UFO Program". This, together with the aforementioned guide, should provide all basic data necessary for training, identification or informative purposes.

Incls:
1. Govt "Aids to IDENTIFICATION"
2. Suggested Revisions
3. USAir Force Questionnaire
4. USAF "Revision"
