ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FLYING SAUCERS?
By HAROLD GREER
Ottawa, Nov. 11-The world's first scientific flying saucer sighting, officially termed as "unidentified aerial phenomena", was reported last Sunday in Hampton Bays, L. I., 10 miles northwest of here. 
The saucer, observed by six scientists and engineers connected with the secret development of the nation's air defense system, was scientifically recorded by means of engineering equipment and instruments. 
It being equipped with every conceivable type of recording device in the process of development for the detection and monitoring of high-speed aerial vehicles, the scientists were able to make a comprehensive record of the amazing speed and maneuverability of the flying saucer.
THE STATION WILL BE MANNED 24 HOURS A DAY
When operations are stepped up, the station will be manned 24 hours a day. All communications, consisting of telephone and a radio set running full volume at 550 kilocycles, will be shut down and a radio set running full volume at 550 kilocycles will be used to pick up any radio stations within range.
TO PROVIDE PROOF, NOW LACKING
Sightings of this type have been numerous in both this country and the United States, and the scientists concerned are determined to provide proof, now lacking, that flying saucers are a reality. A group of prominent scientists and engineers have volunteered their services to man the station around the clock in the hope that they may be able to make additional, irrefutable recordings of the saucers' operations under controlled scientific conditions.
