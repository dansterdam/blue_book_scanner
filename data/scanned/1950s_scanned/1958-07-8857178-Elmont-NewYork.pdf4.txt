The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have produced the following text found in the document:

Comment: It's a somewhat singular that someone who claims to have seen a star-like object at first assumed it to be a satellite since the sighting was to the east rather than to the west, which would be more common for satellite sightings. The weather was clear and the object seemed to be at a relatively low altitude when first noticed, so it would not appear to have the characteristics of a satellite. It moved off rapidly in a west-northwest direction and disappeared from view, suggesting some type of powered aircraft rather than a satellite. A small craft of some kind does not seem an unreasonable inference from the details provided, though perhaps further investigation would be warranted to determine the exact nature of the sighting.

NNNN
