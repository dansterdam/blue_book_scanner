Text extracted from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

After studying the subject, it is the opinion of the Project BLUE BOOK staff that there is no evidence that the object observed was an aircraft, weather balloon, or other known object. There were no definite identifying features noted and no confirmation of the observation could be made. This report is being filed under the project name of UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

The observer's account seems to be in substantial agreement with the known cases on such subjects and the general nature of the incident would tend to corroborated the information furnished. The object was observed for a considerable length of time and was described in some detail, lending greater credence to the report.

The object was described as a silver, glare-type object of large apparent size which was observed maneuvering at high speed and altitude. It was sighted for approximately 15 minutes. No further details are available. The object could not have been an aircraft, weather balloon, or other known object according to the information furnished.

The three jet airplanes which were in the area at the time and time of sighting were reported to be unrelated to the object.

There appears to be no reasonable explanation for the incident based on the information available. The object was observed by a reliable and apparently credible witness under good conditions of visibility.
