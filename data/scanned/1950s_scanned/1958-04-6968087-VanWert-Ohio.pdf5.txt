The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter from the Public Information Division of the USAF responding to an earlier report about an unidentified flying object sighting. The text of the letter is as follows:

15 May 1958

Dear Miss [redacted],

This is to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 13 April 1958 concerning the unidentified flying object sighted that day.

Within the limited information we cannot definitely identify the object. However, astronomical plots indicate the object could have been the planet Venus, which is also the possibility that the object could have been a distant bright light on a weather balloon.

Earlier reports from the Van Wert area that might reveal nothing unusual.

Your report will be included in our continuing study of aerial phenomena. Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
Office of Information Services

Van Wert, Ohio
