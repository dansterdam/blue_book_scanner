Dear Mr. ---, 
This is to acknowledge your letter of 20 October 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object. 
This sighting is much too old to accomplish an investigation and verification at this late date.
For your information I am including the latest Department of the Air Force Report on the subject of unidentified flying objects. 
Sincerely,
Major J. L. Tacker,
Public Information Division,
Office of Information Services.

Lafayette, Louisiana
