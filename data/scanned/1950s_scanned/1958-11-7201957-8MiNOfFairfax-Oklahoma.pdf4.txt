1. I am investigating an alleged sighting of unidentified flying objects in the vicinity of Fairfax, Oklahoma on the morning of 2 November 1958.

3. I would appreciate a possible confirmation of any aircraft under your observation in the vicinity of Fairfax, Oklahoma at 0550 Zulu, 2 November 1958, that might be the observer's UFO's. If you have heard or know of any other information on this particular incident, please forward same.
