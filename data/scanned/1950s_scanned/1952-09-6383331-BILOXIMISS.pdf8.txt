STATEMENT

On approximately 2110 hours, 14 September 1952, I, the undersigned, observed an unidentified flying object. This object appeared to be elliptical in shape, hovered for approximately 5-7 minutes over the area, and then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object appeared to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and illuminated. It was silent and made no sound. Lost sight of object due to its high rate of speed and sudden disappearance from view.

Approximately five (5) minutes later, the object returned to the same general area where I had first observed it. It hovered for approximately 3 minutes and then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object appeared to be approximately the same size as before, illuminated, and silent. 

I heard no sounds or rumblings and observed no trails or exhaust.
