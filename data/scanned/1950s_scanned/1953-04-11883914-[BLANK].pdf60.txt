time to determine all essential and necessary facts which should be disclosed by
an ideal completed form. A coding scheme is being devised to record these facts
and to facilitate analysis. The project files for 1948 and 1951 were made avail-
able recently and this material is used in indoctrination and coding studies.
Upon completion of coding, analysis of the files will begin, probably within one

The clipping service has been initiated and approximately 350 clippings

several sources. These clippings are reproduced here xerographically and the
originals are transmitted to the Sponsor.
