Here is the text from the document:

In your own words please describe the sighting you observed. Use sketches if desired. All observations from the time of first sighting to the time of disappearance are important. Include a description of the weather, wind, and cloud conditions at the time of this sighting.

We were sitting outside our house overlooking the fields and noticed a bright light in the sky about a mile away. It disappeared completely for a few seconds and then reappeared as a slightly dimmer light. It moved slowly back and forth and then appeared to dive straight down and disappear again. This happened several times and the light seemed to change in intensity. We were all quite puzzled by what we were seeing.

The objects later sighted were descending at various times. At first they appeared as one light, but as they descended further, there were many-times greater (than left) at a time. They seemed to appear to take roundish formations, sometimes a single row, sometimes a cluster, as if they were accompanying one another. I label them as 'strange lights' or 'unusual objects'.

Lieutenant (name illegible) USAF when right was flying through the area, the objects were no longer visible.
