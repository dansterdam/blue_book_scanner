Subject: UFO Report

1. This letter will serve to report the following unusual aerial sightings which occurred in the Great Falls, Montana area on September 12, 1950. 

2. At approximately 10:15 PM on September 12, 1950, my wife and I observed four bright lights moving in a northwesterly direction at a very high altitude over Great Falls. The lights were very brilliant and seemed to move in a formation of a diamond shape. Their speed was estimated to be around 500 miles per hour. They were in sight for approximately 1 minute before disappearing from view. The lights appeared to be white or silver in color. There was no sound associated with the objects and no trail or exhaust was visible. The sky was clear at the time of the sighting.

3. This report is submitted for your information and appropriate action.

Sincerely,
