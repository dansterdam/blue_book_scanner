23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when
you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an
"A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

A


B

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include
in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow
beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The sketches correspond to questions 23, 24, and 25:

- Sketch for question 23 illustrates an overhead view with the horizon represented at the top and bottom and labeled 'Horison'. A curved line representing the path of the object and two labeled points, "A" and "B," to mark the initial and final positions of the object respectively.
- Sketch for question 24 shows a horizontal sequence of ellipses with the first one marked as "A" and the last one marked as "B," symbolizing the trajectory of the object.
- Sketch for question 25 includes a series of oval shapes in a diagonal line with an arrow indicating the direction of movement, and below is the handwritten explanation beginning with "I have not included to draw details..." The text trails off and is incomplete.

The handwritten text at the bottom is not entirely legible, but it seems to reflect the witness's statement that they could not include further details about the object's appearance.
