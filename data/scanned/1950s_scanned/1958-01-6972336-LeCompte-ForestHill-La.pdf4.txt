ASTRONOMY
Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be missed in evening observations.
By JAMES STOKLEY
THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the western sky after sunset these evenings is the planet Venus, shining with a brilliancy and clarity of outline reminiscent of a beacon.
Venus is now at a point in its cycle when it becomes most prominent to earthly observers. It is still rather low in the sky, but it is brighter at the present time than at any other season of the year.
In November, Venus will be visible in the eastern sky before sunrise.
Bright Birds in the Sky
There may be, however, some who mistakenly identify the stars instead of Venus as the bright object in the evening sky. At this season of the year, perhaps more than at any other, the appearance of Venus in the evening sky closely resembles that of a bright star.
The reason is, of course, that Venus appears brightest when it is seen close to the horizon, just after sunset or before sunrise.
At such times, the blue and violet rays in the light of Venus are scattered more by the atmosphere, and only the yellow, orange and red rays come through, giving Venus the star-like appearance.
This brilliant planet which we see in the evening now will disappear from view in November, when it will reappear in the morning sky.
