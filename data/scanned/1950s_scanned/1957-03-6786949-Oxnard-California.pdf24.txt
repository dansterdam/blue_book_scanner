It was reported that there was a scramble underway and would ask the aircraft to check the area. 
AIRCRAFT vectored the aircraft into the area and an attempt was made to orient them.
From control tower RADAR operators the aircraft was picked up and a course of 290 Degrees was given them to intercept. This was recognized by the pilot and it appeared they knew they were being tracked. However, the aircraft dove and disippeared below the level of the radar. The last radar contact was at 9:25 PM. No visual contact was ever made. 
The onboard RADAR-OPERATOR reported they had a return on scope which faded in and out but could never gain a visual. They immediately had a report submitted over the communications net.
The reported objects were described as "unidentified" and were under control sight and sound by the group at R-1.
Although on several occasions (sic) the ground observers (sic) reported the aircraft making sharp turns, abrupt changes of direction or level, and dives, the overall operation was broken off at 9:25 PM when radar contact was lost. The entire operation was broken off at that time.
The following police officers were in the area and reported the incident:
James P. Wallison
C.R. Miller
Oxnard, Calif.
