UNCLASSIFIED 
"There was no noticeable sound whatsoever, and this seemed strange and because the sight was quite still and sounds could be heard from the stadium, which is approximately 20 blocks away."
"We also watched several airliners in the following few minutes. All these planes could be heard distinctly normal."
Witness: C.R. - WEATHEROLT
"Original copy of above statement is on file in District Office #4 and will be referred to if needed."
Interview of Miss HELEN HAAS, reflects identically the same information as related by WEATHEROLT.
Review of flight records at 29th Infantry Division, Headquarters Battery, 222d Field Artillery Bn, reveal that U.S. Army planes, AT-6D's and L-17's, that were in the air May 27, 1952 from 2150 to 2350 hours and 2150 to 2250 hours, respectively, were identified by the TOWER and BOSS.
Interview of WEISHEIPT reflects that on 27 May 1952, at approximately 2230, CADWALADER and CAPT. GRAESER were flying a CADWALADER's T-6 aircraft. That their plane was apparently unidentified and aircraft was not in class and in motion was seen to go up and to the left and then dropped approximately 500 feet. On reaching the ground there were no landing lights on, but were a rather large white navigation light located on the bottom and green and red navigation lights were not working. His aircraft was an unoriented, unidentified T-6 aircraft.
After CADWALADER left his state of flying, he was simulating instrument flying. He had flown at approximately 500 feet at a speed of 100 mph. During this time he believes that he saw some unusual lights spotted by MORRIS. He described the weather as very clear and dark, with no moon.
OFFICIAL INDENTIFICATION was not determined from Friendship International Airport, is as follows:
