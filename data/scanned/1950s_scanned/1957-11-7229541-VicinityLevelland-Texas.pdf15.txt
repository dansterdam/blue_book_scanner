SUBJ: Request for Air Science Division Review of Levelland Case

What effect does a nearby lightning discharge have on the water droplets in the air, and what effect does this have on the sighting of a low-flying ball lightning phenomenon?

A request is made for the Air Science Division, in collaboration with other USAF units as necessary, to determine or give their opinion on the hypothesis that a nearby lightning discharge could have caused an effect on the water droplets in the air that may have influenced the sighting of the low-flying ball lightning phenomenon.

The formal request is made to be sent to Washington and/or turned over to the TV group, because the case file will be needed for analysis and the material required by the investigation is in tomorrow's possession. This material may be important and your expedited attention to the matter would be appreciated.
