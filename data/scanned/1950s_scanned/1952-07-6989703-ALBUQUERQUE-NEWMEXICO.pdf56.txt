171st Air Transport Group
23 July 1952, at approximately 2545 MST, a crew on a training flight over Albuquerque, New Mexico, observed several metallic objects in the air. The objects were dull and silvery in color and appeared to be maneuvering. They were estimated to be 25,000 to 30,000 feet in altitude. The objects were in sight for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. One object peeled off from the main group and accelerated rapidly, disappearing from sight. The other objects maintained a relatively uniform course and speed. I have borrowed and attached the original of this report. If you should have any flying saucers or anything of that nature, I would appreciate it if you would return them to me by return mail. I saw one in a bank and saw a metallic flash. On subsequent observation, the object appeared to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter and the ground visibility was very poor. I am sure of the diameter, as I had the object in sight for a considerable length of time and I saw it maneuver. It appeared to be a metallic, disc-shaped object, and the sky cover was such that I had an excellent view. I am sure of the sighting and something must have been in the sky at that time. I saw approximately 3 or 4 of these objects.
