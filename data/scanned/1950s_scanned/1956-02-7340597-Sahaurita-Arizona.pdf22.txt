The image contains two sketches, but no photograph. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "horizon (skyline)" and an object positioned above it, with instructions to imagine how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with two smaller inset sketches, one showing a person on a road, and the other showing a distant horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
