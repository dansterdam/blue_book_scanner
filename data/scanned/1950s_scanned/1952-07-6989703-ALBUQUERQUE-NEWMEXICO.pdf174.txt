The image contains a photograph that appears to be an unretouched photograph of an object seen by a Marine cameraman who was hunting for "flying saucers" at Miami Beach, Florida on Tuesday night. The image is described as being blown up to 10 times its size from a 16-millimeter film negative. The article discusses a theory that the photographed object is called "Plane's Light" and provides details about the incident and the photograph.

Photographed Object 
Is Called Plane's Light
The latest theory about the "or-only caught in 'sight frames,'... yellow-ish object" seen and photographed over Miami Tuesday night is that what was spotted was the front light of an airplane coming in for a landing at the International Airport.
John L. King, an aerial gunner during World War II, said today he is certain that what he saw in the sky above Miami that night was photographed by a Marine was a plane that was on its way to land at the International Airport.
Miami who works in the control tower at the field reported that a plane was due to land in Miami about the time the object was seen in Sur-side. It was looking for "flying saucers" when he went to the home of Berman Mayr, 5200 Byron Ave., shot about 40 feet of film on the object. He said it was "very tal clear" and had "definite shape."
On a hunch Mayr went to the outside home of Glens who two nights earlier had reported seeing an object in the sky traveling at great speed. Mayr photographed the object on 16-millimeter film. He said it was traveling "more than 2,000 miles an hour."
Marine officials in Miami re fused to comment on the photos, but said the object was "very tal clear" and had "definite shape."
