STATEMENT

At approximately 2245 hours, 21 July 1952, an I was working my rounds on the base airfield at San Marcos AFB, Texas. There appeared to be traveling very slow, far away you could hear a low roaring noise but besides this there seemed to be nothing. The object at first didn't bother me as it was not too much because I just thought it was an airplane. Then it gained my attention and I was able to say that it was not an airplane but it was something. It was traveling very slow, about 75 miles or less, and I could see it clearly. It is difficult to estimate how big it was but I should say it was at least 75 feet in diameter. I would estimate it's altitude to be approximately 4000 feet. We had both seen it and a couple other guys that were standing around laughing at this thing.
