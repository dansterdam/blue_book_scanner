JULY 13, 1952 - NEAR NORFOLK, VIRGINIA (KEYHOLE-1953 P 37) 2 WITNESSES
AT 9:12 P.M. A GROUP APPROACHED DC-4 APPROACHING NORFOLK, VIRGINIA ON ITS WAY TO MIAMI. AT THE CONTROLS WAS FIRST OFFICER. THE SECOND OFFICER, BOTH MEN HAD BEEN FLYING FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS, WITH THOUSANDS OF HOURS IN AIRLINER COCKPITS. 
SUDDENLY AN OBJECT FEET IN DIAMETER, YELLOW-WHITE IN COLOR, APPEARED FROM NEWPORT NEWS WHEN A RED GLOW APPEARED AHEAD. THE PILOTS OBSERVED SIX HUGE, DISC-SHAPED OBJECTS RACING TOWARD THEM, BUT AT A LOWER ALTITUDE. THE DISCS, WHICH WERE FLYING IN THE FLAT POSITION, HAD A BRILLIANT ORANGE GLOW LIKE RED-HOT METAL. BY COMPARISON WITH GROUND OBJECTS, THEY SEEMED ABOUT 2,000 FEET BELOW. WHEN THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE 100 FEET IN DIAMETER, THE SIX OBJECTS WERE IN ECHELON FORMATION. THE LEADER AT THE LOWEST POINT. APPARENTLY SIGHTING THE DC-4, THE FIRST OBJECT ABRUPTLY SLOWED, ITS BRIGHT GLOW DIMMING NOTICEABLY. AS IT SLOWED DOWN, THE NEXT TWO OBJECTS WOBBLED FOR INSTANT TO MATCH COLORS. IT SEEMED THESE OBJECTS FOLLOWED THE LEADER AS IF THEIR SIGNAL HAD COME TOO QUICKLY. 
THEN IN UNISON, ALL SIX DISCS FLIPPED UP ON EDGE. FROM THAT BRIEF GLIMPSE, THEY SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 15 FEET THICK, BUT ONLY THE UPPER SURFACES GLOWED. THE SIDES AND UNDERBODY APPEARED TO BE DARK.
WITH A VIOLENT CHANGE OF COURSE - AT LEAST 150 DEGREES - THE OBJECTS STREAKED AWAY, FLIPPING BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL FLAT POSITION. THEY AGAIN LINED UP IN ECHELON, THEIR GLOW BRIGHTENING SWIFTLY AS IF FROM AN INCREASE IN SPEED.
A SECOND AFTER THIS, TWO OTHER DISC-SHAPED OBJECTS RACED UNDER THE DC-4 AND JOINED THE SIX AHEAD. IT TOOK TO CATCH UP. THESE TWO SEEMED TO GLOW THE BRIGHTEST OF ALL.
JOINED THE OTHERS WHEN THEIR GLOW REAPPEARED. THE PILOTS SAW THAT ALL EIGHT OBJECTS WERE NOW IN LINE, HEADING WEST. THEY CLIMBED TO A HIGH ALTITUDE AND QUICKLY VANISHED IN THE NIGHT. 
ESTIMATED THE OBJECTS' SPEED WITH A DALTON MARK 7 COMPUTER. THE DISTANCE COVERED, FROM THE FIRST SIGHTING TO THE POINT OF DISAPPEARANCE, WAS ABOUT 50 MILES. THE STRANGE OBJECTS HAD TRAVELED THIS DISTANCE IN NOT OVER 15 SECONDS, OR AT A SPEED OF 200 MILES A MINUTE.
