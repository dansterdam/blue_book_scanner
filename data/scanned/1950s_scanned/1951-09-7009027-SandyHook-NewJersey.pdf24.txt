2. On 10 September 1951, 1415 hours, an ADC 504, serial number 423, tracked a target which moved about slowly in a circular motion, north of Fort Monmouth at a steady distance of 5,000 yards. The angular elevation was about 1,500 mils. This is proven to be a weather balloon, according to examination by weather personnel. The officer in charge of the operation of the ADC 504 estimated the target to be at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

and 215, 3. On 11 September 1951, 1620 hours, two ADC 504's, serial numbers 217 and 216, tracked an unknown object. The object maneuvered as an elevation change from 4,000 feet to 7,000 feet. The object was tracked automatically in azimuth and elevation (altitude 7,000 feet). The note trace automatically in azimuth and elevation altitude 7,000 feet. The note trace automatically recorded the azimuth and elevation traces. In this case, however, both sets seemed impossible to trace the target properly due to the erratic motion of the object. In order to hold the target, the operator was forced to "pump" the control in order to hold the target. The suspect that the erratic movement was due to the effect of the weather conditions prevailing at the time, namely, a high wind and turbulence. This condition provided the maximum limited tracking ability of the radar set.

However, the radar was unable to provide an accurate range on the target. The maximum slant tracking ability of the radar set was approximately 25,000 yards, but the actual range was undetermined and could have been below normal return.

This incident proves to be a weather balloon. It was determined as such from later date data, October 1951, the item 1, which stated: "weather balloon was identified".

3. On 11 September 1951, at about 1730, a target was picked up on an ADC radar, serial number 1. What could not be measured accurately was the speed as the target maneuvered so rapidly. The target appeared to be from 5,000 to 9,000 feet in altitude. The target maneuver was so rapid, however, overcast conditions prevented a good track. This incident is probably an example of anomalous propagation, where the target was an object in the overcast observed to be maneuvering. It was not possible to determine the exact nature of this incident, but the elevation did not rise above a certain area, thus indicating it was not and aircraft and its elevation at an extreme radar rate was so small, the change in range was not detectable.

It is highly probable that this is an example of anomalous propagation. The incidents indicate that they were aware of this phenomenon, however, it is highly possible that they were unsure of the true nature of this sighting and had difficulty determining what they actually observed based on the limited data and tracking ability of their radar systems at the time.
