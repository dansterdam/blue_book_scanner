was higher (which I think is more likely) the speed would be
- increased proportionately. If you were to take a complete circle,
light it and send it horizontally and, at the same time, have
the forward edge tilted upward in a climbing position, you
would get the same half-moon effect I saw, with the attendant
shading of light. I am not saying that this is what the
thing was doing. This is just my impression of how I would
reproduce the sight I saw.
