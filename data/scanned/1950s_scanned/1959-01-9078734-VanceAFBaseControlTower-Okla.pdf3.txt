OKLAHOMA CITY 6, OKLAHOMA 
Dear Mr. ____, 

The sighting referenced in your letter took place on 5 January 1959. The object was seen from two vantage points: airpoit control tower.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center's analyst determined the sighting was of a T-33 jet trainer aircraft. The object was less than ten degrees above the horizon, corresponding to the reported position of the unindustrial.

The fluctuating from red-orange to blue-green coloration of the light from other sources their appearance is this 
in size and a pulsating this distortion. The probable cause for the lack of identifiability of the aircraft was the time of the sighting.

The official report to the Air Technical Intelligence Center made no mention of gun camera pictures being taken of this object. The aircraft from which this sighting was made is a T-33 jet trainer.

Sincerely,
