The image appears to be a handwritten document, but there is no photograph present. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

As we were sitting this morning, this youngster came over and said - 
I told her about my star. She views across the lake facing 
the mountain. She said she saw what she thought was 
a star two - it moved to the East in intervals. When she
told her husband, he laughed so she didn't tell anyone else. 
I mentioned it. She saw it a month or so ago. Whatever
it is, it always came out of the south east and moves
to the east.
