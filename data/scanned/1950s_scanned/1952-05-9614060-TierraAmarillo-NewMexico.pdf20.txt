SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT, TIERRA AMARILLO, NEW MEXICO 

TO: CHIEF, AIR INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

ON 24 MAY 1952 WHILE ON A DUTY RUN, A PILOT OF THIS COMMAND (MISSING FROM SUBJECT) WAS PROCEEDING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION FROM SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, TO LUBBOCK, TEXAS. AT 4,000 FEET ALTITUDE, AND APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES SOUTH OF AMARILLO, TEXAS, HE SIGHTED AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT TRAVELLING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION AT HIGH SPEED ESTIMATED TO BE 600 TO 1,000 MILES PER HOUR. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, AND YELLOW IN COLOR. HE LOST SIGHT OF IT AS IT DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON. CREW WAS UNABLE TO MAKE ANY POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT. THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THIS HEADQUARTERS. THE ORIGINAL DETECTION OF THIS TARGET ON THE 29 MAY 1952 AT 0345 DEG. AT 6l MILES FOLLOWED BY THE THREE SWEEP CONTACTS.

I CONTACTED MAJ. C AT 15 DEC 52, THIS DATE, AND OBTAINED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS EVENT. I NOW HAVE A COMPLETE SUMMARY OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF THIS TARGET AND BELIEVE IT WARRANTS FURTHER SCRUTINY AS BEING A POSSIBLE UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT. AT THIS TIME I NOTIFIED THE CONTROLLER OF THIS POSITION AND RECOMMENDED THAT THIS DATA BE GIVEN TO PROPER AUTHORITIES FOR FURTHER ACTION. THIS WAS THE LAST POINT DETECTED ON THIS TARGET.
