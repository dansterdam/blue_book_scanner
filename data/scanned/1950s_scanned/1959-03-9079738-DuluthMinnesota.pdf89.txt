DATE:  20  MARCH 1959  

1. On 3 March 1959, ARTHUR GODFREY, from Duluth, Minnesota, called the 1006th AISS on a report he had received from a civilian pilot.

2. The pilot, (BLANK), stated that on 25 February 1959, at approximately 1805 CST, he was flying a single-engine aircraft at 7,000 feet over Duluth, Minnesota. The weather was clear with visibility unlimited. At that time, he observed a bright, disclike object which appeared to be hovering in the air at his altitude. He first observed the object at a distance of approximately five (5) miles to the west of his position. As he approached the object, it appeared to glow bright orange in color. The pilot stated that he had a good look at the object and that it seemed to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. He further stated that the object appeared to have a row of "portholes" or lighted areas around its perimeter. The object was motionless, except for a slight oscillating or rocking motion. After observing the object for approximately four (4) minutes and then lost contact. 

3. The pilot further stated that when he first observed the object, his aircraft instruments began to fluctuate, the compass going completely wild. Approximately one (1) minute after he lost sight of the object, his instruments returned to normal.

4. The pilot stated that he tried to contact the object by radio on both the tower frequency and the emergency frequency, but received no response.

5. The controller called CHARLES GLISS at (BLANK) to advise him of the sighting and to obtain any additional details he could provide. GLISS stated that he was aware of the incident and that he had a good visual observation of the object. GLISS stated that the object was illuminated and gave off a reddish-orange glow. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was estimated to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. GLISS further stated that the object was observed to be motionless, except for a slight oscillating or rocking motion. GLISS stated that he was unable to determine any details of the object's construction, but that it appeared to have some type of portholes or lighted areas around its perimeter.

6. The T-33 controller stated that the probable order was as follows:
a. Rendezvous on (1) - 50 bird (C-130A)
b. Master angle 20
c. Center CAUTIO on ten (10) when airborne

7. The T-33 controller stated that GODFREY had a (C-130A) of the 11th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, which reported that the object hovered at 10,000 feet for approximately 20 minutes before slowly moving off to the southeast at a high rate of speed.

8. The sighting was reported to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, as required.

PT. 1: Here controller vectored RED I on a 030 degree heading at 7000 knots.
PT. 2: RED I at 25,000 feet had a contact on his scope 25 degrees to the right from his position. He had intermittent contacts for about 15 seconds.
PT. 3: Here controller vectored RED I to the left on a about a 320 degree heading at a high rate of speed. Red I lost contact after approximately one (1) minute. 
PT. 4: Here RED I had contact on his scope 90 degrees to his port side. At 17 miles, RED I maneuvered AF chloroform designed on his target which was on a northerly heading on his port side.
