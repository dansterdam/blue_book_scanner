The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The document is a "SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112" and is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top. It was issued by the "DCS/I, Hq 13th AF" and dated "1264502", which likely refers to the processing date.

The document discusses two possibilities that were offered by the personnel making the sightings: "(1) A hot air balloon with a fire in a suspended pan underneath" and "(2) Re-entry and burning-up of a Soviet moon shot which occurred on the same date as the sightings." However, the document states that "Neither of the above explanations seems satisfactory" and that there is "Negative" physical evidence.
