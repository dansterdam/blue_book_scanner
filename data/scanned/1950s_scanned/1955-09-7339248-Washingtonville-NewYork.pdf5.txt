FLIGHT 14 - SEPTEMBER 6, 1955
On flight 14 of the 6th at approximately 1925FST, geographical position approximately 16 nautical miles north of the POU Omni Range, GOA degree track, at 6000 ft. with a clear sky above, unlimited ceiling, I observed a brilliantly lighted object with a bluish-white exhaust flame between a half mile or mile directly ahead at approximately 1926FST, slightly above our position as we were climbing it a 15-20 degree angle descent.
In approximately 3 minutes the object had moved directly in front of us to about 100 degrees from our track placing it off our left beam and was then emitting a lot of sparks as we'll as the blue flame. At that time, it exploded with a blinding flash within, I would say, a half mile or mile of our position.
Flight 12, who I believe, was in the vicinity of ALB at about 8000 ft. reported seeing the flash and that as was background. Southbound Flight 33 who was approximately just south of Coxsackie at about 6000 ft., also reported seeing the flash.
I could not see what the object was except that it appeared like a rocket ship - perhaps partially ignition because all I really got to look at was this trail of flame and, just before it exploded, it seemed like its pattern had seen of a stage failing off of a rocket. I feel certain that it was not a meteor as we had been looking in that direction and it just appeared. There was no trace of it until it got right in front of us. Its speed did not seem to have been in excess of 1000-1500 mph.
