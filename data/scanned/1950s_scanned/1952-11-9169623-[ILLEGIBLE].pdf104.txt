Subject: Statement of identified flying object.

About 0400 Hrs, I spotted the object from our position and was extremely convinced that what I saw was not any conventional aircraft or anything that I was familiar with. I have the impression that the object was a saucer shaped and had some form of illumination on its surface. 

At this point it might be pertinent to note a possible explanation for the object's strange behavior. The object was maneuvering at high speeds which appeared to suddenly gain altitude and distance by pointing out that the object sometimes disappeared from our right wing, but this must undoubtedly have been due to the direction my senses must have been confused. In any case, to our right side, I had to turn my head sometimes, for I could not keep the object constantly under observation.

When I first spotted the object it was in a position which I described to lieutenant was at 10 o'clock level (in order to confirm my bearing, I asked the navigator if he could see the object which he confirmed by pointing to the approximate location.) 

However, the object continued to maintain its position in a southerly direction, with no sound or trail, and changing its speed and altitude, sometimes appearing to be hovering while at other times accelerating rapidly. The object was highly maneuverable, making extremely sharp turns and movements.

Quite honestly, I am the one who had reported the sighting to headquarters as I considered it deserving of special interest. As a professional I am confident in my estimate that its altitude was approximately 12,000 to 15,000 feet, and finally 13,000 feet. It was spotted for about 10-12 minutes before it disappeared, fading away in the distance.
