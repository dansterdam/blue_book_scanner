The object which may have varied or changed the weather, took on all a brilliant greenish-bluish color, object was brighter than any stars in the sky, with the naked eye it appeared to be about the size of a hair, with a steady glow and a luminous-form, one end appeared to be curved and was V-shaped or blunt-ended. SOURCE obtained a good look as the object passed through the periscope of a power Navy type periscope. When viewed through the periscope the object appeared to have diminished in size but retained its brilliant green color and luminous-form. SOURCE observed the object for approx 20 minutes KOPPUT NAVAL AIR STATION, CALIFORNIA, JUNK 5724.
