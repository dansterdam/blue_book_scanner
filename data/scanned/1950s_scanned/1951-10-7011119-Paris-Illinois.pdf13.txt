AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. An unidentified flying object was observed by three observers on 7 October 1951, at approximately 1915 hours, near Paris, Illinois. The object was first observed at about 1915 hours at an altitude estimated to be 3,000 feet. It was described as circular in shape, bright orange in color, and was estimated to be about 50 feet in diameter.

2. After being observed for about 10 to 15 minutes, the object was noted to be descending at a rapid rate of speed. The object appeared to slow down and hover at an estimated altitude of 1,500 feet for a period of about 2 to 3 minutes, then accelerated and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction.

3. During the time the object was observed, it was under intermittent observation by the three witnesses (two adult males and one adult female) from Chrisman, Illinois (age 58 and 46) and Paris, Illinois (age 47). The two from Chrisman were en route to Paris, while the one from Paris was at her home when the object was observed.

4. No sound was heard by the observers, and the object gave off no trail or exhaust. The sky was clear with excellent visibility at the time of the observation.

5. The sighting was reported to the nearest Air Force Base, which was Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois. An investigation was initiated and the results forwarded to Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.
