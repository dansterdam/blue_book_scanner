AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (AGENCY) G-2, 2D Sq. ADM.
TO: COMMANDING GENERAL
SUBJECT: Unidentified aerial objects observed over Baltimore, Maryland on 6 August 1952
1. On 6 August 1952 a private and licensed flying club pilot observed 11 bright lights in a formation at about 8,000 feet above the grounds of the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. The objects were shiny silver in color and were traveling at approximately 500 mph. The formation broke up and the individual objects accelerated to an estimated speed of 2,000 mph and disappeared from view. 
2. The pilot who made this observation is a very experienced and reliable flyer. He has been flying light aircraft for over 10 years and has over 2,000 flying hours to his credit. He is considered to be a competent and trustworthy observer. 
3. Comparable visual observations were made by other witnesses in the area at the time. All descriptions were generally consistent.
4. Data obtained from the radar station at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport corroborated the visual sightings. Targets appeared on the radar screen at the time and location of the visual observations. The targets were tracked for a distance of 30 miles before fading from the radar.
5. This situation has no satisfactory conventional explanation. The performance characteristics of the objects observed, including the high rate of acceleration, were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.
6. Tentative conclusions: 
1) The observed objects were real and of unknown origin.
2) They possessed performance capabilities beyond the scope of present-day aircraft.
