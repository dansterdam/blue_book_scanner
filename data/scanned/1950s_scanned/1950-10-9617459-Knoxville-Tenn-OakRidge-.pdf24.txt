Troop:REMARKS:
On October 16, 1950, at approximately 2:55 P. M., Trooper stopped us at this installation and showed us an object in the north that was traveling toward the northeast. It looked to be about 2,000 feet in the air and a white-reddish looking color. This object was at a high altitude and seemed to come in sight and then disappear. It looked about the size of a ball and seemed to every angle as we looked at it.
