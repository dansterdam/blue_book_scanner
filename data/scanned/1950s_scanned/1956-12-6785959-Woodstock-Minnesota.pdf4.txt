(11) MAJOR, COMMANDER. THIS MAN CALLED ME BY PHONE AT 1330 HOURS, 15 DEC 56 AND GAVE THE FOREGOING ACCOUNT. THE ONLY POSSIBLE CONCLUSION THAT I COULD ARRIVE AT WAS THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOON. HOWEVER THE FARMER STATED HE COULD NOT SEE THE MOON AND THE SIZE WAS TOO BIG FOR THE MOON. I COULD NOT RENDER AN HONEST OPINION OF WHAT THE OBJECT MAY HAVE BEEN.
