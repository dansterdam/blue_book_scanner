Akron Speaker Says So
Flying Saucer Rays Bringing Down Planes?
By DON KIRKMAN
Those flying saucers are picking on us. Not only that, they don't like us a bit and are using an Eastern seaboard as targets for their ultra-sonic heat waves.
That's the story 200 Akronites heard Thursday night at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. An Akron speaker said that the saucers are dishing it out, high and low, with plenty of cold, flying identifiable white objects that may have a three-four inch speech on libelous language.
According to the director of the Akron electrical phenomena research institute, these high-powered heat waves, emanating from the saucers, could have been the cause of a blast from a saucer's "anti-gravity" motor.
The saucers are hostile!

HE CLAIMS the saucers have directed these invisible rays in both countries. These "sonic heat waves" that is, are bringing down planes, it is charged, in both countries.

This deadly weapon, he claims, is some diabolical electrical system in any machine or structure under control of flying saucer occupants for the purpose of navigation, communication and cargo planes.

It was also inferred that the intense vibrations of these "sick call" jumbo jets was caused by these mysterious invisible forces that "New York City's Building has been picketing."

The Air Force has spent $30,000,000 investigating them, he said, "and they don't say they're hoaxes, mirages and hallucinations."

"Airlines tell their pilots to keep their mouths shut and don't print or broadcast our facts Congress is investigating everything," he said. This, "because the investigating teams can't find the saucers."
