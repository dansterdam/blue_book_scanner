TO           ATIAS-2                     FROM ATIAS-5                  DATE 27 May 1953  COMMENT NO.1

1. Enclosed are two sightings of unidentified aerial objects which Project Blue Book requests you review for a possible explanation.

2. The first, 13 Feb 52, Granite City, Illinois, concerns a seemingly conventional target painted by an automatic tracking device which eventually reaches the maximum instrumental speed of 1050 mph. In this instance there is some confusion as to whether or not a temperature inversion layer was requested but unfortunately no information on this was obtained.

3. The second sighting took place at Cariswell AFB on 13 Feb 53. Project Blue Book believes that the visual and radar sighting may be explained by a/c and ground clutter respectively, just happening to be co-incident.

4. As an item of general interest Blue Book would like to know if a moisture inversion can effect a radar as a temperature inversion often does.
