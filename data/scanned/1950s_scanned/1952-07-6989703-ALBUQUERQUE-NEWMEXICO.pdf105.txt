Station, Los Alamos, New Mexico, do report the following:
On July 29 at approximately 10 a.m., MST, I was down in the canyon.
As I was definitely make out any object other than a spot color, some clouded, I estimated this to be approximately 50 to 200 yards from me and at an elevation of approximately 150 to 200 feet. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and seemed to be dark grey or black in color. It was approximately the size of a small car. It was stationary for approximately 2 to 3 minutes and then started to move in a westerly direction at a very high rate of speed and disappeared behind the mountain.
The weather was clear and visibility was excellent. I could see distinctly for several miles. I did not hear any sound or see any smoke or vapor trail.
I have had considerable experience in observing aircraft and this was definitely not any type of aircraft or helicopter that I have ever seen. It is my considered opinion that this was a flying object of some kind and that I have never seen anything like it before.
In comparison to the size of the jet it was approximately the size of a small car. There were no appendages, wings, tail or protrusions that I could make out.
I would like to add that the jet which was moving observed shortly after the flying object was between 15,000 and 20,000 feet.
