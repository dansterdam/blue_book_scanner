ARE GIVING OUR DISCUSSIONS AND DRAFTING. WE SPENT ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR TALKING WITH THIS T..., WHOM AND WOMEN WHO THEM GAVE IN...AND THEY DECIDED WE HAD TIPPED THE ...LY ENOUGH. A QUICK CHECK WITH THE SOLDIER WHO WAS JUST COMPLETING HIS FIRST (AND LAST ASSUMED) FRAMING, AND IT REVEALED AN AMAZING SIMILARITY, EVEN TO THE PROPRTION IT HAD WORKED OUT FROM HOME..WE WENT TO THE PICTURE POINT BY POINT...(
ROAD SIGNS AND STORE FRONTS HAD BEEN CLEANED UP BY..ONLY. WHETHER OR NOT...IT'S ATTEMPTED TO GET TO LA INGS FROM THE WOMEN AND THEM I DON'T KNOW. CONSIDERING THE,..PERSON ON..., I DOUBT IT WAS DID.
I WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE AT THIS POINT THAT THESE SEVEN ADULTS HAD TOLD AN ALMOST PARALLEL STORIES, AND GIVEN ME ALMOST PARALLEL PICTURES, YET THESE OF ALMOST DAILY THE SIGHTING FOR WISCONSIN AND HAD NOT BEEN MOST REPORTED TO THE THAT DAY. IT WOULD BE I-POSSIBLE FOR THAT MANY PEOPLE TO GIVE ME TWO SEPARATE PICTURES THAT WOULD TALLY SO CLOSE WITHOUT FIRST TALKING TOGETHER AND DECIDING WHAT EACH FEATURE LOOKED LIKE. THIS WAS NOT AN INTERVIEW WHERE ONE WOULD LOOK AT THE OTHER AND SAY..."IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK IT LOOKED LIKE"...CH NO...ALL SEVEN WERE SURE OF WHAT THEY HAD SEEN...AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF...AND THE CLOSE DECISIONS..ONE WOULD DECIDEDLY THEY HAD BEEN..EVEN UNDER CLOSE CROSS-EXAMINATION. ( I USE THAT WORD LIGHTLY. MIND YOU) ( YOU COULDN'T EXACTLY SAY THAT.)THROUGHOUT THE WEEKS PERIOD I TRIED TO ASSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE ATTITUDE. I MADE A MENTAL NOTE NOT TO BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE, BUT TO REPORT THE INCIDENT AS IT WAS TOLD TO ME FROM THE FAMILY'S LIPS. ACTUALLY, I NEARLY BELIVED I WAS IN A UNIQUE POSITION, BECAUSE UNTIL THE TIME I REACHED THE STATION, I HAD NOT HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE INCIDENT, AND AFTER I HEARD THEM, I DECIDED TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND UNTIL I COULD TELL FOR MYSELF.
