This is number two tape of two tapes being made by
and addressed to the Director of Intelligence, U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C.

At the end of the previous tape I stated that I saved the government
about three million dollars while working R in the Guidance Law for Convair
Astronautics. I had mentioned some machines. For some two to three weeks
while this engineer was in from the West Coast, R the same night that
I was unable to get to work on these specific machines and exr every little
detail that could be dug up would get me shunned to exarcx one side so as
to speak I was thought of or arranged. Finally there was nothing else to be done
including sweeping the floor,and my leader couldn't very well refuse to take R

a crack inasmuch as he undoubtedly knew I couldn't find the trouble particularly
since a hkxx big genius engineer was there and he had already written it off as a
lost cause. Well having filled the capacity for a number of years to look at a system
and figure out the gyst and uh really ugh to uh keep uh oneself in a position uh
to see things in a fairly good perspective. In other words uh a man who is off on
a mountain or up in a plane can see the scenc pretty well. He is not engulfed
by the trees. So this is part of my philosophy in shooting trouble. Well having uh
uh familiarized myself with uh the particular machine uh I more than knew the guyat
of hxxx it and I might in less than two hours the trouble had been solved.
