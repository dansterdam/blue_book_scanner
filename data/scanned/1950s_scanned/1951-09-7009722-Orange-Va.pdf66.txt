Operations "Bends" was confirmed Monday by four additional persons who saw the same suspicious flight, racing through Lubbock skies Saturday night that was witnessed and previously reported by three members of the Texas Tech faculty.

The Techsans said they saw what appeared to be a group of objects in a semi-circular formation "like a string of beads" flying overhead at "incredible" speed.

Monday, four new witnesses said they saw the same thing at the same time - 8:10 p.m. Saturday. They were Mrs. Earl Medlock of 1912 Ave. N, Mrs. R. A. Rogers of 1916 Ave. N, and Mrs. F. A. Rogers of the same address, and Prof. Carl Heilinger, 2911 Eighth, associate professor of German.
