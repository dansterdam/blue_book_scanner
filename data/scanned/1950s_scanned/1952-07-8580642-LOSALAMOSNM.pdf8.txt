The image appears to be a black and white photograph of heavy cumulus clouds over mountains. The text at the top of the image describes the scene as "HEAVY CMA CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER THE MOUNTAINS TO THE WEST PD". There is no other text or identifying information visible in the image.

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:
