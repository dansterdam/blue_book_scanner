Case 204, Williamstown, Kentucky 11:30 p.m. August 30, 1956. Two civilians, South Williamstown, Kentucky Research Director saw a large brilliant ovoid object, suddenly zip from west to east across the horizon. "It was so low" the object appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length, looked "green and as large as a silver dollar" when the witness first sighted the object. The indistinguishable speed was so great that the true contours were not discernible, however, whiteness and a bright pulsation or glow were observed. Research Director was also viewing south about a half minute before he saw the same object, for about a second, the object appeared to be slanting in toward earth.
