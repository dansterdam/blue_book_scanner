the fringes of the objects were glowing and emitting a bluish-green light. The objects appeared to be within two ship lengths of one another and were moving in a north-easterly direction at a fairly high rate of speed. An extremely bright stationary light was observed near the center of the observation. After the objects passed out of sight, no visual or auditory effect was noted. The total time of observation was approximately a minute and a half.
