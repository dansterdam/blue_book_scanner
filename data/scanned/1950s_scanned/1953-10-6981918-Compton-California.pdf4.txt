October 24, 1953 - Concord, California
Today at about 11:42 AM we observed a phenomenon that we should very much like to have explained:
It was a clear, sunny day, and we spotted several hundred (one estimate says 2000) small, snow-white, gleaming objects, floating and tumbling along on the breeze. Some were as high as the sky, others just a few feet above the ground, and three settled in our garden, one about 4 feet by 3 feet, another about 10 feet by 3 or 4 feet, and the third quite small, about 1 or 2 feet. These looked like some sort of foam, almost like a dense cellulose that was shiny or waxy in appearance. They were very delicate, and began to disintegrate to the touch, and it became apparent that the substances completely disappeared, but we saw they were shiny white, consisting of tiny foamy cells.
While examining these, a huge mass of foam, some floating and tumbling about 20 feet up, suddenly began to disappear, and in a little while all had vanished.
