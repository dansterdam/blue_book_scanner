The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

Current Confidential Iranian
APL 200-2, 79ARMA, Tehran, M-263-52, M-278-52, R-571-52

The reports transmitted herewith, in accordance with APL 200-2, dated 23 April, 1952, concerning reports on unidentified flying objects, are forwarded for your information and such action as may be deemed appropriate.
The measures of 7, 9, 12 and 9 Apr this office's transaction of the Persian documents and their text are apparently a fable. 

For the most part, these reports are discounted by the Asst. Chief of Staff. Probably a consequence of their incompetence and their reports probably exaggerated. In spite of this they all have some basis of validity, however disturbed and imaginative, which constitutes the unidentified observer to build up a story about what he saw.

Inspect as possible, this officer is complying with the directives of APL 200-2. Paragraph 7 even directs separate reports for single incidents which is inspected in this particular case.
