Mr. [Redacted]
Terre Haute, Indiana

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

The object which you describe was apparently traveling at an angular velocity much that of its apparent which was about 1 mile per second at a height of 120,000 feet or perhaps 120,000 miles per hour at a height of 120,000 feet or 28 miles, which is a reasonable height for a meteor.

As a satellite on the other hand at this height would be moving only about 15,000 miles per hour, the same would be true for objects of the type which you described.

If it were a meteor, then it is interesting that you should have heard a noise. Ordinarily, noises could not be propagated to distances such as 24 miles at an altitude of 120,000 feet, and a meteor should have been a silent one. 

On the other hand, objects of the type which you seem to be describing, occasionally described as "like that of crying" have been reported previously, see for example Minirriger's book "Out of the Sky's Peace 52." If you observed the object overhead, it might be worthwhile recording--perhaps by a brief letter to some journal.

Sincerely yours,

John A. O'Keefe
Assistant Chief
Theoretical Division
