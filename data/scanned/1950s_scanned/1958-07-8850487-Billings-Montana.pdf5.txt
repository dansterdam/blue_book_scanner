The image contains a photograph showing a particular cloud, often mistaken for a flying saucer. The text describes this cloud as a lenticular cloud, which is a layer of air close to the Earth's surface that acts as a lens to bring a distant light source into focus. The text explains that this lens-like effect can make distant objects appear distorted, leading some people to see "weird things" like flying saucers. The text promises to discuss this phenomenon in more detail in a later chapter.

The text as transcribed from the document is as follows:

People have frequently mistaken what is something real, not a hallucination like a pink elephant. Nor is it an optical illusion. Light may depart appreciably from its nearly straight-line path when exceptional temperature conditions occur in the lower atmosphere, as, for example, when an intensely hot or extremely cold layer of air overlies a colder or warmer stratum. 

Fig. 2. A lenticular cloud, often mistaken for a flying saucer. The air acts as a sort of lens to bring a distant light source into focus. The lens is imperfect, so that the world seen through it is a little distorted, looking strange, like someone's spectacles. No wonder one sees weird things - even flying saucers. This brief description of a mirage will have to serve until we consider the question in more detail, in a later chapter.
