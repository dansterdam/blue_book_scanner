Tunis, Libya
11 February 1953

I. Description of Incident
An unidentified object was observed by the crew of a C-119 aircraft while enroute to Tripoli from Tunis. The object appeared very bright with a halo of diffused light. It was observed at 17,000 feet on a 170Â° heading making I.A.S. of 170 knots. Length of sighting varied from 5 to 55 minutes. Several members of the crew some of whom stated that it appeared to ascend and then descend slowly.

II. Discussion of Incident
Four out of the five crew stated that, in their opinion, the object was not a star, whereas the remaining observers would not commit themselves on a conclusion. Since the sighting seemed to be astronomical in nature, Project Blue Book submitted it to its contract astrophysicist, standard operating procedures in such cases. It was determined that the object was probably responsible for the sighting, and under fair weather conditions would appear very bright. The fact that it remained almost stationary and was observed for a long period of time would support this conclusion.

III. Conclusion
Probably Venus.
