REPORT OF AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT
BROWNWOOD, TEXAS
APRIL 6, 1952
As it was reported to me over the telephone on April 6, 1952, by Captain John T. Fitzpatrick, Air Force Communications, the following incident occurred:
At approximately 2130 hrs, April 5, 1952, a crew of 3 on board a C-47 aircraft (serial number 43-49241) enroute from Dyess AFB, Texas, to Ft Worth, Texas, observed a brilliant light in the sky, seemingly much brighter than the rest of the stars. The light was first observed at approximately 15 miles east of Brownwood, Texas, and continued to be observed until the aircraft was approximately at Brownwood. The light appeared to be stationary. The pilot headed the aircraft in a southeasterly direction to get a closer observation of the light and from the Brownwood area the light still appeared to be stationary. The pilot then climbed the aircraft to 8,000 feet, circled the area several times, and still the light remained stationary. The pilot reported the light remained visible for approximately 30 minutes. After 30 minutes the light diminished in intensity and appeared to fade out gradually. No further observation of the light was made. The crew consisted of the pilot, co-pilot, and flight engineer.
No further details at this time.
