REPORT OF SIGHTING OF STRANGE AND UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS IN C. R. ALLEN, ACCAP, NEAR VICINITY OF LAKE DEMP ON 7 APRIL 1954.

TIME: Approximately 1900, 7 April 1954.

LOCATION: Objects were sighted over Lake Demp, near ACCAP, while engaged in flying an air mission.

NARRATIVE: At approximately 1900, 7 April 1954, while engaged in flying an air mission, the pilot and observers saw 10 to 15 unidentified objects over Lake Demp, near ACCAP. The objects were sighted at an altitude of approximately 3500 feet. 

The objects were disk-shaped, pale green in color, and were moving in a southwesterly direction at a speed estimated to be approximately 600 to 800 knots. The objects were observed for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. They were seen to climb to a higher altitude and then disappear over the horizon.

The pilot and observers stated that the objects did not resemble any known aircraft. The outline of the objects was clearly defined, and they appeared to be operating in a formation. The pilot stated that the color and general configuration were similar to that of the objects reported in the Norfolk, Virginia area on the night of 6 April 1954.

The pilot and observers felt that the objects were not of this world and could not be identified as any known aircraft. The cloud base at the time was 3500 to 4000 feet.
