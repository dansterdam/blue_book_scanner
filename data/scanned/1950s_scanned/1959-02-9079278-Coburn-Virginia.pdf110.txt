The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document discussing the possible varieties of "angel hair" that were observed during March and April 1959 near Coburn, Virginia. According to the text, the Air Force received multiple reports that flying saucers were cruising over the mountains near Coburn, and they regularly used a landing strip on an inaccessible peak of Sheep Rock Mountain. The investigating officers examined some of the material and identified it as a type of "window", which refers to long strips of aluminum foil used by the military in World War II to produce spurious radar echoes and confuse enemy anti-aircraft fire.

The text of the document is as follows:

The possible varieties of angel hair increase with the development of new technologies. During March and April 1959, the Air Force received many reports that flying saucers were cruising over the mountains near Coburn, Virginia, regularly used a landing strip on an inaccessible peak of Sheep Rock Mountain, and frequently dropped angel hair on the nearby countryside. The investigating officers examined some of the material and identified it as a type of "window," the rolls or long strips of aluminum foil used by the military in World War II to produce spurious radar echoes and confuse enemy anti-aircraft fire. The Coburn angel hair was identified with the fall used by Air Force planes carrying out experiments in the area. "Window" falls very slowly, dropped from heights up to 30,000 feet. It may easily be visible for some time to ground observers, as well as interfere with local radar reception (io).
