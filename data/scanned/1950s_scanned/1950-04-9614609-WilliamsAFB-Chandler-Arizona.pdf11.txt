Evaluation of Source Reliability: AIR FORCE COMMAND OPINION

Analysis and Conclusions:
THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A CAREFULLY OBSERVED PROBABLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE RELIABILITY OF THIS WITNESS. MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS BEING A GENUINE EXAMPLE OF A DISC TYPE CRAFT. THE OBSERVERS SOUND AS THOUGH THEY WERE INTERESTED IN AND FAMILIAR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF COMMON AERIAL OBJECTS. HOWEVER, THEIR DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT SEEMS TO BE JUST AN ORDINARY WANING DISC TYPE WHICH IS OBSERVABLE IN DAYLIGHT. THE MEANS OF THESE OBJECTS IS STILL OBSCURT AND DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION CAN NOT BE REACHED AT THE PRESENT TIME.
