AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
APO 239 
15-20th AIR FORCE

On 4 June 1953, while on a routine night patrol over Kadena AFB, Okinawa, the pilot of a F-94 jet aircraft sighted a strange object in the sky. The object was first observed at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet and was estimated to be about one-half the size of the moon. The object was described as luminous, changing color, and moving at a very high rate of speed. The object was observed for about 30 seconds before it disappeared.

Although the first sighting of the unidentified object was around 1900 hours local time, no reliable information as to the exact location and exact time of the sighting could be obtained. The pilot reported the object as definitely real and observed the object both visually and by radar. Many details were lacking, however, such as the exact location, exact time, and direction of movement of the object.

The weather at the time of the sighting was as follows: Cloud cover at 6500 feet, surface wind 15 knots. Visibility was excellent.

ALL OTHER OBSERVERS were either Japanese or Okinawan weather observers with no specialized training in identification of aviation objects. Their estimated probability of reliability was low.

The characteristics estimated of the object were: Height about 20,000' and Speed about 800-1000 mph. The object was observed to change colors, such as from red to white, and blinking at the same time. It was estimated that the size of the object was about one-half that of the moon. No sound was heard.

The weather at the time of the sighting was as follows: Clouds at 6500 feet, surface wind 15 knots, and visibility excellent.
