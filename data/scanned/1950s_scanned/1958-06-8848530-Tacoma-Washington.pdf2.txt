The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved line to show how high the observed object was above the horizon when it was first seen. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road in a rural area, with two inset sketches - one showing a partially obscured object in the sky, and the other showing a view of the horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
