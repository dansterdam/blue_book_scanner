The text in the document is as follows:

"There is good reason to believe that a dark cloud or spherical shape ascended rapidly from the ground at the sighting location. Whether it was a solid, disc-shaped object or merely an atmospheric phenomenon is not certain from those observations which were made at the time. The reference to 'picking up to 3 to 5 unidentified objects' at the peak intensity of 10:25 PM indicates that these objects, whatever their nature, were displaying unusual motion and speed. It is also possible that more complete information research and analysis might lead to a more definitive conclusion as to the exact nature of the phenomena observed on that occasion."
