The witness Mrs. D. W. Henderson, 52 Yucca Drier, Banning, California, states as follows:
On July 25, 1956, at approximately 8:30 PM, she and her husband observed a strange object in the sky. Mrs. Henderson describes the object as being round and bright, with lights that appeared to be flashing. She states that at one point the object appeared to hover over their house. Mrs. Henderson indicates that the object was making no sound, and that it hovered at an altitude of approximately 1500 feet. She reports that the object then moved off in a rapid, straight-line motion.
From her written statement, Mrs. Henderson appears to be a credible and reliable witness. No further physical evidence or corroborating witnesses could be reached to establish this sighting. However, the witness appears sincere in her report of the strange aerial phenomenon observed.
