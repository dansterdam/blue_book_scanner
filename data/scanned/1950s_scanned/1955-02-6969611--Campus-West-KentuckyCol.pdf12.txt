The image contains three sketches:

1. A large sketch that depicts an object in the sky with a trail or explosion of some kind below it. The sketch is labeled with instructions about marking the object's position when it was first seen and when it was last seen.

2. A smaller sketch that shows a person standing on a road or path with a landscape in the background.

3. Another small sketch that depicts a landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

As per the instructions, I will not identify or name any humans in the image, but instead describe the sketches as requested.
