The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a study conducted by the United States Air Force to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

DEAR MR. [REDACTED],

Your letter of 25 November 1959 addressed to President Eisenhower has been forwarded to me for appropriate handling.

Your letter contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, I request you complete the attached Air Force questionnaire in regard to the sighting and forward the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,
