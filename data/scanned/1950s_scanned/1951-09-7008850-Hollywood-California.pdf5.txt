The Moon, in Scorpio 23.5d., was the only planet elevated above the horizon and visible. It was posited in the ninth division, about halfway between the seventh angle (western horizon) and the Meridian (tenth angle). If the space voyagers were observing this planet we live on, they were certainly afforded a perfect view. If they launched smaller crafts, those they were too enormous to land on the Moon, at such a distance I would not be able to /anything as small as one of our aeroplanes, for example. It is a rational supposition that those were two mother-ships, landed with smaller landing crafts. Why should they not explore the Earth satellites? Surely, the Martians are doing nothing about the Moon. Here we have been doing our satellite, around day in and day out, year in and year out, for ages, and we have not even taken the trouble to find out what we have been dragging around.

It is my theory that the farther away the planet is from the Sun, the greater is the burden or necessity under which those planets must vegetate. The nearer to the Sun, and put little light; enough necessity to make them very skillful, deliberate, inventive and very much on the ball all the time to continue to exist.

One thing is certain; there are those on either Saturn, Neptune, or Uranus who are very curious about us and our little moons in clouding may I say, I hope we will not some day, wake to find our Moon taken away. It could be done, you know. Moons are valuable reflectors of light to planets far from the Sun.
