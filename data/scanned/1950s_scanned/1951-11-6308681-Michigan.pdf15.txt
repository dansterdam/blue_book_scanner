the altitude (i.e. apprarni low), it is apparent that the object must have been a comparatively small distance from all the observers. The fact that the observers did not mention any definite silhouette or outline of the object tends to be explained by the fact that they were blinded by the intense light, and could not see the object distinctly.

The observed flight of the object was probably high over Ontario, Canada. It would probably be possible to determine the exact location, by checking the records of the Royal Canadian Air Force and the weather station that day.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
It is concluded that the object observed in Southern Michigan on 24 November 1951 was a large, incandescent object that probably passed over Ontario, Canada, but was seen by observers in several cities in Michigan or near the border.
