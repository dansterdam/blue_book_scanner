Columbus, Ohio - 22 December 1951

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 22 December 1951 at 1030 EST, the pilot of an F-84 aircraft observed an unidentified object near Columbus, Ohio. The F-84 was flying at 15,000 ft. altitude on a heading of 270°. The object was first sighted at two o'clock high. It appeared to be rolling on its longitudinal axis and emitted a glowing red shape resembled an aircraft with no tail surfaces. It was on a heading of about 300°.

The pilot observed the object for one and one half minutes during which he made a right turn in an attempt to identify the object. It was lost when the pilot turned into the sun to follow the object.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
The pilot of the F-84 aircraft was identified by Project personnel. The facts were written out. The pilot stated he could not identify the object. The pilot is not available for further interrogation. The wind was 30 knots from 270° which would place the balloon in the general area of the sighting. The pilot's opinion is that it was probably a balloon about 1000 to 1500 feet in diameter.

III. CONCLUSIONS
The F-84 possesses a high speed which would allow it to close on a slow moving object like a balloon. The reported actions of the object cannot be explained satisfactorily. The pilots have indicated that a balloon can be very deceptive when viewed from a high speed aircraft.
