AIR DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONES (ADIZ)

In the United States several areas have been designated as Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ) by the Administrator of Civil Aeronautics in the interest of national security. All aircraft entering the Air Defense Identification Zones are required to file flight plans, except aircraft entering from within the Continental Limits of the United States or operating within the Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Knoxville, Great Falls, Minneapolis, Traverse City, and Bangor Zones, at altitudes of less than 4000 feet above the immediate terrain. Any person who knowingly or willfully fails to do so is subject to penalties of one year in prison or $10,000 fine. The Air Defense Identification Zones are identified as follows: Seattle ADIZ, San Francisco ADIZ, Los Angeles ADIZ, Atlantic ADIZ, Pacific ADIZ, Albuquerque ADIZ, Knoxville ADIZ, Great Falls ADIZ, Minneapolis ADIZ, Traverse City ADIZ, Bangor ADIZ, Mexican Boundary ADIZ, and Canadian Boundary ADIZ. These areas are indicated on the face of Aeronautical Charts and are so labeled. For additional information see Civil Air Regulations Part 620.
