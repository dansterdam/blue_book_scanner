STATEMENT OF

At approximately 0335 hours, 13 January 1953, witness observed an aircraft at an altitude of about 2,000 feet descending at an angle of 30 to 45 degrees. The aircraft was moving in a west-northwesterly direction and was observed for about two (2) minutes. The aircraft did not have any lights and appeared to be circular in shape. It seemed to reflect a bright silvery glow, as if illuminated. The witness observed the object as it descended and noted that it made no sound. The witness further stated that just before it disappeared from view, the object seemed to rise quickly and disappear. The witness also stated that he had a rather unnerving feeling while observing the object. No more details regarding the sighting were furnished.
