I. Plane Spotter Sees Circling Objects Drop "Flimsy Material"

This sighting took place on Tuesday, Sept. 10, in Pleasant Valley, N.Y. (on the upper Delaware River). A local plane spotter, a self-employed builder, saw three objects circling silently in a clear sky, "near military planes". The objects appeared to be of human size and were non-rigid or filmy. He tried to judge how far up they were, but they were certainly not high-flying jets. It looked to me as though they were flirting faster than any jet I ever saw--at least 2000 miles per hour.

What makes this observation noteworthy is that "he reported also that strings of shiny material dropped from the mystery craft and drifted southward." (Source: Danbury (Conn.) News-Times, Sept. 13, 1957.)
