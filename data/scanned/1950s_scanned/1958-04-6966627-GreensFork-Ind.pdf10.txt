Dear Mr. Strahl:

Thanks so much for your letter of Mar. 28, 58. 

Am very sorry that there isn't more metal in the thing for you. Am glad to say that I have a very high material content, that I have so far found. I do not have any further need for the chunk and therefore do not think of returning it.

Thanks again for the communication.

Sincerely,
