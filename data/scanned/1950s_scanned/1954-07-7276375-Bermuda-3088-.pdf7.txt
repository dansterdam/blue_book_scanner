The image contains two photographs that appear to be from radar or tracking equipment. The top photograph shows a circular display with several shapes or objects visible, while the bottom photograph shows a similar display with a single object or shape. The text at the bottom of each image indicates the image labels or identifiers "E 652" and "E 509".

As an OCR system, I will now extract all the textual content from the document:

E 652
E 509
