and in many cases more than one sighting is included in the folder, more time was required for coding these reports than for earlier ones. 
Because sighting reports accumulated at a rapid rate in May, June, and July, 1952, and in general were more detailed than earlier reports, it is estimated that it will require until the latter part of November, 1952, to complete processing and evaluation of these reports for IBM analysis.

MISCELLANEOUS SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS

The panel of consultants was utilized during the month to advantage on the following topics:

Analysis of Film

Two rolls of 35-mm spectrographic film and a section of gun-camera spectrographic film, furnished by the Air Force for analysis, were examined by experts on spectroscopy. After examination of the film, it was found impractical to proceed further with the analysis without more data. Although it would be possible by indirect methods to arrive at limited conclusions regarding the sources of light that were photographed, the expense would be prohibitive. Further data needed for analysis of film should be derived from controlled experiments using known sources of light, and from information on the following factors:
1. Type of camera
2. Shutter speed
