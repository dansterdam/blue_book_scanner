FATE
As things stood, Mr. Puskas used 
not have worried. Both pilot and 
copilot and 34 other passengers 
confirmed the story.
The way Captain Killian broke 
it to them was very clever.
"No one panicked or showed any signs of worry. Every - one immediately began to show a
keen interest in what was going on," he said.
"There wasn't a cloud in the sky 
when I looked out and saw the ob - jects in precision formation. They 
were round-like and every now and then one would slow down to let 
the others catch up as if it had moved near
er to the plane.
"We have been making that same
trip a number of times because the line office is in that locality, but we have never experienced anything
like that before."
WHEN Killian first sighted the
objects the sky was absolutely 
clear. Visibility was about 100
miles. There were broken clouds
below his altitude of about 5.500
feet but the sky above was clear.
"The objects were not over a mile above us," he said. "But since I didn't
know their size this was just an impres- sion. Later on I concluded 
that they were enormous, however, at intervals one would move
in closer then fall back into forma-
tion."
