C'A VASSAR MISSOURI - -

URES THAT ON 29 MAR 55 APPROX 2050 LOCI STATION HEARD NUMEROUS FREAK RADIO SIGNALS WHICH HE BELIEVED WERE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFOS) AND SOME OTHER SOURCE. HE RECORDED PORTIONS OF THESE SIGNALS ON TAPE AND IS FORWARDING SAME TO THIS OFFICE FOR EVALUATION. HE STATES THAT THE SIGNALS CONSISTED OF A SERIES OF DOTS AND DASHES (MORSE CODE TYPE). THE PATTERN VARIED CONSIDERABLY AND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE RANDOM TRANSMISSIONS. HE ALSO STATES THAT THERE WERE INDICATIONS OF A NUMBER OF UFOS MANEUVERING IN THE SKY AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTINGS. THE SIGNALS WERE PICKED UP ON A STANDARD BC RECEIVER AND HE CLAIMS THEY WERE COMPLETELY UNAFFECTED BY ANY STATIC OR OTHER DISTURBANCE. THIS EFFECT IS STRANGE CONSIDERING THE VAGARIES OF RADIO WAVE PROPAGATION AT NIGHT. FURTHER DETAILS WILL BE FURNISHED UPON RECEIPT OF THE TAPE RECORDING.
