Dear Sirs 
I have just finished reading the book "Flying Saucers" on page 298 it is a report on the UFO's. 
About 2 years ago me and my friends spotted a UFO 2 miles west of new holland it happened 2 sometime that summer. we called the police (caument) but they did nothing about it. i than called major field in dayton with our report but they did nothing about it either. then the UFO took off like a shot. this is also a report on it in the new Holstein reporter on the U.P.O. 
could you let me know just what is done about these reports. thank you for your kind help and cooperation. 
I am now in the u.s. navy in the med. my address is:
