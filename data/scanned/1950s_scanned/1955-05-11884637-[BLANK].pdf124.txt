The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program to investigate UFO sightings.

The text on the page discusses the procedures and criteria used in the identification and evaluation of UFO sightings. It mentions that the "Certain" identification indicated a minimum amount of doubt regarding the validity of the evaluation, and that a "Doubtful" identification indicated that the choice was less positive, but that there was a better than even chance of being correct.

The text also discusses the importance of collaboration and consistency among the panel of consultants in making the identifications, as well as the procedures followed in making the final identifications, which involved statistical treatment and a conference of four qualified persons.

The text also mentions that during the identification conferences, each sighting report was first studied by one person, and if the two identifications were the same, the report was appropriately marked and considered finished. If the two identifications did not agree, the report was considered later by everyone participating in the conference until a group decision could be made.
