REPLY TO
ATTN OF: AFCIN-W/E4

SUBJECT: UFO Program

TO: AFCIN-4 (Colonel John G. Eriksen)

THRU: AFCIN-4E

1. The Problem Area

a. All of the problems associated with the Air Force’s UFO Program seem centered around the ‘reaction capability’ (reporting and investigation). There is a need to increase the speed of processing reports and of initiating investigations and to improve the quality of both.

2. Discussion

a. The 1006th AISS which, outside of the ATIC, is probably the most logical and qualified organization to perform the investigation function is approximately 33% under T/O strength. The squadron is presently undergoing reorganization in order to perform a new mission of such high priority that consideration is being given to deleting the mission for which the 1006th was originally organized from the new charter. The UFO investigation mission was not included in the original charter and there are no plans to include it in the new one.

b. In order to carry out this new mission, it will be necessary to have more than 50% of the squadron personnel physically located at the squadron headquarters at Ft Belvoir, Va. There are no plans to reduce the number of detachments below the present ten, but to reduce the number of officers and airmen assigned by approximately 50%, therefore limiting still further the personnel available for field investigations.

c. Colonel Goforth of AFCIN-1Al informed Major Friend of AFCIN-4/E4 that if ATIC would provide the personnel the 1006th AISS would be happy to house, feed, and administer them in support of the UFO Program.
