Dear Mrs. [redacted],
This is to acknowledge your letter postmarked 23 January 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object sighted by you in August 1955.
It is, of course, difficult to properly investigate or analyze an incident seven years old. However, your reported sighting will be added to our files.
Thank you for your interest in this matter.
Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
