At approx. 2115, I was on my way to the 
N.C.O. club, when I spotted a red light in the 
sky. Its position was approx. North by north 
West When I got there, I called some of my friends 
outside to see it. They all said they saw it, 
some said it was moving slitaly from side to side, 
other said it was moving away. It changed 
colors in this order, Red, Blue and white, Itâ€™s 
predominate color was Red. At approx 2130 it 
was getting real small, seemed to be moving 
away. At 2135 it was gone, it having drop 
some distance in the horizon.
