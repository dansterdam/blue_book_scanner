          MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: There have been many radar
reports giving speed.

          THE PRESS: What did they range from, sir?

          MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: They run from zero to
fantastic speeds.

          THE PRESS: General, how do you explain this case,
now?  The CAA, as I understand the story, after picking up
these objects on the radar, also got this Capital Airlines
pilot named Pierrnan on their radar as he was going out west

blip, one of the unidentified blips, appeared anywhere near
Pierrnan's plane, he would call Pierrnan on the radio and say,

to Barnes.

          THE PRESS: Yes. Many of them didn't see them, but
then some did.

          MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I can't explain that.

          THE PRESS: Well, how do you explain this directing?
Is that autosuggestion or --

          MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I can't explain it at all.
I think maybe --

          THE PRESS: Have you investigated that phase of
this thing, this vectoring the planes into that?
