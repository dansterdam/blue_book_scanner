The image does not contain any photographs. It contains two sketches or illustrations.

The first sketch shows a curved line with the text "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it."

The second sketch is a larger one that shows multiple views or sketches. The main one appears to show a person standing on a road or path with buildings or structures in the background. There is a smaller sketch in the top right corner that shows a similar view but from a different perspective.

Transcribing the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
