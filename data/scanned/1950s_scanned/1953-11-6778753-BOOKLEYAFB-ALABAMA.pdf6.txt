HYDROGRAPHIC BULLETIN  

METEORS  
The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying  
meteors. Mariners reporting the observations of these bodies are greatly  
assisting in this work. It is desired to have the Greenwich time and point of  
appearance and disappearance as accurate as possible, either by bearing and  
altitude, or by relation of fixed stars, or both.  
Complete observations on long-enduring trains and their direction of drift  
are of especial importance, as they determine wind directions in the upper  
atmosphere.  

       — NORTH PACIFIC  

Second Officer C. A. Oliver of the American SS. Hawaiian  
Refiner, Capt. H. O. Matthiesen, Master, reports that at 1512  
G. M. T. November 29, 1953, a large meteor was observed which  
appeared at an altitude of 20° bearing 290°. The meteor, which  
was greenish in color and a little larger than Jupiter, moved  
slowly from west to north in a slight downward direction and  
then became brighter, breaking in two, the smaller portion falling  
rapidly. The phenomenon was visible for approximately 7  
seconds.  

Weather clear, wind northerly force I, barometer 30.34 inches,  
air temperature 66° F., wet bulb 63° F.
