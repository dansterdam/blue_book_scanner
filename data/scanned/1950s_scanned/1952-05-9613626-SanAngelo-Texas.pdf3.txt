While flying southwest of San Angelo at 20:05C 19 May 1952 at 18,000 seven bright lights appeared in the west in trail.* The height and distance could not be determined. The lights appeared to be circular for about 30 minutes and then seemed to spread or trail out like a vapor trail. It appeared from the beginning as if it could have been small cloud or vapor formations with the setting sun reflecting off a lower deck cloud formation or haze layer. They were visible until dark. As we flew along we did not seem to get closer.
I reported this to the San Angelo Radio and the operator observed this incident from the ground.
