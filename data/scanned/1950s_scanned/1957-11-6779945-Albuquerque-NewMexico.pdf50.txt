The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was the United States Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

Near Knoxville, Tennessee, early on the morning of November 6th, 12-year-old Everett Clark said two men and some women, apparently dressed, "like German soldiers in war movies," emerged from a grounded cigar-shaped object and tried to get back in with his dog. This imprint in the grassy field where the object had rested was found by Knoxville reporters. The boy maintained that what he discovered was as new to him as it was to the reporters.

Curiously enough, the Tennessee report from the schoolboy Everett Clark (page 4) resembles Schmidt's story in several important respects, but as far as we know, the Clark report proved no official investigation at all. We have asked our Knoxville member, James LeaClair, to find out more about this case if possible.
