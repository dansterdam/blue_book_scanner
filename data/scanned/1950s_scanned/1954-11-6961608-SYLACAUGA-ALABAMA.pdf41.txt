This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text of the document is as follows:

On 7 December 1954, ATIC-5 was visited by Dr. Taylor and Mr. Castillo from the G & H Laboratory, WADC. They visually examined the meteorite and agreed with Dr. Johnson's original conclusion. Mr. Castillo stated he has been monitoring effects of ionospheric propagation on HF radio signals through an oscilloscope for the past two years. He has been especially interested in the returns he has been receiving from meteorite trails. He continued that during the month of November, 1954, there had been a mark increase in the meteorite activity. The attached photograph is one that he obtained on the night of 21 Oct 1954 which vividly depicts a fair size return of a meteorite trail. Mr. Castillo operates station W1Y in Springfield, Ohio. He concluded that during the week of the Alabama incident, he received unusual amounts of meteorite returns on his graph.

One set of the meteorite photographs were given to Dr. Taylor upon his request.
