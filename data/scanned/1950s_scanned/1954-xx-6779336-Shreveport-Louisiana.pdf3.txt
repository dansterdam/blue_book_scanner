There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. The image contains a text letter discussing the lack of supporting information for a reported UFO sighting and the difficulty in properly evaluating the sighting.

SAFTS-3/Jma/Tacker/3ma/7/9/56

27 February 1959

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of 29 January 1959 concerning unidentified flying objects which you photographed on 12-21-1956. The long time interval since the sighting, the lack of supporting information, and the poor quality of the photographs make it most difficult to properly evaluate this sighting.

Moreover, the objects appear to be birds in the air, probably waterfowl. Also, the cloudy condition of the sky may have limited visibility from a ground observer's position, possibly from a forest fire or brush fire.

We are returning the photographs with you, the latest report on unidentified aerial phenomena dated 5 November 1957.

Sincerely,

LAVAL R. TURNER
