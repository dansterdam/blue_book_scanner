RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL

SAUCER OVER RIO DE JANEIRO ON AUGUST 22, 1957:

According to reports received by the D.N.P.A.E.E. (National Department of Aerial Exploration) and another clipping. This time at about 14:35 on 22 August 1957, a strange object was sighted over a great altitude over the Guanabara Bay, by a considerable crowd that looked up and observed it remain stationary for about 10 minutes, and then move away rapidly in a southerly direction. 

The object as described by a passenger looked like a round bath tub or a ball, transparent like of glass or luminous metal (sic). Passengers reckoned the thing to be really 15 times as great as a normal civil airliner. It was circled by 2 or 3 other objects which then the body would be 20 feet wide or more. 

Also in Palo XV people crowded in the pier to watch the same object. Saucers sightings occur frequently in Pao Brazil. The object moved very slowly at first, then increased its altitude and disappeared.
