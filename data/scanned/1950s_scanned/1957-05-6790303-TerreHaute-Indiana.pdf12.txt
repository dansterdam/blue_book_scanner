FIREBALL OF 1957 MAY 1/2

On this date a bright fireball was seen at 10:41 p.m., EST, and reported from St. Mary's, Ohio. This was subsequently confirmed by Ohio State University Observatory, and the Ohio State Police in Columbus, who reported that three reports were quite complete. The observers, being in order, K.L. ("Observer on whose report the calculations were made"), Crouch, Prof. of Astronomy, Ohio State University, and Ohio State Police. The message further stated that this fireball was observed from points in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, and was unusually bright, with a duration of 5-6 seconds. The object left a long-lasting trail.

The calculated data follows:
BEGIN OVER
Began over
Radiant R.A.
Radiant Dec.
Projected length of path
Duration
Velocity (calculated from projected length and duration)
Velocity (corrected for altitude)

= 73 24'; DEC = 55 54' at 132 km
= 105 km
= 197 km
= 5 secs (probably less)
= 40 km/sec (probably high)
= 37 km/sec at 83 km

The object is believed to be considerably faster than the heights of 83-132 km would indicate, the attitudes observed being 83-132 km. We are under many obligations to the three observers who reports made the observations possible. Fireball No. 15 in the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Meteor Catalogue, even 1956 Aug. 8.
