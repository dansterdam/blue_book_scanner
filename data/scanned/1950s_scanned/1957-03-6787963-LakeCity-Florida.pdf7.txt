Qb I see it is flying by this is the seco.,d time we ever seen anything like that, he said.

It rapidly rose almos=t perpendicular.

As it appeared came down again on the same track or course,
about 1 minute to a minute and a half in duration.

When i saw it again it seemed to be stationary for the night
i saw that i estimated to go about 1000 miles per hour

Typical.
