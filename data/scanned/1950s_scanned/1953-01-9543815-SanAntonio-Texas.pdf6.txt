Text extracted from the document:

AT APPROXIMATELY 0935 CST 12 JANUARY 1953, AT SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, TWO LUMINOUS ELLIPTICAL OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED. THEY APPEARED TO BE ABOUT AS LARGE AS A DIME HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH, AND WERE MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER, AND THEIR DISAPPEARANCE WAS GRADUAL. ONE OF THE OBJECTS SEEMED TO BECOME SMALLER DURING ITS FLIGHT.

A VISUAL SURFACE OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY THE TWO MEN WHO FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECTS. IT IS REPORTED THAT THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING ABOUT TWICE AS FAST AS A FAST JET AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECTS WERE GOING IN A STRAIGHT AWAY FROM THEM IN A NORTHEASTERN DIRECTION AT A CONSTANT ALTITUDE. THE OBJECTS THEN FADED AWAY.

IT IS THE OPINION OF THE OBSERVERS THAT THE SKY WAS CLEAR, AND A VISUAL HORIZON WAS ESTABLISHED, WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPLAINED THE OBJECTS TO THE LAYMEN.

THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THE SIGHTING, NOR WAS ANY INTERCEPTION OR IDENTIFICATION ATTEMPTED.

CAPTAIN ___ IS THE CHIEF INVESTIGATOR FOR THE AIR POLICE OFFICER, AND CAPTAIN ___ IS THE INSPECTOR FOR THAT OFFICER. THEIR INVESTIGATION WAS GUIDED BY THEIR REALIZATION THAT ACCURATE OBSERVATION IS A PART OF THEIR EVERYDAY JOB, SINCE THEY MUST EVALUATE SIMILAR REPORTS IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR DUTIES. THE INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED CONFORMS WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES.
