1. On 29 February 1960, Mrs wrote to ATIC requesting the return of a colored sketch of an unidentified flying object. Mrs wrote the sketch to the Air Force as a part of a report made by her on 10 November 1959.

2. The objects sighted by Mrs in November 59 were probably birds, but the information provided ATIC was not sufficient to make a conclusive evaluation.
