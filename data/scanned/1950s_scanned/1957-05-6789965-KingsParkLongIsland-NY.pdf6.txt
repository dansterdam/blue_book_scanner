Dear Sir:

On May 24th at 10:38 A.M. while working on a high tension line located on Old Northport Rd., Kings Park, I saw an object in the sky over- head which at first I thought to be a Jet Aircraft. After studying the object for a few moments I discovered that it had no wings or tail assembly. I was also impressed by the slowness with. which it tr. . . . led through the sky.


I shouted up to the lineman on the pole to take a look at the object, after a few moments, he located it and I asked him if he could see any wings or tail assembly , his reply was negative. We both watched the object for about a minute and a half , during this time it passed through an angle of 45 degrees. During the last ten seconds of viewing it seemed to be getting smaller and finally disappeared as if it had suddenly gained altitude.

The object was about an inch long with a dimeter of one fourth the length, it was going from north to south and it left no exhaust or vapor trail. About 11 A.M. a box car flew by in the same general area and at 11:20 A.M. a jet flew almost the same course but in the opposite direction.
The other man who saw this object i s          Greenlawn.     
Very              youe
