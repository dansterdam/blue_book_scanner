The image appears to be a vertical chart or map, but it does not contain any photographs. The text visible in the image is as follows:

VERTICAL CHART
Prepared by USAF STANDARDS
Lambert Conformal Conic Projection
Scale 1:250,000 Sheet 2.7-R(40)
DANGER
AREA

This is the text I was able to extract from the image. There are no human faces or identities to disregard, as the image does not contain any photographs.
