The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with text and a table.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

AT FOUR OF THE STATIONS LISTED ABOVE, SUPER SCHMIDT CAMERAS ARE SMALL, MITCHELL-DESIGNED UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN INSTALLED ON AN INTERIM BASIS.  AS SHOWN IN TABLE TWO, THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL EVENTUALLY BE REPLACED BY BAKER-NUNN CAMERAS WHOSE PRECISION AND ACCURACY SURPASSES THESE INTERIM INSTRUMENTS.

THE DATES IN TABLE ONE ARE DATES OF ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENT.  THE DATES LISTED BELOW IN TABLE TWO REPRESENT OUR PRESENT SCHEDULE FOR THE REMAINING BAKER-NUNN CAMERAS.

2. PHOTOGRAPHIC REDUCTION 
Photographs of American satellites 1958 a and 1958 b1 as obtained during the tracking operations mentioned above have been thoroughly examined and studied for the purpose of photographic tracking stations. Such photographs showing satellites, after immediate field reading, are being reduced for precise data evaluation.  The data display is such that we may be able, with further efforts, to obtain also precise photographic data similar to that provided by the Moonwatch program for the evaluation of detailed position information.  It is expected that a catalogue of position data from these tracking cameras can be issued soon in a nature similar to the catalogues of MOONWATCH data.

3. REDUCTION OF PHOTOTRACK OBSERVATIONS
A considerable number of photographs of the world's satellites have been made by the tracking stations and analytical reduction of these PHOTOTRACK observations is underway in the analytical sections maintained here.  No such photographs have as yet been received here or the U.S. satellite control center.
