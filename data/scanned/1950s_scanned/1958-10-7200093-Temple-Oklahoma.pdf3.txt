A search of the immediate area of discovery revealed no unusual or characteristic marks or indications in the flying object. It appears that this incident would be the result of an ordinary (?) weather balloon.
The complete absence of weather equipment plus the description of the objects when found as given by the operands leads the writer to believe that the incident is as stated.
