On 12 Nov the light was definitely east of my meridian. I must assume that you have disregarded the Thor firing azimuth prior to publication.

Aviation week mentions that the object seemed to depart the origin - I can not determine if information which was deleted from me. The enclosure only shows one frame at original data sheet which was identified report. 

If you can, without violating security, let me know if both I and my wife's report conformed or differ in any way not in full command of our senses and naturally were curious.

Please return my original data sheets after you are finished with them. Thanks.

Yours truly,
