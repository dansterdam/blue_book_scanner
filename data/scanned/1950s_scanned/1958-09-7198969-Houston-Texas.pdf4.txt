2. The Base Operations Officer prepared this report. He talked
with both telephone contacts and eyewitness people. Both individuals seemed
to be intelligent and observant persons. They indicated the visuals created by the object
in flight at night. Because of the delayed good sense in using a
compass and binoculars to determine the object's azimuth, elevation and
identity. He recorded his findings and has them in his possession.
A telephone check with the Houston Post's news staff, the
Houston Chronicle's news staff, the Houston Police Department, Civil
Aeronautics Administration, and the Houston Tower did not reveal any
other reported observers. The 747th AC&W Squadron radar and the
Houston Approach Controller also did not observe the object during the
period of time report.
3. The flight path of the object closely approximates the route
of V-13 and V-22 southwes t. The speed and altitude of the object
closely approximate that of a conventional aircraft. In opinion of this reporting officer that the object was a fuselage, or similar light, on the
underside of a conventional aircraft, probably a civil aircraft.
