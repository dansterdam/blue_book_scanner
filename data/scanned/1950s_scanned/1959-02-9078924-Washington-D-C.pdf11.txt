The shared image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

1. The attached negative was forwarded to the ATIC by Mr. X of Washington, D.C., who took this picture during a visit to the United States in February 1959.

2. The subject took the picture at approximately 2100 on 4 February 1959. Mention is made that the light which appears to be the Capitol was in fact and above the Capitol was a much brighter light.

3. The witness did not offer any of the conditions under which this photograph was made. However, it is obvious that the subject was located on the mall, fairly close to the Capitol and the Washington monument.

4. Analysis and/or an explanation of the light to the left and above the Capitol is requested.
