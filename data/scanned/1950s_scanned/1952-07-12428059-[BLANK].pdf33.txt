           THE PRESS:  General, somebody asked you before how 
      much money you'd spent on this investigation since the start. 
      How much have you spent on it? 

           MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD:  It's very slight.  I don't 
    know, 


          THE PRESS:  General, in connection with withholding 
    information, I'd like to ask General Ramey a question.  That is, 
    how many times have fighter planes been brought down over the 
    Washington area in the last couple of weeks to investigate 
    reports of flying objects? 

          MAJOR GENERAL RAMEY:  That's a matter of record -- 
    three, I believe.  I think two flights one night and one flight 
    Saturday night.  I don't remember the night the other two were 
     up.  I think there have been six sorties. 

          THE PRESS:  One flight the first Saturday night and 
     two flights -- 

        MAJOR GENERAL RAMEY:  In this immediate area, yes.  
     We have airplanes that investigate various reports all over 
     the country or places where we have these fighters, but -- 

         THE PRESS:  I thought the Air Force had said that 
     it couldn't send any fighters up because it didn't have them. 

          MAJOR GENERAL RAMEY:  No.  I don't believe it said 
     that. 

           THE PRESS:  The first night. 

           THE PRESS:  How about .  last night, General? 

          MAJOR GENERAL RAMEY:  No; there were no fighters 
     up last night. 

           THE PRESS:  Were there fighters sent in here from 
     New Castle on both those Saturday nights in question? 

          MAJOR GENERAL RAMEY:  That's right; yes. 

           THE PRESS:  Last night, was that because of lack of 
     a track? 

           MAJOR GENERAL RAMEY:  Lack of a track.
