McMullin Observatory
22 June 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olson:

Here are the comments on the recent batch of material. A few cases are certainly of considerable interest. Over all, 23 January, Stuttgart, Fireballs most probably account for 4 cases; balloons for 28.

Coming to the interesting cases, the Korean 20 April should certainly be followed up. This case closes to being a certain-intelligence matter. Did you certainly like to get more information on this? How about sending a Form A to recover for more. Korea - Australlia should have been investigated by intelligence officers?

Peppperrell AFB 2 May! This has some similarities to the old German V-1 cases. Much fuller report needed and Form A filed car on this.

San Antonio 7 May: This has many similarities to the Babboek Lights and Form A should certainly be sent if this has not already been done.

Finally, a Form A for the 29 April Syracuse stationary-disc sighting would help. The report on this seems very good, but yet the green light sighting gets should have been checked for possible maneuvering instead of south in order for observer for Cheverier to see green navigation lights. I hope that you can eventually send me more information on theses 20 April Korea 2 May San Antonio.  

I am enclosing my version of a report on our recent trip with which I hope you will concur. And keep I'm coming. It's easier to handle a few at a time and frequently them to longer intervals.

Jeanie send her regards.
