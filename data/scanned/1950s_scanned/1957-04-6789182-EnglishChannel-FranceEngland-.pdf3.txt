"Saucer' Is Mirage - In Name Only

By the Associated Press

LONDON, May 9 - A mysterious object, easily identified British planes that united up to 15 miles over the Channel last week was identified today as a mirage from France, a spokesman for the London Evening News said.

The London Evening News said it came one of the morning's papers to receive reports of the "flying saucer" seen over the Channel. The News said it contacted the nearest air stations and civil aviation authorities and was told the object was "impossible to catch."

The spokesman said the apparent sighting of the object was due to optical illusion and atmospheric conditions.
