Rather these objects came down and went up again so suddenly that it seemed as if they were meant for some purpose. They would completely disappear and reappear in other parts of the sky. They seemed to have a definite pattern in their motions, though varying greatly in speed from mere hovering or drifting to very fast motions. It is only after careful study of all available the facts that I am convinced there is something strange about them in regards to anything I have seen before. I have come to the very real conviction that these things are not of this earth. It is about 9 years now since I first got into it and I have studied a lot of reports, taking care not to be influenced by other peoples ideas concerning the earth in all fields to try to eliminate any preconceived theories. This is not an easy thing to admit but I feel that to set the facts behind it all but it is all there to be had by anyone interested and willing to take the time to study it.
