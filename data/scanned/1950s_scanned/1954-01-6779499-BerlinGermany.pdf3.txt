"An Unidentified Flying Object Reported over BERLIN

On 23 January 1954, between 1520 and 1523 hours, German military personnel in the vicinity of BERLIN observed a silver-colored object traveling at a high rate of speed. The object was estimated to be 20-30 feet in diameter and remained in view for approximately 3 minutes. Time of observation was 3-5 minutes. The object appeared to be twice the size of a normal jet fighter aircraft.

REMARKS: German military witnesses stated that this object moved at a speed greatly in excess of any known aircraft. The object maneuvered in a vertical and horizontal direction and at one point seemed to hover for a few seconds. The object then accelerated and disappeared from view. No exhaust trail or sound was reported. Temperature at the time of observation was between 20 degrees to 25 degrees Celsius."
