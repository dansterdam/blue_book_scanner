SIGHTED BY AIRLINE FIRST OFFICER NOVEMBER 2,1951

We were flying an American Airliner DC-6 from Los Angeles to Tulsa, Oklahoma at 9,500 feet, 3 minutes east of Abilene, on ATC's this subject passed to our left at the same altitudes and approximate course.

The object was very bright green with a tail of exhaust vapor.
We were making a true air speed of 220 mph, and the object appeared to be going several times faster.
As the object passed in front of us the light went out, but on looking out in front of us the object exploded, almost like a Fourth of July roman candle.
The object appeared to fly in a horizontal path, or a parabolic path, as is the usual motor pattern. It appeared to be an large as a medium size airplane.
