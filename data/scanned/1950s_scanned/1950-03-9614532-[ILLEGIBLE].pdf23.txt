Flying Whatisit Chases 
2 Westerners in Car

They Won't Admit 
It Was a Saucer

DURANGO, Colo., March 14 - Two Durango business-
men said today that they were chased by an object 
which they said was not an airplane but looked like 
a flying saucer.

Locke of Durango and
Garnet Banner of Cortez, Colo.,
told the story quiet to avoid ribbing from
friends.

They said they were returning 
from Cortez, Colo., when the object 
began following their car. Both 
refused to call to a halt, fearing 
"But it was too fast for a bird, 
and too small for an airplane," 
Mr. Banner said.

"It must have been a tremendous 
machine," Banner said. The object, described as
25 feet in diameter, was said to have traveled 
on a 40-to-50-foot radius around 
the automobile.

"Clear in Headlights"
"We could see it clearly," Mr. 
Locke said, "for about five minutes while
they were following us." The "thing" zipped around 
the car."
