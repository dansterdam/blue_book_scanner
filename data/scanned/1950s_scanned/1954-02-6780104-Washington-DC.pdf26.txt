The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a "Captain Mantell Incident" that occurred in January 1948. The text discusses the possibility that Capt. Mantell may have been trying to close in on a UFO object, and states that in all events, the UFO was a "conventional object".

CAPTAIN MANTELL INCIDENT
7 January 1948

In fact, it is possible that in some phase of his climb, Capt Mantell may have been trying to close in on Venus, as is borne out by his remarks that he could not gain on the object.

In all events, the UFO was a conventional object.
