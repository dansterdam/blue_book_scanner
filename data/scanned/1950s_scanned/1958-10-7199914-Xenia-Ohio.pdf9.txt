The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph present, but rather two illustrations.

The first illustration shows a curved line to represent the horizon (skyline) and an object above it. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine that they are at the point shown as "A" and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it.

The second illustration shows two larger sketches. The larger sketch on the left depicts a road with buildings and trees on either side, with a person standing in the middle. The smaller sketch on the right shows a distant landscape with mountains. The instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" at the position where the object was first seen, and a "B" at the position where it was later seen, to complete the larger sketch.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
