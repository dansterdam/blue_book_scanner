30 November 1959

1. In the fall of 1947 the United States Air Force took official notice of reports of unidentified flying objects. Responsibility for the UFO project was assigned to the Intelligence community.

2. The project as established was to determine first, if UFO's were hostile, second, had they any scientific value, and third, to determine the nature of each of these objects. After 12 years, 6152 cases, and more than 8000 reports, the Air Force has not discovered any evidence which would indicate that UFO's are internal or pose a security threat in any way.

3. During the life of this project there have been indications of its possible scientific value. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, former scientific consultant to the project, now reports as possible sub- stantiating evidence. Dr. Charles F. Olivier, President of The American Meteor Society, has on several occasions requested information from the Air Force to be used for his studies on "Fireball Meteors". Dr. Olivier claims the Air Force information is more complete than his own reports. The UFO files contain reports of cases which were analyzed as being due to rare scientific phenomena such as "ball lightning".

4. In the absence of a security threat from UFO's, it is my opinion that the project's value to the Air Force lies in exploitation of its scientific information. In order to accomplish this goal the UFO program should be transferred to ARDC, and its scientific objectives clearly defined.
