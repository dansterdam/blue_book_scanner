Oxnard, California Case ( 16 Mar 1957 )
This case was somehow brought to the attention of numerous UFO clubs who besieged the Air Force demanding explanations. Keyhoe sent a 6-page telegram to ATIC.

Briefly, a woman living in a rather isolated area outside of Oxnard observed what she termed as "descending red and green lights" near her home. Hysterical with fear, she contacted the Duty Officer at the Oxnard AFB. The Duty Officer contacted the local fighter squadron. Two F-89s searched the area. Two Navy aircraft made a search. Nothing was found. During this period, the local police, state highway patrol, and the sheriff's office was contacted. All units converged on the area. A detailed intelligence report made as a result of the investigation disclosed that the source was a highly excitable, emotional person, a believer in saucers, and apparently left alone for the first time by her husband, an Air Force Captain, she became frightened at the lights. 

An analysis disclosed that the objects were red warning lights installed on a barn nearby, which, when observed through shiny glass insulators, or a telescope pole (in her line-of-sight) from her kitchen window did give the unusual appearance described. The play of automobile headlights on the insulators was emphasized in a telephone report to ATIC. Misidentification of conventional objects.
