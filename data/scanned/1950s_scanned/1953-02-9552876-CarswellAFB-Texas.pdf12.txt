1. Reference is made to the additional information mentioned in paragraph 1 of Comment No. 1. This information is quoted:

"Blips were at extreme range of radar, and operator could not tell whether they were aircraft, birds, or weather. Blips did not change size. Blips disappeared into noise and did not reappear. Radar observers were unable to track them up on successive B-36 aircraft. Returns of nearest blip were very sharp compared to B-36 target. Other blips were just above noise, similar to B-36 radar."

2. The characteristics of the above signals are compatible with those of ground returns. The indicated weather conditions indicate that there was a temperature inversion at 1000 MB pressure (near the earth) and at 950 MB pressure.

3. It is considered that it is highly probable that the reported radar targets were ground targets.

4. This correspondence may be downgraded to CONFIDENTIAL upon removal of inclosure, in accordance with paragraph 25e, Air Force Regulation 205-1.
