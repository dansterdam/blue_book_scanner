DEAR SIR:

One week ago I sighted an unidentified flying object. My attention was called to this object by my daughter, aged 10.

I have been a life-long student of aviation, took my first flying lesson at the age of 15. Spent three years in the USAAF. I've been a member of the National Aeronautical Association for some 15 years.

I have been a "flying saucer" fan for a long time but up to now had never seen anything. I would class as a saucer. My but this object seemed near and I could see it plainly.

The object made no sound at all. It seemed to be pulsing; the smoke and haze in front of it seemed to be distortion. It seemed to be almost motionless.

Mr. daughter, aged 10, first spotted the object. She was in the garden and attracted my attention to something in the sky. I was in the kitchen.

I took a look at the object and knew they could not make a sharp right-angle turn as such.

The object made no sound at all. It seemed to be pulsing; the smoke and haze in front of it seemed to be distortion. It seemed to be almost motionless.

I also know they could not make a sharp right-angle turn as such.
