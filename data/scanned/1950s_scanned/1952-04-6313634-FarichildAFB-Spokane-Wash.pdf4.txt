Sighting appears to establish the plausibility of a transitory nature of the object. A initial impression was made to establish the existence of the object viewed at a specific time and place which could not be fully explained as a known or familiar object using standard means of identification available to the observer on the spot. The time of sighting and brief duration indicate the object was transitory in nature and did not remain in the area of observation for any extended period.
