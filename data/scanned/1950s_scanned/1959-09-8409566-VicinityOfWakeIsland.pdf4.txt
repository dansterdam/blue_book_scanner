SUMMARY:  (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative reports. Basic narrative text on AF Form 112)
This object was sighted at 1812Z, 3 passengers noted an unusual concussion at 5 o'clock.  The object appeared to be moving towards them.  The passengers estimated the size of the object to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, and described it as being disc-shaped.  The object first hovered, and then proceeded to ascend at a high rate of speed.  The object was rapidly dissipated by winds, and had disappeared entirely within 3-5 minutes.  The passengers were shaken, and though they could not recall the precise details, they knew they had seen something out of the ordinary.
Subsequent investigation revealed that the most some of an Atlas IRBM fired from Vandenberg AFB at 17:20Z on 9 Sep 59 appeared to the passengers to be a possibility that this same missile may have been responsible for their sighting.
