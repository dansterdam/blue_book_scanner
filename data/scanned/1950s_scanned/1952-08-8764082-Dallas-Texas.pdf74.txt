Ex-Marine Describes 'Saucer Attack'
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--An ex-Marine told his wife and neighbors about a strange incident which happened to him Monday night near Dallas, Texas.  The former Marine said it was a "saucer-shaped" object that attacked him.  He left the house in his car with his wife and neighbors to investigate.
As he sped through the brush, the object is said to have followed him.  The ex-Marine said he could hear the "thump, thump, thump" sound of the object right under his car.
According to the report, there was a bright light which seemed to be "playing" on the car, and the car radio was affected in some way.  The ex-Marine said he was so frightened that he almost wrecked the car.
Investigators are taking this report seriously, as they feel it may be another case of a "flying saucer" encountering a citizen.  No further details are available at this time.
