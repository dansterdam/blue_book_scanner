Gentlemen:

I live in Westwood, a suburb of Cincinnati. For whatever information
value it may have to you, I wish to report observing a bright star-like
light in the sky which I am certain was neither a plane nor a star.

My windows face northeast. Two tall trees are about 200 feet away.
On Monday night(May 31st) at midnight and after, I observed between
the top branches of the two trees a very bright light which I thought
to be a star. Watching it I wondered if it could be two stars together,
it was so large and seemed closer than the others. It seemed to pulsate.
Had the color of: tholight from an old-fashioned coal-oil lamp in the
distance on a very dark night.

Being fascinated, I decided to watch it, and became conscious that it
had movement. It moved from the space between the two trees to in.
back of; the one on the right and came out on the other side. At times
during its passage behind thtoree I could get glimpses of it. After
it came from behind the tree, it seemed to slip back behind it again,
and storm clouds then hid it and other stars in the sky from view.

It traveled from left to right in a pulsating fashion on what seemed
an almost horizontal line. I did not time the travel, but it seemed much
slower than the setting sun (or at least as slow) during the autumn
days.

Very truly yours,
