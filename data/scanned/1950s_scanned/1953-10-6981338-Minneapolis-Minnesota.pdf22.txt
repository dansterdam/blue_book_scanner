While observing a balloon car (about 4 feet a white trail appeared in the sky coming from behind part of the building structure (cross or block). It first appeared to be just wisps of vapor, but shortly they began to materialize into a complete jet stream trail. This trail of the smoke train dispersed away to the east. The leading edge or the smoke trail dispersed at about the same rate as the trail was formed. The trail remaining about continuous and equal to maximum length at all times. As this train was forming the vertical movement became very rapid, probably about as fast as the horizontal velocity. As the trail began to disappear, the trail became less continuous and finally dissipated. At the same time, two flashes were seen, which we assumed to be reflections from the sun at the distant or moving axis. This could be expected from maneuvers in a conventional craft.
