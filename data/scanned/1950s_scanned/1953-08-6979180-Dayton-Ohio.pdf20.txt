The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved object or sighting in the sky, with the instructions to place an "A" on the sighting line to show how it was seen initially, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how it was seen later. The second sketch contains three separate drawings - a larger sketch of a landscape with a person walking on a road, and two smaller sketches, one of a mountainous landscape and the other of a person standing in front of a landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine if the object is here that you saw first. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how you saw it later.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
