I have recently acquired some information concerning the sighting and taking of two, (2), photographs of an unidentified object by Mr. and Mrs. ??? at Mcguinville, Oregon. The photographs were taken on May 11, 1950 at the Mcguinville air farm just as dusk was coming on. I would be much obliged if you would obtain and send to the address listed below information and photographs of other and this such incidents.

Any thanks
