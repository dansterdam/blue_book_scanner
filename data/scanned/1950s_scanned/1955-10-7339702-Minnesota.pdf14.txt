The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text. 

The text in the document reads:

"We were originally running a practice intercept on a target known to be at 25 + 7 miles. The target was originally contacted at 45 + 7 miles. During this period I was on search operation, about 10 to 15 secs. Later I noticed the target tracking the same as with a range of 15 miles. I tracked it on hand control for a mile + a period of about 5 secs. Then returned to the intercept."
