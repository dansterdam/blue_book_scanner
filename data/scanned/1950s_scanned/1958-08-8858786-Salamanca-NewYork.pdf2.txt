Dear Sir:

Yesterday at approximately 6:00 p.m. I noticed thousands of silver colored objects in the sky traveling northwest. I could see them clearly, although I did not see nor hear any plane. I could not determine the size of these objects. 

Upon searching, I found several pieces of which I am enclosing this sample for your examination, as it appears to be the remnant of such an object.

Of course, this has worked much conjecture, everything from a hoax to an actual fact. The people who saw this are insistent they feel a tingle in their hand where they touched this.

For that is all I can say - there must be thousands more around if you are interested.

Yours very truly,
Bradford, Pa.
