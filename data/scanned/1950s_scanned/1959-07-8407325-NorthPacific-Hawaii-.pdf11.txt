MEDDELANDE
Från K. GÖSTA REHN

Datum Sept 3. 1959
Via Stockholm

Dear Major Tacker,
I thank you very much for your sending me several recent Fact Sheets and transcript of the TV discussion on the Armstrong Theatre. 
I know how much in trouble you are with the Swedish UFOE Staff which handles UFO-matters and they are in complete disagreement with the US Air Force regarding the investigations and sightings. We simply cannot convince them as well. 
I hesitate to ask you to increase your kind courtesy and favor by sending me the Astronomical - Meteor Journal reported on July 18th 1959 by FAA control tower at Honolulu and the newspaper reports. It would be very nice indeed to have copies of the documents. 
As I stated in my previous request, my experience is somewhat different. We have been having camped together in various offices before the war. He is a major authority and really knows me very well.
Sincerely yours,
K. GÖSTA REHN
