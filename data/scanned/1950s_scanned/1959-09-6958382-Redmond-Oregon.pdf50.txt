Dear Mr.

Your letter of December 31, 1959, addressed to the Federal Aviation Agency in Washington, has been forwarded to this office for reply since the UFO sightings occurred in Region Four.
I am enclosing copies of the two reports referred to in your letter from our Communication Station in Redmond, Oregon, and the Air Route Traffic Control Center in Seattle, Washington.
If I can be of additional service to you, please let me know.

Sincerely,
