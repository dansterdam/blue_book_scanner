Identification: AF-425-52
Subject information: Sighting of unidentified object over Martinsville, Virginia, April 17, 1952

Narrative: On April 17, 1952, at approximately 11:20 PM, an object was sighted by the pilot and co-pilot of a flight 3.5 miles south of Martinsville, Virginia. The object was described as being approximately 1200 feet altitude.

Flight 1/2, a Lockheed C-60, observed cited object approximately 1200 feet altitude.

N.C. Leon ------, Co-pilot, National Airlines Operations, Jacksonville, Florida

No physical evidence of sighting is known. No interception or identification attempted. No air traffic control assistance attempted.

Comments of the Preparing Officer:
The observers, due to their flight training and experience, should be well qualified and their conjecture seems reasonable opinion. From the general description of the object, it does not appear that it was an aircraft or a known astronomical object. Thus, the description does not identify any specific jet aircraft which might have been present. However, it is not inconsistent with the objects of a similar type as reported on recent occasions, and which have eluded identification. For summary, Andrews AFB, could not be contacted for information.
