SUMMARY (Summarize the cases, give location, time, date, other pertinent data as paragraph.)
Fanning, Georgia at approximately 5:00 hours on the morning of 9 December 1952, observers at the Post Gate reported seeing an unidentified object in the sky. The object was described as approximately the size of a B-29 aircraft, round in shape, and emitting a bright yellow light. It appeared to be hovering at approximately 1,000 feet for about two minutes and then disappeared to the south-south-east at a very high rate of speed.

1. All observers seemed certain it was neither a meteor nor a fixed astronomical body; nor was it an aircraft of any kind. The object was observed by three men on sentry duty at the Gate, and one other observer from the Post.

2. The weather was very good, with ceiling and visibility unlimited.

3. As far as can be ascertained by this Headquarters only five people saw this object.
