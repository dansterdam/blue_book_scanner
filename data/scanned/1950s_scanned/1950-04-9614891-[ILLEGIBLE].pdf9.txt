Flying Saucers Again
By Australis (This Time)
SYDNEY, Australia, Monday, May 9 (AAP)-Reports of "flying saucers" streaked through the skies over Sydney and many parts of Australia, and officials said they could not deny the many sight them.
Reports came from four widely separated suburban areas of Sydney, and in each case the observers said the objects were larger than a plane, travelled at great speed, and made a "flash across the sky shortly after dusk. Two of the reports came from the air force officer, a veteran of world War II.
The Royal Australian Air Force said there were no jet planes on duty near Sydney at the time the objects were reported, and it could not explain the phenomenon.
