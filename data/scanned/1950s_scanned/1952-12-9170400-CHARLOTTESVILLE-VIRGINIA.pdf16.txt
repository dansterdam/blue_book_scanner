NARRATIVE: On 15 December 1952 at approximately 205/1 an unidentified track appeared on the radar sets of the Charlottesville, Virginia, filter center (AAFSIN-2S6). The target appeared shortly before 205/1 just north-west of Charlottesville, Virginia, about 10 miles. It was traveling at an estimated speed of 120 knots on a slightly curving course to the north-west. The target was seen on the first, second and third sweeps of the radar. The size of the target was estimated to be about double that of a standard aircraft target. The estimated speed was 120 miles per hour.

All blips seen were about double target size. Negative results were obtained from a radar checkpoint made on the remainder of the radar sites in this area for a possible sighting of the same track.
