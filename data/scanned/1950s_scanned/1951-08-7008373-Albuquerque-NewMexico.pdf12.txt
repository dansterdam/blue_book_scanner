The text in the report is as follows:

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - 26 AUGUST 1951
On the evening of 22 August 1951, at 2145, a bright light was observed by Grant C. Ballard, 3524 Santa Fe S.E., Albuquerque, New Mexico. The light was first observed about 5 miles north of Albuquerque, moving in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. The object was circular in shape, without wings, tail or trail, and gave the appearance of a solid body. The speed of the aircraft to be about one and one-half times the speed of a jet fighter. The object was at an altitude thought to be about 800 ft. - 1000 ft., and there was no sound. The object had a bluish-white color and was very bright. Pulsating or flashing lights were noticed on the trailing edge of the object. The object was in sight for about 3-4 minutes.
(See Appendix I for possible related incident.)

VISUAL:
Broken clouds at 17,000 ft., visibility five miles, wind 8 mph.

BASIS OF INVESTIGATION

It had been ascertained that he is mentally stable.
The photos taken of the V-shaped object at Lubbock, Texas, (see Appendix I) were shown to the witness, and he stated that the object he saw was similar to the one in the photo.

An investigation was made to determine whether or not any one else had also observed this object, but only negative results were obtained.

Further evaluation of this incident depends on the outcome of attempts to establish the authenticity of the Lubbock photos.
