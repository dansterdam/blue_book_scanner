Dr. J.A. Hynek

Station general--near 31 Benson, Arizona
Direction of flight--northwest--alt est 10,000 ft.
Duration of observation--3-4 minutes
Angular velocity--very rapid

Appears to have been a fireball similar to that observed on the morning of the 3rd--and described in detail in a previous letter. The object was spherical, appeared to emit a bluish-white light and left a very long trail of sparks behind it. It was seen in the northwest traveling in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be at an altitude of perhaps 10,000 feet and was traveling at a very high rate of speed--of the order of 1,000 mph or more. It might suggest a mix-up photo, if one could be obtained, such as the fireball seen in New Mexico and at several other stations in the south.

The observation is corroborated by several other witnesses in the Benson area, and it is thought that there are probably additional unreported observations in that vicinity. The object was visible for 3-4 minutes.

Meteorite: This was about the time for a known meteor shower, the Orionids, and the object may have been a particularly bright meteor or fireball associated with that shower.

Artificial Satellite: Possible. Trajectory of travel, size, speed and duration of observation point to this possibility. However, there are no known artificial satellites in existence at that time capable of the performance exhibited by this object.

Plane: Possible, but very doubtful. The object was several times larger than any conventional aircraft, very much faster, and the trajectory and duration of observation do not fit the characteristics of a plane.
