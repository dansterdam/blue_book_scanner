SUBJECT: Sighting of an Alleged Unidentified Object, 15 Sep 59, Article SPTAE Area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. Enclosed as attachment 1, a true copy of a report, dated 15 September 1959, which was forwarded to this headquarters by the Greater Pittsburgh Airport. The object was sighted by the airport tower operator and a copy of the Police report along with sketches of the object received are attached.

2. The undersigned, upon receiving a call from Sgt. Bollou, Greater Pittsburgh Airport Control Tower, was informed that the object was possibly a part of a weather balloon radio transmission and that as soon as visibility allowed, the ground crew would attempt to locate and recover the object. A complete description was given, the weather man furnished additional information to me, and as no further contact was made operations, the object and identified it as a weather balloon and informed the Intelligence Center accordingly.

3. Investigation by the Pittsburgh Police and Bales Station, no evidence of an explosion or reason for an explosion was found. To the best of my knowledge no other agencies were notified of the incident and no further action had nothing to do with it.
