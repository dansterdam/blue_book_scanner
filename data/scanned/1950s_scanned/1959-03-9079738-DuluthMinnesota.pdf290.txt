The image does not contain a photograph. It is a typed document describing an observation of what was believed to be the planet Venus as an "unidentified flying object" on March 12, 1959 in Duluth, Minnesota.

Venus as an Evening "Star"
In the evening of 1959 Venus again, this time in the evening, caused reports of flying saucers. As close as 15 miles, an unidentified flying object with visibility of over fifteen miles, was observed. Witnesses described its shape as tubular or cigar-shaped, grey in color, and with a rotary or spinning motion. Two interceptions by the Air Defense Command were made, but they could get no closer and eventually gave up the chase. It was observed for about thirty minutes, by fading from sight. Airborne radar tracked the object intermittently as it made various sweeps and, at times, heading toward the position of the observers and then racing away, all with irregular speeds, but they could not make a positive identification of the aircraft. At the same time, about thirty minutes, the ground station had photographed and the film showed the object at Boston, Mass. and its size on the film indicated it to be a large object.
The radar screen at the ground station had been photographed and the film showed that the object was not from a real target but were "angels" that the observers had noticed (see Chapter VI). Some operators reported the object made sharp contacts, others reported the object faded intermittently. Apparently, as others it moved off the scope at incredible speeds.
At the first of the sighting Venus was just on the western horizon, and probably was the true position occupied by the unknown, and probably would have been mistaken for the reflection by the earth's atmosphere had produced layers of light and dark alternating. The object had maneuverability.
