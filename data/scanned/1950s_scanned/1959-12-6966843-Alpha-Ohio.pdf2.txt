Despite his age, appears to be a competent observer. He reported what he saw and drew a sketch, which aided in the investigation. His mother's previous report probably gave him confidence to turn this into ATIC and did not appear to have any bias.

REPORT OF SUBJECT INVESTIGATION

Patterson Field Case

T-1012 at 1915. ALL S-101 returned. KC-135 landed at 1924. Four bright lights on its made it look like a Christmas tree unusual according to observer. The lights pointed toward the wings.

Contrast lighting the KC-135 which was dark blue, the landing lights apparently were on already. The undercarriage was visible enough to determine that there had been no dangling or trailing objects. 

There was no search by our investigators and the case will be closed until the results of 1/C handling and timing analysis are obtained. The observers answer to the USAF interviewer was that he had heard about the sighting "on the grapevine" before or after the ATIC sighting.
