The text in the document reads as follows:

"The night of 7-5-53 was a very momentous occasion. The observers, who included the pastor and his family, his daughter and her husband, four other adults, and the writer, watched for over 90 minutes a lighted object slowly move across the sky, hover, and then move off rapidly in the distance. The object was completely silent and was observed through binoculars at different times. It was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, balloon or any known aircraft. Its performance was completely beyond the capabilities of any known man-made craft at that time."
