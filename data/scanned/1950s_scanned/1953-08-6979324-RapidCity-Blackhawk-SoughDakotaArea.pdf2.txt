the tower as from the Filter Center. The angles must be regarded as in determinate, and as far as altitude is considered it appeared higher from 
the tower than from the Filter Center. The altitude is indeterminate since 
we do not know the distance. All observer said the objects could not truly 
be distinguished one from the other. One or more objects, then, were visible 
from 05122 until 08302, that is, for approximately three hours.

pointed out repeatedly. At the time of the passing of the C-12h, the object closest to it - object #1 - appeared to blink in a sort of a signalling way. 
It was likened to the signaling of a ship's signal blinker but not as fast. 
It was most pronounced int h, but they said it was taken up by # 3 and then 
#2, as though a wave had passed from #4 to #2.

Likewise, in the triangulation
the airport and the Filter Center. Object # 2 appeared to the Northeast of the Filter Center and due North of the tower, 
The tower directions are to be trusted since the window faces directly north and object # 2 was seen square out of the window. It is the opinion of this
