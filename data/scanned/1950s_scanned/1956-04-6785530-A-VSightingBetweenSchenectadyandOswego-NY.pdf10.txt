BUFFALO, April 10 - A veteran airlines pilot today 
recounted the tale of something fantastic he said he 
saw in the sky while flying his regular run between 
Buffalo and Schenectady, N.Y.
  Capt. Raymond E. Ryan, 43, of suburban Snyder, a pilot 
for Caro. York airlines, said he followed a bright light from 
Schenectady to Buffalo, but never could quite catch up with 
it.
  "The light was so bright you wouldn't want to look at 
it," Capt. Ryan said. "I'm the type of fellow that - well, you've 
got to show me. But I'm convinced there was something 
fantastic up there."
