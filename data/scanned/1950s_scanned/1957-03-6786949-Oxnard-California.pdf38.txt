FOUR SAUCERS OVER CALIFORNIA AT SPEEDS UP TO 3600 M.P.H. REVEALED IN RADAR REPORT

CERTIFIED BY MEMBERS OF THE NICAP BOARD OF GOVERNORS

"I certify I have seen the signed reports dated April 22 and May 15, 1957, describing these saucer-shaped objects as reported to at speeds up to 3600 m.p.h."

(Signed) Raymond Albert Keller, Robinson Memorial Church, Greenfield, Mass.

The report cited was signed by crew members of the U.S. Air Force Radar Station at Oxnard Air Force Base, California. On the night of March 23, the operators tracked four saucer-shaped objects traveling at speeds up to 3600 m.p.h. This incident is CLASSIFIED, NICAP investigation shows, since it raises serious technical and security problems.

Col. E. F. Curry, Jr., stated that no attempt has been plotted to the fact that these objects were tracked on radar, since the NICAP possession. The radar pictures taken that night are now CLASSIFIED, the reason given being that the Air Force wishes to withhold from public view any radar evidence which would confirm the reality of UFO's.
