1. ATIC Comments and Conclusions:
a. Mr. ~~~~~ observed a strange light traveling from South to North. Contacting a member of academics, including the U.S. Air Force Academy of Sciences, suggest it may have been a satellite or a meteor. However, some consider this could be a UFO report.
b. Object not Sputnik. Going the wrong way.
c. Experts on moonwatch agree that under favorable conditions Sputnik can often be seen with the naked eye. Research instruments indicate only one satellite can be seen at a time and persons often misinterpret certain natural phenomena (e.g. satellites, aircraft, etc.) that may appear in the sky. From Mr. ~~~~~~'s letter, it appears he and his daughter were attempting to track Sputnik with the naked eye.
d. Dallas, Texas ADC Filter Center was contacted for a detailed survey of their records for that night in the Ft. Worth-Dallas-Abilene area. Their records indicate no unusual celestial or aerial observations were made during this time period.
