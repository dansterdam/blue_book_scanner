GENERAL TECHNICAL DATA PARTICUL1959
THE OBJECT WAS rEFEn TO AS A 'BRILLIANT LIGHT' By THE OBSERVERS, WHO SAID THAT IT APPEARED TO REST ON THE GROUND AT VARIOUS POINTS, GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS ON A SUPPORTING STAND. IT WOULD THEN RISE STRAIGHT UP IN A SLOW VERTICAL CLIMB AND MOVE OFF HORIZONTALLY AT A TERRIFIC SPEED. DURING THESE INSTANCES IT SHONE WITH A BLINDING LIGHT. WHILE HOVERING OVER THE GROUND IT APPEARED TO CHANGE INTO DIFFERENT SHAPES. SOMETIMES IT APPEARED TO BE DISC-SHAPED, SOMETIMES IT APPEARED TO BE ELONGATED IN SHAPE. ITS SIZE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN DIAMETER.
THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY NUMEROUS PERSONS AT THE SCENE AS WELL AS BY SEVERAL AUTOMOBILE DRIVERS ON THE HIGHWAY WHO SAW IT PASS OVERHEAD. IT WAS UNDER OBSERVATION BY THE WITNESSES FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES.
SOME OF THE WITNESSES STATED THAT IT GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS BEING CONTROLLED FROM THE GROUND. THEY SAID THAT WHEN IT WOULD RISE VERTICALLY FROM THE GROUND AND THEN MOVE OFF HORIZONTALLY IT APPEARED TO BE RESPONDING TO SOME SIGNAL OR CONTROL FROM THE GROUND.
ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION RECEIVED, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE SIMILAR TO A VEHICLE WITH A CENTRAL BODY AND FOUR APPENDAGES OR PROTUBERANCES EXTENDING FROM IT. THESE APPENDAGES SEEMED TO GLOW WITH A REDDISH-ORANGE COLOR. THE CENTRAL BODY OF THE OBJECT GAVE OFF A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DISCERN ITS TRUE SHAPE AND OUTLINE.
NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO PHOTOGRAPH THE OBJECT, BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE BRILLIANT GLARE FROM THE LIGHT IT EMITTED RENDERED THE PHOTOGRAPHS USELESS. ONE WITNESS REPORTED THAT HE TRIED TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE OBJECT WHEN IT WAS ON THE GROUND, BUT WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE SPOT HE FOUND THAT HIS CAMERA HAD BEEN RENDERED USELESS.
IT IS FELT THAT THIS OBJECT HAS SOME HIGHLY UNUSUAL CHARACTERISTICS WHICH WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
