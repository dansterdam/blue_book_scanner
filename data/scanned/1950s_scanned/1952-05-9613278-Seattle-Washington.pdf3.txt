COURT METEOR EXPLODES WITH A ROAR: ON SCARES THOUSANDS IN SEATTLE
SEATTLE, May 11 - A giant meteor swished across western Washington and exploded with a tremendous flash and roar over Seattle at 11:25 a.m. today. It frightened thousands of persons as it lighted the sky and rattled doors and windows.
The flash, however, and the greatest damage seemed to have been inflicted on the people's nerves.
A 30-second rumble followed the blinding flash of the celestial explosion. Early estimates placed the area of the blast at four to five miles north of Greenslake, in north central Seattle.
Witnesses found it difficult to determine the altitude of the object, but they estimated its size as comparable to a large piece of tinfoil.
Northwest Airlines pilots, however, said it appeared to be only a little larger than a baseball.
Early reports to the Coast Guard said the object was sighted first as a blinding light in the north and of steadily moving toward the south. They reported the object had exploded into five pieces approximately five miles southwest of Greenslake.
Police and state patrolmen preceded forth fruitless efforts to find the pieces of the meteor.
