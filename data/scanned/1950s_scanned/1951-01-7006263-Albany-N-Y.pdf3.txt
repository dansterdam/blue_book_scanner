2. At approximately 1930 hours, 30 January 1951, while flying in close formation, in echelon left at an altitude of 41,000 feet, the pilots of two F-80C aircraft (Idaho White #'s flying with the flight leader) observed, simultaneously, a green flare descending at a steep angle, at their altitude, approximately 100 to 200 yards off their left wing.
a. The flare appeared to be similar to those fired from a "Very" flare pistol and seemed to dissipate at about 25,000 feet.
b. No other aircraft were observed in the vicinity at that time.
c. The Idaho White Flight was on a heading of approximately 130° at the time of the incident. The geographical coordinates at the time were approximately 73° 50' west and 43° 30' north.
3. Both the flight leader and the wing man are in complete accord as to the details of the observation. Neither shows any indication of having been subjected to similar night reflections or other similar night phenomena encountered.
