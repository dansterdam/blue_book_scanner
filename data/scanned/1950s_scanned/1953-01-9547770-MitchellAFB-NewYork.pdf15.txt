DATE OF REPORT: 12 January 1953
LOCATION OF INCIDENT: Mitchell AFB, New York
NARRATIVE: (Give complete details of report, etc., in chronological order.)
The aircraft pilots were on a training flight. During the flight, they observed a bright, fast-moving object to their right at about the 2 o'clock position. The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, faster than any known aircraft. The object suddenly made a sharp 90-degree turn and disappeared from view. The pilots reported that the object was a metallic, disc-shaped craft and that they would have attempted to intercept it if they had not been on a training mission.
DISPOSITION: The report was forwarded to the Air Force for investigation.
DOCUMENTATION OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None.
CONCLUSION: The Air Force could not identify the object observed by the pilots.
