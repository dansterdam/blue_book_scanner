The image contains three sketches or illustrations, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above it, and instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was when the observer first saw it, and then to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was later. The second and third sketches appear to depict different perspectives or positions of the observed object.
