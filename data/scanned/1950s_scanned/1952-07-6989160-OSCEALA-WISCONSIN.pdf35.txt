29 July 1952, Osceola, Wisconsin

Report indicates that anomalous propagation was affecting the radar performance. This condition would allow detection of ground targets which are not normally detected. This would not explain movement of targets unless weather conditions were such that every target (ground) was not detected on each sweep of the antenna thereby causing an apparent movement of stationary targets.

A firm analysis cannot be made.

Weather data: Temperature vs height, and moisture lapse vs height would be of some assistance in analysis.

See rpt dtd 25 July 52.
