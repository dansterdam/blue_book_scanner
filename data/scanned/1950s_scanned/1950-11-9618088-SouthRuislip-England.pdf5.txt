UNCLASSIFIED
AF 25O84O
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
United Kingdom 	2-1-50

UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OBJECT

Originator: Greater London

DATE OF OBSERVATION
20 November 1950 	10 November 1950

Object was observed, but details are as shown in attached statements.

From radar observations by USAF personnel, the object is described as follows:

Tracks were contacts were made with an unidentified object airborne existing apart from approximately 10 to 70,000 feet and from 1020 to 1025, 10 November 1950. The object travelled at a estimated speed of approximately 1,000 m.p.h. and executed violent gyrations and maneuvers which appeared to defy the laws of physics. The small size and extreme speed, together with the exceptionally large number or abrupt changes of course in a relatively short distance, were additional characteristics.
