There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
30-UFO-3-56  Part One

Flight 3-D, 4600d Alr, 
March 7, 1956 Part One, Report # 30-UFO-3-56
Statement of Mr. [REDACTED]

As I went out into the kitchen for a drink of water, I noticed a bright light in the sky which no stars normally appear. It appeared to be an oval object suspended in the air, which was a bright light, bright enough to illuminate the surrounding area and make it light as day. It was very close and very large, estimated to be 80 to 100 feet in diameter. The light was the only light visible and it remained stationary for about 10 to 15 minutes, then it suddenly flashed out leaving no trace. It was just gone. 

It did not appear to have any form or shape, the light was just a round, bright light, glowing, with the color and brilliance of a fluorescent light.
