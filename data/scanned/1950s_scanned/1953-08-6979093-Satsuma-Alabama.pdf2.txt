SATSUNA, AIARA
17 August 1953
Under date of 17 August 1953, Captain Gordon R. Gallep, USAF, 433rd 
Air Base Squadron, advises as follows:
On 17 August 1953 at 0835 hours local time, an object was reported to 
appear from the north, travel in a northwesterly direction, and disappear 
to the south. Witnesses described the object as a bright, fiery glow 
heading from the North to the South. No sound was associated with the 
object. Observers agreed that the object was not an aircraft and 
indicated no flight pattern that could be identified as that of a conven-
tional aircraft. Both observers agreed that the object was within their 
sight for approximately one minute. No further investigation was accom-
plished since the sighting had terminated and there was no need for 
further action. No photographs were taken.
Responsibility of observers is as stated above.
No interception was attempted since the sightings were late in being reported.
The sighting is reported as in Enclosure 77.
