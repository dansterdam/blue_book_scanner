Mr. Frank E. Norihamer

Willow Grove, Pennsylvania
Dear Mr. Norihamer:
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 6, 1952 reporting an observation of a strange object in the sky near Willow Grove, Pennsylvania on September 4, 1952 at approximately 10:00 PM. A review of your report indicates that you observed a bright, fast moving, object which left a white trail in the sky and was observed for a period of about 10 seconds before disappearing. No sound was heard and the object was described as being slightly larger than a star. No photographic evidence was obtained and your report has been filed for future reference.
Investigations into reports of this nature are conducted only when the sighting appears to have sufficient significance or when photographic evidence is available. In your case, since no photographs or other corroborative evidence was obtained, no further action can be taken at this time. However, your report has been noted and will be retained in our files.
We appreciate your interest in this matter and your willingness to report your observation. Your cooperation is helpful in our continuing effort to investigate reports of this nature.
Sincerely,
Captain Harry H. Bogner
Commanding Officer
