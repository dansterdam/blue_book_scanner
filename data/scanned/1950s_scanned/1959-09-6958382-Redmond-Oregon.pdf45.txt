SAFOI-34/MB/Jacker/mbh/72291

19 January 1960

Dear Mr **********

This is to acknowledge your letter of 31 December requesting various facts concerning unidentified flying objects as investigated by the United States Air Force.

The Portland, Oregon UFO sighting of 24 September 1959 is carried on the records of ATIC as "Insufficient Information." The ATIC account of the sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of the attempted intercept. It is the ATIC opinion that this object was probably a balloon as evidenced by its relatively long period in the area (more than an hour), and the fact that unless equipped with reflectors balloons are not good radar reflectors. The average direction and strength of the wind at the time of sighting was south at 15 knots.

Project Twinkle was discontinued in the last quarter of the calendar year 1951. The conclusions from the project were that unusual phenomena could be attributed to such man-made objects as airplanes, balloons, rockets, etc; others were attributed to natural phenomena such as flying birds, small clouds and meteorites. There was no mention in the conclusions as to the specific composition of "green fireballs."

ATIC is familiar with the theory of Dr. Donald Robey concerning the composition of "green fireballs," but as yet these theories have not been substantiated. Air Force studies of meteors have not revealed any data which would lead to similar conclusions as those proposed by Dr. Robey.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER Major, USAF Public Information Division Office of Information
