9. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING 	10. COMMENTS
One (1) round, reddish-white object, the size of a disc as same length, was observed by a civilian pilot for a fifteen year old.

The characteristics of this object seem to coincide with those of a balloon. The observer stated the object appeared and disappeared at the same point, but as the object went "straight up", and at the same time disappeared over the horizon, the rest of the facts seem to bear out a balloon sighting. No investigation authorized by this headquarters.
