There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page of the document. However, the document does contain handwritten text that appears to be responses to a questionnaire or form related to a UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
(The response indicates that the object did disappear while the witness was watching it, but does not provide further details.)

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(The witness responded "Yes" to this question.)

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(The witness responded "Yes" and provided a detailed description of the object's movement in front of a cloud.)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color
(The responses describe the sound and color of the observed object.)

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
(The witness provided a detailed response describing the size of the object in relation to a match stick held at arm's length.)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
(The witness provided a hand-drawn sketch showing the shape and details of the observed object.)
