FLOWER AND COOK OBSERVATORIES

Dear Sir:

Last year the Executive Officer was kindly, in reply to a request from me for information about certain fireballs which appeared in 1957, to send me some information. He stated besides, that during the past year or so a large number of fireballs have appeared over the eastern and in the central states, and in the cases of the five to be mentioned, I have been able to assemble a number of observations. But according to this I should furnish all the information I have about these fireballs for forwarding to appropriate offices. I am therefore sending you reports in your hands, dealing with these bodies.

Over 30 years effectively cooperated in such work and as a consequence it has been possible to solve for many important and useful scientific problems. The specific bodies I now request information on are:

1958 April 28/29 Southeastern States
1958 July 4/5 North Carolina etc.
1958 Nov. 30 South Carolina etc.
1958 Dec. 12/13 New York, New Jersey etc.
1959 Feb. 10/11 South Carolina etc.

It would be a great favor to science if you would be good enough to send me observations dealing with these fireballs.

Very sincerely yours,
