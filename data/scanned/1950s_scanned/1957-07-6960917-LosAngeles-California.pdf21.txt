AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
4 August 1957
CONTENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

The report indicates that the sighting was probably caused by balloons. However, the following possibilities are also considered:

1. Illusion: This could be attributed to "Searchlight" or small aircraft which could have appeared larger than normal.

2. Night Photography: Possibly an individual or concern with photographic skills launched and flares for night, aerial photography. However, it would require further investigation to substantiate any unusual conditions or phenomena.

3. As evaluation of "probable ball-cone" is given to this series of sightings.
