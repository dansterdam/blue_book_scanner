Memorandum for Record
Subject: Report of Unidentified Aerial Object
1. A.L. approximately 1200 on 25 Aug '52, an individual from Vandalia called and said that on the night of 24 Aug '52 he was in the Sherwood Drive-In at Dayton. He noticed two objects which were about 15 times the size of a star floating thru the sky at a rather high rate of speed. They seemed to have a "weird glow," similar to a light-bulb placed behind a thin cloud. He said that he was facing north and that the objects came out of the southeast, first came into view at about 45° to his right (southwest). They came across the sky at an elevation of about 45° and when they got into the southeast they just disappeared as if someone had turned the light out. The incident took place between 10 and 11 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.
2. Mr. stated that although he was extremely dubious of any publicity on "flying saucers" these things did have the appearance of a saucer. He was very apologetic about calling and stated that he had been a person who had scoffed the most at those "flying saucer" reports and that he did not say that the objects he saw were "flying saucers". He stated, however, that they definitely gave the appearance of being disc-shaped and he did not believe that they were aircraft.
