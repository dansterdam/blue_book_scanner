1. On 9 July 1954 at 2240 hours a Beacon radar station received a telephone call from a civilian operator who reported observing an unknown object. 
2. RADAR OBSERVATION: The radar station tracked the unknown object which was at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet and 60 miles from the radar site. The object was traveling at a speed of 700 mph. After tracking the object for approximately 30 minutes it suddenly increased in speed to about 1,800 mph at which time it disappeared from the radar screen.
3. VISUAL OBSERVATION: Two observers, a chief warrant officer and a civilian employee, made the visual observation. They reported the object appeared to be disc-shaped, slightly flattened on top and bottom, and emitting a bright reddish glow around the periphery. The estimated size of the object was approximately 35-40 feet in diameter. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes after initial sighting.
4. Witnesses were interviewed and statements obtained. The personnel were considered reliable and on duty at the time of the observation. This incident is of particular interest because of the accurate radar plotting and the visual confirmation by reliable observers.
