10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
KC-97's on refueling mission sighted 1 obj at 0705Z, contacted radar site which had obj on scope at 0708Z. Site held intermittent con- tact for 19 min, KC-97 tried to close after obj appeared (usually) to be hovering at 10 o'clock position. Obj climbed to est 40-50,000' when KC-97 tried to close. KC-97 lost visual contact Obj moved very fast, changed direction and jumped off radar scope. Formed circular patter then line abreast/

11. COMMENTS
Object still on P scope then accelerated to 1600 K and moved NE. Fighter scrambled negative results. At same time, radar was painting 5 smaller objs below KC 97's at an alt of 5 - 10,000'.
