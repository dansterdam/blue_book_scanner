5. PHOTOS
Yes
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
TWO OR THREE (2-3) SECONDS
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One (1) object, the size of a half dollar held at arm's length, appeared to be split in the middle and the two halves revolved around each other. The object was yellow and white. The object took two or three seconds to travel from a position directly overhead to the eastern horizon.
12. CONCLUSIONS
Was Blimp
Possibly Balloon
Possibly Aircraft
Possibly Astronomical
Insufficient Data for Evaluation

11. COMMENTS
Due to the delay in receiving the information, the investigation was not started until 1 1/2 months after the sighting. The duration of the sighting and the fact that the object crossed a major portion of the sky in a few seconds indicate the possibility of it being ASTRONOMICAL.
