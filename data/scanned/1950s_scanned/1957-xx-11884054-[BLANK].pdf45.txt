The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document summarizing the various manifestations of meteorological, astronomical, or psychological phenomena that have been discussed, and the possibility that new air vehicles, hostile aircraft, or missiles may be regarded as unfamiliar flying objects by the initial observer.

SUMMARY
The various manifestations that are created by meteorological, astronomical, or psychological phenomena have been discussed with the intent of assisting the air crew member in observing and reporting unfamiliar flying objects.

To date, the flying objects reported have imposed no threat to the security of the United States and its possessions. However, the possibility that new air vehicles, hostile aircraft, or missiles may first be regarded as unfamiliar flying objects by the initial observer is real.

The United States Air Force is charged with the responsibility of investigating the United States and its possessions, as well as its obligations. In order to discharge this responsibility, it is imperative that all unfamiliar flying objects be reported accurately, so that identification may be made through subsequent investigation.

Current Air Force regulations outline the procedures for reporting unfamiliar flying objects. However, it is believed that a clearer understanding of many natural phenomena, and of how to recognize the conditions under which they occur, will add to the validity of subsequent reports.
