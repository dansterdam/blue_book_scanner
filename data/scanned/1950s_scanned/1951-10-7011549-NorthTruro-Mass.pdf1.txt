11. COMMENTS
This sighting occurred about 8 hours later then* the other sighting (same report number)
ulch all conditions similar except for time, duration of tracking, and direction of the
track. The temperature and altitude information are the same, indicating no temperature
inversion. It would be unlikely that two meteor trails would be observed the same day,
and 2 minutes seems too long for this type of target. There isn’t sufficient data regarding
the track direction. range, changes, etc., to enable a meaningful evaluation to be made.
