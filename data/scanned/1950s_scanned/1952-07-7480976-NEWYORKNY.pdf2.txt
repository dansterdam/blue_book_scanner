FIELD INVESTIGATION REPORT

Location: New York, N. Y.
Date: 7 July 1952
Time: 11:45 P.M.
Weather: Clear, scattered clouds.

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:

At 11:45 P.M., an unidentified bright light was observed moving rapidly in a southerly direction across the sky. The light appeared to be round or elliptical in shape, and was described as being much brighter than any star or planet. It was observed for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared from view. No sound was heard, and no vapor trail was visible.

There were several other witnesses to this sighting, including two police officers who were on patrol in the area at the time. All observers agreed that the object did not appear to be an aircraft, helicopter, or any other known type of aerial vehicle.

CONCLUSION:

The nature and identity of the observed object remains unknown. It does not appear to match the characteristics of any conventional aerial vehicle. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the origin and nature of this unidentified aerial phenomenon.
