AT 1927 (Pacific Standard Time), 9 JANUARY 1953 over the city of Santa Ana, California, on a heading of 330Â° by co-pilot, i.e. Charles G. Loveless, called my attention to a formation of lights approaching the aircraft from a position of 63:30 o'clock level. The lights approached at a very rapid rate of closure and I immediately effected a turn to the left. The lights stopped and appeared to make a position maneuver at close range and then made a slight rise and disappeared. The total time of sighting was approximately 5 seconds. I immediately called Los Angeles radio and informed them of time, altitude and position of the objects. The weather was clear in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. As both pilots were familiar with the reflection characteristics of the B-29 aircraft, it was apparent the objects were checked to be ground reflections. There was no aircraft in the immediate vicinity and none was reported by Air Traffic Control and Military Flight Services. The lights seemed to appear in a slightly bent V formation and were blue in color. The formation appeared to change from a bank to a level position then stopped and sank away just before disappearance. The pilot and myself were the only members of the crew to view the lights. Our altitude was 15,500 feet. 

I further state that I am an Aircraft Commander (12343) assigned to a combat crew of the 53d Air Refueling Squadron, 53d Bomb Wing (M), Castle AFB, California. I have been on flying status for 7 years. I enclose a drawing of the appearance of the sighting.
