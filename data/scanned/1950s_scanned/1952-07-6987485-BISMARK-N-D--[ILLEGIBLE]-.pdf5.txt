PART B - OW STANINE'S CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING AIRCRAFT

On Monday, July 28, 1952, at 11:40 p.m., two or more objects were observed over Bismarck, North Dakota. These objects were in two separate groups, varying in an erratic direction. These objects were of a fantastic nature, extremely brilliant, and maneuvering in the sky in a most incredible manner. The objects were sighted by many witnesses, including reliable civilians, and they were observed for approximately 20 minutes. The objects were round in shape, estimated to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and were completely silent. No vapor trails nor exhaust were visible. The objects were described as being a bright white light, similar to a magnesium flare, and were seen to make extremely rapid stops and starts, 90 degree turns and complete reversals of direction. The objects were also seen to hover motionless at times, and then to accelerate to an extremely high rate of speed and disappear.

Following this incident, an Air Force jet interceptor was scrambled and was airborne within 10 minutes in an attempt to intercept the objects. However, the objects disappeared before the interceptor could make contact. Our intelligence impressions were that the performance of the objects was such that they were technically far in advance of any known aircraft at the present time.
