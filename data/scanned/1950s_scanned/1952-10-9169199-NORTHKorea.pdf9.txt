STATEMENT
17 October 1952

On 15 October 1952, at approximately 0503Z, the weather conditions were four tenths of cloud cover at 6500 feet and the visibility was estimated to be four miles. We had just finished checking in with the time was Control and were told to call their Control every fifteen minutes. We had just taken off and were climbing to other control points when an object appeared to be an aircraft passing over us. At this time, the object Grid Square 56040 was observed and appeared to be a balloon. It was approximately 17,000 feet in altitude and traveled from East to West at a speed of approximately 100 knots. At this time, there were approximately sixty-three hundred (6300) feet in altitude and the object was approximately 600 mph.

I called the attention of the object to Ist Lt. Hooper for his observation. The first time, I couldn't determine the object and a first sighting, I appeared what may have been a reflection of the sun. As the object came closer, it appeared that the object was approximately 200 feet in diameter and silver in color. The object hovered at this distance for approximately one minute. At this time, the object appeared to increase in speed and speed away from us and disappeared from sight to the West. The object was 25 feet in diameter and silvered in color. Those observing it through binoculars said the object then appeared to be spherical in shape. The aircraft was approximately 6000 mph. We turned the aircraft to keep the object under observation.

The object then stopped for a period of observation and then resumed flight at a high rate of speed and disappeared. Our observation with continued and even the other pilots were wearing Air Force issued sun glasses. The object hovered in Grid Square 56048.
