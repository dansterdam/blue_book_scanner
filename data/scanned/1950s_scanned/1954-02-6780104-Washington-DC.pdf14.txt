There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text describing an incident that occurred on May 2, 1957. The text discusses an optical analysis plot that indicated the probable size of the observed object was between 5 to 12 feet in diameter, and the distance at which it was observed was between 6 to 12 miles. The report also mentions that a balloon was released by the weather unit shortly before the observers spotted the object, and that the balloon's elevations, bearings, and times coincided almost exactly with those of the camera crew's observations.

EDWARDS AFB
INCIDENT 
2 May 1957

The optical analysis plot, graphically depicted, indicated that the probable size of the object was between 5 to 12 feet in diameter, and the distance at which it was observed was between 6 to 12 miles.

A reply from the weather unit confirmed that a balloon was released
West of the observers, approximately five minutes before they observed it, visually. Further, the balloon was tracked by precise instruments. The elevations, bearings and times coincided almost exactly with those of the camera crew.
