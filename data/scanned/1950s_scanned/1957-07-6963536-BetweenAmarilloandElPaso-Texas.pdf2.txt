This object was observed 28 miles west of Amarillo, Texas, on
July 6, 1957, at approximately 2:30 a.m. The object was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. The object circled the airplane
and then suddenly accelerated and shot away at a fantastic
speed. The pilot estimated the object's speed to be 3,000 mph.
The object was estimated to be 50 to 75 feet in diameter. The pilot requested a chase but was denied by the authorities. Pilot
was interviewed and his reliability and qualifications were establi-
shed. This was an official Air Force report.
