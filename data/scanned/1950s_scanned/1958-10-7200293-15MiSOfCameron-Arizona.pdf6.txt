"They got real bright and white- The stars, but a lot bigger and moving very fast."

"We called the engine observer, and he was watching them. They must have been a mile or so north of us, real low because the next time we saw them they came moving in back of us. The were coming a lot faster this time--a lot faster than the train when they first went by."

"They lit up twice like I told you. They did that twice as they went and the color changed. When the first lit up they were bright white, then they changed to a kind of yellow, then to orange when they went real slow."

"Robinson agreed with this description. He added that he had seen them from the back end of the train for several minutes after they went away to the east and then they went away."
