The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text from the document:

ON 23 JULY 1952 at 0800 I noticed an unusual object in the sky. My initial observation was that it appeared to be a glowing ball with a trail. After observing it for a short time, it maneuvered rapidly and changed direction a number of times, disappearing from view in approximately five minutes.
