8. The observers were Mr. G. H. McGarrigle and Mrs. McGarrigle.
9. Mrs. McGarrigle stated that her husband was not one given to hallucinations nor imagination, and he is positive that what he saw was not the moon.
10. The object was observed in the sky at an angle of approximately 40 degrees from the horizon, over Langley AFB approximately 10-15 miles away. It also varied somewhat in the car at different times.
11. The object was observed from 2115 to 2200 operations 10 September 1956, but due to the distance and the limited illumination of the object, it is necessary to make a more detailed investigation. This is being arranged for.
Comments of Investigating Officer:
1. The object was a bright object which the observers stated would fall within the 10 to 100 feet in diameter category and appeared to be illuminated from within. It was observed for approximately 45 minutes and was not observed to remain stationary but showed up and down and horizontal motion.
2. In all and though the object was not observed to be of unconventional design, the nature of the observation and the apparent characteristics of the object warrant further detailed investigation.
