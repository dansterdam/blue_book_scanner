REPORT OF U.F.O. SIGHTING BY MR. AND MRS. XXXXXXXXXXX OF BROOKSIDE KNOLL,
GREENFIELD, MASS.:
(Experience related to Mr.- Albert Ballon- by Mrs. George (Jeanne) Kendrick:)
Mr. L. awoke at about 2 a.m. Wednesday, August 1. From his bed he could see
through window to the East. His attention was drawn to an extremely bright,
orange "star" of enormous size which hung about 10 degrees above horizon and
almost due N.E. He wakened Mrs. L. who was so impressed by this strange sight
that she went outdoors to get an unobstructed view of it. Because it was so
large and so bright, she remained awake from 2 until 4 a.m. watching it ... She
gives the object's size as being about half the size of the full moon, but much
more brilliant with "deep, deep orange color". Not noticed at first, but later
in her two hours of observation, was a narrow, rope-like beam of light which
emerged from one side of the disc and extended vertically for "considerably
distance" (See Illustration). Also, after watching this object for a short
While, she noted another object (not clearly visible at first, because of the
brilliant light of object #1) which was a short distance in front of the disc
and of a dull, silver color. Also,this second object, which looked "like a
large silver peanut, standing on end", showed a rather irregular contour and
its edges were not sharply defined as with the disc. (See illustration.)
After watching this spectacle for a time, Mrs. L. reports that a new develop-
ment took place. Suddenly the bright, orange disc began to "spit out tiny,
White stars" which began to drift away very slowly over Greenfield and the con-
necticut River valley. They drifted with no obvious pattern, sometimes alone,
sometimes two or three together in a "completely crazy, aimless manner."
She counted them as they appeared and found that there were eight of these
smaller, stea=-like objects. When Mr. L. took a final look at the disc at
4 a.m., these smaller, star-like objects were no longer apparent.
Mrs. L. retired at 4 a.m. with the object still there, but she realized that
it was "moving with the stars" as time passed. When she retired it had moved
from about 10 degrees above the N.E. horizon to approximately 25 degrees and
appeared to be shifting from N.E. to E.
At 7:30 a.m. Mrs. L. looked again and saw the disc, now at about 30 degrees to
above the N. horizon and appearing as a silver disc. She did not watch to
observe when or how it finally disappeared. However, the following morning
at 2 a.m. o'clock it appeared again in the same place, and again on two
third morning at the same time. She did not check to see if it was there on
Saturday or Sunday mornings, but I did check last night ) (at 3 a.m. Monday)
and saw nothing aside from the usual pattern of stars.

She says this is much as the object appeared . My only comment is that whenever I hav$
observed the unusual phenomenon, the sky was clear and the moor
