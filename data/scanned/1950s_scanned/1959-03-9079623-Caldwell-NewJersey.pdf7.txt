1. The possibility of Mr. XXXXXXXX seeing one of the satellites and 1st c/o carrier was considered. Upon checking, it was determined no known satellites were in the area at time of sighting.

2. Assuming the figure of two degrees per second and 50,000 feet altitude, the ground speed would be around 600 knots, which is within the speed range of jet aircraft. It is quite possible the objects were at a lower altitude than 50,000 feet; however, a small error in the witnesses' estimate of time would have a large effect upon the resultant speed.

3. The AFIO conclusion is that in all probability the witnesses saw aircraft lights.
