SAFIS-3/Agd Tacker/11/73328

14 April 1958

Dear Mr.

Captain Marley has requested that we answer your letter of 31 March 1958, since some of the information you requested is in our files of confidential material. 

First, regarding your request for the procedure to obtain footage from the military services for motion pictures, this is covered by existing Air Force regulations. The procedure may be purchased by a representative of your organization. Approved scripts are required in advance of this production. Approved scripts are forwarded to the appropriate film depository where the footage may be selected for purchase such footage as is commensurate with the production plans of the Department of Defense.

I should caution you again, that good motion picture footage is not always available from any official source. As was pointed out in earlier correspondence, exhaustive research has not disclosed any authentic evidence that would indicate the existence of flying saucers. Therefore, the Air Force does not have any special film that would radiate on a television screen.

As you will re-read your correspondence, dated 31 June 1957, from Major Robert J. Friend, you will note that there is not any such film in our possession. You should also add, since you cited Mr. Ruppelt's book, that it was claimed only for security purposes and in fact a disclaimer for factual accuracy was made at that time by the Department of Defense.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
