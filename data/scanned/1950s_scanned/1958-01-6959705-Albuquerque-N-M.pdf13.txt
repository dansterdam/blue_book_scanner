The image contains a photograph of a document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be an old UFO report. The document discusses the Trindade affair, where witnesses observed a UFO and took photographs of it. The text mentions that the photographs were not able to capture much detail due to the speed and distance of the object, but it provides a description of what the witnesses observed. The text also discusses the Rolleiflex camera frame size and the fact that the photographs show the UFO measured about 3.25 inches on the frame.

early that month I saw Chapter 16, and seems to It was several weeks later, in the month of the sauceyr engagement, ho was no longer certain just what he had seen. First, he said to make it very clear that I don't know if what I saw was really a saucer. "What I saw was definitely some sort of flying object, and I'm quite certain that it wasn't any conventional aircraft," he said. He added that it was a large, silvery object which moved with tremendous speed and suddenly disappeared in the horizon. It did not possess any protrusions or wings, and emitted no noise. After making observations for a few seconds, it was gone, disappearing very rapidly towardsc the horizon line. Everything happened in a matter of less than twenty seconds, and for this reason I gave you more details about the curious craft. It looked like an object with a polished surface and uniform color. I am sure it was not a balloon, an airplane, or a sea gull." This description does not mention the dark band around the object or the "Saturn-like" appearance noted. It sounds remarkably like a description of the typical or standard flying saucer.
When asked whether the object he saw was the same as that on Baumanns film, he said before, "As I said before, the thing was too rapid. 
It was almost impossible for the human vision to fix any detail of the object. Mr. Baumann, however, was operating with a camera of modern type which was able to register these details. Generally speaking the shape of the object sighted was the same seen on the negatives. . . " [24]

The Trindade Photographs
Accounts of the Trindade affair often remark that the photographs must be genuine because no opportunity for fraud occurred. On the contrary, there were ample and repeated opportunities. Since Baumann was not under observation when he loaded his camera, he could easily have inserted a "prepared" film, with no one the wiser. With the type of camera used, the operation would have been simple. He was again free from observation when he developed the negatives. Captains Bacellar recorded him to the door of the darkroom but remained outside, on guard at the door. The only person to accompany Baumann inside to help by holding a flashlight was his friend Viegas--the same man who had cried "Flying saucer!"
When Baumann emerged with the developed film, he exclaimed "Look, comrades, we have observed the UFO." The witnesses allegedly agreed, however, that the negatives showed the object they had seen in the sky--an amazing fact when we remember that the Rolleiflex film frame is small, only about 2.25 inches square.
In the print of Frame 3 shown in 0 Case-file, the UFO measures approx 3.25 inches.
