The image contains a photograph of a new radar plane, described as a "new saucer-domed radar plane" that is in the planning stage. The text states that this new type of aircraft may easily be mistaken for an unfamiliar flying object due to its unique configuration.

NEW FLYING OBJECTS

A new saucer-domed radar plane, now in the planning stage, is an example of an unfamiliar type of aircraft which, to the uninitiated observer, might appear to fall into the unidentified flying object category.

Technical advancements in the field of supersonic rockets to gather weather data offer possibilities for radar detection of apparently unidentified flying objects. Rockets will be shot into the stratosphere at 3000-plus miles per hour. At a height of 20 miles or more, their wakes will explode and release a cloud of metal foil fragments, which will be tracked by radar to learn wind velocity and direction.

The construction and successful launching of man-made satellites into the edge of space above the earth is part of the International Geophysical Year program, which began on 1 July 1957, may lead to reports of unidentified flying objects. The United States expects to launch a scientific data-gathering satellite in 1958 at the latest. At least one other country has announced intentions of duplicating this feat.

This new radar plane may easily be mistaken for an unfamiliar flying object, under unusual weather conditions, because of its unique configuration.
