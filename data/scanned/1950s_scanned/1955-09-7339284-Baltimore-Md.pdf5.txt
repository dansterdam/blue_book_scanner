FLIGHT: 2-11-1652-A-1555 
PARTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: PROBABLE
1. The report of the Preparing Officer, the UFOB sighting was probably caused by the blinking night lights from one or more of the Andrews AFB jets flying toward or from the Baltimore-Washington figure on 09/02/52 and 09/03/52 Sept. 25.

(3) The observers did hear sounds of aircraft in the area while they observed the lights, and the sounds were coming from beyond the area illuminated by the lights.
