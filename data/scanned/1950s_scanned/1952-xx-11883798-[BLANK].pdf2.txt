The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

In order to accomplish the above it will be necessary for the Air Force to make a PIO release similar to "White Paper". In addition to explaining the Air Force policy (and proposed plan) for investigating future UAO observations, this paper should note that valuable scientific data will become available as a result of the proposed plan for implementing the collection thereof by use of instruments. It should be pointed out that only such data that is of military nature will be classified, whereas fully scientific data will be released to the scientists cooperating on the project and will be valuable to them in their studies. 

As in the collection activities, so in the analyses operations it is planned to hold costs to a minimum by the employment of existing military and public agencies to a maximum. For this reason conferences have already been held with MATS to work out arrangements whereby the Balloon Screening activities will be monitored by the Air Weather Service and Aircraft Screening will be monitored by Flight Service.

The speakers who follow me will explain the technical details of the instrumentation plan.

Thank You.
