The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, featuring a handwritten description of an observed oval-shaped object.

When I first observed the oval-shaped object, it seemed small and vaguely defined. In between 5 & 10 seconds, it grew larger, as though approaching, and became sharp and clear in shape and color. The light from the object was steady. No wobbling motion was apparent. At first it was in the N.E. After seeming to approach, it ceased to increase in brilliance and size. It then moved slowly across the sky (keeping at the same distance from the horizon) to the S.E.
