AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
16 SEPTEMBER 1954

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Observed Over Korea
LT COL KENT LEE, Office of Special Investigations (OSI) - Korea, reported that on 8 AUGUST 1954 at approximately 1800 hours, while airborne in an F-86 jet aircraft approximately 30 miles east of Seoul, Korea, he observed a bright circular object at an altitude of approximately 36,000 feet. The object appeared to be brighter than the sun and was approximately the same size as a quarter held at arm's length. The object was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, many times faster than the F-86 jet aircraft which was traveling at an airspeed of approximately 600 knots at the time.

The duration of the observation was approximately 3 to 5 seconds. After the initial sighting, the object appeared to change course and traveled in a southerly direction. LT COL LEE immediately reported this observation on all command operations.
