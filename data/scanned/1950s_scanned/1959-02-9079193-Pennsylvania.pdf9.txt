The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

Lights being approximately 30 degrees above the American Airlines pilot's horizon and his seeing them for 40 minutes. This coincides with the pilot's report of lights apparently below the United Airlines pilot's reported sightings at 3:45 p.m., 50 miles west of Ashtabula, Ohio. This would account for the tanker aircraft lights being sighted over Ashtabula at 9:15 p.m. The tankers had a ground speed of approximately 210 knots and were flying at 30,000 feet. This would account for the tanker aircraft lights being sighted over Ashtabula at 9:15 p.m.

These findings were made available to all media representatives through the Director of Information Services on 16 March 1959. The Air Force is well aware of its obligation to keep the public adequately informed on this subject and press releases are made periodically through the Department of Defense.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense press releases on unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,
