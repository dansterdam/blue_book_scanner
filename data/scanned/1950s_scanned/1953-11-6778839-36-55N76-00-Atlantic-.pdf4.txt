The image appears to contain a photograph of an experimental aircraft or "flying saucer" design. The text below the photograph discusses the capabilities of this aircraft, referred to as the "A.V. Displays Flying Saucer", which is described as being able to travel at speeds up to 2,000 miles per hour.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"The Air Force last night revealed this first picture of a flying saucer design as a by-at-2,000-miles an hour propulsion research model disclosed by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. This model, designed by Douglas Aircraft Company, is powered by a turbojet engine and is only 18 feet in diameter, but its wing span is less than that of a DC-2.
A.V. Displays "Flying Saucer"
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 (#)--The Air Force continues from the staring science fiction stories to my 2,000 miles an hour streamliner saucer planes.
The 18-foot "flying saucer" was built by Douglas Aircraft Company under a Navy contract, and was tested and evaluated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. It is powered by a turbojet engine and is described as a "research model" for vertical-rising, high-speed, long-range flight. The Air Force says nothing more. But its wing span is less than that of a DC-2 airliner and it has a highly streamlined shape reminiscent of the "flying saucers" that have been reported from so many quarters in the past few years. It has a long, narrow, slender shape, something like two dinner plates put together with the rims facing opposite ways. The research model is only 18 inches deep from top to bottom.
