DATE OF INFORMATION: 29 May 1955
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object
1. On 29 May 1955, at approximately 1015 hours, observation of an unidentified flying object was made at PARKER, ARIZONA.
2. At approximately 1015 hours, FIRST LIEUTENANT FRANK M. BAKER, while performing routine ground duties, observed a bright, white, circular object moving in a northwesterly direction at extremely high speed. The object was observed for approximately 15 seconds and disappeared from sight.
3. The object appeared to be circular in shape, the size of a basketball at arm's length, and was bright white in color. It was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft. Due to the high speed and brief observation time, no details were discernible. The object was seen against a clear blue sky.
4. No other witnesses were present at the time of the observation. The weather was clear with a few scattered clouds. No sounds were associated with the object.
5. Report submitted by: FIRST LIEUTENANT FRANK M. BAKER, USAF.
