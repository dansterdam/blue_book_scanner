I. SOURCE: Mrs (blacked out)
Address: (blacked out), Graham, North Carolina
Occupation: Housewife and COC Chief Observer
Education: High School Graduate

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was completely thorough in her description of the sightings. SOURCE was extremely cooperative and of average intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS: SOURCE and her husband were on duty at the COC post at Fairchild Field, Graham, North Carolina (GULG 305), when the object was sighted at a 170° azimuth and at an elevation of 10°. SOURCE observed the object at 0501L52 Mar 56, and was certain she observed it for ten minutes. She reported the observation in the Durham, North Carolina, Filter Center (GUMP 0559) and was instructed to continue watching the object. The Filter Center informed SOURCE that no aircraft were in her vicinity.

The sky was clear and many stars were visible. The moon condition was not recalled. The weather was cool and dry; a slight breeze was blowing. The object appeared to stand still at times and to speed up. It did not break up, give off smoke, change in brightness or shape, flicker or throb. It moved neither in front of nor behind anything else. It appeared to be solid and ranged in color from amber to red and was brighter than an auto headlight at a distance greater than a mile. From red its turned green, and then back to amber; this occurred at regular intervals. The object made no sound. SOURCE viewed object through eyeglasses, 7x50 binoculars, and window glass, the edges of the object looked like a bright star. SOURCE was certain that the object appeared in size by a quarter held at arm's length, and she was looking just southeast when the object was first sighted and south when it disappeared. Object did not disappear due to distance but sank below the horizon. SOURCE stated that the object appeared to be approximately 60 miles away. When the object disappeared it was on an azimuth of 180° and an elevation of 0°. This was the first sighting of this type SOURCE had ever observed.

At the same time on the next evening (0601L52 Mar 56) SOURCE observed the same object at the same location. Its characteristics were the same as the night before, but it was observed for thirty minutes on that occasion.
