Dear Mr. ???,

We wish to express our sincere appreciation for the assistance which you extended to us in connection with your review. We had difficulty in obtaining results, but those will be used for official purposes only, of course.

Instead of mailing the film, as the torn caption, as discussed with you previously, it is apparent with celluloid tearing shows it happened probably during shipment as well as the contents of the film. We regret the inconvenience caused, but sincerely hope that the reimbursement has adequately covered any expense which you may have incurred. Since the return will not be possible, we make a permanent action as soon as possible.

The nature of this definite contribution is our current analysis. It is impossible for us to add any further comments about them until much thing is determined regarding the relationship with the basis for some definite conclusions, if any is possible.

Again we tender our sincere thanks for your cooperation and hope that the film's absence has not caused you any hardship.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM A. ADAMS
