The text in the document is as follows:

The Intelligence Officer, 1236th Air Base Group, Ernest Harmon AF Base, Newfoundland, reported the sighting of an unidentified object near Sandy Point, Newfoundland, by three (3) Newfoundland native employees of the Motor Transport Division of Ernest Harmon AF Base. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes on 9 August 1950, at 2301Z (7:01 p.m.). The three witnesses, all employed for one and a half years (151/2), are 28, 34 and 35 years old, also employed by USAP for the last 2 1/2 years (21/2).

The sighting was made from approximately two miles off Indian Head (48째 29' N - 58째 30' W) and was approximately between Indian Head and Stephensville (48째 32' N - 58째 15' W) and approximately 1 to 1 1/2 miles off shore.

The object appeared to be about dark in color, round or barrel-shaped, and was described by all three witnesses as being round, black, or blue in color, about the size of a barrel and resembled a glider or an inflated balloon, according to their opinion. However, they decided it was possibly a balloon or some object released from the upper atmosphere. When it first appeared, it seemed to hover and then slowly descended until almost on the water again. This flying and descending occurred until it disappeared. Each cycle of ascending and descending lasted approximately 40-60 seconds. The object was observed to surface for approximately 5-10 minutes for approximately 3-5 times.

The water transportation officer, USAF, rated all three men as very reliable, stating that all were quiet and truthful.
