AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DRS 3-6004th AFIS 
REPORT NO. 52-269

1. Estimates of size, distance and altitude are vague since no definite references could be established. Since the object came from behind and apparently did end up at some distance to the North, it was evidently moving at a speed in excess of the 777.

Observers' conversation just fail to provide any visible passing under the determined cloud cover. The object was sighted silhouetted against the darkened sky during the attempted interception.
