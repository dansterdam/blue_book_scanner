Dr. Herbert S. Bennet, EMC, Fort Monmouth, N.J.
Statement of Dr. Bennet
EMC is interested in countering airborne devices. They are limited in scope of operation to anything that can be countered from a ground installation. Their operations pertain to Army operation.
Major Martin, observer at Twin Lights, heard pilots' comments on radio at his station. When Bennet heard via commercial radio that pilots observed an object, he contacted Martin to see if an echo was received on radar scope.
Dr. Bennet stated that EMC (Electronics Warfare Corps) was not operating or performing tests that would cause phenomenon as picked up by radar scopes.
Dr. Bennet also stated that he was not aware of other projects that could cause these radar sightings.
When questioned as to date, Dr. Bennet stated that the incident happened the day before he visited Major Martin. The radio report was on the same day that he made his visit to Major Martin who was in charge of a CPS-6B radar installation. When queried as to possible causes of such sightings, he suggested several possibilities:
1. Constant altitude balloon: In order to maintain constant altitude during night and day operation (diurnal variants) it is necessary that the balloon drop ballast at night. If for some reason or other, a faulty release prevented dropping of ballast during night, the balloon would float to a low altitude. This would cause the balloon to define on the top which would make it look like a saucer shape when looking down on upper surface. The possibility of the pilots looking down on the object just as the faulty mechanism released the ballast would indicate an increase in vertical velocity. This balloon could be either a General Mills or NYU project. It was Dr. Bennet's belief that this was the cause of the radar sightings.
