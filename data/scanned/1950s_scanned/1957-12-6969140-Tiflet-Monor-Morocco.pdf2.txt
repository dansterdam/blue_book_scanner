Report 1-58, dtd 12 Dec 1957
IN-50-00055 (see attached sheets)

1. Light was sighted flashing rapidly, changing conditions when the lay attempts to stay fixed on eyere objects in the sky above in the general direction bearings or elevations are often unreliable. This is particularly true when roads are hilly or other perfectly straight road flat. The object allons invariably appear to move and change elevation.

2. Light was observed for 15 minutes.

3. Observer describes UFO as a "light" in portions of the report, and as an "object" in others.

4. It is significant to point out that the planet Venus was in the ESW (the position determined after the car stopped and the bearing of the light taken). This body is so familiar during December that comment was made by both the press and scientific papers (see incls).

When the lights were observed, at what appear to be unusual appearance at sunset or dawn when the low, silent light of the sun strikes them. As shown from numerous similar reports the reconstitulent colors are yellow, red or orange-red.
