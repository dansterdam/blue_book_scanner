Washington, D.C.

e. Capt Cunnion, Commander, Flight 3D, #502d AIGS, Andrews AFB,

(1) Capt Cunnion was contacted and the purpose of the unheld
   signal's mission was explained. Capt Cunnion agreed that he
   would get all the weather and radar information for the
   period 2100 to 2230 hours, 24 May 1957 and dispatch it to
   AITC. However, on Friday 24 June 1957 Capt Cunnion was
   again contacted by phone and a verbatim account of weather
   and radar were given as follows: weather, clear, dry and
   cool; wind NW @ 10 miles per hour. There was no moon,
   only a few stars visible.

(2) A U.S. Army site which was the nearest point to the sight-
   ing area with radar gave a negative report for the period
   indicated above.

f. Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, Maryland.

(1) A request was sent to the Commanding General, Aberdeen
   Proving Ground, for all available information concerning
   any activities taking place at the base on the night of
    24 May 1957 to be forwarded to AITC. At 1830 hours
    27 June 1957 in a telephone conversation between Col.
    Desens, Operations Officer, US Air Force & Aberdeen
    Proving Ground, Maryland, and undersigned, it was determined
    by review of records that on the night of 24 and 25 May
    1957 between 9:30 and 10:30 PM EDT that an aerial
    demonstration involving B-26s took place over the area of
    Whaton Creek, Maryland; and that World War II parachute
    flares were dropped. Verification of this demonstration
    is contained in Inclosure #2 of this report.
    AND FLASH BOMBS

c. CONCLUSION

7. Based on all the information obtained from this investigation, it
   appears certain that this sighting was caused by an experiment or test of
   certain types of flares by the U.S. army and that they originated from
   Aberdeen Proving Ground, which is located near the subject sightings.

D. RECOMMENDATION

e. That the UFO case investigated herein be entered in the UFO case file
   under the category of OTHER,(Flares) of unusual nature.
