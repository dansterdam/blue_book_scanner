"It appears that a remarkable sighting occurred slightly earlier this evening. They are certain that the object they observed was not an airplane or other conventional aircraft. They sai d it moved in a way that no aircraft they had ever seen could move. Its maneuvers were incredible and not at all like the movements of any known type of aircraft. 

It appeared to be much larger than an airplane, and it remained in view for approximately 45 minutes. They are convinced that it was not weather balloon or any other known object. They watched it move back and forth, stop suddenly, and then take off at tremendous speed. It was unlike anything they had ever seen before.  

The director of this incident is certain that they actually saw something extraordinary. Just a few minutes ago he telephoned the ATIC and related the details of their sighting, requesting that the matter be investigated further.

This description and details of this sightinge were made within a short time after the occurrence and are considered to be highly reliable. Their credibility appears to be excellent, and it would seem that this report merits thorough investigation."
