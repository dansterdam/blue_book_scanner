METEORITE BIDS ARE COMING IN

Bids on the nine-pound meteorite that plummeted into an Alabama living room four days ago and shook a house and fast asleep Sylacauga housewife are coming in.

But the meteorite itself was apparently flying low and slow-courtesy of the U.S. Air Force. 

Officials at Westover-Peterson Air Force base said they were slated to arrive here for analysis Friday afternoon. It's in yet. But they "presume" it's en route.

Air Technical Intelligence Center specialists will study the curious visitor before returning it to its owners, Mr. and Mrs. Hewlett Hodges of Sylacauga, Ala.

MEANWHILE, Hodges reported receiving at least 75 bids for the object, including one from the public museum. The highest bid so far, he said, is "an excess of $500" to the highest bidder.

Mrs. Hodges, who was struck on the hip and hand by the stone when it hurtled into her home Tuesday, remained in a Sylacauga hospital, recovering from bruises and nervous shock.
