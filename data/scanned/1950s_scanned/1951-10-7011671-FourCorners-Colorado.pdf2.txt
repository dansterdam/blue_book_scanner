TYPE OF OBSERVATION    Sighting of unidentified objects
SUMMARY: About 1230, 10 October 1951, what was thought to be a scouting aircraft was observed over the Four Corners area of Colorado. It was described as a bright silver-like object, flying in a NNW to SSE direction at a very high altitude. The object appeared to be traveling at very high speed and was observed for a period of 35 minutes by several persons. No sound was heard. The object maintained a straight course and showed no deviation from its flight path. It was also observed by an experienced pilot who gave the same description. The reporting agency is considered a creditable source, is a private organization, but it is considered dependable and its observer was a competent observer who gave a clear picture of what he saw and his reactions to it.
