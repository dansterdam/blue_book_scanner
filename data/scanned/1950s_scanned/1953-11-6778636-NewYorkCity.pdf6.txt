Sir:

Three weeks ago next Tuesday not being able to sleep I sat facing the East as I often do and to my left in the line of vision where I have a very clear view of the Hudson and the Jersey shore between the French building to the left on 5th Ave and the corner of 45th St and Madison Ave, where the Ritz-Carlton formerly stood.

Suddenly a fading circle of light about the size of a large dinner plate and much lighter than a star, though it seemed to be illuminating the surface or the river was seen. It seemed to be floating very clear out seemed to be moving very slowly as it moved along the surface of the river.

It was not a falling star sort of medium size like the things I had seen described in papers as unidentified flying objects.
