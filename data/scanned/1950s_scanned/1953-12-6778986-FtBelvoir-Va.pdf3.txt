"1. Between 0530 and 0515, 16 December 1953, five members of the 515th Engineer Pipeline Company observed three bright objects pass overhead at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The objects were pale blue-green in color and appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, witnessed by three of the five witnesses, Cpl. X and Pvt. Y at 0939, 15 December 1953."

"2. Narrative report of interview follows:

"Pvt. Z observed, at approximately 0930, a bright illuminous object without definite shape at an altitude of approximately 1,000-6,000 ft in a WSW direction from the 515th Engineer Pipeline Company Operations. Upon being questioned, Pvt. Z brought this to the attention of Cpl. Y, who also witnessed this object. As a second illuminous object became visible at approximately 0935, it appeared to turn the sky over, but not of such intensity to disthanchen (sic) the stars. Both objects then appeared to be moving, the first (which appeared first) at a somewhat slower rate than the second. The color of the objects appeared to be most noticeable at the time."

"Both objects were bright, but not of such intensity to disthanchen (sic) the sky. The objects turn the sky over, but not of such intensity to ditch ance. the stars and green. The red color seemed to be most noticeable at the time the objects appeared to be moving, closer being more notice able than when stationary."

"The objects were approximately 75 degrees apart; the first appearing to be over Davison Army Air Field, the second (which appeared later) to the southwest."
