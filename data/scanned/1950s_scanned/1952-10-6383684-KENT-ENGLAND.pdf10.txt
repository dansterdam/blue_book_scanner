The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with a form filled out, likely by a witness reporting a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound _____None_______________
b. Color __INTENSE SILVER COLOR__

17. Describe that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include any distinguishing features of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
ONLY A CIRCLE WHICH APPEARED TO BE FLAT WITH THE FLAT SURFACE FACING DIRECTLY TOWARDS ME

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Clear, Distinct __ b. Fuzzy, blurred __
c. Like a bright star __ d. Don't remember __

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there? _ONLY ONE_
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
