SAW SPUTNIK
WOMAN SAYS

Mrs. Helen Murphy of 113 
Hickory st. reported today 
that she saw what she thinks 
was Sputnik's rocket passing
over this area last night.
She said it was close to 10:00 
after and looked like a bright
star. "It moved faster than
a shooting star," she said.
"It was moving from north 
to south as it went. I saw it
and ran into the house to
get my husband. He came
out and we could see it in
the direction of the front
yard around to the back yard to 
watch some more. I guess we
could see it for a couple
minutes, something like that.
I looked just like the stars only
it was moving. I thought at
first it was a comet but it was
moving faster than it was.
"We saw nothing like it before
and he could have been wrong
in what I thought it was," she
said. 
H. L. Kissell, board president 
of the Morgantown chamber of
commerce, said his Morgantech team
would be looking againtonigit from
6:15 to 7:30 p.m.
