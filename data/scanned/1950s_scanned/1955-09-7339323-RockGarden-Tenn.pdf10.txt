AF FORM 112-PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1951
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (AGENCY): 2-0-u, 41002d ATSS
REPORT NO.: 2B-UTDR-I-55 Part Four Cont'd
COMMENTS of Preparing Officer Continued:
fact that SOURCE changed her description of the object from being "almost square" in the preliminary investigation to being "pointed like a rocket and having stubby wings" in the following investigation, and one can only wonder about the reliability of this report.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
1. Due to the change of description of the object from "almost square" and about the size of a "baseball hold at arm's length" to "pointed like a rocket with small stubby wings", it is the opinion of this headquarters that the witness can be considered "unreliable".
2. In view of the above, it can be assumed that the SOURCE is probably in error in other statements which as the duration of the sighting. It is the opinion of this headquarters that the SOURCE possibly misinterpreted one or more of the aircraft known to be in "that" area at the time of the sighting.
