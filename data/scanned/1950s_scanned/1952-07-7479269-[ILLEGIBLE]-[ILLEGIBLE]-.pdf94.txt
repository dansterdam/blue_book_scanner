The image does not contain any photograph or visual content. It appears to be a page from an "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" document from Project Blue Book. 

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PAGE 2 OF 2
In turning two minutes later, one of these flashes again made its appearance. This time the lash endured for somewhat over a second, and was much brighter than before. When it disappeared, the balloon, or balloons, appeared to be much closer, and the two halves each of which retained its shape, and that one of these in turn broke into two was now more clearly evident until it threatened to disappear from view entirely. 
The phenomena could be observed in the lower layers, cutting the balloon or balloons and an unusual color or glow surrounding them for more than a hour in the air at the horizon. It had an eccentric motion at times, and gave the impression of traveling on an east-west course during the observation period. The thin cirrus cloud which the balloon seemed to have entered appeared to have no effect on its brilliance and shape after bursting.
Editorial comments: It has also been suggested that these might be explained by the well-known effects of pressure or temperature changes against the splitting of the image.
