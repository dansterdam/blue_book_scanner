Dear Sirs:

I am inclosing a small portion of a large amount of material that apparently fell from the skies in northern Ohio. There is evidence that this could not have dropped from any means of aerial transportation.

My friends, who have sent this to me, asked me for an explanation, and I am forwarding some of the material to you for your evaluation. I have only specializations that would give them the ability to give them the facts.

Certainly, I will appreciate your comments and results of your examinations.

Sincerely and respectfully,
[Signature redacted]
