There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically a "Memo Routing Slip" from Project Blue Book.

MEMO ROUTING SLIP
PLAN OF TITLE: COL PERMISSION
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: 3700 AIR FORCE 4LS BLDg
COL Hoffmann
REF J J Mocker
ARP13-3

REMARKS:
1. This analysis concerns an UFO sighting by a private subject.
2. The description is characteristic of a meteor. It was a bright object moving rapidly on a downward trajectory. Its motion was very impressive, as described by the "flying saucer" book he had just finished, and was similar to a "saucer".
