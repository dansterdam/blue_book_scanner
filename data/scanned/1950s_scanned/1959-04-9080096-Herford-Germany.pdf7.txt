Dear Sir,

I seem to satisfy somewhat my curiosity regarding the object I sighted the night of 12 April 1959, 22:45, with the following details:

At the time, it was a very clear night, and I was looking out a window in the direction of the Herford military airfield. Suddenly, I observed a bright, bluish-white light directly overhead, moving at a very high rate of speed and in a straight line. The light was definitely not an aircraft, as it made no sound and did not blink or exhibit the normal characteristics of an airplane or other known aircraft. It was only visible for approximately 3 to 4 seconds before disappearing from sight.

Having sighted the phenomenon, I was greatly puzzled, as I could not identify the object. The stars with which it was contrasted were clearly visible, and the light itself was very bright, larger than a normal aircraft light, and of a distinctly bluish-white color.

I feel certain that the object was not a meteor or other natural phenomenon, nor was it any type of known aircraft. I have no explanation for what I observed, and I would be most interested in any information your department may have regarding similar sightings in this area.

Sincerely yours,
