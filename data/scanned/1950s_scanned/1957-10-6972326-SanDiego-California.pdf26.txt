1. In accordance with reference (a), the basic report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object as submitted by VS-21 is forwarded.

2. To supplement the report, the following statement by the pilot that sighted the object is forwarded:

"At about 1900 PST, I sighted what appeared to be a 'halo' about 30-40 feet in diameter at an altitude of approximately 2000-3000 feet, altitude above the ground being between 1000-1500 feet, over San Diego, California. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10-15 minutes. The object appeared to be hovering in one position and had a luminous quality with a greenish hue. The object disappeared from view while being observed, and I lost visual contact with it. I was piloting an F4D-I aircraft at the time of the sighting."

COOLEY, William L, LT USN, 347-10-54, A/C USN, Pilot operator.

1. After cast-off, I sighted an object which appeared to have a greenish hue and the size and general characteristics as above-described. This object remained stationary for about 10-15 minutes, and then disappeared from view as we flew out of the area.
