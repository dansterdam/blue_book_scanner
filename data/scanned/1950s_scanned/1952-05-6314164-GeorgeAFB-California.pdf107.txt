GEORGE AFB, CALIFORNIA

SYNOPSIS:

On 6 May 1952, at approximately 2050 hours, a Northrop F-86A jet aircraft, piloted by Lt. LESTER L. WAGNER, 36th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, was scrambled from George AEB, California, to investigate a reported unidentified flying object. The object was observed for approximately 25 minutes, during which time the aircraft was unable to make visual contact with it.

DETAILS:

At approximately 2050 hours, on 6 May 1952, the radar controller at George AFB observed an unidentified target on his scope, 10 to 15 miles west-northwest of the base, traveling at an estimated speed of 400 to 500 knots. This target was at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. The controller immediately contacted the 36th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and requested that an aircraft be scrambled to investigate the target.

Lt. LESTER L. WAGNER, piloting an F-86A jet aircraft, was scrambled and proceeded to the reported location of the unidentified target. Lt. WAGNER was in radio contact with the radar controller and was vectored towards the target. However, despite extensive maneuvering, Lt. WAGNER was unable to make visual contact with the object. The target was observed on radar for approximately 25 minutes, during which time it maintained a relatively steady course and altitude. The object then disappeared from the radar scope.

Lt. WAGNER reported that he was unable to detect any exhaust trail, navigation lights, or other identifying characteristics of the target. He further stated that the object appeared to be metallic in nature and was traveling at a speed far exceeding the performance capabilities of any known aircraft.

The report concludes with no further details or analysis.
