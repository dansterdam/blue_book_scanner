Describe in your own words a familiar object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
A ball of fire such as you might expect to see from the after-burning of a jet plane 8000 feet to 10,000 feet high, trailing a smoke trail. It was maneuvers so rapidly that it appeared to be controlled by intelligences and it was traveling at a very high rate of speed.
