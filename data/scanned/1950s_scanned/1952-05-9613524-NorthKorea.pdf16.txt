STATEMENT

On the morning of the 26th May, 1952, I certify as to the following:

While on base west of Promide, informed as of an unknown object located at 1:00 A.M. 26 May 1952 bearing approximately 2,500 feet altitude but unable to descern further due to terrain to determine exact location and altitude. Promide was called and stated he could investigate with his permission, as in an earlier incident we had investigated which turned out to be a jet aircraft. Promide called and said he pointed an object on my tail, as I requested, and stated as the object appeared to pull away, and i observed it through my rearview mirror, the object appeared to be of a brilliant white light. As we could discern no outline on the object due to the brilliancy of the light, we could discover no details as to its shape or size. The object appeared to slowly recede in the distance and was out of sight in approximately 10-15 seconds. At that time, the aircraft involved was approximately 6,000 yards to approximately 12,000 yards in 12-15 seconds. At that range, the object appeared as a brilliant white light for the duration as observed.
