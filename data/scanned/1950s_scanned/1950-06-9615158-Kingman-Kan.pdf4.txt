Dear Sir:

In June 1950 about 12:30 AM, near Coring, OHIO I sighted an object that for all intent and purpose appeared to be a shooting star. As it came down the horizon and shot back out at about the same angle it came down and disappeared as indicated in the following sketch.

If it had not bounced back out I would have thought it merely to be a shooting star and probably would even have remembered it. When it bounced back out, my wife also saw it. Incidentals I like to relate the details that impressed me at the time. I am taking the liberty since this is to form a permanent record, to appreciate your opinion as to the possible connection with unidentified flying objects. If more evidence are of value I think they can be obtained. At the time I reported it to the Denver Post but they made no response to it.

Cordially
