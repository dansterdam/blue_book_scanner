basic information which applies possibly in with the airborne sighting.
Paragraph No. 2 (a) 1 balloon because:
a. Constant altitude.
b. Slow variation in azimuth.
c. Visual observation about the same time at the same altitude 
by a group of officers.
d. Motive or cause to the cause for search for that balloon was estab-
lished as an order from the Commanding Officer of the student attachment.
e. Pip size checks with balloons.

3. Target echoes as described bear the characteristics which closely
resemble aircraft. It is based on what we have now. We can't add anything
negative. Although it resembles an aircraft, it is not impossible that it
is caused by weather phenomena. It is of blimp waves.

4. Whether possibility exists as follows:
a. Stationary target when first detected giving rapid altitude
change offers us one solution that fits.
b. It is to be qualified, however, that weather is not as plausible
an explanation of a track of 10,000 yds. continuously at 700/mph over south
to 32,000 yds. range. It is to be mentioned however, that more accurate
experienced observations than those of the students would be required to
identify any points of similarity in the actual appearance of aircraft return.
Students were able to yield primarily only information concerning the motions
of the pip. However, as most preliminary conclusions offered this staff, the
airborne sighting of 1st Lt Rogers and Major Ballard follows:
