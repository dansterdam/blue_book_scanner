The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically a letter from Captain Isaac E. Earp of the 24th Weather Detachment, Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, dated July 7, 1953.

The text of the document is as follows:

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

In my opinion, West Reed has the mental alertness and integrity that is above reproached. The undersigned officer firmly believes what is said in the attached report.
