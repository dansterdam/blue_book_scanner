There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned document containing a letter written by Lawrence J. Tacker, Major, USAF, Executive Information Division, Office of Information Services, Department of the Air Force. The letter is dated February 21, 1959 and is addressed to Major Tacker. The letter discusses the writer's previous letter of February 17, 1959, provides information about the "UFO sighted at Vance Air Force Base, Enid, Oklahoma" on January 9, 1959, and requests the return of the writer's previous letter.

Dear Major Tacker:

Thank you very much for your letter of 17 February 1959, giving the official analysis of the 9 January 1959 sighting at Vance Air Force Base, Enid, Oklahoma. I realize that it is difficult to establish a definite conclusion in some of these cases of reported UFO sightings.

There are two matters I would like to have cleared up, however. One, you mentioned that an article written by me appeared in the December 19, 1959 issue of the National Geographic Magazine. I was not aware that any such article had been written or published under my name. I would like to know the content and title of this article. Second, I also notice that in your letter you stated that you had returned my letter to me with your reply. You neglected to do so. I would appreciate it very much if you would return it with your next reply.

Sincerely,

Lawrence J. Tacker 
Major, USAF
