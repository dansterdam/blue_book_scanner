Report No. ATIC UJ1229 (IR-271-54) dated 27 October contains various comments extracted from newspapers throughout Europe on various UFO sightings. Descriptions include:

Flying cigars
Flying saucers
Incandescent ellipses
Balls of fire
Explosions high tray
Intense luminal cylinders

COMMENT: ATIC attributed two major causes of the recent (Sep, Oct, Nov 53) outbreak of sightings in Europe: this book has recently been translated into various languages and is now selling in Europe. Also, a strange foretaste of meteoric activity might account for a portion of the observations.
