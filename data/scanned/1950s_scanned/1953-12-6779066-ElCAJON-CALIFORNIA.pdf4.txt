Flying Objects Sighted 24 Dec 53, El Cajon, California, by Naval Aviators

with little or no wind. There was no meteorological condition which
would account for sightings. Interception was impossible due to
greater speed of objects. There was other air traffic in the general
area at Brown Field; however, there were no reports from them.

6. ACTIONS: No action will be taken by this District. A copy
of this report is being made available to the Air Technical Intelligence
