3C-99 19 October 1952
SUBJECT: Sighting of strange object or light

TO: Squadron Intelligence Officer

1. The following report is submitted as regards the sighting of a strange light or object in the vicinity of Anderson Air Force Base on the night of 6 October 1952.

2. At 1915 hours on the night of the 6th of October a lighted object was observed in the night sky, which was described as "low, swooping and swerving". The object being sighted from Anderson's control tower on the runway. It maneuvered for about five minutes and then disappeared into the fog and was not too for from our runway.

3. After a careful study through the binoculars, I/3e Tower and myself agreed that the object was stationary and had a slightly change from an orange glow to rcd as it remained in the same position. It could not be an aircraft or a balloon or even a meteor due to its stationary position.

4. He had a 2-6 flying in the local area, his number being 167 and the control tower being in communication. 

5. We asked 167 if he had the object in sight. He verified our transmission and stated 2'17 to the object and turn his landing lights on at, which he did and his statement was that the object was around 2000 feet high and not too far from our runway.

6. The pilot of 167 also did not know what it was and at 1940 hours the object disappeared and at 1945 hours the object had disappeared from our sight.

7. During that thirty minutes we had verified target by Control. Operations and GCA. They said the object was too low for their scopes.

8. The above is what I consider the incident.
