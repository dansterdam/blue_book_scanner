Dear Major Friend:

I wonder if you can send me a copy of the file on the Pan American Airlines sighting over Chesapeake Bay on July 14, 1952. This appears to be one of the "classic" cases and Mrs. Boyd and I are struggling with it. Certain features suggest meteors, but we need more facts for our analysis.

Thank you very much for your telephone call about the Killian case.

Cordially yours,

Donald H. Menzel
Director
