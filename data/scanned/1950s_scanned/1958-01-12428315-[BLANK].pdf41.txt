EDWARDSJION: (Cont'd)
WHAT SIT: I VHILE HE H WATCHED,
AT SHORT SHE SECTION TOLD THE OBSERVER
COULD HAVE ENTERED THE HIND JET-
STREAM FLOWING SOUTH. IT COULD
MOVE RAPIDLY SOUTH, STILL CLIMBING.
AT A POINT SOMEWHERE SOUTH
OR SOUTHWEST OF GOWEN FIELD ...
JERE IT WOULD HAVE CLIMBED
THROUGH THE JET STREAM INTO A
CALM VERT ... AND THEN IT WOULD
SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTH OR SOUTHEAST
... DIRECTLY OVER THE AREA VHERE
THE UFO WAS SIGHTED.

CUT DACK TO EDWARDS AND WHEDON
EDWARDS:
You believe it's possible for
trained observers ... pilots like
Capt. Mantell ... to see a balloon
and not recognize it as such?
WHEDON:
Certainly ... in a period when
balloons of that size were rare ...
