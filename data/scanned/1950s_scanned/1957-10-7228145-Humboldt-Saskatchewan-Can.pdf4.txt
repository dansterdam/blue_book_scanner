INVESTIGATOR'S REMARKS

B. M. Davis, B. Sc. reported that about 10.30 p.m. on Otd. 24, I955 a woman who wished to remain anonymous reported observing a strange object which appeared to be from outer space over the Humboldt highway about 7 miles southeast of Humboldt, Saskatchewan, Canada. 
The object was described as a large circular craft, silvery in color, with red and green lights flashing around the rim. It was seen to move slowly across the sky and then suddenly increase speed and disappear. The witness stated she had been trying to get up enough courage to report this sighting for several days. 
Report sent in on August 7, 1957.
