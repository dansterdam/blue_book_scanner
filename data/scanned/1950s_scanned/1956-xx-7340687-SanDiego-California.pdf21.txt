Would you be kind enough to write me your opinion as to what was what I saw?

During World War II I was a Radio Operator with rank of Sergeant. Our squadron received orders to stand by for 60 days. The 602nd Fighter Control Squadron had orders from the 52nd Troop Carrier Squadron to man the communications center. My Squadron Commander was Captain . I served over 5 years from 1941 to 1945 and am now on the retired list. I was awarded 14 medals and was in the European, Asiatic, Asiatic-Pacific and Indonesian campaigns. I am a native of Statesville, North Carolina. I was inducted in New York City. I hope you will consider what I have to say.

That's why I worked in a Radio Station on the ground but today I have quit drinking altogether. Etc.

Thanking you very much for your attention reading this letter and for what you might be able to do about the U.F.O. and wishing you good luck in your important duty, I am

Faithfully and sincerely yours, [REDACTED]

My mother and brother still live with me today. My address is [REDACTED]. I speak several languages: Italian, French, German, Japanese and Tagalog.
