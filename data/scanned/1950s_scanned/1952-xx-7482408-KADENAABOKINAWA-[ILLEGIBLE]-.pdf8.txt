The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and extract all the text visible in the image:

On the night of the 16th of July, at approximately 10:00 P.M., I saw a light which appeared to be a star that was moving and blinking. It travelled from the west to the eastern direction in a zig zag motion. It stopped abruptly. Strange lights remained there for about 2 minutes and then it increased altitude and disappeared.

On the 15th of July, at approximately 11:00 P.M., I saw a little circle-like shape that started from the western and proceeded to the northeast moving altitude.
