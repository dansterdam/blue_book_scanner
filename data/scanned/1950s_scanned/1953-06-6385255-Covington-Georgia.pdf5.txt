The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an "X" symbol in the sky. The text below states "Was 45 sec. to pass objects (trees, houses etc.) the angle of disappearance was unknown."

The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with a road leading into the distance and mountains or hills in the background. There is a figure in the foreground, possibly representing the observer.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
