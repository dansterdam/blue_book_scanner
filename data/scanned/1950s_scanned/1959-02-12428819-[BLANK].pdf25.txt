FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (AFR 190-16)

AFR 200-2 DATED 5 FEBRUARY 1958,
AND CHANGE THERETO DATED 3 JULY 1958

1. This regulation as it stands serves well the purpose for which it was written. However, the Air Force investigators are doing little more than meeting the minimum requirements of this document, and in many instances require prompting by the Air Technical Intelligence Center to deliver even this minimum data.

2. The shortcomings of the UFO investigation procedures probably are due mostly to the Air Bases assigning inexperienced and/or unqualified people to this task, and also to lack of interest in the Program. It is difficult to become fired up over a Program in which the boss shows little or no interest.

3. The ATIC proposes the following as a solution to the problems associated with UFO investigation.

   a. Assignment of competent persons as investigators.

   b. Short training program for the personnel proposed for use as investigators. The length of this training program should depend upon the basic qualifications of the personnel selected. However, it is suggested that such a training program not exceed twenty (20) hours. In all instances the program should include hours of instruction on the following:

      (1) History and philosophy of the UFO Program.

      (2) Introduction to Astronomy (Basic terminology and description of the more common astronomical bodies).

      (3) Methods of interrogation.

      (4) Use of equipment.

      (5) Reporting.
