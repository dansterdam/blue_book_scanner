Memo, AFCIN-HHEG, 26 Dec 59, Request for Evaluation
1st Ind (AFCIN-HRLP/Capt. Koriakon/js/12201) 21 Jan 60
TO: AFCIN-HHEG

1. An analysis of the attached UFO message reveals the following:

a. The reported anomalous propagation in the area could possibly be re-escapable to the unidentified radar return, particularly if a severe temperature inversion existed and permanent echoes on the radar were a contributing factor.  

b. Based on the winds aloft, track movement and track groundspeed, the UFO could possibly be a balloon.

2. The lack of information on this UFO makes a more detailed and thorough analysis impossible.
