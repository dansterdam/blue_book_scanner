AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
7132 AISS 
10 JUL 53
PART TWO

COMMENTS ON THE PREPARING OFFICER:
1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the reliability of the information contained in this report is considered good. The sources of the information can be made about any one of the three sightings because there were only slight variations in location.
2. The following possibilities are given: Fighting ships, weather balloons, and reflection of the observers' faces in the windshield or possibly mirages. (Further comments are made below).
3. This report shows a file entry of seven degrees temperature inversion did exist, which is the normal condition for the area and time of year. This could have a bearing on the sightings and adds to the theory of an optical phenomenon.
4. The report shows that the sightings were of short duration and could be satisfactorily explained by the length of time during which a meteorological phenomenon would be visible, leading to the possibility that these sightings were as a result of a meteorological condition.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the three (3) sightings described above are separate and distinct sightings, with conclusions of each as follows:
a. Riverside, California: Sighting by Ernest L. Dunn, Glen Avon Ground Observer Post.
