There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically case number 1953-01-9545247 from the Continental Divide in New Mexico on January 26, 1953.

The text in the document is as follows:

Continental Divide, New Mexico
26 January 1953

I. Description of Incident
On 26 January 1952 at 2115 MST Air Force personnel stationed at an AC&W station in this area observed an object in the sky. This object was seen visually and by electronic means. At the naked eye the object appeared as a very bright reddish-white object outlined to the naked eye. The object passed behind a hill and was not observed further. The object was observed by the station personnel to make a very erratic maneuver at high speed, appearing to zig-zag across the radar scope, appearing west of the station approximately 9 miles away. The object showed the object to be moving at a rate of 2,700 mph, a velocity of 10-15,000 feet per minute. It was eventually lost on radar at the 16 mile range. The object under visual and radar observation illuminated the sky to the horizon. The elevation of the station is 7,500+ above sea level. 
Weather at the time was characterized by high thin overcast and low scattered clouds. Winds aloft were from 270Â° at 30 knots at 10-20,000'. An atmospheric inversion layer existed at 12,000' with the top at 21,000'.

II. Discussion of Incident
This is the most complete report ever received by ATIC on the sighting of an unidentified object. The intelligence officers of the 29th Air Division are to be complimented on their initiative and complete covering of all the details regarding this observation. However, the conclusion drawn in this continental visual-electronic sighting is the best type of sighting to work with because it affords the most information.
The intelligence officer's estimate is that the report describes a weather balloon was reasonably explained as a possible answer to the sighting. It was found that a 9' 'radiosonde' balloon from Tularosa, Arizona, would offer the only possibility. The unknown object was observed to move from east to west, which aligns with the balloon trajectory. Also the sighting time of 0315 x 1 hour and 15 minutes after the window release and by that time it is probable that the radiosonde had burst. 
The fact that the object was detected on radar and seen visually for so long a period of time eliminates some astronomical solutions, such as a star or fireball, and especially if both radar and eye were seeing the same object. Since the object was tracked at 12 to 15 mph, aircraft are also eliminated as a possibility.
Some electronic specialists advanced the theory that the slow speed and large visual radar size of the target make it appear that weather effects may be the cause of the electronic pickup. However, the inversion layer at 12,000' appears to be too high to affect the radar which was tracking the object at 10-15,000'.
There is a possibility which ATIC is now checking.
