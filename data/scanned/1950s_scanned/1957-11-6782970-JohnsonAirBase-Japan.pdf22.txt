DATE 14 November 1957

At approximately 06:15, 14 Nov 1957, I was on duty as an Air Polic at Area #12, Johnson A.B. APO 996. I was talking to M/S Tom Smith inside of the Air Police Date house when I happend to glance out the door and see a strange looking appearance in the sky which anyone would notice. I called M/S Smith's attention to the same. I thought it was the moon in a strange position. M/S Smith said it was a cloud, and we were both amazed and I will be moon above us a little to the rear, we were facing east at the time, and explaining to Smith that the sun was to the rear and if the object could be, there would be shining that brightly from the sides facing us, there were no clouds we could see very close against a dark clear background. I could see the object up with a telephone pole and it was not moving in any direction. This all took place in a matter of approximately two minutes. At this time the object moved out and continuously gained speed.
