There does not appear to be a photograph in this document. The image shows a page from a project blue book UFO report document, containing text describing a "similar 'halo' effect" that was photographed by a member of the ATIC photo branch.

Text transcribed from the document:

AN EXAMPLE OF A SIMILAR "HALO" EFFECT WAS MADE BY A MEMBER OF ATIC PHOTO BRANCH BY PHOTOGRAPHING A STREET LIGHT. ALSO, SIMILAR "TASTY PULP" EFFECT CREATED BY PHOTO OF MOON WITH PROPER CAMERA MOVEMENT. PRINTS OF UFO AND SIMULATED EFFECTS BEING FORWARDED UNDER SEPARATE COVER.

IT IS NOT BELIEVED THAT THE OBJECT IN QUESTION WAS CREATED BY LIGHT REFLECTION FROM CLOUDS OR SKY, BUT BEFORE THE INFERENCE THAT OBJECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH DISNEYLAND IS RULED OUT, AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE MADE TO SEE IF ANY OF THE RIDES IN DISNEYLAND ARE SIMILAR IN SHAPE TO THE CIGAR SHAPE BECAUSE THRU A TRICK TECHNIQUE A SPACE SHIP IN DISNEYLAND COULD HAVE PROVIDED THE PECULIAR SHAPE.

THE SKY PRODUCED IN THE PHOTOGRAPH GIVES IT AN UNREAL ISTIC APPEARANCE BECAUSE OF THE EXPOSURE RECEIVED BELOW THE OBJECT AND THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE NORMAL SKY EXPOSURE, i.e. TOP HALF OF PHOTO IS BLACK, BOTTOM HALF VERY LIGHT. AN EXPOSURE OF 1/10 OF A SECOND AT f/4.5 WHEN CAMERA IS POINTED AT THE SKY WILL REPRODUCE THE STARS UNLESS THERE WAS A CLOUD COVER. ALSO, THIS EXPOSURE WILL NORMALLY NOT PRODUCE AN EXTREMELY DENSE NEGATIVE AS STATED BY SOURCE. ATIC EXPOSED STREET LIGHT AT 1/30 AT f/4.5 AND AT 5 SECONDS, f/3.5. THESE EXPOSURES TEND TO DISPROVE EXPOSURE DATA STATEMENTS MADE BY SOURCE.

IN THE REPORT OF INCIDENT IT IS VERY APPARENT THAT THE SOURCE HAD EITHER A GOOD WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES OR ACCIDENTALLY USED SETTINGS THAT WOULD REPRODUCE A GENUINE UFO EFFECT.
