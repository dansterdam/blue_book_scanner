I was stopped at Kerr Hollow gate where I was on duty October 15, 1950. [Redacted] and I observed what appeared to be a bright silvery light in the sky. The object appeared to be about the size of a quarter of a mile long. The smoke was grayish in color. The object failed to complete the outside loop. It went into the gate house to appear at a distance. I was making the phone call at about 9:50 P.M. when the object continued downward to the extent that a second object was involved in the middle along the smoke trail. The second object was the same size and shape and was about 50 feet behind the first object. The two objects appeared to be attached to each other and moved in a downward direction at this altitude, both objects changed to a bullet shape, also at this altitude, both objects began diminishing in size. During the entire incident, the angle of descent was about 60 yards from the catchouse toward Galway bridge. This was where the object had diminished to about 25 inches.
