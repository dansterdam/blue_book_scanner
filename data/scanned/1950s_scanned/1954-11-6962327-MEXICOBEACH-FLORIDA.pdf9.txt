ROUND TRIP
Alabama's Star Now 
Closer To Housewife

WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 - (NEA) -
The "transient" meteorite which fell from the skies 10 days ago and landed in Alabama is now closer to the housewife's kitchen than the Democratic Rep. Kenneth A. Roberts of Alabama and Brig. Gen. Joe W. Kelly, director of the Air Force public information office.
Brig. Gen. Kelly said the Air Force had taken possession of the meteorite and is responsible for its safekeeping. He said the Air Force had "established a claim" to the meteorite, lest it fall from the skies again.
Mrs. Hodges, whose husband has tentatively identified the object "as the highest ever known to hit the earth," said several "fantastic offers to buy it" have been received, ranging from $2,500 to $5,000.
In keep the meteorite from its original owners, the Hodgeses, the Air Force has now transported the meteorite from its landing place in Sylacauga, Ala., Dec. 3 - and has whisked it off to the Eglin Air Force Base. The meteorite has not been seen by the Hodgeses since that day.
The Air Force now has the object and several scientists in other branches of the armed services are studying it. The object is being studied at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
