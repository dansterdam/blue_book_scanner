The photograph depicts a classic "flying saucer" type UFO. It is an oval-shaped, smooth object with a distinct central dome on top. The object appears to emit or reflect a glow and is set against a dark background, giving the impression of being photographed in the night sky.

Here's the text from the document:

```
GLOWING SAUCER WAS SPOTTED BY AVIATION
TECHNICIAN ON LATE DECEMBER EVENING IN 1955.

This drawing was one of many included in
an article which appeared in the December 5, 1955
issue of Life Magazine. We asked [REDACTED]
to pick out the ufo which came close to describing the
one he saw. He chose this one and said it was almost
identical to the one he saw land on August 29, 1955.
