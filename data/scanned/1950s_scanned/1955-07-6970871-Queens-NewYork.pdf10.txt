The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document labeled "STATEMENT" that describes observations of sixty-inch power searchlights operating on the evening of July 30th between sunset and midnight. The text indicates that the searchlights were operated on separate electrical motor units of varying speeds, and it was not uncommon for these beams of lights to be visible for several miles.

STATEMENT
All four of my sixty inch power searchlights were operating on the evening of the 30th of July, between sunset and midnight. They are operated on separate electrical motor units of varying speeds, thus making possible an infinite number of combinations of various patterns. It is not uncommon for these beams of lights to be visible for several miles.
