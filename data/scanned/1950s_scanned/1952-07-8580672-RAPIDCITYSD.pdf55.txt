REPORT 1/10 - 7/8/52
Dear Sirs: This report gives the facts as I observed them
the evening of the 7th of July 1952 at Rapid City, South Dakota.
At approximately 8:30 P.M. I observed in the sky over Rapid 
City a bright orange light moving in a northerly direction. It
was at an estimated altitude of about 5,000 feet. The light moved
slowly for about 10 minutes, stopped momentarily, then moved off
again at a high rate of speed in a northwesterly direction.
As the light stopped momentarily, I observed it through field
glasses and noticed that it appeared to be circular in shape and
about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length.
The light itself appeared to be more of a glowing or a luminous
nature than the reflection of the sun as the sky was already dark.
I have been interested in astronomy for a number of years and
have observed many aircraft and unusual phenomena in the sky but
this object was definitely different from anything I have ever
seen before.
I would appreciate your comments and any information you may
have on this incident.
Yours truly,
(Signed)
Rapid City, South Dakota
