The text in the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED
AISOC 27 November 1956
SUBJECT: AIR and Photographs of El Toro MCAS UFOB Sighting
TO: Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: AFOIN-2B3A
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

1. Enclosed is a copy of AF Form 112 with radar scope-photograph of the El Toro UFOB sighting on 7 November 1956.
2. Since evaluation of this sighting depends primarily on an analysis of the radar scope-photographs, and since facilities for adequate interpretation of scope-photographs are not available at this level, a detailed evaluation by this organization is being undertaken jointly with your organization and complete analysis of the radar scope-photographs.
3. At the present time, it appears that the radar part of this sighting was caused by known types of local phenomena which affected the MCAS radar system. The visual part of the sighting, (which may not be related to the radar returns), have been caused by known phenomena and/or temporarily over-active imaginations stimulated by the unusual events of the evening and morning.

FOR THE COMMANDER:
CHARLES V. GOODE
