1. Transmitted under separate cover is approximately fifteen feet of 16mm moving picture film taken by Mr. Gerald Heroux, Great Falls, Montana, who is a director of the Great Falls baseball team. 

2. These movies were made on 15 August 1950 between the hours of 11:25 and 11:30 p.m. over a drive-in theater located in Great Falls, Montana, near the airfield operated by the 341st Bomb Wing. It shows an object described as being elongated, about the size of a car, brilliant white in color, and without wings, tail, or other appurtenances. It appeared to be hovering and later to move rapidly from a northerly to a southeasterly direction at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately ten thousand feet and at a distance of about three-quarters of a mile from the observer's location. The motion of the object is described as completely silent, and it observed that the witness stated that he ran outdoors and outside the car from which the pictures were taken. Examination of the film by this office disclosed that it does actually record the motion of an unidentified flying object as described.

3. The water tower in instant pictures is located approximately seven hundred feet in a southwesterly direction from the point at which the pictures were taken, and the lower is approximately one hundred seventy-five feet in height.
