Mysterious Green Fireball Brightens Night Over Texas

TYLER, TEX., Feb. 14 (/p)--There were unconfirmed reports that a weird green light shot across the sky last night and that it exploded over an airport control tower.

Word of the phenomenon spread quickly and the Weather Bureau at Dallas got several reports of people seeing the glow over northeast Texas last Sunday night.

It was apparently a meteorite.

Here's his story: "Around midnight this light
appeared, brighter and larger than electrical storms often are. It appeared to be going steadily along, not like a shooting star." It was green, like an electric arc, and was greener toward the trailing end, which flickered like a flame.

"IT WAS going due south. There were three of us in the house at the time. The light illuminated the whole room like a blinding light. It was on for about 15 seconds.

"About 30 degrees above the horizon, it made a sharp turn to the east, then disappeared into the distance. We watched it disappear to the south."

THE MOST vivid account came from J. N. Auer, control tower operator at Pounds Field here. "It looked like a giant flare, burning brightly," he said. "It lasted for about 5 seconds."
