SIGHTING REPORT INVESTIGATION

Several objects were observed in the sky at about 8:00 P.M. on the evening of August 22, 1957. They appeared to be moving slowly from the northeast and disappearing to the southwest. The objects were of irregular shape, varying in size, and seemed to be about 1,000 feet high. The objects appeared to change in speed and direction. There was an estimated 7 to 10 objects in all. They were observed for about 10 minutes. The observer, who was an electronic technician, stated that the objects appeared to be similar to a falling leaf, but much larger. They seemed to have a rocking motion, like a saucer skipping on water.
