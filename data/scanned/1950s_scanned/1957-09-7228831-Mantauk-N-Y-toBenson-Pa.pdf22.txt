In 1953, an evaluation and detailed report was made on a phenomenon existing at Montauk, Montauk, New York. This phenomenon could not in any way be associated with the 20 September 1957 incident by the NORAD team.
7. Weather: Immediately following the incident, the Division Weather Officer analyzed weather and atmospheric conditions prevailing in the 26th Division. This analysis was based primarily on soundings and reported weather conditions. In general, this analysis showed no ducts, inversions or other conditions which could account for false target tracks.
A similar analysis was performed by members of the 31 Weather Group, Hq. ADC. The results of this analysis verified the findings of the Division weather Officer.
Weather forecasts and soundings from the four weather stations closest to the area in which the tracks were observed are included in Attachment II. It is noted that the only indication of a refractive layer is found in the plots of R units (refractive index) from Idlewild. This layer was not strong, however, and was at a higher altitude than are layers which normally cause false targets.
To summarize: Two independent studies of the available weather data by qualified weather officers failed to reveal conditions which are known to produce anomalous propagation or false targets. If weather conditions prevailing on 20 September did produce these high speed tracks, one would expect the occurrence of such tracks to be the rule rather than the exception.
8. Equipment Malfunction: Montauk Air Force Station has recently had the AN/FPS-20 search radar modified into an AN/FPS-20. The station has in this manner been able to maintain continuous operation of its radar equipment.
