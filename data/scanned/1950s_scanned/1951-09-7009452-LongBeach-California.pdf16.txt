UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL UNCLASSIFIED
OFFICE OF INVESTIGATION REPORT NO. 129
TITLE: FRED T. RAGSDALE
LOCATION: Maywood, California
DATE: 30 October 1951

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Object Over Long Beach, California.

REFERENCE: Memo to Has Lost - dated 26 October 1951

The Commanding General, 27th Air Division, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, California, requested an investigation concerning the sighting of an unidentified object observed from Norton AFB on the evening of 25 October 1951 between 1930 and 2030 hours at 50,000 feet. Four P-51s were dispatched to investigate and establish contact with the object. During the climb to the altitude of 43,000 feet, the object disappeared. Visual contact was maintained only for a very short period of time and the object was described to be a swept wing fighter type aircraft. A check with aircraft maintenance indicated that no experimental aircraft had scheduled test flights on that date.

Observations made upon the object were as follows: It was estimated to be a brilliant light source, possibly illuminating an object at an altitude of 50,000 feet. It was found that all three of the P-51 aircraft were lost during the unsuccessful attempt to make contact with the unidentified object. It was determined from later investigation that the object sighted was one of the balloons which had been released just prior to the time this object was reportedly seen.
