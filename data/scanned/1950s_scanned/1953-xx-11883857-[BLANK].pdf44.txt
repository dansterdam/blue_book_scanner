OPTICAL PHENOMENA

GENERAL

This can cover a multitude of things. Original scanning of the report should be made to attempt to determine whether it more likely describes a material object or an optical phenomenon.

Optical phenomena which have been reported as UFOBs run from reflections on clouds and layers of ice crystals (sundogs) to the many types of mirages. No one set of optical phenomena can be set down as representation for the whole class.

There is no limit to the speed of optical phenomena. Reflections can travel from incredible speed, as in the case of a search-beacon on high clouds, to stationary.

These cases if well reported will almost always warrant follow-up. Their variety and connection with upper atmospheric conditions make these observations especially valuable scientifically.

1. Shape: Generally round but can be elliptical or linear.
2. Size: Starlike to large luminous glow.
3. Color: Generally yellow.
4. Speed: Stationary to fantastic.
5. Formation: Any.
6. Trail: None.
7. Sound: None.
8. Course: Any.
9. Time In Sight: Any.
