I stopped, calmed down a little, then drove on. My first thoughts were that it had been a picnic plate or similar object - I felt that the transient object, being dark but sharp, and the plate slightly reflecting, might have had some connection except in my own mind. It did seem rather unusual.
I analyzed it during the rest of the drive into Festus, several hours that night and the following day. The object appeared not to be one which could not be reconciled with the visual observations.
I had been an explosion encountered with the illumination connected with the concrete object which seemed freakish and improbable, but not impossible to explain by natural means. The change in speed I was going, the speed it was going, the apparent collision course, and the blowing of the object when I slowed, I could not completely describe. Considering the distance it was away, the change in direction would require more speed and maneuvers than the wind could give it.
I finally decided to report the occurrence, and did so on 14 October 1954, in a telephone conversation with A. B. Craidon, USN. The above is a confirmation and amplification of our conversation.
