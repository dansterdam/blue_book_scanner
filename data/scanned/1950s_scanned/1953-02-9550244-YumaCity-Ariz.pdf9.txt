"SIGHTINGS OF FLYING OBJECTS"

The location, Yuma, Arizona. At approximately 1:15 p.m., February 6, 1953, I was using a theodolite to follow a pilot balloon, which was ascending at a rate of about 700 feet per minute. The theodolite was set at 55 degrees elevation, and the balloon was out of sight, having reached an altitude of approximately 27,500 feet. I had my eye glued to the eyepiece of the theodolite, and although it was a clear day, I saw a small silvery-white object approaching from the north. I had a clear unobstructed view of the object as it passed overhead, at an estimated elevation of approximately 15,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was traveling at a high rate of speed. I noticed no sound or exhaust from the object. As it passed overhead, I lost sight of it as it went behind the theodolite.

The objects were both the same size as early as I could determine, and I would estimate the diameter to be approximately 30 feet. The objects were shiny-silver in color and appeared to be traveling at an estimated speed of 500 to 600 miles per hour.

I am a Meteorological Aid employed with the United States Weather Bureau, having followed balloons through a theodolite for the past ten years.

I am absolutely certain of what I have seen through the theodolite as described in the foregoing paragraphs.
