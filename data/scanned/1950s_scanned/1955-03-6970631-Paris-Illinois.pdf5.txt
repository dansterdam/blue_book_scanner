The image does not contain any photographs, but rather illustrations and sketches related to a UFO sighting report. The first sketch depicts a curved line representing the horizon, with instructions to mark the position of the observed object using "A" and "B" on the curved line. The second set of sketches shows a larger sketch on the left, with instructions to place "A" at the position the object was first seen, and "B" at the position where it was last seen. The smaller sketch on the right provides an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
