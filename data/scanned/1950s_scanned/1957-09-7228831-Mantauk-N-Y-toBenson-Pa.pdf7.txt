is maintaining a constant track. UNCLASSIFIED
The target intensity of track BB-6 remained constant
throughout the entire tracking period. Normal target returns
fluctuate in intensity to such a degree that the condition is
visually obvious to the operator.

Tracking was continuous and the blip/scan ratio was 1.0
over the entire track. A 1.0 blip/scan ratio on conventional and
jet aircraft without beacon or Mark X is a rare occurrence under
normal operation. 

The fact that this target was of such size to sustain
a 1.0 blip/scan ratio at Montauk AFS would indicate that other stations within detection distances certainly should have received some
indication of this track.

Mutual interference, that is, interference of one
rotating radar with another rotating radar operating at or fairly
close to the same operational parameters will normally produce
"spikes" occurring at the outer edge of the PPI scope and spiraling
into the center of the scope along with extremely high background
noise levels. The noise level on the scope, of course, is proportional to the power transmitted by the interfering radar. It was
impossible to associate track BB-6 with previously experienced
mutual interference patterns of two rotating radars. It would be
possible, however, to ascertain a condition of this sort with a fixedantenna type radar operating at or close to the frequency and PRF of
the rotating radar. The team was unable to ascertain the location
of any fixed radar stations in that area that could produce such a
condition of interference.
