There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object which you saw, so that when it was placed up in the sky it would give the same appearance as the objects which you saw. How close could your construction come to the actual objects which you saw?

How close could your construction come to the actual objects which you saw?

I am afraid that I could not construct any model that would accurately represent what I saw. The objects I observed were very unusual and I have no way to recreate their appearance. They were definitely unlike any known aircraft or objects that I am familiar with. This is why I felt compelled to report the sighting, as it was a very strange and unexplainable occurrence.

42. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this? (Circle one) Yes No. If you answered no, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

Yes

43. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what's might have caused it?

The object was extremely unusual and I do not have any explanation for what it could have been or what might have caused it. It did not resemble any known aircraft or object that I am aware of. I am perplexed by this sighting and can only speculate as to its nature and origin.
