The text in the document is as follows:

On July 9, 1953, a civil airline pilot sighted an unidentified flying object approximately 3 miles east of LeGrande, Oregon at about 2:04 a.m. He reported this sighting to the LeGrande Airport control tower. The pilot stated that the object was round, brightly lighted, and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. 

The object appeared to be descending when sighted and was observed for approximately 30 seconds. The pilot stated that although the object appeared to be pulsating or oscillating, it did not make any sharp turns or abrupt changes in direction. 

The control tower operator at LeGrande advised the pilot that there were no other aircraft in the vicinity. The pilot's description of the object is consistent with the characteristics previously reported on similar unidentified flying objects.
