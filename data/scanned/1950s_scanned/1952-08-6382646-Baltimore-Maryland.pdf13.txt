On 14 JULY 52, at approximately 10.48P.M., a married couple living at the above address observed three to four spherical or disc-shaped objects travelling at a high rate of speed across the sky. The objects were white in color and appeared to be reflecting some light. They were seen for a period of about 2 minutes. The objects were about 15 degrees apart in the night sky and were travelling at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. A fourth object was tentatively observed but could not be positively identified.

The objects were reported to the Baltimore Air Defense Filter Center, 11th Air Division, and were confirmed by radar. No interceptors were scrambled as the objects were outside the Baltimore air defense sector.
