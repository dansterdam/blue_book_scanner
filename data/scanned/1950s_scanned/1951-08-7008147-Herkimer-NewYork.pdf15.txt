24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Can only say that it appeared to be a sphere and of a solid nature. And say sphere since in observing its approach and departure it did not change shape throughout such change of view as was permitted by the angle of view and the objects declination in it.
