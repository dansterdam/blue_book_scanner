SWORN STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

I, _________, Lt., USAF, 135th Aircraft Control
and Warning Squadron, do hereby make the following sworn statement:

On 23 May 1952 at 1600 hours, while acting as Director, I was in-
formed by the door guard that there was a silver object in the sky to
the West of our station. I immediately went downstairs to the door and
observed a shining object at a low angle from the ground. I then went
back to the radar scope and observed three tracks, at 20, 25 and 30 miles
heading outbound. After checking with the Identification Section, I was
able to identify one track as a Constellation. Idaho #1 being airborne
at the time on a test flight, was diverted from over Kirtland to identify
the other two tracks and also to search for any unusual objects. Idaho #1
was vectored to 350 degrees and 11 angels and at approximately 35 miles
one track was identified as a Piper Cub. Idaho one continued for the sec-
ond track on a heading of 260 degrees and at 50 miles, identified a C-47.
The third track at this time was 270 degrees and 85 miles.

I received word that the object was still in sight so had Idaho #1
climb to 23 angels and search on an inbound heading. He came within 15
miles of the field without sighting anything and since the object was
still in sight from the ground, he was again vectored outbound on a track
of 254 degrees at 18 angels.

When at 50 miles, he reported fuel running low, he was vectored to-
ward the base at minimum altitude and landed.

Idaho #1 reported excellent visibility with the only clouds 50 miles
West of Kirtland Air Force Base, with tops estimated at 17,000 feet.

At no time was there an indication other than the three outbound
tracks, with the exception of Idaho #1.
