I was vacationing in Europe, and the plane I was on had a very unusual experience. We were flying from Estrasburgo through the Hietym Hotel in Madridejos, arriving a little late since the weather was bad. When we landed, a German businessman, Dr. [Redacted], was also on the airplane. He remarked to me that while we were in the air, he noticed a large, bright, metallic object that seemed to pace us for a while. He said it was cigar-shaped, with what appeared to be openings or lights on the side, and it moved at a tremendous speed, much faster than our plane. The object disappeared in the direction of the west. Dr. [Redacted] was quite startled by the experience and felt that perhaps he had seen some kind of experimental aircraft. I was inclined to believe his report, since he seemed to be a serious and responsible person. I hope this information is useful to your investigation.
