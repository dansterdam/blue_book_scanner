AN AIR FORCE INVESTIGATION H. a.
TIME: 21 AUGUST 1952, 1725 P. M., EDT
PLACE: WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT 
VISIBILITY: partly clear. visibility at the time was restricted to about 25 miles due to haze.
DESCRIPTION: through glasses a bright white light, very round, and probably about 500 feet in diameter, was observed to come from the northwest, maintain a constant speed and altitude, and then stop and hover for about 10 to 15 seconds, after which it suddenly accelerated and disappeared in the direction from which it had come. It was observed by many persons, some of whom were on the airport operations staff.
REMARKS: This sighting was also observed by personnel at the CAA Tower and from other points on the airport. Radar contact was maintained on the object by the CAA Radar Unit for a period of about 15 minutes. The object was reported to be traveling at a speed of about 1,200 miles per hour. As no plane is known to have this speed, the object is unidentifiable. It is requested that the information contained herein be made a matter of record.
