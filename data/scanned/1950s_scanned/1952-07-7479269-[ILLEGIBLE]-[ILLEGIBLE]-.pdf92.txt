AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Objects

REFERENCES: Project 10073 Record No: AIO 7165

As approximately 1300 hours on 17 July 1952, two white balloons were observed in flight to the southwest, moving in an erratic manner. The balloons appeared to be extremely high, and their movement appeared to be unnatural or erratic. At this time it had reached a height of about 45,000 feet and it appeared to be much higher than normal balloons. After I finished recording the weather, I went back out to the theodolite and I looked at the theodolite and immediately got the balloons back in my vision. I watched them for approximately 15 or 20 seconds then they moved out at a greater speed. I could see no visible means of propulsion.

For a period of about 7 or 8 minutes after that I could see other objects in the group, seeming to move in an erratic manner. However, they didn't track them out to the horizon because I didn't want to lose my balloons. After the balloons were gone, I didn't see the other objects again.

If they were the same size or larger than the balloons, then they were at the same altitude as the balloons. If they were smaller than the balloons, they would be at a higher altitude. It would be hard to give an exact estimate as to the size.

At times it looked as though they may have been oblong, then again it looked as though they were round in appearance. It was difficult to say exactly what shape they were.

There were four (4) people that saw these through the theodolite. One man, whose name I did not get, said he thought they were flying saucers.

The theodolite has a maximum power of 20 diameters and a field view of 2 degrees. It was very interesting to watch.
