a slight fuzziness around the periphery and were estimated to be about twice the diameter of a return from a B-52 jet maximum radar range. The intensity of the blips remained constant throughout the entire track. Tracking continuity and blip-scan ratio was 1.0.

The following is a summary of the characteristics of, and technical environment surrounding, the Benton target phenomenon on 20 September 1957:

1. ... they had a 1.0 blip-scan ratio throughout the entire tracking period. They maintained a constant target intensity. The size and shape varied considerably from that of normal returns and they were not detected on the search or vertical lower beams. Targets having returns as strong and persistent as these should be seen on all beams of an FPS-10. Only one scope height finder. In addition, other sites in the immediate area were alerted sufficiently in advance to acclimate themselves to the situation, yet no other detections were made by these other stations.

It should be noted that no attempt was ever made for maintenance and did not return to operation until one minute after the target faded at Benton. The 1.0 blip-scan Ratio at Benton and the target location at the time of the fade would indicate the track should have been detected by Lockport.

The detection and fading characteristics of these targets were completely abnormal. The screening angles for Benton ARD do not exceed 6Â° throughout the area of concern. The tracks were detected well within the
