PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 24 Apr 54
2. LOCATION: Bellflower, Calif.
3. FORM UTILIZED: GC0-30002
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: N.A.
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 mins
7. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Four draftspeople had been working late in an office. About 10 p.m. they noticed four bright objects about the size of a silver dollar, moving rapidly across the sky. The two others following, moving very rapidly between 30 and 60 miles per hour, slowed down and appeared to be 'tailing' the first two which seemed to slow down very fast and then sped off rapidly.

8. CONCLUSIONS:
Possibly Balloon
Was Aircraft
Possibly Aircraft
Possibly Astronomical
Unknown

There were six sightings reported for flying objects in the local area at that time, which is probably what these were, possibly aircraft on training flights which were witnessed by several observers.
