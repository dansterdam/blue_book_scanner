1/20 Mart conducted a follow-up investigation of this sighting on 3 September 1957. Captain Davis, reporting officer of the original report, was interviewed regarding his report. The pilot's identity was established and the individual interviewed. He stated that the sighting was reported to him by his crew and when asked why the cone had apparently veered to the south shortly after sighting it. He said that he believed it was due to the reflection of the sun on the underside of the object.

The participating aircraft were based at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico and were not on a routine training flight. Captain Powell and Mr Payne of the Edwards Air Force Base Ballistic Missile Division were consulted and gave the opinion that the distance and velocity of the object were consistent with those of this type of drone.
