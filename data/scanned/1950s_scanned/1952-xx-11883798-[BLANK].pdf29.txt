5. Instruments
All reports that are substantiated by photographs or other instrument readings should be forwarded in compliance with AFR 200-2, so formal processing of documentation can be promptly initiated. On 4 June 1952, ADC requested that all ATIC agents who were equipped with Polaroid Land camera be furnished a special scientific type camera to attempt to photograph unknown aerial objects. A special questionnaire was prepared by the Electronics Branch of ATIC and furnished to the field. It was requested that this questionnaire accompany all reports of radar sightings. To date, only several such scope photos have been received.

The Collection Division of ATIC is presently developing a system for obtaining good quality photographs. A contract has been let to purchase the cameras. One hundred units will be supplied shortly. The format used will be 35mm, 4x5 and 16mm. These cameras will be delivered, equipped with a diffraction grating in front of the lens, and will be placed with observers shortly thereafter. It has not been fully decided who will use the cameras or when. The choice of observers, and the general procedures are the most likely centers of delay to this project.

6. Questionnaires
In an effort to obtain a questionnaire developed by a civilian contractor, the questionnaire contained in the questionnaire was developed by a group of experts and previously made a study of the problem of the collection of data on visual sightings of unidentified aerial objects. The questionnaire was designed to provide uniform reporting and to-ccnduct a systematic analysis of these reports. The interpretations of what has been observed. These questionnaires are now being used on a trial basis and after a fair sampling is obtained they will be reviewed and revised if necessary.

The majority of the cases covered by these questionnaires are the result of direct mail or telephone calls from observers who report a sighting through military channels. It is presently estimated that a majority of sightings are reported through these channels or by direct mail.

7. Clipping Service
ATIC has secured the services of a newspaper clipping service through which the services of a clipping agency are utilized. All clippings pertaining to unidentified aerial objects, large meteors, and other aerial phenomena are clipped from newspapers and forwarded to ATIC. This service has been found to be very useful in determining the extent of "Flaps" in certain local areas. In some instances, it has shown how newspaper articles or reports have triggered a local outbreak of reports.
