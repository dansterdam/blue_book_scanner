IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ILLUSIONS OF
AIRCRAFT TYPE OBJECTS SETTING ON
A LAYER OF ICE CRYSTALS OR A VERY THIN
CLOUD. IF THE SUN CONCEPTS, AND IS
MADE UP OF LIGHT REFLECTIONS AND REFRACTIONS
OF THE REFLECTION, CREATING THE ILLUSION
OF MOTION AS THE CLOUD MOBILITY
DECREASED. THE SUN WAS ALSO
CONDENSE AND WHICH WAS GENERALLY TOWARDS
THE NORTH THEREFORE THE REFRACTING DRIVING
TOWARDS THE SUN COULD HAVE IMPLIED
FOUR TIME APPARENT INCREASE IN ALTITUDE.
THE REPHRASY THAT THE OBJECT WAS AT

THERE WOULD BE NO APPARENT MOTION INIT
THE AMONT OF REFLECTION (LIGHT) BEGIN TO
DIMINISH.
THE FIRST JUMP THE TOWARDS WAS THE
