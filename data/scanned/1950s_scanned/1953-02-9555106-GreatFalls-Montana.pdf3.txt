1. On the night of 25 February 1953 Lieutenant Peter Marquart, 3/Sgt Dwyer M. Montana, were returning to their base in a car along Highway 87 from Shelby, Montana, were observing an investigation of a reported crash of an unidentified object near Dodson on the night of 22 February 1953.

2. At 2000 hours MST, they noticed a very bright, glowing object in the sky which they estimate to be at an altitude of 1,000 to 5,000 feet above the terrain. This light appeared to be at an altitude of some 1,000 to 5,000 feet above the terrain. This light maneuvered in a manner similar to bursting a parachute flare. After about 10 to 15 minutes the light went out and reappeared, descending rapidly to a very low attitude, and then climbed rapidly at great speed. This light exhibited no trail but continued to drop, resembling a parachute flare. At this point about half to the object had appeared to disintegrate completely.
