The image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document that primarily consists of text.

I will now proceed to act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and extract the text found in the document:

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: CORBIN, KENTUCKY
DATE: 9 FEBRUARY 1953

I would like to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object over the city of Corbin, Kentucky, on 9 February 1953. 

At approximately 1735 hours, I was driving my automobile near the downtown area when I observed a bright, oval-shaped object in the sky to the north. The object appeared to be stationary and was reflecting sunlight. I stopped my car to observe the object more closely. 

The object remained in the same position for approximately 2-3 minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from view to the northwest. I was unable to discern any sound or exhaust trail from the object.

I am a reliable witness with no known history of reporting unusual aerial phenomena. I am confident that what I observed was not a conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon. I request that this sighting be thoroughly investigated as part of Project Blue Book.

Respectfully submitted,
John Doe
Private Citizen
Corbin, Kentucky
