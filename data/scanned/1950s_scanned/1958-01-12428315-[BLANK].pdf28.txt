The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch of what appears to be a UFO sighting, as described in the text. The text states that the object was traveling at a speed estimated between 500 and 700 miles an hour, and had two sets of windows and a blue fluorescent glow underneath. The observer, identified as EDWARDS, reported the incident to the proper authorities and drew a sketch of what they saw.

EDWARDS:
Traveling at a speed estimated 
between 500 and 700 miles an hour, 
the light berg in on them. The
object was brilliantly lighted... 
it appeared to have two sets of
windows..and underneath, from the
belly of the ship, there was a
sort of blue fluorescent glow.

As they watched fascinated, the
object flashed by about 700 feet
to their right.

On landing, Chiles and Whitted
reported the incident to the
proper authorities and then each
drew a sketch of what he saw.
