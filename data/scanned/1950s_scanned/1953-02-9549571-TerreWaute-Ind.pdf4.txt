Terre Haute, Indiana
1 February 1953

I. Description of Incident:
A military aircraft on a 270Â° heading 10 miles west of Terre Haute sighted a close group of moving lights changing color from red to blue, to green to yellow. The pilot estimated their altitude to range between 20,000 ft. to 35,000 ft. flying in a manner similar to unconventional aircraft. Searchlights from the St. Louis area seemed to be on following the unidentified lights. The time of sighting was about 21:30.

II. Discussion of Incident:
ATIC made a check on local aircraft and found that there were many commercial airlines on their scheduled flights, but did not find any to account for the erratic lights of sighting. It is possible that searchlights from St. Louis picked up one of these aircraft. The observing aircraft was 100 miles away from St. Louis which probably accounts for the changing color of lights.

III. Conclusion:
Possibly manmade.
