APPENDIX VI

FORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY - 10-11 SEPTEMBER 1951

On 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of incidents occurred in the area of Fort Monmouth, N. J. An initial sighting of an unidentified object was made on 10 September by the radar station of the 6518th Test Squadron, two air force officers in a T-33 aircraft unsuccessfully attempted to intercept an unidentified object. Later several more sightings were reported.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

A complete investigation of this incident was carried out and will be reported in detail to AFOIN-V2. It has been tentatively determined that the T-33 pilots probably observed a balloon that had been released from the area. Although there were several other visual observations and the object was tracked on radar, it is believed these were either caused by the same balloon or were unidentified objects of a similar nature. The investigation is continuing in an effort to determine the cause of the incident and the exact nature of the objects observed.
