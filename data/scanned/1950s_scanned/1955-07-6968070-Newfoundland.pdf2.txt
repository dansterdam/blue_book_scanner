PAGE SEVEN
"ARCHIE 29" CALLED "ENRAGE" CONTROL AND VERIFIED MY ACCOUNT OF THE
OBJECT. AFTER POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF "ARCHIE 29", THE DISCUSSION
OF THE OBJECT WAS REFERRED TO AS TO ITS POSITION FROM "ARCHIE 29".
I VERIFIED ALL OF "ARCHIE 29'S" INFORMATION AND CONTINUED WATCHING
THE OBJECT UNTIL APPROX 23 MILES FROM HARMON FIELD. FROM THE INFORMATION
"ENRAGE" WAS GIVING "ARCHIE 29" IT WAS APPARENT THAT "ARCHIE 29"
WOULD MAKE ANY FURTHER REPORTS ON THIS OBJECT, SO I DECIDED TO LAND
AT HARMON AND CLEARED RC FROM THIS "ENRAGE" FREQUENCY." SIGNED LT ROBERT
W SICHENKO AN T77521 AFCT COMDR, KC-ST97 ARX (TDY EHAFD)
PART 6 "AFTER WE FINISHED OUR REFUELING RUN AT APPXY 0739Z, WE
RESUMED OUR HOMELAND COURSE AND WE HEARD LT SICHENKO REPORT THE
BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS MOVING VERY FAST AND ERRATICALLY. RIGHT AFTER
THE LIGHT CLOUD OUR SAW THE OBJECT AND POINTED IT OUT TO ME. I COULD
SEE IT. IT LOOKED LIKE A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT, LIKE STAR. WE TURNED TOWARDS
THE LIGHT AND DOUBT WAS THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED MOVEMENT. IT APPEARED
STATIONARY FOR QUITE A WHILE AND THEN IT MOVED IN EITHER NORTHERLY
OR SOUTHERLY DIRECTIONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES. EACH TIME IT MOVED,
WE TURNED, WE LOST TO KEEP IT AT 12 O'CLOCK POSITION. "ENRAGE"
FIRST REPORTED WE WERE 45 MILES FROM THE OBJECT. THE SKY WAS
FAIRLY LIGHT ON THE HORIZON AND BY CONTRAST THE OBJECT APPEARED
VERY BRIGHT. IT WAS AT ITS BRIGHTEST WHEN "ENRAGE" INFORMED US THAT
WE WERE 15 MILES FROM IT. AFTER THE SKY WAS GETTING LIGHTER, THE
OBJECT BECAME DIMMER AND MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE. ABOUT 0833Z, IT
DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY." SIGNED LT DAVID GUELDNER AC 3035255 CO-PILOT,
