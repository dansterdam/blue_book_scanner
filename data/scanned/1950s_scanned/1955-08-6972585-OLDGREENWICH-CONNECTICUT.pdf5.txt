The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page of an old document or report, possibly from Project Blue Book, that contains handwritten text.

I will now act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and transcribe the text from the document:

"FROM THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO, TELEPHONE MAIN 2-5251, EXT. 87178.  
"UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT - Extract from Special Reports File - REFERENCE: SIGHTING REPORTED FROM OLD GREENWICH, CONN., JULY 28, 1955.

"On the evening of July 28, 1955, at approximately 8:10 P.M., EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME, the witness, a resident of Old Greenwich, Connecticut, observed a strange object in the sky at a height estimated to be about 1,000 feet. The object was oval or elliptical in shape and was emitting a soft glow. The witness described the object as seeming to float or glide and made no sound. The witness watched the object for about 2 or 3 minutes as it moved across the sky in a northeasterly direction and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. The witness stated that the object made no maneuvers, and he could detect no means of propulsion. He stated that the object did not resemble any known aircraft, and he could discern no wings, tail, or other appendages. The witness has had considerable experience in observing aircraft and believes the object was not a conventional type of aircraft. The witness is considered a reliable reporter.
