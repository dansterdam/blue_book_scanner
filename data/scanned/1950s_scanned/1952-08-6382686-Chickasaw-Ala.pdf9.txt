OT1
31 AUG 1952
The following is a written statement concerning a strange sight observed by a military observer in the sky above Chickasaw, Alabama, on 31 Aug 52.
1. The following is a factual account of the incident as related by the observer:
2. At approximately 1155 hours on 31 Aug 52, I was standing outside a building facing west, when I observed an unusual object in the sky. It first appeared to be a solid silvery object, shaped like a cigar and moving at a very high rate of speed, approximately 150-200 feet above the ground. The object went into a steep climb and disappeared from sight. It was visible for approximately 15-20 seconds.
3. After the object disappeared, I immediately entered the building and reported the incident to the officer in charge. The officer in charge advised that he also observed the object, confirming my description.
4. In preparing this statement, I have again carefully reviewed the incident in my mind, and I am confident that my description of the object and its maneuvers are accurate. I am unable to offer any explanation as to the identity or origin of the object. I am in good physical condition, have normal eyesight, and am familiar with a wide variety of aircraft. This is the first and only time I have observed an object of this nature.
