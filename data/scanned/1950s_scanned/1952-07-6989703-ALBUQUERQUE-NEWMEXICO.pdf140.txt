The image appears to contain a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s. The document appears to be a report about an incident that occurred on July 29, 1952, near Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The text in the document states that on the 29th of July 1952, while conducting training in the local area, a WAF aircraft observed a bright object at an altitude of 30,000 and 40,000 feet. The object was thought to be another aircraft, but after several minutes of observation, it was determined that the object was not a known aircraft and was exhibiting unusual behavior, such as rapidly changing altitude and direction.

The document also mentions that the object was observed for a period of about 2-3 minutes and that it appeared to be losing altitude before it disappeared from view.

Air Force Office, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On the 29th of July 1952, while conducting training in the WAF area about 1300 hours (M.S.T.), a WAF aircraft observed a bright object at an altitude of 30,000 and 40,000 feet. At first, it was thought that this was another aircraft, but after about 7-8 minutes of very close attention to it, it was decided that this was not a known aircraft and that it was exhibiting peculiar characteristics between an altitude of 30,000 and 40,000 feet. At first, attention was fixed on it for a period of approximately 5 minutes, and it was assumed to be bobbing up and down, and darting here and there, and it appeared to be increasing and decreasing in altitude. While maintaining this position, it was noted that it appeared to be losing altitude, and after a period of about 2-3 minutes and decided to report it to the Command Center (GCI), while watching it to see if it would reappear. When it did not reappear, the WAF aircraft returned to base.

Sworn statement before me this 30th day of July 1952.
