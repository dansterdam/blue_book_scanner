Following is a translation of an article which appeared in the newspaper "Nieuws van de Dag" on 18 July 1952.

"STRANGE PHENOMENON PHOTOGRAPH:" and at the same time STRANGE PHENOMENON
"In the early morning on Tuesday the 15th of this month, the public was stirred by an extraordinary incident at Delft (Netherlands). A young man who is employed by the Dutch Army as a radio mechanic, on his way to his place of work observed a flying object and succeeded in photographing it. 

He described the object as follows: It was circular in form, appeared to be hovering over the spot and at times appeared to stand still and at other times to move in a horizontal direction, but rapidly. The object appeared to be of metallic construction. 

On reaching his place of work, the young man developed the exposed film and noticed an extremely bright light which was, so he said, as appeared later, moving from one side to the other.

The witness stated that when he raised his camera to take the photograph, the object was stationary, but when the photograph was taken, the object commenced to move in a diagonal direction. He claims that at the moment I took the snap-shot, I noticed a very bright light which was very painful to the eyes. This light was so bright that it was almost impossible to look at it directly.

When the film was developed, it was found that this bright light had made its appearance on the photograph. The witness further stated that, for about 15 seconds, the object stood still, after which it commenced to move in a diagonal direction at a very high speed. He was able to remember all the details very well, as the incident occurred at 7.30 A.M. 

This matter was reported to the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute who were very anxious to put this young "camera researcher" in touch with their experts. It was ascertained that the curious size which the object for (which?) the photograph showed, could not be explained by any known astronomical or physical phenomenon. As far as is known unique in this country. They would investigate further the possibiltiy of the camera being interfered with or the chemical development of the film having somehow been affected.

It was ascertained that the enormous size which the object for (which?) the photograph showed, could not be explained by any known astronomical or physical phenomenon. All properties point to the fact that it must have been a phenomenon of some kind, as yet unknown.

The possibility which was suggested, that the lens of the camera might have been interfered with or that the chemical development of the film might have been affected in some unexplained manner, could not be seen but which are considered by the photographic plate - the "deviation" - is not clear. What was the matter of fact question is not what did really happen? the explanation is not loose."
