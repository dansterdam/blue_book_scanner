Dear Sir:

I would like to report, as a matter of official record, an occurrence that I believe may be of some interest, at least as a matter of official record.

In Sacramento, California, on about November 15, 1952, it was my privilege to witness a strange occurrence in the sky at a height of about 100 feet. The time was about 5:30 p.m. I observed this white stone it moved across the sky in a very rapid and erratic direction. The observation was made in the rear of my residence at 4:30 p.m.

On approximately May 20, 1953, in the city of Los Angeles, it was my privilege to observe the same white stone. The time was about 9:30 a.m. and it was almost directly overhead and slightly from the northwest. It came to rest abruptly over the area of about 1.5 feet altitude and obviously was controlled in some way. It remained exactly stationary for a few moments and then it dashed almost directly overhead and slightly from the northwest. It came to rest abruptly over the area of about 1.5 feet altitude and obviously was controlled in some way. It remained exactly stationary for a few moments and then it dashed off in a rapid and erratic direction that reminded me for its appearance and dimension of football game and which was what it at first. We about the same extent and size.
