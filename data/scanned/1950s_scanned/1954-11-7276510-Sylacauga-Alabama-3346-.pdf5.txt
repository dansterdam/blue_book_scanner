ON 7 NOVEMBER 1954, A METEORITE WEIGHING APPROXIMATELY 8 1/2 POUNDS FELL THROUGH THE ROOF AND STRUCK MRS. ANN HODGES, WHO WAS TAKING AN AFTERNOON NAP ON A COUCH IN HER HOME. MRS. HODGES SUFFERED A BADLY BRUISED HIP. THE METEORITE SHATTERED A WOODEN RADIO TABLE AND CRACKED THE CEILING. IT IS BELIEVED TO BE THE ONLY VERIFIED CASE OF A PERSON BEING STRUCK BY A FALLEN METEORITE.
