PATROL SQUADRON TWENTY THREE

On 29 August 1952, while on a cosmic balloon tracking flight, I observed the balloon at about 71,000 feet at about 1955Z. I was sitting in the pilot's seat on the port side of the aircraft and was circling slightly to the left on a heading of approximately 060T when the balloon released the parachute and sent the instrument package to the ground. The instrument package descended at a rate of approximately 2,000 feet per minute and I was flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet.

There was an undercast. * * * * I was flying a TF-2 at a speed of about 150 knots. To my knowledge, this was the first cosmic air traffic in which I had participated.

As I closed in on the balloon, it appeared to be a glassy, transparent type structure. I observed three objects, slightly smaller than the balloon, shaped like round discs and they were circling the balloon. However, this impression vanished when I realized they were in reality pennant-shaped patterns with the main balloon. As the instrument package descended, I was tracking it and forming a diaond-shaped pattern with the main balloon, the two objects I had observed, and myself.

I called "IT CALLS" as I was in the co-pilot's seat and because of the relative position of the balloon and the fact that we were in a half standard cat left turn did not observe them as the main concern centered on the package descending. As the balloon shrank in size, the objects had disappeared. I called the "Icebreaker" upon sighting the objects and while they were still within view and asked how many objects were to have been released. They replied that only one had been.
