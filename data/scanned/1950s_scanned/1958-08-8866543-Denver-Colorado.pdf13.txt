The text of the document is as follows:

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Thank you for your letter to the Secretary of Defense, dated 8 September 1956, referred to this office for reply.

Without more specific information, we cannot make a definite conclusion as to the object which you observed. However, your description fits the basic pattern of one of the U.S. Air Force jet aircraft. While the flight maneuvers you observed would appear unusual, this could point to the fact that a jet aircraft in a climbing position may appear to be moving very slow.

We have added your report to our files for reference in our continuing investigation of aerial phenomena, and we appreciate your interest. 

Sincerely yours,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information Services

Mr. [redacted]
Brooklyn 15, New York
