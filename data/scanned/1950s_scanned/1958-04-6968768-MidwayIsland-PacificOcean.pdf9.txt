April 39, 1958

A fenny A. Wendt, Lt. U.S.N. now on the 35th day of operation between 0900 & 1600 and 0830 and 1200, have been in that highlighted segment of the coast line on Midway Island when I observed the following:

Between 1300 and 1400 hours, I was sitting on my usual observing post, when I sighted a dark object coming in from the southwest, traveling relatively slow and very low. The object appeared to be round or elliptical in shape, and of a dark color. As it approached Midway, it appeared to be maintaining a constant altitude of approximately 300 feet above the terrain. As it passed over the island, it did not deviate from its course, and it continued on for a distance of approximately 5 to 6 miles before it disappeared from sight over the horizon to the northeast.

I immediately called the control tower and reported the sighting. I can say without reservation that the object I observed did not appear to be any type of aircraft with which I am familiar. It is my opinion that this object was not of this earth.

Lts. A. A. Rauch, P. A. Harris, U.S.N., are witnesses to this report.
