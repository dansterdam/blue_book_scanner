On 6 November at about 0600, I looked at an object or light. It looked at first like a minute, silvery ball, stationary and luminous like green on a dark watch face. It was still dark outside, not daylight. The object, about 4 inches long, moved slowly and steadily to the left, front, without sound and luminous like green on a dark watch face, but could not be seen well at times. Its velocity checked up by my first the object increased speed and took a zig-zag course, first in fast, then a slow zig-zag and finally out of sight. Angle of elevation was about 15-20 degrees. The object was about 15-20 inches long and the width was about 4 inches. Long at a time length. Angle of elevation was about 15-20 degrees. The object was about 15-20 inches long and the width was about 4 inches.
