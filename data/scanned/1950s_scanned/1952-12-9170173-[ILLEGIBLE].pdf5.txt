The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

On the night of Oct 4, 1959, an Air Force pilot at Laredo, Texas, had a strange encounter. The pilot reported seeing a strange device in the sky. Twelve miles from the field, the pilot told ground control that he was pursuing an object. It had been no accident. The strange device had raced down at his fighter, then climbed straight up. The pilot was badly shaken by the incident. 

Three years before, many Air Force officers had been puzzled by the object at Fogie's report. The UFO intelligence officers grilled him on every detail. Did the UFO (unidentified flying object) seem to be under remote control? What was its size and shape? Its speed compared with a jet? Did the blue light blink or pulsate? The Air Technical Intelligence Center at Dayton, Ohio, and intelligence headquarters in Washington, D.C. were interested in the Laredo incident. The intelligence report was cleared for me by Albert M. Chop, the Air Force civilian expert on UFOs. Chop had learned most of the details from Project Bluebook. When he transferred to the Pentagon, he had become the Air Force's chief spokesman on flying saucers.

(The Air Technical Intelligence Center's summary of the Laredo incident was sent by a LOOK magazine writer in September 1952.)

The official conclusion on the case was: "Possible air-to-air observation."
