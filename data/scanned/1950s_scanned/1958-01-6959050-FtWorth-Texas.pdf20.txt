There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed document or report.

This incident is of sufficient interest to me, and presumably to others, and I am writing to describe it as fully as I can remember.

Conceivably no corroboration of this observation will ever be found, but I am making this report in order that it may go on record for whatever value it may have.

This object was observed by my wife and me, and any reference to "I" or "me" in this report should be understood to include both of us, unless otherwise specified.

On the evening of January 22, at approximately 8:30 p.m., while on the Trinity University moon-watch team in San Antonio, sighting a "relatively very bright" object about 6,130 F.P.H. Tuesday evening January 22, which he speculated might be Sputnik II. The source given however was northeast to southwest, while the passage I observed was from south to north, somewhat to the west. I have not seen any public announcement of a launching of an American satellite.

I am willing to cooperate as a witness in this matter.
