I can't think of anything pertinent. 
In my original letter accompanying the negatives 
I gave the conditions under which they were made, 
and with that information and the negatives I'm sure 
you have on your staff some one who can 
scrutinize them and come up with positive answers. 

In paragraph 1 (g) of my letter of 7 July 1952 I estimated 
the time as 1600 hours and in 1 (a) the date was not stated 
but the almanac for 1950 shows that it was 1645 hours 
on 11 Sept 1950 (Bering Sea Time) or 0345 hours 
12 Sept 1950 by GMT as used in the ALMANAC 
If I can be of any further assistance you have my address.
