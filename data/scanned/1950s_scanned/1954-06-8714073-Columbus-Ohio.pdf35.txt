There is no photograph present in this image, only hand-drawn sketches. The image contains two sketches:

1. The first sketch depicts a curved trajectory showing how high the observed object was above the horizon.

2. The second sketch shows a larger landscape sketch with a person standing in the foreground, and a smaller inset sketch showing an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

Here is the text I have extracted from the image:

32. In the following sketch, imagine you are looking at the point shown. Place a dot where you first saw the object, and a "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, draw your sketch of the position the object was in when you first saw it. Here is a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
