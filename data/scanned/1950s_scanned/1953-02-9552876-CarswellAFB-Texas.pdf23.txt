CASE #3 (CONT'D)
INCIDENT: The original observer, 3 other observers witnessed this incident. An Electronics Data Sheet was forwarded to Carswell AFB to be filled out so as to get technical information on radar.

The radar data contained in the report from Carswell AFB was not sufficient for analysis purposes. For instance, there was no indication that the target observed on the radar was the same as the visual sighting. The weather data contained indicated that there was a temperature inversion and a moisture lapse at about the time of the incident. This weather condition could cause radar ground clutter signals to appear above the horizon, although the report states that a check indicated no ground return signals were received. A wire was sent to Carswell AFB requesting information as to whether the objects were seen on radar. Radar operators at Carswell AFB stated that this was not the case and they did not move in azimuth. Also stated that blip did not change size. Blip disappeared into noise and did not reappear. Radar eye observers then attempted to pick them up on tail radar of another a/c. This attempt was unsuccessful. 

ATTIC FILM AND CONCLUSION
Based on the above stated information, there was a temperature inversion at the time of sighting and it is believed by ATTIC analysts that radar sighting was a temperature inversion or weather effects on radar and the visual sighting was an a/c flight.
