1. After making a local routine investigation it was decided by the investigators that there was not enough information available to determine what the object was that was sighted. Therefore the investigators proceeded to the area of sighting and the following information was recorded:
2. At 0800, 13 May 1958, Capt Hoffman was contacted at the Filter Center in Charleston W.Va., and stated that after checking all observation posts, in the area of sighting, no unusual sightings were called in during 8 and 9 May 1958, also that he had not received a UFOB report in over two months.
3. At 1645, 13 May 1958, the investigators reported to 1st Lt Miller, adjutant of the 783rd ACWI Squadron, Guthrie AFS, W.Va. They were then taken to Capt Schwarz, Chief Controller, and a complete check of all traces and radar scope readings were made for a period of four hours before and after the time given for the UFOB sighting. All traces were identified by the Chief Controller and there were no indications of a UFOB in the reported area during 8 and 9 May 1958.
4. At 1345, 13 May 1958, the investigators departed Guthrie AFS and proceeded to Marietta, Ohio. They arrived at Marietta, Ohio, at 1510, 13 May 1958, and reported to Sheriff Dean Ellis, Sheriff of Washington County, Ohio. A check was made and it was found out that the source had given an erroneous address on the report. A further check was made with the post office and it was found out that the last address given by Source was at 11111 Marietta, Ohio. After checking the above address it was found out that Source had moved to 22222 Marietta, Ohio. A check was made at the new address and no one was at home. After checking with neighbors it was found that the owner of the home was at work. The owner was contacted at his place of employment and confirmed the fact that the Source was living at his home as a roomer. The Source was then contacted at approximately 1645, 13 May 1958, and taken to the Town Motel for an interview regarding the UFOB he reported.
5. The Source was quite cooperative; however, immediately before the interview began, Source informed the investigators that he had given "false" rights as an "eyewitness."
