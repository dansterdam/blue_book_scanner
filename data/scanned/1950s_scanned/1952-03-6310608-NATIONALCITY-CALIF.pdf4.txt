While driving my car east on 12th St., my wife and I observed what appeared to be a bright light.
By auto accident, my attention was called to this object in the sky, said, "What's that unusual looking thing?" I looked around in the sky and it appeared to be about the size of a basketball, self-luminous, and had the appearance of a very bright star, which cast a glow on the ground below it. The object was hovering, and then suddenly it made a very fast start, going in a southerly direction, and then stopped just as suddenly. This was repeated several times. Finally the object moved slowly eastward. The motion may have been due to the earth's rotation, that is it may have been stationary. I was unable to detect any sound connected with the object.
As far as I could determine, this was probably no more than a mile to the south of me. The size of the object was certainly not over that of a basketball, and the lumination was bright enough to cast a glow on the ground below it. The object did not appear to be anything known to me, and I have had considerable experience in observing celestial objects. The object was visible for approximately 25 minutes.
I am an aircraft mechanic and I have been trained to recognize aircraft identification, and I can state with confidence that this was not a known type of aircraft.
The above is a true statement.
