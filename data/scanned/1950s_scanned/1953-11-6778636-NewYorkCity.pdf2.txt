38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I have no idea but the brightness of the light and the precision in which it moved across the horizon lead me to believe it was some type of machine operated by intelligent beings rather than any natteral phenomena. It could fail to appear through the clouds at once and could be seen again instantly indicating that it was under intelligent control. It may be that such visitations are military test flights, secret experiments or some other classified phenomena but I do not feel that it was my duty to report it to the authorities since I only caught a brief glimpse and was unsure of the significance or what I had witnessed.
