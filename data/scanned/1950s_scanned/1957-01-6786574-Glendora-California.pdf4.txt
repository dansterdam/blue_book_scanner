Early 1957: Palm Springs, Califâ€”
A male witness and two others sight-
ed a formation of five UFOs while
unloading silo from a semi-trailer 
near the city limits. The UFOs,
presumably oval contoured, per-
fect formation as they passed
directly overhead and flew out of
sight over Mt. Jacinto in about 3 
seconds. The time was about 11:00
p.m. and the sky was very clear.
