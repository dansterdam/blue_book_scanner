38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I think the object was some kind of aircraft or craft, but I'm not sure what it was or what caused it. I've never seen anything like it before. It was hovering silently above the trees and then suddenly took off at a high speed. I really can't explain what it was or where it came from.
