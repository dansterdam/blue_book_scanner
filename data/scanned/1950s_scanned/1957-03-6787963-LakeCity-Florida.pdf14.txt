27 February 1953

Dear Professor,

This is to confirm for your letter of 20 February 1953 concerning our interest in your sketches of an unidentified aerial object which was observed over Lake City, Florida on 13 March 1952.

Our Air Technical Intelligence Center has received no report of that particular incident. We do have records of several aerial sightings, reports and case histories, but this particular one does not seem to be included. If you do have a written account of this incident, it would be greatly appreciated if you could send us a copy of it. We would be most interested in obtaining all the details possible concerning this event.

Many sightings of this nature are reported directly to the Air Force. As you know, the Air Force is charged with the responsibility for the investigation of the Air Force. Any person does go into the direction of the Air Force, and especially reported to us.

The implication that the contents of this picture may usually classified or may be withheld by the Air Force from available statistics or reports is possible. An incidents of this nature are considered classified aspects of investigations, trials and legal restraints, and other unclassified aspects of investigations generally are published or distributed for public information. If we do find this case in our files, it may indicate that it is in the category of classified incidents not usually made available to public.

Your report on records and details has been reviewed with much interest and will become a part of our permanent files on this subject.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

LEONARD J. CALDER
Lieutenant Colonel, USAF
Chief, Technical Analysis Division
