Transcribing the text in the document:

At about 1:30 PM EST on 10/6/59 USAF MASTER SGT GA WAS CONTACTED BY 6A ROLAND BARNARD AGE 56 WHO STATED THAT HE HAD SEEN A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY NEAR WASHINGTON GA. HE SAID WHAT HE OBSERVED TO BE FLOATING OVER THE AREA WAS APPROXIMATELY 50-75 FEET IN DIAMETER, ROUND, SHINY, SILVER COLOR AND MOVING WITH NO SOUND. HE WATCHED IT FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES THEN IT SHOT AWAY AT A VERY HIGH SPEED. UNABLE TO SEE ANY STRUCTURAL DETAILS OR MEANS OF PROPULSION. ALSO NOTICED SOME 4 CONVENTIONAL MILITARY AIRCRAFT CIRCLING OVERHEAD DURING THE SIGHTING. I WATCHED THESE JETS FOR SOME 15-20 MINUTES AND THEY APPEARED TO BE MANEUVERING.
