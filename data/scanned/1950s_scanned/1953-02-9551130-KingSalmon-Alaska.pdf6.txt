On 6 February 1953 at 2055 A.M.P.S.T., the Officer in Charge Station reported that the 705th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron received a report from King Salmon, Alaska that a light was sighted in the sky to the west of the field. Nothing unusual could be determined by further investigation. The tower stated for sure information and was informed that the object had disappeared.

1550 hours, King Salmon, Alaska is an isolated G.C.A. airfield located at 58-41N 156-39W. There are no weather observers at King Salmon Airport to report they had not sent up any balloons that day. The only air traffic in the area was very clear and the temperature was very comfortable.

All administration personnel and all saw the light. Their signed statements are attached. The matter is still under investigation at the time of the interview from land marks observed at the time of the sighting.
