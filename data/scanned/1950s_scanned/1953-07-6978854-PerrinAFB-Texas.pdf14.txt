The handwritten text states:
"To answer your question and explain just what I saw and thought about, the I saw a strange object flying near Perrin AFB that looked like a formation of several apparently uncooordinated objects moving at high speed at about 10,000 feet and at a direction of 180 degrees. This happened for about 2 or 3 minutes before the objects disappeared. I could not estimate their size or exact nature, but they did not resemble any aircraft I am familiar with. Please let me know if you need any further information."
