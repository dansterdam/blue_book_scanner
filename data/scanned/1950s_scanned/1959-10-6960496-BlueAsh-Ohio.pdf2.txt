For your information-

On Sunday, 11 October 1959, at about 10:00 p.m. (EST) while working at the AISI airfield (CALOH is about 50 miles ESE of WPAFB) I saw a bright light source.

I first saw this object while looking at a C-47 landing in over the airfield. The object appeared to be an exceptionally bright star.

Having established the location of the object, I obtained a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars.

Using the binoculars magnified the object considerably. (It has been my experience that binoculars do not perceptibly magnify a star.)

The object appeared to be unusually, and nearly as bright as the sun, the brightest side being that aide toward the east.

Using the magnetic compass on an airplane, I determined the object to be bearing 57.1 degrees above the horizon.

I watched the object for about 20 minutes and it did not appear to move.

Then, with this information I telephoned Cincinnati Approach Control and spoke to one of the radar observers.

He said he was unable to establish anything.

The object appeared to be stationary for another 10 minutes and then disappeared or our visibility was lost.

About an hour later, having the opportunity to look again, the object was no longer visible.

The weather was clear. and visibility, and quite windy.

The weather was also clear and the visibility was unlimited, and quite windy.
