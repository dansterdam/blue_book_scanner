The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a detailed illustration and text describing Venus and other celestial objects. The text describes Venus as a "brilliant object in the sky" that will soon be joined by another object, and provides information about the stellar constellations and their appearances in the night sky. The illustration includes a star map showing the positions of various stars and constellations.

VENUS MOST PROMINENT
Venus, the brightest object in the evening sky, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the "Shower of Stars"

BY JAMES STOKLEY

Right at the present time, you can see in the western sky, just after sundown, a brilliant, dazzling "star". This is not a star at all, but the planet Venus, the second planet from the sun. It is outshining all the real stars visible at that time of the evening.

This brilliant object in the sky is Venus, the "morning star" and the "evening star," a planet more prominent than any other star. Venus appears so bright because it is relatively close to the Earth, much closer than most of the other planets. It is only 25 million miles away from us at the present time.

Venus circles the sun in an orbit closer than the Earth's. Consequently, as it goes around the sun, it appears to go through phases like the Moon, sometimes appearing as a thin crescent, sometimes as a half-moon, and sometimes as a brilliant full disk. Now it is in a stage where it appears as a brilliant full disk.

Not in Position at All
Venus is not in position to be seen as the "morning star" at the present time. But in the evenings it is readily visible in the western sky just after sunset, a brilliant object that cannot be mistaken for any star.

As November progresses, Venus will appear to climb higher in the sky in the evenings, though it will still be low on the horizon. By mid-November it will begin to be joined by another brilliant object - a "Shower of Stars" which we call the Geminid meteor shower.

The Geminid meteor shower is one of the most spectacular of the year, and it produces meteors that seem to come from the direction of the constellation Gemini, the Twins. This shower will reach its maximum on the night of November 12-13, when there may be as many as 40 or 50 meteors per hour visible.

As the month of November advances, Venus will continue to be a prominent object in the evening sky, though it will be gradually drawing closer to the horizon, and will disappear from view sometime in December. In the meantime, it will be joined by the "Shower of Stars" as the Geminids make their appearance.

The part of the sky occupied by Venus contains a number of interesting celestial objects. Most prominent are the so-called "Andromeda Galaxy," a gigantic system of stars so distant that it requires a telescope to see it clearly. This galaxy, situated in the northern part of the sky, is the only one visible to the naked eye, although there are millions of other galaxies in the universe, so far away that their light is too faint to be seen without the aid of a large telescope.

There are also many bright stars visible in this part of the sky. Prominent among these is the star Capella, a member of the constellation Auriga, the Charioteer. Capella is a brilliant golden star, outshining all the other stars in its vicinity.

Another group of stars worth noting in this part of the sky is the constellation Cassiopeia, the Queen, with its distinctive "W" shaped pattern. Just to the northeast of Venus is another famous constellation, Andromeda, the Princess.

So in the evening sky, during the next few weeks, be sure to watch for the bright, steady glow of Venus, and at the same time watch for the "Shower of Stars" - the Geminid meteors as they make their annual appearance.
