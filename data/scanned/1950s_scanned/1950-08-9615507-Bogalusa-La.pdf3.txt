"UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT"

I have the honour to refer to your letter on the above subject dated 22nd August 1950 rer. 50/5/27/Int. and to state that the following information on the following points:

a. For what length of time had the aircraft's track been observed prior to the scrambling of the meteors at 1400 and from what direction had it appeared?

b. What was the speed prior to the scrambling and were there any subsequent alterations? What was the ground speed and direction at 40,000 feet?

c. What was the hostile's outgoing track and for how long was it observed?

d. Has any check been made with the Dutch C. & E. R. organisation for that date or Allied squadrons operating in that area?

e. This report is considered most interesting as if it can be positively established that an aircraft was flying at the time, area and height, then consideration must be given to the possibility of an aircraft like the Type 27 I.s.f.R. role.

I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
H. Basset Collins
