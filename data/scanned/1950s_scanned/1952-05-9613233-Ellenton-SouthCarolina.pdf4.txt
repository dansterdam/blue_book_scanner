There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a report from a "cooperating observer" about an observation of a "meteor" that was seen on May 10, 1952 at 2:54 A.M. The object was observed for about 2 seconds at an altitude of 65 degrees and traveled north and disappeared at an altitude of 25 degrees.
