No plate (or rather frame) distortion correction formula has been
applied to the UFO's coordinates as measured directly from the film.
It is assumed that since the objects are near the center of the frame for
most of the shots, the error due to distortion or emulsion shrinkage etc.
would be much less than when the standard deviation of 45" and therefore would
not affect the reliability of the measurements.
