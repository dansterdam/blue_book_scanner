Discussion
This sighting is one of the best in Project Blue Book's files as far as details are concerned. However, due to the efforts to report the sighting and it is unfortunate that the contents in the efforts to report the sighting were lost and to the procedure for reporting unidentified flying objects. The description of this object, and the length of time observed rules out any conventional objects in our atmosphere.Project Blue Book's contract astronomers were contacted. They stated that this sighting was undoubtedly caused by the planet Venus.
Conclusion 
Was astronomical (Venus).
