AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

276th FIGHTER-BOMBER WING

SUBJECT: UFO: Fighter pilot sighting of a bright light chasing a star. 
WHEN: 27 Feb 53, 1930L 
WHERE: Over Honshu, Japan
OBSERVER: Pilot, 276th Fighter-Bomber Wing

NARRATIVE: The pilot of a F-84 jet fighter observed a bright light chasing a star-like object during night flight over Honshu, Japan. The pilot first noticed the light at 1930L hours. It was a very bright light, brighter than the star it was chasing, and appeared to be on a converging course with the star. The light gained on the star, pulled alongside it, and then accelerated sharply away. The whole event lasted approximately 30 seconds.

The pilot states that the light appeared to be a solid object, not merely a point source of light. It had no trail or exhaust, and no noise was detected. The pilot continued his mission and did not attempt to pursue or investigate further.

OPINIONS: Pilot is considered reliable and his story is consistent with other UFO reports received. The lack of any exhaust or sound suggests the object was not an aircraft. Possibility of meteor or other natural celestial phenomena cannot be ruled out, however, the maneuvering capabilities described are not typical of such objects. The incident remains unidentified.

CONCLUSION: This incident is being forwarded to higher headquarters for further analysis and evaluation. More data is needed to determine the nature of the observed phenomenon.
