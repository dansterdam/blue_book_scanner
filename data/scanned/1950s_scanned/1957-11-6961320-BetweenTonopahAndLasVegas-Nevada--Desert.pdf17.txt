"Ltr, Dist Comdr, 5th Dist OSI, Subj: (C) Req for Spl Investigations

a. A discreet investigation of the officer's background, with emphasis on leads and indications that would suggest any tendency towards exaggerations or possibility of a hoax.

b. An hour-by-hour accountability of the 72 hour period preceding the alleged sighting, with full consideration given to those points specifically mentioned in Dr. Hynek's report.

c. Contact and coordination with both the Flight Surgeon and pertinent authorities of the Survival School, to determine the nature of the course, its possible effects on trainees, and any information regarding unusual physical conditions, performance and including his physical and mental condition during and at the completion of this rigid course.

d. This matter is considered urgent for the manifold reasons found in the attached case file, and particularly if this officer completes his tour of duty, or otherwise severs his relations with the Air Force prior investigations to determine the actual facts have been completed.

6. The case file should provide you with valuable guidance and assistance in pursuance of this matter. (UNCL)
