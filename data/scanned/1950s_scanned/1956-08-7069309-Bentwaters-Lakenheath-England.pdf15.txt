"SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
1. REFERENCE is made to the following information received from the Radar Intercept Officer of the 607th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, RAF Station Bentwaters, England, concerning unidentified flying objects observed over the Bentwaters-Lakenheath area on the night of 13-14 August 1956.

2. At approximately 2300 hours on 13 August 1956, the RAF Radar Intercept Officer at Bentwaters reported that the Bentwaters and Lakenheath radar stations had detected a number of unidentified, high speed, high altitude targets over the area. The targets were observed to make abrupt changes in direction and speed, disappearing and reappearing on the radar scopes. These targets were tracked for a period of approximately 6 hours.

3. At about 0010 hours on 14 August 1956, one of the unidentified targets was observed to split into two distinct targets which then closed in on an R.A.F. fighter aircraft which was airborne and vectored to intercept the targets. The fighter pilot reported that as he closed on the targets, they executed a sharp turn and rapidly accelerated, pulling away from the fighter at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour.

4. The fighter pilot stated that the targets appeared to be solid, metallic, disc-shaped objects, approximately 30 feet in diameter. This incident lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes."
