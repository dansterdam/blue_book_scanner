"SAFOI-3t/M!3 Tucker/soti/72291

Memo for SAPO, SQbj: Letter from C/S Pucinsld

Dr. — — is a confirmed believer that space travel
is reverse and we are being watched by intelligent beings from
other planets. He believes that UFO's or popularly termed "flying
saucers" are space ships.

There has considerable correspondence with Mr. — — 
on this subject and he has been informed on two or three occasions
that the Joint Army-Navy-Air Force publication #SR is out of print
and is too voluminous to copy. In this same reply he is invited to visit
his office where he can read and copy this publication in whole or
in part.

His request for Army publications should, of course, be
directed to the Department of the Army and Mr. — — should be
informed that classified documents are not available.
