GLOWING OBJECT CHASES 1960
CAR IN NORTH CAROLINA. APO

On Tuesday, November 3, several re-
ports were made to law enforcement
agencies regarding a mysterious glowing
ball of light in the eastern sky about 3
a.m. Weather Bureau officials at the
Raleigh-Durham Airport explained these
as possibly a weather balloon which they
had released at 3 am. and which 'might
no in the sun' at about that time. A
State Highway Patrol dispatcher at Salis-
bury said the object appeared very large,
glowing and still visible in the east, mov-
ing south at about 3 a.m.

Not so easily disposed of, however,
was the report of ___, a
Tayloresville used car dealer, who report-
ed a 'ball of light' which chased his
car along a deserted highway at about
1 a.m. --two hours before the weather
balloon was launched. ___ driving
near Statesville. and observed the object
as it came within several yards of his
vehicle several times. He said it hovered
over the car 'Just above tree-top level'
and moved alternately at slow and very
fast speeds. He stopped his car six times
and each time the object stopped also.
During this same time there were re-
ports of the bluish-white fireball being
observed over a 50-mile radius in the
game area.
