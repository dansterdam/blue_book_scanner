a. Source cannot give exact date or time, only that incident took place sometime in June or July, 1956.
b. No properly solve any UFO case, immediate reporting of the incident is necessary for on-the-spot investigations. A matter of a few days' delay can render the investigations worthless.

An electrical discharge, often referred to as St. Elmo's fire, and associated with swamps and particularly if methane gas (CH4) is in the area.
