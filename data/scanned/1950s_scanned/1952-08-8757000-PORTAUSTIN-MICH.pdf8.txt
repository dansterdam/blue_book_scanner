On the 6th of August, 1952, at 07:12 an unidentified target was observed on our radar scopes in the vicinity of Carp Bay, Ontario. This blip had the appearance and size of a multi-engine aircraft, but manner of flight characteristics was not characteristic of normal flight handling by this station.

The above-mentioned caused us to plot this target and notify ACAO of same. Radar maintenance men on duty at the time did not believe that the blip was caused by interference from a nearby station.

This target when first observed was on a 300° heading into our station, and varied within a range of 70 miles. It then approached at a range of 30 miles on an outbound course of 050°. Speed was estimated in excess of 800 knots. At the time of last detection, the target was at a range of 200 miles.
