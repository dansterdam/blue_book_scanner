These two celestial occurrences should have been sufficient to hold us, but make not

On the night of January 14, I was in my back yard about 10:30 p.m., looking at the stars through my 4-inch telescope. At that particular moment, I had stopped away from my scope and was looking in the direction of Gemini (Castor and Pollux), when suddenly four oval-shaped objects came out from behind the other and in perfect formation, flew across my line of sight, very low. (I would say under 150 feet.) These objects were not lighted at all, were grayish in color from the lights of the city (the moon was not in the sky). They were flying exactly uniform in speed, at less than 200 miles an hour. I would say, if the objects were as low as they appeared. In less than one minute, they disappeared from sight. As a guess, I would say their exact flying speed in relation to each other. It is possible that each was a thought to the same long object which would be invisible if it were painted black (like gondolas under a dirigible). No sound was audible, nor even a murmur.

My private theory is that at Killington Field, about 20 miles southeast of my house, where many jets are in operation, knows something about these objects. If they belong to our government (power without sound or light and perfect maneuvability) we've got the next war won.
