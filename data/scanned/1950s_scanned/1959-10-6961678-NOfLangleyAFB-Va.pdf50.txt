     This report is based on the observation of two employees of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Langley Field, Virginia, on 6 October 1959. The observers were Kendall R. Moore, Engineering and Technical Assistant, and John Watkins, Engineering and Technical Assistant. Both observers are considered to be reliable and credible.

     On the date and time mentioned above, Moore and Watkins were working in their office at the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, when they observed an unusual object in the sky through a window. The object was first seen at approximately 4:15 p.m. and was visible for about 4 minutes. The object was described as a flat, round, silvery, metallic object, hovering and maneuvering at a high altitude. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and seemed to be in a horizontal position. It was observed to make several very rapid angular movements, and at one point it appeared to tilt slightly, revealing what appeared to be a dark, round area or opening in the center of the underside.

     Both observers indicated that the object moved in a very unusual and unnatural manner, making sudden starts, stops, and angular turns that seemed to defy the normal laws of motion and aerodynamics. They stated that it was unlike any aircraft or other known object they had ever observed in the sky. After a period of approximately 4 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view, moving in a northeasterly direction.

     Both Moore and Watkins are experienced observers of aircraft and are thoroughly familiar with the appearance and performance characteristics of conventional aircraft. They are convinced that the object they observed was not an aircraft, balloon, or any other known flying object. They state that they have no explanation for what they saw, and that the object's performance was such that it could not have been any type of conventional aircraft.

     It is requested that this report be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and analysis.
