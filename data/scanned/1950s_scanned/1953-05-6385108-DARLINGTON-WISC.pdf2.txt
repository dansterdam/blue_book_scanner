FLYING SAUCERS

By courtesy of RECENT AUSTRALIAN SIGHTINGS:
Mackay, North Queensland, 4:35 P.M., 15th May, 1953.
Captain E.L.Jones, an R.A.A.F. pilot, reported by radio that he saw a plane, just south of the city at 6,000 ft., which he reported to CIVIL AVIATION DEPARTMENT. Captain Jones observed the object circling and appeared a grayish-brown in color. It was moving at a high rate of speed and disappeared. This happened on May 10.

To check with the control tower at the airport showed that there were no other aircraft in the air at the time. The report showed that there was a dark circular object which was traveling at a high rate of speed and then vanished. From about 1,000 or 3000 ft. the terrific rate until it vanished crossed his path again near Freshwater Point.

Captain Jones said that he and his second pilot had watched the object about five minutes. There was no possibility, he added, (during the course of a radio broadcast) that it could have been a meteorite. He said the object exhibited no vapor or sparks.
