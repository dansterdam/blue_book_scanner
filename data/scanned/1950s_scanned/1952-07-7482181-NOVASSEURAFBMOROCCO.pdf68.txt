Text extracted from the document:

Be aware that you are on express in many fields of physiology and physics, and I do not at all claim to a complete understanding of your ability, but I am simply not satisfy with the simple explanation that you gave for the behavior of several objects who were apparently detected in your areas.

The duration of proof is the crucial factor. Doctor Turner, if you are aware of every single theory I have investigated, you must be amazed at the fact that this is still going on. Sub-normal cases, we know, must usually terminate in a certain way. Non-normal cases do not conform to the rules, so we have a very awkward situation on our hands.

In my records, I note that your postmarked envelope's date was 9/9/52, so it took your book a month to reach here.

DELETED is discussing a report on observations made on 7/6/52. Apparently a "Rescue Air Officer" was involved and made some comments. The report discusses the behavior of certain objects that were detected, and notes that the "duration of proof" is a crucial factor. It also mentions various theories that have been investigated, and notes that "sub-normal cases" tend to terminate in a certain way, while "non-normal cases do not conform to the rules", leading to an "awkward situation". The report also mentions that the postmarked envelope containing the report was dated 9/9/52, so it took a month for the book to reach its destination.
