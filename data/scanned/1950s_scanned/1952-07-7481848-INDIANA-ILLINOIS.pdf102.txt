Dear Sirs:

I wish to report having seen a "Flying Saucer" last me say that I do not know the exact circumstances could have subjected to these observations. The circumstances were these: 

I was on a vacation camped on a small lake called Rock Island Lake which is near Tacoma, Illinois about thirty miles north of Danville, Illinois. On the morning of Friday, July 11th, I could not sleep so got up and went down to the lakeside. It was dark and I could just see the outline of trees against the sky. The sky was perfectly clear and the moon was full and at a height of about forty degrees above the horizon.

Suddenly under the lake height about halfway between the moon and the horizon my eyes caught this light, which traveled from east to west immediately and was in sight for about four seconds. It had no way to judge its size or altitude but it appeared to be larger than the diameter of the moon. When it disappeared it didn't seem to be because of clouds or whether its light went out, probably to the former. Its size seems to me to have diminished during the time it was in sight.

Its appearance was as if it were made of clear plastic containing a brilliant white light. The main body was a disk the thickness of which was about one-sixth of its diameter. At the rear was a brilliant glow rounded nose about the shape of the nose of a revolver bullet. There was no sound heard.

For two days afterward I tried to convince myself that this was a reflection or could be accounted for by some normal means but have been unable to do so. My thinking changed so one of film conviction that this thing exists and that I saw it.

Yours sincerely,
