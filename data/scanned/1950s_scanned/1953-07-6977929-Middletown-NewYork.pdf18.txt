SUMMARY: (A recent preliminary report by the Middletown, New York, Civil Defense Ground Observer Corps states that an observation of a strange aerial object was made on 6/7/53 at approximately 10:00 PM, EDT, over Middletown, New York. The object was observed for about 15-20 minutes.) The illuminated FLYOBJECT, reported by persons, appeared at white, large, round object, moving fairly slowly at an approximate altitude of 8,000-10,000 feet. It was compared in size with a jet fighter, but much larger. The object was clearly seen by the observers and remained fairly stationary for most of the observation period. At the conclusion of the observation, the object moved off rapidly to the north and disappeared from sight. (See attached report.)
