There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

April 26, 1957 
I was awake looking through the window to my right when suddenly shortly before the plane bumped I saw a light, something that passed by very rapidly by could not identify any particular thing. (It reminds me a room lighted suddenly out of deep darkness).
I cannot tell the direction of whatever produced the flare. 
The light was rather soft. It was like a light produced by a common electric bulb. The whole thing passed like a flash.

I know Jose J. Meux, aged 11 years, son of a friend of mine. I wrote for him what he told me in Spanish.
