4. Aircraft Serial No. 49-2522, F-94A, 1st Lt Donald A. Uckman, pilot; 1st Lt Thomas W. Davies, radar observer, was on base 1st (comments: Probably means down wind) to approach for landing when 1st Lt Davies called attention to pilot on a target at 11:20 o'clock same altitude. Target was heading from .star-board to port. (Note: Probably means right to left when looking out port side of a/c.) Targets affirmed by pilot. The F-94 was heading 60°. Target was heading 240° approximately parallel and 130° to fighter flight. During the next 30 to 45 seconds target increased its speed noticeably. When F-94, Serial No. 49-2522 turned in base log (Note: Probably means final approach) heading approximately 240°, target continued heading approximately 240° at the same altitude. (Note: Probably means targets same altitude.) From position of base area target seemed to ascend at a phenomenal rate with a straight course and very erratic flight.
