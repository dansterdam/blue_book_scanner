observes that unless all six observers are unable to distinguish a star from anything else, the stellar explanation will not hold. Further, the angular positions appear to rule this out.

2. Balloons:

If these objects were balloons, they would have to be captive balloons because of their restricted motion and the fact that they did not rise. Extensive inquires were made as to the possibility of any experiments going on in that area at the time. The weather bureau was consulted, since in previous years there had been some cosmic ray experiments by Dr. [REDACTED] and Dr. [REDACTED]. In both cases they had consulted the weather bureau for wind conditions. The weather bureau knew of no experiments at that time. The Dean of the Bismarck Junior College was consulted to see if he might have known of any experiments at the time. He took us to see the head of the North Dakota State Museum, and he also knew of nothing. We asked to check the hotel register of the best hotel in town, and found no names that might have had any connection with scientific experiments. We likewise checked the newspapers for this period, and although this incident was mentioned, nothing else bearing upon it was. The newspapers did mention that television towers were being erected at approximately this location at the time. Accordingly, the engineer of the TV station was consulted and he stated that at no time were any experiments carried out relative to the construction of the towers.

3, Aircraft:

All observers are reasonably well experienced with aircraft, with of course Mr. [REDACTED] being the "authority" among the observers. Aircraft must definitely be ruled out. The only hope is that these were balloons, but in the absence of any evidence for experiments going on at the time, or of these lights behaving as balloons, this appears a desperate solution.
