THIS IS A SUMMARY OF WHAT I OR WE SAW - THIS ENCOUNTER WAS ENTIRELY UNLIKE ANY OTHER SIGHTING WE HAVE EVER HAD.
THIS WAS THE MOST BIZARRE SIGHTING FOR US TO DATE. THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT 30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND THE COLOR WAS A LUMINOUS SILVER. IT WAS HOVERING ABOUT 50 FEET OFF THE GROUND. IT SEEMED TO HAVE SOME FORM OF STRUCTURE, AND WHEN IT WAS EXAMINED LATER BY EXPERTS IT WAS FOUND TO BE OF SOME UNKNOWN COMPOSITION. IT WAS ALSO ROTATING SLOWLY ON ITS OWN AXIS.
AS WE APPROACHED CLOSER TO GET A BETTER VIEW, IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY AWAY FROM US AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 20 MPH. SUDDENLY IT ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND SHOT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AT AN UNBELIEVABLE RATE OF SPEED. IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. THE WHOLE ENCOUNTER LASTED LESS THAN TWO MINUTES.
THE OBJECT GAVE OFF NO EXHAUST OR NOISE OF ANY KIND. THERE WAS A SLIGHT HAZE OR SHIMMER VISIBLE AROUND IT WHICH MADE IT APPEAR TO BE SURROUNDED BY SOME KIND OF FORCE FIELD OR ENERGY SOURCE. IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT WITH NO WIND, AND THE OBJECT SEEMED TO MOVE WITHOUT MAKING ANY SOUND.
AFTER IT DISAPPEARED, WE FELT STUNNED AND AMAZED AT WHAT WE HAD WITNESSED. WE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THIS TO THE AUTHORITIES, BUT WERE TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT CONFIRM OR DENY ANYTHING ABOUT OUR SIGHTING. THIS INCIDENT IS STILL A MYSTERY TO US.
