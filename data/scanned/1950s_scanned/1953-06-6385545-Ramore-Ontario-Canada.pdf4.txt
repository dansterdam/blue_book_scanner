The image appears to be a photograph that is part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The photograph shows a statement made by an observer named Theodore H. Coulsting about a sighting that occurred on 30 June 1953 near Ramore, Ontario, Canada. The statement describes an unidentified colored object seen in the sky that was not recognizable as any known aircraft. It was observed for about 15 minutes before disappearing. There are no visible means of propulsion, and the object did not seem to resemble the moon rising.

STATEMENT

At 2352 EDST 30 June 1953 I was notified by the Charge of Quarters of a report of a strange object in the sky. I looked out and saw an orange colored object in the sky to the NNE. It was egg shaped and was on the side, as viewed, it had no doors, no windows and no visible means of propulsion. It seemed to be at an elevation of about 150-200 It dimmed away to the North. At the time there was no moon visible, but the object did not seem to resemble the moon rising. The coloring was much more vivid.
