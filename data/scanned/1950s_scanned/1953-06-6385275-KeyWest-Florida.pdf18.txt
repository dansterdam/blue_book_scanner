JOINT MESSAGEFORM
FROM: AFOIN-ATIA-7-16-E  UNCLASSIFIED
ATIC has received AF Form 112 on 16 June 53 Key West sighting by WO Paul M. Laino. Request you determine whether T/2N aircraft specified in report was operating searchlights at the time of sighting. Also request you determine whether other local aircraft noted were engaged in any unusual lighting operations. ATIC believes five second duration of sighting does not allow observer accurate estimate of object's course. T/2N therefore may have headed toward him then flew away and therefore could have caused sighting. ATIC regards your report as officially complete.

In reply cite Project Blue Book.
