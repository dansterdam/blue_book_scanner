C-23. Rome, Italy ... 9/16/54) A. P. Wire: Startled Romans who saw a strange sugar-coated substance descending over the capital flooded newspaper offices with calls. Radar operators also reported picking up the missile in instruments. Technicians at Ciampino Airport described the "half-cigar" as plummeting toward earth for more than 1000 ft., then rising at tremendous speed before vanishing. (Thinks to George Gordon, Dayton, Ohio.)

An INS release by eyewitness Michael Chinigo states: "What attracted my attention was the strange sound it made. It was like thunder with a static effect... I saw a series of explosions that grew louder as the object got closer. This was followed by a loud whistling sound as the thing stopped just over the trees and left an exhausted trail of milky white smoke. It went straight up into the sky." The Defense Department described it as "a brilliant cone" with a smaller surface on the bottom, or as two semi-circular disks, one bigger than the other, with a bigger one on top. To the Italians it appeared "like an enormous lighted object with three lights or ports on the side." The radar station at Rome which picked up the "cigar" or "cone" said it registered for 3" minutes."

Editor's Note: Significant here is the AP and INS release. First they break as the news on the "labrador sighting in July, then silence, then the Norwegian space man story in August, now Italy. Foreign sightings all -- a subtle preparation.
