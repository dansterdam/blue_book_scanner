Flying Saucers on Top of Dracula. Terrifies Sheffield Lake Woman
BY ALLEN P. ASHBOLT
What could be more terrifying than a real life encounter with a "flying saucer"? Mrs. Fitzgerald, a Sheffield Lake housewife, was treated to this unique experience, and says it was "the most horrible thing that has ever happened to me."
Mrs. Fitzgerald was awoke one night last week by a brilliant white glare that filled her bedroom. Looking out, she saw two flying saucers hovering over the house next door. Her immediate reaction was to hide under the bed covers. "I was too frightened to move", she said.
The objects remained motionless for more than five minutes, then suddenly shot straight up into the sky with an incredibly bright light trail. "It was as though a thousand light bulbs were turned on at once", said Mrs. Fitzgerald.
After the departure of the strange craft, Mrs. Fitzgerald got up and went to the window to get a better look. She noticed that the neighbor's house was bathed in a strange green light that seemed to come from the hovering objects. "The light was so bright that it closed the bedroom drapes through the windows. The objects themselves were then visible and seemed to be about twenty-five feet in diameter."
Mrs. Fitzgerald said she became hysterical and had to be given a sedative by her son, who is a graduate student at Baldwin-Wallace College.
Since the experience, Mrs. Fitzgerald has been extremely nervous and upset. "I just don't know what to think. I've always been a practical person and I never believed in flying saucers before. Now I'm not so sure."
