7. Extracted from Fifth Air Force "Perinterrept" for 27 May 1952:

"At 1840-45Z, 27 May 1952, visual observation of a radar-controlled aircraft was made by pilots of a flight of F-86 jet Sabre aircraft. Contact was made at 7,000 yards, on a tail chase heading 270Â° at an altitude of 25,000 feet. The aircraft maneuvered erratically, appeared to be jet-propelled, and was accelerating from 550 knots. D/I 5th AF Command. The 606th ADC is investigating the incident and will be the source of further information."

Comment - If true as reported, the final velocity of the object would be approximately 1,000 mph, which must be interpreted as an erratic target, rather than a normal aircraft. The results are to be forwarded via a Form 112.
