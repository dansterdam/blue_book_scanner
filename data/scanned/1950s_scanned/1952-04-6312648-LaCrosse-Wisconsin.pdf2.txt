Reference: I. Your letter 22 May 1968, subject: UFO investigation, on which you have listed, in the order they were listed.

1. 7 January 1952, Palmer, Alaska.
I have rated this case 26 C7, meaning that as far as strangeness is concerned, the final rating seems to have been 26 on a scale of 30. The report seems to come into the category of "cigar-shaped Ufos" reported from many countries and which have already been adequately explained. In this instance, there is not sufficient information for us to go on. The report we have states that an "Alaska Air Command informed stated will take further investigative action," and "additional data will be forwarded when available."
To this list of my knowledge the following data were never received.

2. 14 April 1952, LaCrosse, Wisconsin...

I originally asked to review this case in the hopes that unknown to me some additional followup had been made. I found that despite the fact that a Captain of commercial airline and others apparently observed this object, there is still no record of any further investigation.
