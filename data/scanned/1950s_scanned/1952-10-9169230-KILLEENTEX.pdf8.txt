Dear Sir:

During our discussion on 8 January 1953, you asked me to check the sightings for you, one on 17 October 1952 in the Albuquerque area and one on 22 November 1952 in the north central part of the United States. This has been done and I have found that there were no long distance traveling objects, just a bit.

The sighting on 17 October 1952 that at first appeared to be an object was actually determined to be weather balloons. It appeared bright and shiny but was determined to be weather balloons. We found that there was no correlation between time, or direction of the reported object, and the weather balloons that were released.

It appears that there were no permanent records of any radar tracks from Hutchinson, Kansas on 20 November 1952, at least none that I could find. It is still possible that something was tracked but it was not held to be of significant interest. Our files show no reports that could be due to interference and the object visually observed was a regular meteor.

Yours very truly,
EDWARD J. RUPPELT
Capt, USAF
