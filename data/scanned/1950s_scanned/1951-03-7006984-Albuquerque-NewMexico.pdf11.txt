1. Reference is made to the attached Spot Intelligence Report, subject as above, dated 21 March 1951.

DR. LAPAZ's statement, attached (report) that a photographic coverage of the area as where the luminous phenomena was reported in his opinion could have landed was noted.

The 17th District OSI has no objection to this recommendation but contact was made with Headquarters, Special Weapons Command, in an attempt to secure photographic coverage, with negative results. DR. LAPAZ further informed this office that such a mission could not be accomplished by his Command due to a shortage of qualified personnel.

3. Reference the fourth paragraph of DR. LAPAZ's statement, attached at report, the 17th District OSI does not concur in the recommendation that Air Force personnel be assigned to ground search in the area in which meteoric ingress appears to have occurred.

1. This attached report is forwarded for your information and view. It is requested that this District be informed if your Headquarters deems it advisable to secure photographic coverage of the area as outlined on the attached map.
