Text extracted from the document:

At 9:15, 7 August 1952, my mother took my son out into the backyard to see an airplane coming from the west. While watching the plane, she noticed a large, round object in the sky moving at a very fast rate of speed. It came from the west, made a U-turn and disappeared, somewhat like a light being turned out. My mother then turned and saw another in the North heading South moving slowly. As it moved along it seemed to gather speed and disappeared in the same manner as the first. Both came in and out of sight. A third object appeared from the North at about 3:20 and moved slowly South. While watching this object, we noticed a fourth object appear from the North, passed the third object rapidly, made a large circle bearing East and disappeared as it came in line with the sun. A two-engined aircraft heading South passed under the 4th object.

The objects appeared to be about 15 inches in diameter, round but flat, and looked like a ball of white fire. All four objects appeared to be similar in size, shape and color.

I certify that the information contained above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:
