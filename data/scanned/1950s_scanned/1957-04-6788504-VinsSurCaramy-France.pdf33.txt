Anyway, any way that one looks at it if we are dealing with a known sub-stance, then the presence of the latter on the highway is, therefore, explained and also explains the cracked pieces that were encountered over an area of 3 to 4 meters in diameter. In this small province of 195 people, the passing of an asphalt truck would not go unnoticed and, at 10:45 at night, it would be an unlikelihood. Even a leak in a mosaic would not have left such traces. We examined the approximate bridges and highways for some other clues.
