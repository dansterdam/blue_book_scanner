"Fireball' Geis a New Twist, Nevada Has Blast and Blaze

Yesterday morning's mysterious fireball, viewed over a vast area in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Nevada, was as much a puzzle to observers today.

Reports of witnesses varied from a "green glow fireball" followed by a "red fiery streak" to a "bright orange smoke trail."

People who know about meteors, including Charles Omonel of Charles City, la., Dr. N.V. Chernin of the University of Utah, and others, said it had to be carefully investigated.

Hobbs, assistant trainmaster at Montello, Nev., for the Southern Pacific railroad, reported many railroaders and passengers having seen the fireball. They said it appeared to shoot across the sky from east to west during the day and saw a column of smoke and dust hanging in the sky.

Montello is about 112 miles almost due west from Salt Lake City, and Reno and Carson City, Nev. reported the seven-blue cloud outlined with yellow dust remained for several minutes, then gradually lifted away.

Ralph Gibbs, soil conservation official, and ranchers were led to investigate. They found a 600-acre tract burned in Dairy Valley, 26 miles north and five miles east of Montello. They could find, however, no evidence of a meteor fall.

L.E. Taylor, U.S. weather bureau, today told a hurry of excitement was caused here when a high flying B-36 with the vapor trail was mistaken for a fireball over the city."
