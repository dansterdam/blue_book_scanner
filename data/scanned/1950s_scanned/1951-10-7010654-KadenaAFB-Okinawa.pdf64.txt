AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
ATTN OFFICE, D/I USAF 
IR-23-52
The following information was received from the T-2 Technical Intelligence Office, Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, Japan, on 5 June 1952. This is not tied into the two "sighings" mentioned in the report, but is most unlikely to be of any importance to this section. 
1. The CW frequency will used on the CW net from Kadena to Itazuke was not received satisfactorily at Kadena. Apparently the frequency from Itazuke to Kadena was not frequently experienced on this net, but it was unable to determine what hours the frequency was actually in use. A check of the APPLUSE or WHITNEY frequencies revealed that they could be received satisfactorily at Kadena, indicating that the reception difficulties were confined to this one particular frequency.
2. It is apparent that there is no photographic evidence to substantiate the two sightings. The objects noted in the sightings are not a true picture. A check the next day found the coordinates between the two bases to be off several degrees.
3. Letter of transmittal - 1st Indorsement by Headquarters, 20th Air Force: 
HEADQUARTERS, TWENTIETH AIR FORCE, APO 239
TO: Commanding General, Far East Air Forces, APO 925
1. Forwarding as requested, pending completion of an analysis which attempts to support theories that the sightings reported with the incident are the product of a natural cause rather than man-made or extra-terrestrial.
2. Forwarding for information is offered that the analysis, referenced above, required special calibration of the radar equipment upon which the sightings were experienced. This calibration was considered essential in order that findings and conclusions forwarded to your headquarters in the immediate future.
