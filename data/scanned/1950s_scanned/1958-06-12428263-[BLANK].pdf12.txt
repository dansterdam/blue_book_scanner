MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: Briefing of Representative Henderson and Colleagues on the Air Force Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Program

1. On 20 June 1958, MAJOR JOHN SAGAIN AGOKIN-XA, and MAJOR RICHARD LAFEAIR, assisted by Mr. Ardissi, AGIN-XXI, and accompanied by the following members of Representatives John E. Henderson, Ohio:

Rep. Henderson, Ohio
Rep. Cramer, Florida
Rep. Ferguson, Washington
Rep. (Mrs.) Katharine St. Onge
Mr. Bachelor (Adm. Aid--Cramer)
Mr. Toly (Adm. Aid--Jr. Magnuson)
Mr. Gordon (Adm. Aid--Grirren, Mich.)

2. The briefing was prepared in response to a personal request by Rep. Henderson who previously submitted a request for information on UFOS. AGOKIN prepared the necessary briefing material.

3. Members of Congress are constantly besieged by constituents regarding UFOs including allegations and personal visits. With rare exceptions, such requests are forwarded to APFL for answer. The lack of information on UFOs increased by the Congress has caused a considerable interest, a great number of Congressmen and their administrative aids have indicated an interest in first-hand information on the UFOS.

4. The Congressional audience was favorably impressed by the presentation. One apparent dedicated skeptic, at the conclusion of the briefing, expressed his complete faith and confidence in the APFL and indications that they were now prepared to deal directly with their constituents without resorting to SAFFL.
