No Case (Information Only) 3 January 1956 Pasadena, California

(2) Request for Information on UFO Sightings from General Public

January 3, 1956, - Pasadena.- A pilot and aerial cameraman sighted and attempted to track what they described as "three distinct objects" in the sky. The two civilians are co-owners of an Aerial Photo Company and have been flying for 15 years for the Army and commercial purposes. They have reports of 21 years in the air as an aerial cameraman and during home studies of the films, have not encountered anything like this before. The objects were sighted at an altitude of 11,000 feet when they sighted the military aircraft. The two pilots immediately attempted to close in on the three objects, but despite their efforts they only were able to close within 2,000 feet, and they both noted that they made definite maneuvers and had a brilliant light that seemed to emanate from them. It immediately flew to a higher altitude, a Gamma 100, into a circular course, while white trails to each of its mount left and disappeared in the west. Cramer said, " they were clearly outlined."

The Air Force viewpoint is that the so-called "flying saucers"is will account.
