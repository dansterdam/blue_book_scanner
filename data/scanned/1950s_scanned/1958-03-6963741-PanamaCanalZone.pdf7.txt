1. Data is too limited to make an analysis. It appears, however, that anomalous propagation is a strong possibility since the observer indicated that return was exactly the same as a strong (familiar) aircraft at one point. The fact that the largest ("three times the size of a military aircraft") was not visible at 20 miles with excellent visibility conditions seems to preclude the target as material.
