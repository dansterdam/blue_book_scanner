AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
(1) Seven (7) objects were sighted by all the persons present in a clear night sky. Objects were estimated to be approximately 1000 to 5000 feet from the observers and descended from an altitude of about 10,000 feet at a high rate of speed. The objects appeared to be circular in shape and glowed in a yellowish white color. All the objects appeared to fade out and drift toward the west.
(2) The objects were estimated to be approximately 25 to 50 feet in diameter, from the comparison of their apparent size to known aircraft or ground objects of a standard size, as observed at 5,757 standard time, 25 July 1953.
(3) Observation was visual from the ground.
(4) Observers were 1st Lt R...R-.... AD, 36Oth Bomb Sq, 310th Bomb Wing, Perrin AFB, Texas; 1st Lt L... K..., AD, 3602d AISS, Perrin AFB, Texas; and 1st Lt J... W... H..., AD, 3602d AISS, Perrin AFB, Texas. The objects were sighted at about 2300 hours on 25 July 1953, approximately 5 miles southwest of Perrin AFB, Texas, at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet.
(5) The reaction of the persons sighting the objects was one of surprise and awe, since the objects seemed to disappear and reappear at will and were traveling at a very high rate of speed.
(6) As a result of this sighting, an attempted radar track was made to identify the objects but the objects disappeared before a positive radar track could be established. A plane from the Kerrville Control Airport was vectored to the area but made no visual contact with the objects.
(7) This report is considered to be factual in content.
(8) There is no evidence of any hostile intent on the part of the object or objects.
(9) The Air Force standard identification procedures were followed.
