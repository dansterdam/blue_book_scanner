The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text from the document:

On a ferry trip from El Norte, Texas to Blythe, California on 9 February 1953 at approximately 2650 Pacific Standard Time, the witness sighted an object in the sky at 7 o'clock high.

I looked out the window and saw a round, bright light which was much brighter than any star. This bright object appeared to be hovering or stationary at an indeterminate altitude.

(7) or slightly (8) minutes - a glow appeared near the bright light, was approximately 20 feet above the bright light. This glow was an indefinite shape and could have been a reflection from the bright light.

The bright light disappeared at this time. The total time of the observation was about 5 to 10 minutes.

The location was 11-48N - 114-15W.
