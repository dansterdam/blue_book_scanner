CARLSBAD, New Mexico
(BALLOON) Observation

Plastic UFOs and the "Stack of Coins"

A burst balloon has caused many a saucer scare, but the invasion of Farmington, New Mexico, on Saint Patrick's Day 1950 was one of the most dramatic. The "saucers" began to fly about 10:15 A.M. M.S.T., and soon filled the air. In numbers estimated from 500 to thousands, for the next hour the gleaming saucer-shaped objects soared over the town, moving erratically at incredible speeds, darting in and out among each other in what one writer has called "the greatest exhibition of magnetic flight that has ever happened in this universe." [6] (See Chapter ix.)
The explanation is more prosaic. A Skyhook balloon had been launched that morning from Holloman Air Force Base near White Sands, New Mexico. Near Farmington, in the cold atmosphere at 60,000 feet the balloon had become brittle, burst, and disintegrated into hundreds of tiny pieces of plastic. Light as feathers, shining in the sunlight, they floated over the town and away [1, p. 106].
