4. WITNESS:  MR. H. B. PALMER

5. SUMMARY

At 8:40 PM on 6 August 1952, Mr. H. B. Palmer, an air traffic controller at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, observed an unusual aerial object while on duty. Mr. Palmer stated that the object appeared to be a disc-shaped craft that moved at a high rate of speed and made sharp, angular turns. The object was visible for approximately two minutes before it disappeared from view. 

6. CONCLUSION

The object's disc-shaped appearance, high-speed maneuvers, and disappearance are consistent with reported UFO sightings. No definitive identification of the object has been determined.
