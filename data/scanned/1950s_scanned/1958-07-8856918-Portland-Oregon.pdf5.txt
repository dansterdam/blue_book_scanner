UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SUMMARY
SUMMARY AND EXTRACT REPORT
UPON REPORT # __________

DATE OF INCIDENT: 24 July 1958
LOCATION OF INCIDENT: Portland, Oregon

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: A school supply helper, reported to see a rapidly rotating object at 55-53 degrees direction and at an altitude of approx. 35,000 feet. The object was described as circular in shape and was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes. When last seen were at an azimuth of approximately 245 degrees. The object disappeared in the distance after traveling in a southerly direction.

INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS: Check with current ATIC chart (W.A.S. #669 - Columbia River) shows that a large flight path chart map located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base ATIC indicates a plot from source's position to a southward track shows that any e/e formation followed above 53,000 feet are identifiable as C-47 or C-54 aircraft (as shown by him) which landed at Portland G.A.C. Talked to C.O., Maj. F. R. McDonnell who said he recalls a flight of ADC planes in formation over the area at the time. No confirmation that this incident involved anything unusual for that time.

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None

FINAL ATIC EVALUATION: Insufficient information to provide any definite conclusions. The flight path and maneuvers of the objects will often appear as a lender vehicle or flight path of the objects against a dark sky, due to optical reasons. No other evidence from any source to indicate anything strange or unusual about the objects flew over area.
