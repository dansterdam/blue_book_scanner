The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter or document related to a report from Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during the 1950s and 1960s.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Greeted of morning daylight had already begun. We were in the valley as you described the terrain. Only the scattered clumps of gray-green sage brush gave any indication of a landscape. The sky was brilliantly clearâ€”no clouds to interfere with the full impact of the bright sunlight.

The "case" of the "daylight sighting" is greatly ambiguous. While the details furnished are interesting, they do not, in my opinion, constitute a valid report of an actual observed object. However, they may be a result of some external influence, of which I am ignorant. How- ever, I cannot feel that the text of the report carries enough substance to warrant definite conclusions.

The only reaction in this particular instance is that of understanding. The phenomenon, whatever it may have been, caused some disturbance in the visual perception of the observer. But beyond this, I cannot feel that it calls for any unusual inference or conclusion. Rest assured that the whole matter will be given the fullest possible consideration. All personnel concerned with the investigation and study of such phenomena are fully aware of the need for extreme care and objectivity in the handling of these cases.

I am looking forward to visiting you in your new quarters. I hope in early June.

Cheers,
