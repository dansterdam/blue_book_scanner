II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was completely thorough in his description of the sighting. CONICE was extremely competent and of superior intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE and his son were in their yard (100 yards from their home) when the objects were sighted at an elevation of 30° - 35° from the horizon. SOURCE observed the objects at 6:05 p.m. and with binoculars observed them for 10 minutes. 
The sky condition was bright twilight. The sighting was of two oblong objects, semi-luminous and of bright golden color. The objects travelled at terrific speed, sometimes flapping their "wings" as they did look like they were machine powered, and at a terrific rate of speed, moving towards and away from each other at 10 miles apart and approximately 25 miles away, flying west but not into the sun. SOURCE estimates they were between 100 and 200 feet. As SOURCE trained his sight on the objects, the brightness increased to an automobile headlight a mile or more away. The brightness and shape of the objects were consistent. The sighting was erratic and they seemed to suddenly speed up and push away. The objects did not give off smoke, break up, or pulse. CONICE was fairly certain of the objects as compared in size to a half-dollar held at arm's length. Objects were last sighted at 26,000 altitude and did not disappear due to distance but rather dimmed in the haze. 
SOURCE estimates the distance of the objects to be from 15 to 20 miles and speed to be 600 plus MPH.
