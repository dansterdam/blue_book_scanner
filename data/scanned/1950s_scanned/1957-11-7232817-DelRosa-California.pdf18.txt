The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page describes an incident that occurred on November 7, 1957, involving a UFO sighting near Del Rosa, California.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

Tuesday morning's chief contribution to the UFO epidemic was not to be laughed off as easily, for it was made by trained military personnel. At 5:10 a.m. on October 5, the Coast Guard Cutter Sebago, traveling north in the Gulf of Mexico, detected a visually maneuverable UFO on the radar scope. The rapidly moving object appeared immediately from another direction and position and again moved off in a new direction. After ten minutes the object disappeared, but watchers on the ship discussed the object, brilliant-white and disc-shaped, as it streaked across the sky just above the northwest horizon. A shower of sparks trailed the unknown radar targets then returned and continued to fill the scope with their intermittent signals until 5:27, when they finally disappeared and did not return.
The ship, some 200 miles south of New Orleans, was moving under heavy-enough air temperature conditions to account for unusual radar echoes from the complex patterns of the UFO, but from the complex pattern of the single, fantastic-shaped image on the radar scope, weather conditions accounted for the uniform, steady, precision movements of the UFO. The brilliant light that flashed across the sky was probably connected to the radar scope and had no relation to the moving brilliant object (the sun rose some fifty minutes later), the flash of light was probably a distant meteor. No evidence for a spacecraft could be found.
