Transcription of the text in the document:

"Would have a seli of a 'Vidget' craft observed at 2300 on the night of Aug 8, 1952 on the east side of Detroit, Michigan. the craft seemed to be proceeding to the southwest at a high rate of speed, low to the ground and at times hovering. It was observed for 15 to 20 minutes and seemed to take on the appearance of a silvery disc or object. The movement and manuvers of the craft seemed to be controlled and directed, not just random. The craft was also observed to change color from a silvery white to a reddish orange. During the period of observation of the craft there were sudden bursts of acceleration at high speeds, the craft would appear to move from one area of the sky to another area some distance away in what seemed to be a matter of seconds. The movement was jerky and rapid and the craft had the appearance of being under control and directed. It was also observed that at times the craft seemed to be surrounded by a reddish orange glow or exhaust. the color, movement, and maneuvers of the craft were such that it could not have been any type of conventional aircraft. The sighting was witnessed by [REDACTED] and several other persons. The incident has been reported to the Air Force and Project Blue Book."
