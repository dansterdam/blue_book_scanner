The image contains three hand-drawn sketches illustrating the movement and appearance of an unidentified flying object. The first sketch shows an arched trajectory of an object above the horizon, the second sketch shows a wider view of the object's position, and the third sketch shows a partial view of the object's trajectory.

Project Blue Book was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects. This image appears to be from a document related to that investigation.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
