In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could suddenly enlarge the object which you saw. Of what type material would you say the object is made and what structures, if any, would you say are present in it? WOULD BE LUCITE & DE LIT IN SUCH A WAY THAT NO LIGHT, BEAM ETC. WOULD PROTRUDE (THE LIGHT OF THE OBJECT WAS DISTINCT WITH NO SOURCE OR DISTORTIONS). IT WOULD BE A SPHERE OF SOME DIAMETEREE. IT WOULD BE OPAQUE OBJECTS THAT MAY APPEAR THE SAME ARE: THE MOON (BUT SMALLER) IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, A DISTANT LIGHT, A LEMON, AN ORANGE, A RED PLATE.
