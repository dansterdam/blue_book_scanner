STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN MAO DONALD

On the 19 December 1952 approximately 0530, we were flying at 7500 feet on a heading of 150 degrees when I saw a bright object traveling about 20 degrees to each side of the nose of the aircraft. The object was silver-white in color, with a bright blue ball like flame at the aft end. It appeared to be traveling faster than the aircraft.

This object was in view we were about 130 miles NNW of Guam. When I first sighted the object I called major Dickerson's attention to it.
