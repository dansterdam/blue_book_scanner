Text from the document:

type of observation was made again at about 2:00 p.m. on Aug. 6, 1952, over Orlando, Florida. The object was first observed as a bright light moving very rapidly in the sky, approaching from the southwest. It appeared to be traveling at an extremely high speed and made an abrupt turn to the right, moving across the sky at a very high speed. It then made an abrupt turn to the left and continued on generally northward until it disappeared from view. The object did not show any trail or leave any evidence of exhaust or propulsion system. Its maneuvers were very sharp and precise, and it appeared to be under intelligent control. Estimated height was approximately 20,000 to 30,000 feet. No sound was heard. No other objects were observed in the vicinity. The observation was made by ... and several other persons. The time of observation was from approximately 2:00 p.m. to 2:10 p.m. The object was observed through 7x50 binoculars.
