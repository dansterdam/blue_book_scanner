The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects. The document appears to be a report on a sighting of an unidentified flying object over Hokkaido Island, Japan on December 30, 1952.

The text in the document is as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CASE

30 DEC 52
DATE OF SIGHTING: 30/12/51
TIME: 1955 HRS 
LOCATION: HOKKAIDO ISLAND, JAPAN
ATTIC DOCUMENT 11519/
UNCLASSIFIED
The report states that the object observed was not rotating, appeared to be spherical, varied in color from red to white, and was seen by 6 crew members of a BTSC aircraft. The object appeared to be moving at a speed considerably greater than the aircraft. It was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes before disappearing. The pilot of the aircraft, who was an Air Force colonel, attempted an interception but was unable to close on the object.

The document also mentions concurrent sightings of other unidentified lights in the area, and notes that the planet Venus in the night sky may explain some of the phenomena observed. It states that the sighting was "UNCLASSIFIED" and "DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS".
