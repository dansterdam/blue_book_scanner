19 PAY 1955
LOS ANGELES, California

Winged creatures sometimes avoid the interplanetary label only by staying in sight long enough to be examined. About sundown on May 16, 1955, switchboards at police stations in the Los Angeles area were flooded with calls reporting flying saucers, changing formation with incredible speeds 'as if playing tag in the sky'. The presence of mind to get out his binoculars and look at the objects, they were birds with dark wing tips. Thinking they might be some, he called the Saw, which identified the 'saucers' as a flock of Pelecanus erythrorhynchos, an inland species of pelican that flocks on the prevailing wind current [s].
