The text in the document is as follows:

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
6 February 1956
Somers Point, New Jersey

CLOSE SIGHTING MADE BY A COUPLE DRIVING ON JERSEY SHORE: A couple that we interviewed in the course of the evening said they observed an object which they could not identify. They said that they were driving along the Jersey shore when they noticed a bright light in the sky which seemed to be moving toward them. They pulled their car off the road and watched the object as it came nearer. The woman said that at one time the object was so close above them that it appeared good sized - about the size of a house. She said that it seemed to be shaped "like a kidney bean" and sometimes it appeared still, and then would move at a rapid rate of speed. When speeding, it would seem to change shape and there would be a bright light in the center, and a glow around the edge. At other times, the light would seem to be only a bright light in the center and a glow around it. There would be a bright light in the center and a glow below it - like a glowing tail. Finally, as the object seemed to be moving away from them, it suddenly disappeared. The woman said they would stand still a while, and then suddenly it would reappear.
