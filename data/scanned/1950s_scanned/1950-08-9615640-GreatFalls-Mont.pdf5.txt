Mr. [REDACTED]
Great Falls, Montana

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

You are probably aware of the fact that the Air Force stations have been investigating the flying saucer phenomenon and attempting to make a comprehensive analysis of recent sightings against those made in previous years. In this connection, the report of a sighting dated by [REDACTED] that you mentioned has come to our attention.

Therefore, we would be most grateful if you could permit us to borrow/your original motion picture film for study and duplication. In so doing you would be rendering us a great service.

We will have an officer from Great Falls Air Force Station contact you shortly 28 October and should you consider our request favorably, he will obtain the movies and give you a receipt for them. We will, of course, return them as soon as possible.

Your cooperation and consideration in this matter is earnestly solicited.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM A. ADAMS
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Topical Division
Deputy Director for Estimates
