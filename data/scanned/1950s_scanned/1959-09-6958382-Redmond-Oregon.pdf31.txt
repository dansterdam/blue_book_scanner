MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, LEGISLATIVE LIAISON, SAFL
ATTENTION: Major Mims, Section D

SUBJECT: Reply to Senator Keating on UFO Sighting at Redmond, Oregon

The following is a draft of a reply to Senator Keating.

"I refer to your recent inquiry in behalf of Mr. [REDACTED] of Washington, D.C., concerning the unidentified flying object sighting near Redmond, Oregon on 24 September 1959.

Paragraph three of Mr. [REDACTED] letter indicates that the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena has asked the Secretary of the Air Force for an explanation regarding this case. The Air Force explanation was sent to NICAP on 25 March 1960 and a copy of this letter to Major [REDACTED], Director of NICAP, is enclosed. The letter is self-explanatory and indicates that the finding of "Insufficient data" in this particular case was definitely a valid conclusion."
