Output of text from the document:

Report of sighted objects at high altitudes in the vicinity of Bentwaters, England, on 13 August 1956.

Apparently the lights were sighting to determine by ICAO/RAF.

The lights were variable and seemed to be maneuvering, but no definite conclusions could be reached as to their nature.

One object appeared to be from 10-15 miles in the distance and was observed to ascend to a high altitude very rapidly.

It is requested that complete details of this incident be furnished to the Air Technical Intelligence Center.
