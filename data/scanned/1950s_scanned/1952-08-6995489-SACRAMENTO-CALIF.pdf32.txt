TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
While returning from a late movie in the city of Sacramento, California, the undersigned and an accompanying friend were going to their car, which had been parked in a parking lot near the Gibson Bus Lines.
My friend told me to look up into the sky and pointed in a northerly direction, the undersigned looked in the direction pointed and saw three (3) orange colored objects, appearing to be the same size and shape of an average automobile. The objects appeared to be at an extremely high altitude and traveling at a very high rate of speed. After looking in the direction pointed and seeing the above mentioned objects the undersigned was able to get an appreciable four (4) second sighting of the objects. As I watched them the objects flew on the right seemed to "oscillate" in the direction of the object on the left, at about the point of collision the objects all three of them faded out and were gone. The objects were flying in a "V" formation and flying from the South to the North.
The above sightings took place at approximately 22:00 hours on 25 August 1952, in the city of Sacramento, California.
