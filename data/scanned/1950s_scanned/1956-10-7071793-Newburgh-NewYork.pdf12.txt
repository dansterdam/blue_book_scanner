YOUR LETTER DATED 7 OCTOBER 1956 ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THIS HEADQUARTERS FOR REPLY.

WITH REGARD TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION, A BALLOON CAN BE SEEN AT TWO WIDELY SEPARATED PLACES CONTAINING, OF COURSE, ON ITS PAYLOADS. HOWEVER, OUR INVESTIGATIONS INDICATE THAT THESE CANNOT BE THE SAME BALLOON BUT WERE TWO OTHER BALLOONS RELEASED AT THE SAME TIME FOR THIS BEING THAT BALLOON RELEASES ARE SCHEDULED AT INTERVALS FOR REASONS I CANNOT GO INTO HERE DUE TO SECURITY REASONS.

INASMUCH AS YOUR LETTERS INDICATE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR WHERE-ABOUTS OF THESE BALLOONS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 6,000 CUBIC FEET AND CAN ONLY RISE TO A MAXIMUM ALTITUDE OF 100,000 FEET, YOUR FURTHER QUESTION WILL BE ANSWERED BY PROVIDING YOU WITH THE FOLLOWING:

CONCERNING YOUR SECOND QUESTION, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THESE OBJECTS, AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED, COULD CONTAIN, PAYLOADS WHICH COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. MANY OF OUR OWN SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS USING BALLOONS CARRY PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT, AND APPEARING TO BE UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON TO THE UNAWARE, WOULD BE PERFECTLY NORMAL TO THOSE CONDUSTING THESE EXPERIMENTS.

WE FEEL WHEN PERSONS SUCH AS YOURSELF SEE UNUSUAL EVENTS IN THE SKY, IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT YOU WOULD BE MUCH CONCERNED WITH WHAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE. THE ASSOCIATION OF YOUR DESCRIPTIONS WITH OUR OWN EXPERIMENTS USING BALLOONS FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES WILL, I HOPE, ALLAY FURTHER SPECULATION OR CONCERN ON YOUR PART RESULTING FROM YOUR ORIGINAL OBSERVATION. A LARGE PORTION OF SUCH OBSERVATIONS CAN BE SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED IN THIS MANNER. YOUR FURTHER INTEREST AND COOPERTION IN THIS MATTER WILL BE APPRECIATED.
