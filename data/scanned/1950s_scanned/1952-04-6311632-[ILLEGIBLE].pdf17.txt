*****

until no occasions that means of gossip would be necessary the same as through any other means of communication among my friends and no occasion has been given by me to justify any suspicions as arising from mere neighborliness and friendship. I am not inclined to be associated with anything that savors of the unusual or other than the normal and consequently have steadfastly avoided anything that might subject me or my associates to unfavorable comment or raise questions as to our motives or conduct.

The nature of my work and the necessity for maintaining strict security rules and regulations have been generally understood by my friends and acquaintances and I am sure they have never construed my actions or attitude as being in any way irregular or subject to suspicion.

I desire to cooperate fully with your office in every possible way and I hope that you will find that I have been and am willing to be completely frank and honest in all matters pertaining to this case.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
