The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

I. SOURCES:
Address: Lake Leelanau, Michigan
Ages: 39 and 39 years, respectively.
Occupations: High School
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: Both witnesses admitted in their belief that it wasn't an aircraft or a star. As far as could be determined, they are both solid citizens of the community.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: We were driving from Traverse City to Leland, Michigan, at about 11:30 p.m., when we noticed this bright, round object about 15 miles away over Lake Leelanau. It seemed to be for about 20 minutes. It seemed to be stationary and then it started to move up and down and then side to side and then it disappeared at about 11:45 (0024432 April 1956) either behind some hills or clouds.
