The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten account of a reported UFO sighting.

Extracted text from the document:

"Sent: June 19, 58
We saw what definitely was
something not of this world. 
(Saturday) just north of New Orleans.
This is a detailed report with 
one mile the approximate distance
and we were able to view it for 10 or 15
seconds. It was a perfect sphere with
a glow around it and the color was
all white. Hovering worked in an
evasive movement hectic. During the
experience I rapport fighting in detailed
to the Office of Sperical Observations
of the Air Force in detail.
They are granting it serious doubt-they
could hardly explain why or what.
My two nephews and myself are
life long residents of DeLand and
certainly know there is no natural 
connected with finding this satellite."
