PART II
FUTURE PLANS

And now, in conclusion, let us describe our plans for the future.

The present methods of conducting the investigation will be continued, with special emphasis upon use of scientific consultants. In addition, however, we will soon establish -- are already in the process of doing so -- a new procedure involving both radar-scope and direct photography.

As to the radar-scope photography, we have made an arrangement with the Air Defense Command to maintain a special alert for aerial phenomena and take radar-scope photos of any unidentified objects that may be sighted on radar screens. This is a one-in-a-million chance, and we are well aware that the probability of results from this method is very small. But we believe it is worth trying, especially since the ADC alert can be maintained without any interference with normal operations.
