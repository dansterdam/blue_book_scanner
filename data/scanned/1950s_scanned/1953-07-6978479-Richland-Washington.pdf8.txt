On the evening of July 3, 1955, noticing the clearness of a full moonlit sky I was very much impressed to take my telescope into my backyard and taking a look at the moon. To my surprise what I saw was very powerful. While watching a series of black disk travel over the edge or rim of the moon's disk, suddenly at the lower left edge of the rim of a black surface begin to protrude as the lower left edge of the moon's rim. Very slowly but surely it's every increasing in size until it was about the size of my thumb held at arm's length. This great black disc was rotating and was brightly lighted. I carefully watched this CAREFUL VISUAL OBSERVATION until it finally moved out of sight behind the trees. This great black disc was rotating and was brightly lighted.
