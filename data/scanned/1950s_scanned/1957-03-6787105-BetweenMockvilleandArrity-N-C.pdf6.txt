For General Watson, 14 Mar 57
The attempt by the press to somehow relate Venus, must also be ruled out. This planet was not visible as shown and placed 3360 in the morning, at approximately 350 miles west of Jacksonville, Florida.
It is advised that an analysis of this data indicates that our Earthman radar was not operating as consistently as expected, because the Astronomic Analyst of Goose Bay is convinced that this object was a satellite.
The facts are that the object was simultaneously observed by a well-known astronomer of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, to which reports are attached.
2. It is the recommendation of this office, that in response to any public release of this decision, the Air Force would firmly state, that information regarding this incident was thoroughly investigated and that the object was analyzed as being a natural Satellite.
