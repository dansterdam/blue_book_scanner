FLASHING LIGHT IN SKY BURNS TWO WOMEN
TWO New Mexico housewives recently suffered painful burns in a peculiar incident near here when a bright light in the sky struck them as they stood outdoors at night. Their conditions are reported as satisfactory at a local hospital today.
The women, Mrs. Celia Corbin and Mrs. Ella Budd, said the light came from above and struck them on the shoulders, causing immediate pain. They are being treated for second-degree burns on portions of their bodies.
The Civil Aeronautics Authority said it had no report of any object in the air at the time and could not account for the flash of light. Investigators said the women had no knowledge of any nearby experimental aircraft or flares. 
Other aspects of the incident were under study today.
