It may be concluded from the above that past experience indicates that a new policy concerning investigations must be developed. There was an increase in public interest which caused an increase in the number of articles on the subject; however, this trend has been noted previously.

In order to overcome the lack of basic data, it is necessary to standardize reporting procedures. Specific descriptions in regard to size, location, speed, motion, sound, and duration are necessary in order that the information thus obtained will be useful.

For observers who wish to report unidentified aerial objects, the following procedures are established to turn in a brief basic summary form. It would be appreciated if observers would send in a complete form for their observation.

If and when new developments turn up in this program, the Air Force will keep the public informed.
