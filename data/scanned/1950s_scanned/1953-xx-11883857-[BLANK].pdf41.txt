METEOR

1. Shape: Round to elongated.

2. Size: Pinpoint to size of moon.

3. Color: Flaming yellow with red, green or blue possible.

4. Speed: Crosses large portion of sky in few seconds except if 
    coming head-on.

5. Formation: Generally single - can break into shower at end of
    trajectory. Occasionally (but rare) small groups.

6. Trail: At night almost always a luminous train which can persist
    as long as a half hour (rarely). Daytime meteors are much
    less frequently observed. In daytime, leaves a whitish to
    dark smoke trail.

7. Sound: None, although occasionally reported (believed psychological).

8. Course: Generally streaking downward, but not necessarily sharply
    downward. Can on rare occasion give impression of slight
    rise.

9. Time In Sight: Longest reported about 30 seconds, generally less 
    than 10.

10. Lighting Conditions: Day or Night. Mostly night.

11. Radar: Return from meteor itself is highly improbable, however, the
    train left by a meteor, is a good radar reflector.

12. Other: An exceptionally bright meteor is called a fireball. These
    are rare but extremely spectacular and on occasion have been
    known to light surroundings to the brightness of daylight.
