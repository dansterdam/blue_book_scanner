The image does not contain any photographs. However, it does contain text that appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads as follows:

July 24, 1954

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reply to your recent letter in further reference to unidentified flying objects.

While the Air Force does not deny that there may be sightings of other flying objects, there has never been a shred of evidence that would lead anyone to believe that these beings have visited the earth in spaceships. On the contrary, all the investigations made during the past 15 years have served only to strengthen the conviction that no identifiable "flying objects" under discussion are actually craft of some conventional object such as an aircraft, balloon or something even their.

In the case of Captain Mantell, at the time he was dispatched to investigate a UFO, it was not known that a weather balloon was in the area. When the report of his sighting was checked out, investigation revealed that the Navy had released such a balloon under a then classified project and the sighting was determined to be of that balloon. Publicity to those persons actually working on the project.

The Air Force conclusion of the Washington D.C. sightings were that they were due to mirage effects created by a double inversion.

Sincerely, 
MASTON M. JACKS
