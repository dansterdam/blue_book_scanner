The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marked on it, and a "B" marked on the same curved line. The text above this sketch instructs the viewer to imagine they are at the point shown, and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when they last saw it.

The second sketch contains two smaller sketches. The larger one shows a road with buildings and trees on either side, with a person walking on the road. The smaller sketch shows a landscape with a curved horizon.
