Dear Sir:

On January 22, 1958, the Armstrong Circle Theater presented a program which dealt with the unidentified flying object. The program was entitled "Flying Saucers - The Sides" and was supposed to present both sides of the UFO controversy. The show consistently did not proceed according to plan as some of the individuals scheduled to appear did not-specifically Edward J. Ruppelt, Kenneth Arnold, and Captain C.S.Chiles. The most dramatic segment of the program occurred when Edward E. Keyhoe was cut-off in the middle of a paragraph.

In June of 1958, I sent a letter to Talent Associates requesting a copy of the script used on July 31, 1958. I received a letter from Mr. C.O. Hess saying that the supply of scripts had been "exhausted" and that it is indeed hard to believe that the requests for these scripts had so far exceeded the supply that the Armstrong Company did not have a single copy left in their organization.

Since the CBS program appeared, a number of articles have appeared concerning 'censorship' of the script for this program and especially in regard to Mr. Keyhoe's section of the show the way in which my request for a copy of the script was denied by Mr. Hess only supports this charge made by Mr. Keyhoe and others.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me where I could obtain a copy of said script.

Thank you.
Sincerely,
J. Chapman
