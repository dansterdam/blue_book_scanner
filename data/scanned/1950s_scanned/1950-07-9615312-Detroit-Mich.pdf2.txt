1. In compliance with letter, Department of the Army, USASA, CGSC4D, 452.1-2, dated 21 August 1950, subject: Unidentified Flying Objects, USASA Control number A-1217, the following information is hereby submitted:

"SHAPED LIKE A STOGIE - 6 Girls Report Seeing 'Something' in the Sky - sit Southfield Township Girl Scouts reported that while they were sitting about the campfire at Camp Dequindre at 10 P.M. Thursday they suddenly saw an awesome brilliance in the sky."

"Their scout leaders, Mrs. Lewis Whitmarsh and Mrs. Virginia Shidmacher, said they saw it, too."

"The girls said the terrifying radiance was shaped like a cigar or a "zeppelin". They said it roared toward them and broke in two. Then they said, the pieces rejoined."

"The girls are Tena Lopes, Claudette Moore, Bonnie Michall, Donna Kramer and Carol Ann Whitmarsh, all in the 12-to-14 age group. 'I was scared,' said Tena. 'It was just like she had opened.' Claudette added, 'I thought it, was coming right at me.'"

"Mrs. Franklin Tillage, Mrs. Dick Lewis and Mr. and Mrs. Russell Barton all reported seeing the object but could not attest to its stogie shape."

"Neither the girls nor the leaders thought it looked much like what a flying saucer is supposed to look like."
