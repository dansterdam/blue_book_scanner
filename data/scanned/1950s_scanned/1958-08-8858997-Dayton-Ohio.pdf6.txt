There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have produced the following text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One:)
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel 
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar
g. Silver dollar
h. Baseball
i. Grapefruit
j. Basketball

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.)
a. Very sure
b. Fairly certain
c. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Gradually faded from sight

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, do you wish that you could have sketched the object that you saw? If so, what shape, color, or other appearance did the object which you saw seem to have?

Tentatively remarked, no clear view 
little to reporting shell.
