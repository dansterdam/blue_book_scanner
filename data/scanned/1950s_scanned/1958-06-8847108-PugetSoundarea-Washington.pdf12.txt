TRACKING NORTH AT A TERRIFICAL HIGH RATE OF SPEED. I TURNED
TO KEEP THIS OBJECT WITHIN SIGHT. IT APPEARED TO CLIMB
AND SLOW DOWN AND DO A LARGE 350 DEGREE ORBIT THEN IT DESCEND-
ED AND STARTED CLOSING IN TOWARD ME. IT THEN MADE 4 OR 5 SMALL
ORBITS AROUND ME. AT THIS TIME THE FEATURE OF THE DARK CENTER OF
THE OBJECT WAS DISTINGUISHABLE
AND ALSO THE BANKING ATTITUDES OF THE OBJECT
WERE VIVID. IT FINALLY PITCHED UP 45 DEGREE PITCH
ATTITUDE AND ACCELERATED AND CLIMBED
RAPIDLY OUT OF SIGHT ON A NORTHWEST HEADING.
