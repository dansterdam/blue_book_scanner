There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

5. Because of the reason stated in paragraph 2, it is not possible to confirm this report as being a legitimate photographic image on the object described. It is unfortunate that the majority of such submitted data consist of photographs of an unconventional nature that are formed photographically by the camera. It is submitted as being photographs of unconventional type of objects, but it is of such notably poor quality that they offer practically no basis for technical evaluation.
