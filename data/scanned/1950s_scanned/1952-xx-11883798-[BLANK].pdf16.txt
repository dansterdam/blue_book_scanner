2. ATIC would be responsible for press releases in the early stages of all sightings
3. ATIC would furnish the contractor technical group all data on sightings as they were received. This would enable the contractor to be thoroughly informed on the procedure to be followed.
4. ATIC would process all sighting reports. This would consist of investigating the reports, preparing a folder in duplicate (1 copy for ATIC files and 1 copy for contractor technical group) with all pertinent data. 
5. ATIC would furnish the high level advisory group with periodic summary reports made available by the contractor technical group. These summaries would supply the high level advisory committee with the necessary material for information releases.
