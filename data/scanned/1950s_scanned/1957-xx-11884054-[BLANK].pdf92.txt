The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that describes the characteristics of an aircraft. The text on the page provides detailed information about the shape, size, color, speed, formation, trail, sound, course, and time in sight of the observed aircraft. The document seems to be from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program established in 1952 to investigate unidentified flying objects.

AIRCRAFT
1. Shape: From conventional to circular or elliptical.
2. Size: Pinpoint to actual. 
3. Color: Silver to bright yellow (night - black or color of lights).
4. Speed: Generally only angular speeds can be observed. This depends on distance but small objects crossing major portion of sky in less than a minute can be ruled out. Aircraft will not cross major portion of sky in less than a minute whereas a meteor certainly will. 
5. Formation: Two to twenty. Numbers greater than 20 more likely birds than aircraft.
6. Trail: May or may not have (vapor and exhaust).
7. Sound: Zero to loud shrill or low depending on altitude and winds aloft. Under certain conditions, aircraft may be observed at high altitudes without making any sound.
8. Course: Steady, erratic or gently curving (not erratic - may appear still if approaching head-on). Abrupt angle turns and sudden reversals, abrupt changes in altitude ruled out.
9. Time in Sight: More than 15 seconds, generally of the order of a minute or two.
10. Lighting Conditions: Night or Day.
