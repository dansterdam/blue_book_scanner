Staff Sergeant Ferris base ball machine broke down, broke two machines streak, may have been due to a blue-white light passing through from NW to SE. Passing very close to instruments and auxiliary scope, Ferris miles away. Five of the sea search team found no radar targets where the blips occurred. The instructor's flight engineer received training and familiarization, which was checking the blips, duration, speed, and maneuver characteristics. The instructor and search pilot saw and tracked the blips.

Radar stated at that time he had 50-mile range on, indicating a return at 15-18 thousand feet elevation. With the blips continuing to a point 15-25 miles off the coast, and then disappearing, the instructor flight engineer tried running after them to observe positions, but as he got closer, they would just disappear. During this period, student and instructor radio viewed the scope, and determined no interference existed. At this time, Radar could not calibrate his set to eliminate any interference or malfunction, when he attempted to scan the scope once more, the blips had disappeared. It was called continuing from 7:40 to 9:15, when they disappeared, the speed stated between 600 to 9,000 mph. At all times the blips were witnessed, speed was in excess of our fastest fighter plane, and it passed in from the east, to the west, then to the south and off at the observer's sight.
