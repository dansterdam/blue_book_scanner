The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from the Project Blue Book archives.

As an OCR system, I will now output the text found in the document:

FROM: LIEUTENANT J. L. MOODY, SCT., USMC
ADDRESS: 246 CESAR E. CHAVEZ AVE., EL TORO, CALIFORNIA
AGE: 26
LENGTH OF SERVICE: 5 YEARS
DUTIES: GCA and control tower operator
EDUCATION: High School graduate  
QUALIFICATIONS: Two (2) years radar experience. ODASDCACC combined control tower and radar.
IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE INTERVIEWED SOURCE WAS VERY COOPERATIVE IN THE QUESTIONING. HE APPEARS TO BE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN THE REPORTING OF THESE INCIDENTS AND VERY EAGER TO FURNISH ANY INFORMATION THAT HE COULD ABOUT THEM. HE COULD OFFER AN EXPLANATION OF SOME OF THE OBSERVATIONS AS BEING NOT UNCOMMON OR OUT OF THE ORDINARY, BUT STATED THAT IN ALL HIS EXPERIENCE WITH RADAR HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THE RETURN HE OBSERVED ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION. HE WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL AIR TRAFFIC IN THAT AREA AND WITH THE USUAL RADAR PRESENTATIONS, AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HE SAW SEEMS SINCERE AND CONVINCING.

ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, SOURCE WAS ON DUTY AS STANDBY GCA OPERATOR ON THE EVENING SHIFT AT THE GCA UNIT AND NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT ORBITING NORTH OF THE FIELD (MCAS EL TORO). HE CALLED THE DUTY OFFICER AND NOTIFIED THE CONTROL TOWER OF THE LIGHTS. THE CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL ALSO OBSERVED THE LIGHT AND REPORTED IT TO SOURCE.

NORMALLY AND AT SPEEDS WHICH SOURCE ESTIMATED TO BE FROM FIFTEEN (15) TO TWENTY (20) KNOTS, THE LIGHT WOULD REMAIN STATIONARY FOR PERIODS OF TIME AND THEN DART RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY, DISTANCES OF APPROXIMATELY ONE (1) MILE, MAKING VERY SHARP TURNS AND STOPS. SOURCE ESTIMATED THE DIAMETER OF THE LIGHT TO BE FROM ONE AND ONE-HALF (1 1/2) TO TWO (2) FEET AND STATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE FROM TWO THOUSAND (2000) TO THREE THOUSAND (3000) FEET IN ALTITUDE. HE STATED THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE LIGHT WOULD APPEAR TO FADE OUT AND THEN REAPPEAR AGAIN IN ANOTHER PART OF THE SKY. SOURCE STATED THAT THE OBJECT MOVED SO RAPIDLY THAT HE COULD NOT TRACK IT ON RADAR.

EARLY IN THE COURSE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS, SOURCE SWITCHED ON THE CONTROL TOWER RADAR WHICH GAVE INCONCLUSIVE RETURNS. HAVING NOTIFIED THE TOWER OF HIS OBSERVATIONS, SOURCE WAS THEN INSTRUCTED BY THE TOWER TO KEEP THE RADAR ON AND TO CONTINUE OBSERVING THE OBJECT.
