The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

About 6:45 pm on the evening of the 15th of November, my friend [REDACTED] called me to the phone and asked me to take a look at an object in the sky to the southeast. I watched the object for about 15 minutes. The object seemed to hover, or stay in about the same place in the sky. It did not appear to have any definite shape. It seemed to reflect the ground lights, and occasionally, when a car headlight would shine in a certain direction, I could see the object quite clearly, but most of the time it seemed to blend in with the surroundings. It was giving off a reddish-white glow. I would estimate its altitude to be about 3000 feet. There was no sound or any indication of motion, other than an occasional seeming to change position slightly. Its behavior seemed quite erratic. I did not take it to be an airplane or any conventional aircraft. I hope this information will be of interest to you.
