Additional note to Question 40: 

If the following problem can be solved, being 
a reasonable cloud upon the object's speed and 
altitude is possible. I have been searching for 
some means by which these could be determined -- Do 
you know his herein if a value can be assigned to 
the intensity of the object's light? At several or 
so often I became aware of a light overhead 
the object came into view (duration seen, answered 
in question 5). Problem, how far could the object's 
glow be evident to be noticeable under the cir-
cumstances this object was seen? What intensity 
was its light when the object was distributionary 
to when the size approximately of a "grapefruit".
What then was the object's size? If these can 
be solved, then it will be possible to solve fairly 
definitely the object's altitude as well as 
speed since we have a) duration seen, b) angle 
of view, and, c) object's declination; as well,
d) true extent of the object's glow radius(sphere). 
It has had me licked -- would you let 
me know results if above can be solved? -- 
It'd really be interested!!
