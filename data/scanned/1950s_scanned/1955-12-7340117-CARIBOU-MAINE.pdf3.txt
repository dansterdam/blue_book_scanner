This is a good piece of footage. We had some very unusual sightings of objects one evening. The familiar saw in the sky below appeared to be about thirty-five yards or so away. As far as I could say, the objects seemed to be moving up and down in a zig-zag fashion, like a fish swimming in the water. Sometimes the objects did not move at all but appeared to merely float without any apparent means of propulsion. I could see very clearly the outline of this object. It was round in shape and bluish-white in color. At the same time, I could see no lights or evidence of any kind of mechanism that would be necessary to lift or propel such an object. I was amazed at what I saw and felt that it could not possibly be an aircraft of any kind. It was definitely not an airplane or a helicopter or anything like that. It definitely did not have the shape or configuration of any conventional type of aircraft. At the time I did not know what to think. Now, in retrospect, I am convinced that what I saw that evening was something out of the ordinary, to put it mildly. I will always remember that experience as I had never seen anything like that before or since. I realize that others who have reported similar sightings are often ridiculed or made to feel that they are strange in some way. I do not wish to be included in that category. All I want to do is describe what I actually saw. I am aware that the subject of UFOs is a controversial one and often a sensitive one. However, I am convinced that what I saw that evening was real and not a figment of my imagination. I would be glad to cooperate with any properly authorized investigative agency that might have an interest in this incident. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to assist in this matter.
