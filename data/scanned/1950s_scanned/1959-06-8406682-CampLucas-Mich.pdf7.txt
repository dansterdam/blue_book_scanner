The dream and object sighted by Mrs. and her friend have all but become very well known through the public press and TV coverage in the Detroit metropolitan area. Several miles west of Detroit, a woman and her friend observed an unidentified flying object between 2030 and 2100 hours. As they were driving home from a picnic along a country road, their attention was attracted to a bright light in the sky. The object was saucer-shaped, giving off a brilliant bluish-white light. It hovered for a few minutes at an estimated height of 2,000 to 3,000 feet, then suddenly darted away at a tremendous speed. The ATIC conclusion was that they saw an aircraft leaving a contrail. 

Other individuals in the area also observed the object. Copies of the statements taken from some of the observers are enclosed. The film, or who the film was used on, is not known. If the film was taken, it did not come into possession of ATIC. What was the shutter speed and lens opening used while taking the film, or was the light sufficient for hand-held shots. Was the object head-held, or was it on a tripod or other mount. Requests have been made for analysis. The VELO cannot be identified from the statements. The statements appear to be honest and the witnesses appear to be normal individuals.
