on the night from the 8th to the 9th November 1954 my wife and I saw a strange object in the northeast skyline. The object appeared to be about 2,000 ft high and 100 ft in diameter. It had the appearance of being made of dull silver metal and had a glowing red light on the underside. The object moved in a southwesterly direction at very high speed and was visible for about 7 minutes. It did not make any noise that we could hear.
I have mentioned this incident to several people but they all think I am crazy. I have kept this to myself but feel that it is my duty to report this sighting.
I would be most grateful if you would let me know if you have had any similar reports from this area. Yours sincerely.
