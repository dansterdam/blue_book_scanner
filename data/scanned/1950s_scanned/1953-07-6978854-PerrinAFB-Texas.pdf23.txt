AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: Lt/Col Larry W. Bowen
Perrin AFB, Texas

33d Air Def Sq, 10th Air Div

The object sited was a light which first appeared to be a star, but later began moving rapidly and erratically. Two jet interceptors were scrambled to investigate the object, but it disappeared before they could make visual contact. The pilots reported that the object made a rapid and sudden change in direction and speed, unlike any known aircraft. Ground observers also reported seeing the object. The incident was well within our radar coverage, but no targets were plotted.

Weather conditions were clear and visibility was good. There was no indication of any atmospheric phenomena which could have caused the sighting.
