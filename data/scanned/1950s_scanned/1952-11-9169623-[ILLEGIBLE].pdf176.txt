The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

the matter of the photograph is not considered significant enough to warrant
reporting, since the photograph shows nothing more than a few small bright spots against a dark background.
The entire report is considered of little or no interest, and is being filed without further action.
