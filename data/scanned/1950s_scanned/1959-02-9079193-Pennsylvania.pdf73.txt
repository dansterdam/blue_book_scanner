Here is the text transcribed from the document:

THE IRANIAN AFFAIR CONCERNS THE SIGHTING OF FLYING UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS OVER THE UNITED STATES ON FEBRUARY 25, 1959, WHEN A COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CREW AND PASSENGERS WERE ALERTED TO THE UNUSUAL ACTIVITY IN THE SKIES OVER OHIO ON THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 25, 1959.

THE INCIDENT REPORTEDLY OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 8:30 P.M. WHEN AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 593, EN ROUTE FROM NEW YORK TO SAN FRANCISCO, CROSSED OVER OHIO AND THE CREW AND PASSENGERS SIGHTED SEVERAL FAST-MOVING OBJECTS IN THE AIR. CAPT. WILLIAM NASH, THE PILOT, FIRST SIGHTED THREE BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE NIGHT SKY AND IMMEDIATELY ALERTED THE CREW AND PASSENGERS.

CAPT. NASH HAD FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECTS AT 8:45 P.M. AS HE WAS TRYING TO LAND THE AIRLINER AND WAS BETWEEN PITTSBURGH AND YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, MRS. WILLIAM FORTENBERRY, A PASSENGER, ALSO SIGHTED THE OBJECTS AND REPORTED THEM TO THE CREW.

ON NOTICING THE STRANGE OBJECTS, CAPT. NASH TURNED ON HIS LANDING LIGHTS IN ORDER TO GET A BETTER VIEW. HE THEN INFORMED THE GROUND CONTROL STATION OF THEIR PRESENCE. FOR THE NEXT 12 TO 15 MINUTES, CAPT. NASH AND HIS CREW WATCHED THE OBJECTS MANEUVERING IN THE NIGHT SKY. WHILE THEY MAINTAINED THEIR ORIGINAL COURSE, THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO SUDDENLY CHANGE COURSE AND SPEED. THEY COULD BE SEEN CLEARLY IN THE SKY, FIRST HOVERING, THEN DARTING AWAY AT TREMENDOUS SPEED. 

THIS INCIDENT REPORTEDLY REACHED NATIONAL ATTENTION WHEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE QUESTIONED CAPT. NASH AND HIS CREW. THEY WERE APPARENTLY INTERESTED IN THE EVENT, ALTHOUGH THEY DECLINED TO MAKE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENT REGARDING IT.
