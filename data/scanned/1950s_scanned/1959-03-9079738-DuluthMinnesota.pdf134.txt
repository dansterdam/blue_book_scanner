AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 77-U-35-1-59

PART I: UFO SIGHTING
Incident 7, 1956th AISS - Date and Time of Sighting: 10 March 1956 - 6:15 pm 
Location: Duluth, Minnesota - Distance from Observer: Approximately 8-9 miles, but nothing beyond.

This unidentified sip, however, was oval in shape and had a definite metallic sheen. As he described it, its size was approximately 30 feet in diameter. He stated that it appeared to be hovering at an elevation of 500-600 feet above the ground. He observed it for approximately 8 minutes before it rapidly accelerated to an estimated speed of approximately 1,500 mph and disappeared from sight.

The observation was briefly interrupted when the observer was called to the telephone. When he returned outside, the object was still in view, hovering at the same approximate elevation. He was able to observe it further for about 2 to 3,000 feet altitude.

The pilot of an aircraft observed a light below his aircraft at approximately 6:30 pm, in the same general area as the reported sighting. There was no radar contact established and no other witnesses could be located. No further information.
