This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed text discussing the procedures for handling reported UFO sightings.

Text extracted from the document:

15. As each reported sighting is identified, compatible with security, it is planned to make available to those in the field responsible for the observation, information as to the nature of the object. In addition, ATIC's monthly report of sightings will continue to be compiled. It is recommended that this be disseminated to all military establishments contributing to the work of the project. In addition, an unclassified version can be prepared for release, and the statistical summary of this monthly report could be released to the PIO in the event the press continues to clamor for information on the adoption of this plan to have the Air Force decline voluntary reports by non-technical personnel.

16. I would like to take the remaining few minutes to discuss the overall operation and the work of collaborating agencies. It is recommended that wherever possible existing military facilities and agencies be used. Any organizations can contribute the required technical data on observations of UAO's. To minimize expense and complications, it is recommended that one organization be responsible for the field collection and transmissions of observation reports in the U.S. It is believed that ADC is the logical organization inasmuch as the command which has responsibility for intercepting enemy aerial objects should be the command which operates air observation and instrument network for spotting UAO's.
