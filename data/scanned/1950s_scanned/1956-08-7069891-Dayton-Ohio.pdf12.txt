Flying Object Reports
Received on 11-29
of 22 AVG 1956

Several reports of flying objects were called in last night. I took notes on 4 of them. The object that I have a light-like object was seen crossing back and forth across the city of Dayton last night. It seemed to be somewhat dim in flame and made no noise. Only one report was received at the Sheriff's Office after 2100 hours. The Deputy Sheriff made his two calls at 0100 and after this reporting. Here are some of the names and addresses of the people who witnessed this flight (?)

"Flying Saucer?"
NO! Just Plane!
People in this area have been alarmed last night by a "flying saucer" circling low over the Miami Valley - just the wrong sight - but it was the Wright Air Development Center's photographer reconneissance plane taking night photos of the Dayton area. The Wright Air Development Center photographers at what they thought were strange lights had excited people to believe that it was a "flying saucer." Sorry.
