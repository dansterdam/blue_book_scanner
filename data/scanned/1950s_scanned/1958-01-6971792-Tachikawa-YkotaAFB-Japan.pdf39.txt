24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the objects that you saw. Of what materials would you make them, and how large would they be, and what shape or shapes would the objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the one which you saw?
From what I saw and considering the time, the object itself seemed to me to be the flight of a medium-size aerial rocket.
