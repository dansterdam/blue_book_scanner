Transcription of the text:

9 August 1955
South Bay, California
Local 53,5,9 Aug 1955
One (1) disc shaped object, the size of a grapefruit held at arm's length, was silver in color and seemed to hover in the sky for about 30 seconds. The object did not make any noise and attracted the observer's attention.

The age of the observer would limit the observer's knowledge of objects which would be readily identifiable to others. However, from the source being a conventional aircraft, the observed object which gave the disc-shaped appearance like a jet and the noise of the object, leads to the above checked conclusions.
