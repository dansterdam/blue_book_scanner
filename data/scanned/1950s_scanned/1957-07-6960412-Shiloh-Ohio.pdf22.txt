There is no photograph present in this image of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image is a scanned document containing text, which I will now transcribe:

Mr. Joe Searcy's Office
Mansfield, Ohio

Dear Mr. Searcy:

In response to your letter of 16 September regarding the object which was kindly sent to me, I wish to advise that the investigation has now been completed.

The object which at first glance appeared to be a meteorite. However, after careful examination, it was found not to be a meteorite but most probably a volcanic bomb.

As the stone is not a meteorite, we feel that it is not worth a further investigation and that it should be returned to you.

We shall hold the stone pending instructions from you regarding its disposition.

The Air Force wishes to extend its appreciation for your assistance and cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,

WALLACE W. ELWOOD
Captain, USAF
Adjutant
