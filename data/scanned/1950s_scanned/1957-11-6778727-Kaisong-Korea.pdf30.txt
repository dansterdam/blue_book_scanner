The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with handwritten text that seems to describe an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

ATIC 

KEYS, Daniel D., Sgt. RA 17401567
1952 (Germany) Int. Cavall. Division

Time - 0500, 6 November 52 (pickup point at 0212

Visibility - slight overcast - very dark - stars visible - very few clouds - reasonably clear.

Vision - suddenly a bright flash caught my attention and lasted about 2 seconds - the flash was silent. No sound of any kind. It appeared to be a bright greenish white vapor trail with definite form - much like the trail left by a jet but without the characteristic of a jet. The trail was horizontal and straight - no curves at all. It seemed to come down rapidly from a high altitude and then disappear - no trace of it remaining. I watched closely for any further activity but saw nothing like it again. No kind of aircraft was observed. I'm at a loss to describe exactly what it was that I saw. It remained distinctly visible only about 2 seconds and then was gone. Observed that it was of little or no width at the beginning expanding to a width of perhaps 6 inches at the end - rapidly disappearing as it died out. It did not fade but simply disappeared completely.
