1. Mr. L. D. Johnson, 102 North Topanga Canyon Road, Woodland Hills, California, who is employed as an Engineering Fisherman by North American Aviation, informed Officer that on or about December 26, 1952, approximately 6:00 P.M., while Mr. and Mrs. Johnson were in their back yard, they observed an object which appeared to go in a vertical and upward direction across the sky. This object appeared from the south, heading in a northeasterly direction, leaving a long trail of fire of a yellowish-reddish cast, very distinct as it passed through the sky. The object remained in sight for about 15 to 20 seconds before diminishing but shooting upward at a terrific velocity. It was encountered at its source; like a dart of an arrow, fanned out toward the end.

2. This report is forwarded in accordance with provisions of paragraph 7c(2)(b), AFR 200-2.
