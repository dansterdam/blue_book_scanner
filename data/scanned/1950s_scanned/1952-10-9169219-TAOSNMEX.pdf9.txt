SWORN STATEMENT

I, Richard D Volk, 1st Lt., USAF, AO 1903267, 34th Air Division 
(Tec), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On Friday evening 17 October 1952, at approximately 2110 hours MST, 
I observed a strange object in the sky. While watching a football game 
at Municipal Stadium, I noticed what appeared to be a very large meteor 
east of Albuquerque traveling north. The object was a bright blue-green,
and falling very rapidly. It was only in view for about one (1) second,
and it was not possible to estimate any speed. The object appeared to 
burn itself out rather than fall from the sky.

Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 23rd day of October 1952.
