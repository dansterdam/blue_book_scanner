The image contains several sketches and drawings. In the upper sketch, there appears to be a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above it. The text instructs the reader to "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it."

In the larger sketch below, there is a road leading to some buildings in the distance, with a person standing in the foreground. There is also a smaller sketch in the bottom right corner depicting a landscape.
