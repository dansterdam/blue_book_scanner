In the opinion of the observer, the reported object was probably a weather observation type of aircraft, but neither convective activity nor the synoptic situation over the area could likely have caused a mirage which might appear to float in the air and ascend at time of incident. Powering cumulus clouds were observed to the N and NE over the mountains, but there were no clouds directly over the field at the time of incident.

So definitely a metrological observation, at approximately 0945P, a passenger in a T-6 aircraft approximately 40 miles SW of Geiger Field enroute to Larson AFB, called the object and had a glittering appearance as it ascended high in the sky over the surface, reported to be circular and had a glittering appearance. Duration of sight - approximately 20 seconds.
