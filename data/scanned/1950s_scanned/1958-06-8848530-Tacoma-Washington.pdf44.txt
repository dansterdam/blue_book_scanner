Dear Senator Smith:

In June of 1958, Mr. [redacted] submitted a report to the Air Force on an unidentified flying object which he had observed for some months. With this report, he sent negatives of some pictures he had taken of the object.

After careful study by photointerpreters and two scientists, the object in the pictures was determined to be the star Arcturus.

The Air Force will return the negatives to Mr. [redacted] immediately.
