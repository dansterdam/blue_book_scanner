Officers [REDACTED] were 
talking with me in front of our school bldg.
at about the same time both shouted "What
the hell is that? They were facing west, I was 
facing east. I turned and seen a circular 
shadow sailing through the air not far above 
our building (3 stories) we ran to the corner 
the school bldg and watched the object until it 
got over the kitchen bldg (located directly in 
the rear of school bldg about 60 feet Then it 
seemed to pick up great speed and go 
straight up in the air. The night was dark 
but the object seemed darker. It made no
noise, to me the night seemed to get quieter as 
I watched the object.
