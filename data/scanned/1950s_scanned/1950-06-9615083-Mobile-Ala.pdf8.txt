Plane Passengers Watch "Saucer"
(AP) - United Airlines today disclosed the latest flying saucer story.
First officer David Stewart of Redondo Beach, Calif., told of watching a brilliantly-glowing object pass the plane he was piloting.
Stewart said the object traveled at a terrific speed, estimating it at 14,000 mph or more and that it was more cigar-shaped than the previously-reported saucer-shaped objects. He said the passage of the object took only a few seconds.
