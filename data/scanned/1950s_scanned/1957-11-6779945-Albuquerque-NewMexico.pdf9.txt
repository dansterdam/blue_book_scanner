Photos of 'Saucer' Sent to CD Head; Mailer Sought
JERRY ENGLE, an employe of the Albuquerque Journal, said he took a picture of a flying object from his window in Belen, N.M., last Wednesday. The picture, he said, was sent to this office of the CD (Civil Defense) Head, George Merritt, who referred it to the Air Force for investigation.
Merritt said the letter was from a man in Belen, N.M., who wanted him to take the picture and investigate it for him. The picture, Merritt said, showed an unusual object in the sky. He said the man who took the picture did not want to be identified, but that he would like the Air Force to examine it. 
Merritt said his office had forwarded the picture to the proper authorities.
