TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:

It is the contention of the writer that some physical factors were involved in the sighting, that there was more to the incident than just a visual impression. The physical factors noted at the sighting were:

1. The object moved in a manner which could not be attributed to any known type of conventional aircraft. It was capable of instantaneous stops and starts, sharp changes in direction, and accelerations which far exceeded the capabilities of any jet aircraft.

2. The object gave off a light which was illumined from within. This light was a brilliant white color and was not the reflection of sunlight.

3. The object was in view for a period of over 15 minutes, during which time it maintained a constant altitude and was under complete control and direction.

In the opinion of the writer, the behavior of the object was such that it could not be attributed to any known type of aircraft, either conventional or experimental. The maneuvers and performances exceeded the known capabilities of any man-made device.
