I saw one object. It was round and looked like a balloon. It was brilliant in color, changing from small near-objects to the broad horizon. At first it had a trail and then it just vanished there was no sound.

It was about 1935 when I saw it. I timed it about ten (10) minutes.

I observed the object visually from the ground and used binoculars. The balloon appeared to stand over the horizon 7,500 feet in the air. When I got the glasses on it, it looked like a balloon twelve to fifteen inches in diameter.

The object was directly overhead (Tinker Air Force Base).

I have been in the Air Force at Tinker Air Force Base for eleven and one half months. I view aircraft regularly and this was no aircraft. The weather was clear, there were no clouds - nothing to block the vision. 

There was no fragments or physical evidence of the object.

I doubt it was a weather balloon. I would judge the object to be about 10,000 feet high.
