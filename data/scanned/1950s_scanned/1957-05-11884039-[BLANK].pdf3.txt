ATIC 10. The attached proposed revision of AFR 200-2 is submitted for transmittal to
USAF Coordinator and USAF Regulation Committee for approval, inclusion and since
clearance with ARC laws have been incorporated, this Regulation is ready for
publication.
2. No substantive changes have been made to the most recent ATIC revision as stated in paragraph 3 of attachment 1. Other than deleting minor redundancy and ensuring clarity, the
changes indicated are considered to be of an administrative nature to facilitate distribution which is the point covered in this transmittal.
Of SAFPIS all unclassified Air Force regulations are made available to the Press. because
clearance of public interest in UFOs, the subject Regulation would receive close
scrutiny if any material that either in or out of context might reflect an unfavorable change in USAF attitude or policy toward UFOs. In every instance where the content has been removed or altered, at most, the effect of such deletions or
alterations would sacrifice informative material regulating the convenience of the
user of the Regulation.
