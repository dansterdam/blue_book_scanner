The witness was walking along the road north to inspect a field of milo (sorghum) when he noticed an object coming from the north to the south, checking the milo as the road was too narrow to pass directly beneath the object.

The object was able to make sharp turns without loss of speed or control and was visible for approximately 60 seconds. The witness stated the object was estimated to be 500 to 600 feet in diameter. The object was silver in color and had no visible means of propulsion. After passing overhead, it made a sharp turn and sped off to the south, disappearing from view behind a hill.
