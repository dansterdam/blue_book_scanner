The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Similar glow of light, reddish in color, before the course of the movement appeared, and something like a searchlight was directed from the object, and watched, and saw, especially in diminishing. Descending, slowly ascending, finally emerging, but continuous streaming, slightly waving, no sounds, as of an engine or propeller. Duration about 5 to 7 minutes. Object after 1:00 to 4:30 appearing constantly, they believe, enlarged. 
This went, and as, the record was quite incomplete. Apparently, some lower to sketch dim outline before. Once there was a minute, fairly vivid picture. In a moment it faded and they lost all sight of it, nothing. Frankly, disappointed.
I hate to write about this, a long story.
