The image provided contains a diagram or chart, but no photograph. The chart appears to be a "SURVEY PROFILE" with an "ANGLE OF DEPRESSION" scale on the left side and an "ANGLE OF ELEVATION" scale on the right side. The horizontal axis shows various distance measurements in feet.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text found in the document:
