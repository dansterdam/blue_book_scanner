CASE CALLED TO MY ATTENTION BY ROY LEET OF GAHANNA, OHIO, WHO STATED THAT HE HAD TALKED TO THE WITNESS AND THAT HE WAS VERY RELIABLE AND APPEARED TO HAVE SEEN SOMETHING UNUSUAL. WITNESS RECALLED SEEING A BRIGHT OBJECT HOVERING IN THE SKY FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AT A DISTANCE OF AROUND A MILE AND A QUARTER ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 26, 1957, ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK, WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK. OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ROUND, BRIGHT, AND SPINNING, THEN SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED. WITNESS DID NOT FEEL IT WAS AN AIRPLANE OR ANYTHING CONVENTIONAL. HE SAID IT WAS A DEFINITE UFO.
