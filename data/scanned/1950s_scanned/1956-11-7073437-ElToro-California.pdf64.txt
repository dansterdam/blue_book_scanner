DETAILS OF INCIDENT

On 7 November 1956, at approximately 1506 hours, a radar target was observed on the height-finder radar of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, El Toro, California. The target was first picked up at an altitude of 44,000 feet and a range of 90 miles. The target was tracked for approximately 12 minutes, during which time it decreased in altitude to 6,000 feet and increased in speed from 300 knots to 600 knots. The target then began to gradually climb again, reaching an altitude of 18,000 feet before disappearing from the radar scope.  

The weather at the time was clear and the radar operators were experienced. No other aircraft were in the area at the time, and no known aircraft were capable of the performance exhibited by the target.
