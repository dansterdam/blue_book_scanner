9. COMMENTS: Specifically Astronomical Data, The object observed by certified Weather Observer W. B. McKee, was pulsating and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 25,000 feet. It was under observation for about 2 minutes, during which time it performed "aerobatic-like" maneuvers, changing direction abruptly without banking or loss of altitude, then accelerating into the distance and finally disappearing from view. No further details are given which may have appeared unusually large. Insufficient data for thorough evaluation. Forwarded: 7/17/62.
