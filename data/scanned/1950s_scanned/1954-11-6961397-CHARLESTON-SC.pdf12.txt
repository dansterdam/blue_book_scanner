The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a newspaper article about the United States studying European flying saucer photos. The article mentions that the U.S. Air Force is studying photographs of "mysterious flying saucers" taken in Sweden, Yugoslavia, and Italy, and that these cases make up about 10% of the U.S. cases that are unexplained.

U.S. STUDYING EUROPEAN FLYING SAUCER PHOTOS
Swedish, Yugoslav, Italian Reports Checked - 10 Pet. of U.S. Cases Unexplained.
BY ASSEN E. JORDANOFF
NEW YORK, Dec. 10—United States defense agencies are studying purported photographs of mysterious flying saucers taken in at least three European countries—Sweden, Yugoslavia and Italy—in an effort to determine whether the objects represent natural phenomena or frauds.
The Air Force's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, which handles investigations of all "unusual aerial phenomena," is analyzing the data and photographs from abroad.
The Air Force said last night that its analysis of scores of reports indicates that "a small percentage may be unexplained" and "we are unable to identify the objects as anything conventional."
They said further that they "are not developed or under development by the Air Force and that they are not space ships from another planet."
Many sightings, it explained, have been identified as conventional aircraft, balloons, reflections on windows, or objects existing as visual illusions, with some also explainable as natural phenomena.
Among the photographs being studied, it said, are those of a group of Sicilians seeing saucer-shaped objects over the town of Ascoli Satriano. These were obtained from a French source.
Sweden's defense ministry has disclosed that it has been investigating for two months an unidentified flying object that photographed over the southern part of that country. The object went northward and disappeared, an official statement has been made by Sweden.
In France, which has been the scene of more saucer reports than any other nation in Europe, the belief is developing that the sightings are the result of a Soviet or other foreign nation's operations to explore the possibilities of using these devices toward espionage, psychological warfare or even actual sabotage.
About 8,200 sightings have occurred in France alone during the last three years, and about 10,000,000 francs (about $28,750) have been spent by the French Government to bring these from outer space into its offices.
