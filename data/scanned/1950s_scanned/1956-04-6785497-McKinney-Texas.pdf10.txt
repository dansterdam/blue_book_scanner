Washington, D.C. ________________ 
Dear Sir:, ____ 
Attached hereto is a sketch of an unidentified flying object seen 
over this city, or apparently over it, on April 4,1956, Efforts 
have been made to identify the UFO, hence the delay of sending 
this report. 
The UFO was called to my attention, as I am the local Weather Pureau
observer, and I noted it at 3:15 P.M. on the afternoon of the date 
named above. It was apparently ten degrees northwest of zenith 
from McKinney, and I at first thought it as a ether radiosonde 
balloon. On calling the port Worth Weather Purse however, I learned
that there were no weather balloons in the air in this vicinity, I 
then decided it was far higher than at first I believed, and was 
a base of three miles for a tri ang1etion reading. The angeles 
showed little or no convergence and I ran another base line of 
the same length This latter trianglation showed, so fer as icould
detirmine with my old prismatic compass, a onvergence of about 
three degrees. This placed the UFO some 100,000 feet; up. With 
an eld rifle telescope I took several readings and finally worked 
the object eut as a substanding somewhere bear a minute of asec. aking 
it over 200 feet in diemater, ___ 
An amateur astronomer here placed his 200-power telescope on the UFO 
and drew a sketch of it for me. I 3am sending you a copy of this. 
The astronomer said it apparently was moving westward at about 100 
miles per hour, though the upper sir currents here were blowing from
the east far faster than that. I noted the UFO from 3:15 P.M. until 
dark. I saw it was in apposition with the planet Venua, which I sav 
while watching the UFO, end about seven: degrees due north of the 
planet. As the planet traveled westward the UFO kept its station 
at what we believe as seven degrees north. l am inclined to think 
that what the astronomemthsmghe movement, th 
ity, epterpreted as moments was the rotation of the earth, turning 
away from the UFO. 
Now, a most peculiar phenomenon connected with the UFO was the fact 
that it did not rotate all-afternoon. The raised bar around its 
midTig remain stationarydr"nught there were aerated appendages 
attached to the UFO måsteeraol it glistened in the sunlight like 
Aliteyf though Mr. Anderson and it looked as if it was "ud7w'e oF 
trenslucent,$1l¥¥ herwver hero I did not observe it was denis the 
spolseopa| and linreey power glasses to be weer able to 
clims, the UFO did not change its position with respect to the 
planet Venus at any time, and when it finally disappeared, about 
9:00 P.M., it was in the same relative position
