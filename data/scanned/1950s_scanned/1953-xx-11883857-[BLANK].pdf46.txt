10. Lighting Conditions: Day and night.

11. Radar: No return. In special cases radar response will
occasionally have to do with unusual clouds, and meteorological
phenomena such as described in Minnsart's book "Light and
and Color in the Open Air."

12. Other: One of the standard types is the "sundog." In this a large
luminous halo is seen around the sun with one to four
images of the sun placed along the halo circle at intervals
of 90 degrees. Another report often has to do with a bright
planet or even the moon shining through a light overcast.
Mirages reflections are said to occur frequently when
temperature inversions exists in the atmosphere. If an
optical phenomena is suspected, routine check of the
meteorological records should be made to establish whether
such inversions existed.
