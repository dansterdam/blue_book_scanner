LOUISIANA and reportedly has never made any observation of this nature before. The car used belonged to Mr. LeCompte. It was a 1957 CHEVROLET. It was checked for possible leads as to the cause of the observations. It possessed no exterior or interior objects which might account for the sightings. The road taken by the sources during their observations was re-traveled by the preparing officer during the same evening period in attempt to seek an explanation for what they had observed. The only observation which could be considered related to the un-identified object was the PLANET VENUS. It was located in the same general vicinity as the reported object and disappeared from view at about the same time as the object reported by the sources. VENUS was bright and gave off a glow similar to that described by the sources. However, the movements of the object observed by the sources cannot be explained or accounted for. Civic officials at MELTON, FOREST HILL and LeCOMPTE were contacted in regards to observations of this nature in the past. All gave negative reports. Some could give a possible explanation for the sighting. It is believed by the preparing officer that the object in question was the PLANET VENUS and that the imagination of the sources along with the movement of this vehicle in which they were traveling made it appear as if VENUS was gliding gracefully from one side of them to the other.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The names of the sources of this report should not be disseminated to any civilian agency without the approval of the preparing officer.
2. Every attempt was made to identify the size and shape of objects as outlined in AFR 200-2, but to no avail. For this reason it is believed that neither source could make a satisfactory estimate of size and shape of objects.
