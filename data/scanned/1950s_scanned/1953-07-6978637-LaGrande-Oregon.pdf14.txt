The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or drawing area where the witness could provide a visual representation of the observed object. The text in the document states:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Constant
b. Color - Constant, Silvery 

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the objects that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially indicate trails or vapor trails. Place the sketch so as to show the relative position in the sky where the object was seen.

The sketch area shows an oval or elliptical shape, which the witness likely used to represent the observed object.
