Pilot Sees Fireball Fall After Near Collision
DENVER, Oct. 16.â€”A former USAF pilot described here a strange air sighting that occurred when his commercial airliner narrowly missed a collision with a Russian satellite launched last week.
Lt. Cmdr. W. F. Norris, a pilot for a major U.S. airline, told how the pilot had to make a sharp turn to avoid a collision, and how the pilot then saw the flaming object surge past his plane.
Norris said they were flying over Utah near the Colorado-Utah border. He said they saw the flaming object pass their plane at about 17,000 feet. The object came driving out of the west, he said, and flashed by on the left side of the transpor
Norris said the object was traveling at about 600 miles per hour and was on a course for the United States heartland.
Headquarters of the North American Air Defense Command, contacted about the incident, said the pilot's report was being checked. Maj. Gen. George Weaver of Cleveland, Ohio, said the incident confirms earlier reports that a Russian satellite was being tracked by his command.
