There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from what seems to be a Project Blue Book report, containing text and the signature of Dr. J.A. Hynek, an Associate Director at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

The text reads:

However, although the evidence is not contradictory, and although it appears probable that the sighting was due to a bolide, the possibility of a guided missile or flare is, of course, not ruled out, but all available information does not indicate the presence of such at the time of sighting - 3:30 A.M.
