SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

TO: Commanding General, Air Defense Command

At approximately 1625, 25 August 1952, a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object occurred near Mendocino, California. The object was observed for about 20 minutes. It appeared to be cigar-shaped and larger than any known aircraft. The object appeared to be traveling at a very high speed and was periodically seen to change shape or color, appearing darker and lighter alternately, until it was lost from sight. It was definitely not any known aircraft. Its color, turning a darker and lighter red, until it was gone. 
My opinion is that this was definitely not any known aircraft. It was also observed to be too large or too small at various times to be a normal aircraft.
