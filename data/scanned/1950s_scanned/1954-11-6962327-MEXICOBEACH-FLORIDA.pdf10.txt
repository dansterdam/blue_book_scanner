The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document about a "Falling Star" that was reportedly caught by a woman named Mrs. Hodges. The text on the page describes the incident and the museum's interest in preserving the meteorite as a souvenir.

Go and Catch a Falling Star
When John Donoho raced to the Washington for scientific research. The museum, located in Tuscumbia, says it wants the meteorite for display research purposes. Mrs. Hodges, who obviously is a pretty woman, says she wants the meteorite merely to preserve it in the good old American fashion, as a souvenir to talk about when folks drop in.
She merely wants to preserve it. in the manner of the good Old American fashion, as a souvenir to talk about when folks drop in.
But the Museum demands now that they have possession of this meteorite, perhaps some kind of a compromise can be worked out whereby the Air Force can get a sample of the meteorite for its research, and Mrs. Hodges. in return, can keep what is left, which she might be willing to send it to the museum occasionally, say on alternates. But it must well be explained to her the law of the land; any meteorite or falling star shall belong to said person who first finds it.
