STATEMENT

At approximately 1945 hours, 16 June 1953, I was on duty as a control tower operator, at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. The sun had just set and I was scanning the sky, keeping track of air traffic in the area, when I noticed an elliptical-shaped light that appeared to be suspended in the WNW sky. At first sight, I thought this light might possibly be an unidentified flying object, then I reasoned that it may have been the sun drawing water. This object gave the appearance of a light shining on a cloud or smoke. It appeared to be approximately the size of a regular envelope held at arms length. I observed this light through binoculars but could not see any additional detail. I notified the ACCU Squadron at Lackland AF Base but they reported nothing on their scopes. ABTC Center, San Antonio, was also notified with the same results. After watching the light for approximately five minutes, it suddenly disappeared. I am firmly convinced that the light was caused by the reflection of the sun on a high cirrus cloud.

I certify that this statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:
