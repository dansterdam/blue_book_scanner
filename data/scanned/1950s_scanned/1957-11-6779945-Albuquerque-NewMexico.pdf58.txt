The image does not appear to contain a photograph. Instead, it shows a page from an old document that appears to be a table or data grid with rows and columns of information. The text in the image is too small and distorted to be legible, so I will not attempt to transcribe it. However, based on the context provided, this page seems to be part of a Project Blue Book report from 1957 related to an incident in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
