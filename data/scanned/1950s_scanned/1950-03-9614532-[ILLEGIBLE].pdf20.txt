According to the text, a business man who had seen a "flying saucer" in Mexico was quoted as saying he saw the remnants of an exploded "flying saucer" on a mountain near Mexico City. The Air Force in Washington said they had heard nothing about this, and that a Lt. Guy F. Deninick, sales manager for a powder company, refused to discuss the possibility of a "flying saucer" explosion and would only say he knew nothing about it.
