Yuma City, Arizona
4 February 1953

I. Description of Incident:
At 12:30 MST on the 3 February 1953, the U.S. Weather Bureau was searching for a 1,000 weather balloon with the aid of a theodolite when, at a distance of 10 to 12 miles, the observer observed an object at an elevation of 55-60 degrees. The size of the object consisted of one minute of arc.
The object appeared to be ascending straight up, then leveled off and at this point this object apparently went off due west at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

II. Discussion of Incident:
From the observer's previous experience in tracking balloons, it is concluded that these objects could not have been balloons especially since they were seen to move against the wind. There were aircraft in the area but the observer states he was aware of them and could not have confused them with the unknown objects. Because of the manner and the time of day, an astronomical solution must be ruled out.

III. Conclusion:
Unknown.
