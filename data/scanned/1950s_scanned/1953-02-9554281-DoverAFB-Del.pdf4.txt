There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which I will now transcribe:

"Sitting with 2d the Tower and elanning my directing the T-33 personnel were also told to observe the object. However, they informed me that the object had been there "all evening".

My next efforts were directed to obtaining an aircraft for a close look. The 487th Tac Ops Sq at Dover was the nearest unit was being used by the 487th at Niks Castle AFB. I contacted the "astronomer" at Niks Castle and supplied the necessary information. I was informed that two (2) aircraft were in the area and that they would be contacted immediately.

I then went to the tower and just the glass on the object. The object now was approximately 1/2 to 1 degree in size. The object appears to be red in color when observed through the glasses. It was diminishing in size, giving the impression of ...ent away from my viewpoint. 

While in the tower a Niks Castle jet called us and asked for our location of this object. The tower estimated the object to be due west of the field and seven miles. The pilot of the aircraft stated that it was further away than seven miles in about so he could not effectively investigate it from the air. It was heard at Dover too.

I continued to observe the object of night. It appeared to experience a slight change in brightness approximately every 15 minutes. I then left the tower.
