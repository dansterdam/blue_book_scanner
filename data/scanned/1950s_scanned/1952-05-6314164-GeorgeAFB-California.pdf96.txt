STATEMENT OF G. SMITH

Group:. I wish to make the following statement concerning observations made by observers:

1. The flight of the objects appeared to me to be erratic, like that of balloons or smoke. They were first observed in the west and moved in an easterly direction. They moved at varying speeds and in a random manner. Their color appeared to be light.

2. I sighted the objects at approximately 1945 hours and I saw them for approximately 15 to 20 seconds.

3. I spotted the objects from a tower which is about twenty (20) feet high. I was unable to make a close estimate of the objects with binoculars as they disappeared from view.

4. I sighted the objects from the tower of the small arms firing range. They moved in a southerly direction at an altitude estimated to be between 10 and 20 thousand feet.

5. I am nineteen (19) years old, an air policeman at George Air Force Base. In civilian life I worked as a mechanic. I completed the 10th grade at school and am married.

6. At the time that I sighted the objects the sky was clear and there was absolutely no wind.
