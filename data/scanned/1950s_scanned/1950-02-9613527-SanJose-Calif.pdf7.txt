Gentlemen-

I am enclosing a clipping from our San Jose paper about a "flying ice cream cone".

I wish to inform you that I have seen it, first when it appeared to be over our western mountain range coming from the west toward San Jose and this was when I looked out of my shop window at 5:57 p.m. on Tuesday.

It attracted my attention because it looked like a small comet hurrying slowly upward and going off.

At about 5:57 p.m. it flew almost over our street (First Street) at about 500 feet and cut out of my sight over San Jose. This was a small single motor plane which I could see very distinctly throwing off this red vapor from the tail like a comet's.

The plane was moving slowly with a slight noise of the propeller. I called downstairs to the store personnel and they went out and saw it also.

I hope this information may be of service to you.

Yours very truly,
San Jose, Calif.
