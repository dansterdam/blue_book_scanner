THE FLIGHT OF CARMEN

To Whom. this may concern: in the realm and profession of scientific inquiry, the following resume is a description of an unusual manifestation of aerial phenomena observed on the night of September 14, 1952 - this display of unusual lights and motion on the horizon is hereby submitted as follows:

On the night of September 14, 1952, a group of witnesses observed a strange phenomenon in the sky over Chihuahua, Mexico. 

At about 11:30 P.M. (basic time for Central Standard Time U.S.A.) this group observed a number of very brilliant lights in the southeasterly sky, and traveling at a terrific rate of speed. These lights seemed to be part of a coordinated and very brilliant formation of lights or spheres. 

On the celestial chart or map of this observation, this first group of lights is designated as "Group Number 1."

This group of lights was traveling at a very high rate of speed, on its course, without any deviation. The formation of these lights definitely appeared on its course without any deviation.

In this group of lights, it is estimated that there was at least twelve individual lights traveling in a definite line or formation.

When this line of lights passed the observers, they observed that the lights went out, one by one, as they moved across the sky. This observation leads to the conclusion that each light was self-illuminating, and that the failure of the lights was not due to any screening or obstacle in the path of the lights.
