The image appears to contain a Project 10073 Record Card, which is a form used to document UFO sightings as part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official study of unidentified flying objects. The form includes fields for recording details such as the date, location, type of observation, source, number of objects, and a brief summary of the sighting. In this particular case, the form indicates that the sighting occurred on 6 November 1957 near Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, and the observer reported seeing a light that was "moving at a fast rate of speed" at an estimated altitude of 50,000 feet. The form also notes that the observer sighted the object for a brief period.
