There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text describing a UFO sighting.

The text reads as follows:

On the night of August, on a clear night in August of 1959 my mother-in-law and I were on our way up the hill behind the school in Coeburn, Virginia from about 8:00 p.m. to about 10:30 p.m. When we first got there we parked and I got out of the car and looked around the sky. I saw a few stars and there was no moon. At about 8:30 p.m. I saw a large object come up over Sheeprpck Mountain followed in a few seconds by two more of the objects. They were moving at a very slow speed. The objects were about twice as bright as the largest star on a clear night. They rose steadily and began to follow the top of the mountain ridge. At one time the two of the objects got below the mountain on my side or the mountain. Then they went back to join the other object and traveled on down the mountain ridge. As I have already said, I left the scene before they were completely out of sight. I took the picture at about 9:00 p.m. when the objects were all over the top of the mountain. I used a Brownie camera.
