Major Friend - Mr. Intelligence Officer, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base.
Mr. - (Looks at credentials and smiles) Uh huh.
Major Friend - Generally describe what you saw Mr. and then I will ask some specific questions.
Mr. - I was coming home from Paynesviile, Ohio on Route #35. I saw this thing through the windshield of the car. It was traveling higher than normal highway traffic and was also traveling much faster than the normal highway traffic. There didn't seem to be any sound associated with the object as it passed over the car. There was a whirring sound like something to do with the headlights that I noticed. Then I changed my mind and drove home to get my wife. On my return there was no evidence of the object.
Major Friend - Was there only one object?
Mr. - It appeared to become two just as it went over the car.
Major Friend - What was the direction in which your car was headed?
Mr. - South - southeast.
Major Friend - Can you be sure there was an absence of sound or was it possible you couldn't hear it with the car going?
Mr. - I can't be sure.
Major Friend - How long was the object in sight?
Mr. - Approximately three (3) seconds.
Major Friend - How fast were you driving?
Mr. - Fifty miles per hour.
Major Friend - Did you apply brakes as soon as you saw the object?
Mr. - Yes.
Major Friend - Was the object in sight until the car came to a complete stop?
