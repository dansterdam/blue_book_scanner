OCR output:

On the 4th of February 1953 I was scheduled to ferry aircraft 53-1379, an F-84 G, from Convair Aircraft Company to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona.

While flying on airways from Blythe to Riverside by Blythe, California, I was at 19,000 feet and had the autopilot engaged. The time was 2550 hours Pacific Standard Time and as I was approximately 3 miles west of Brawley, California, flying I noticed a bright light some 2000 feet above me. The object appeared to be the same size as the star reflecting off of a metal surface. No vapor trail was visible from the object. It's relation to my aircraft showed the object was, for a period of 30 seconds, stationary in relation to my aircraft. after this sighting the object accelerated at a very rapid rate and disappeared within 3 seconds. The whole sighting lasted approximately 30 secs.
