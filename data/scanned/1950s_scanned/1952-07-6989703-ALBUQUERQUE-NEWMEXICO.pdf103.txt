This page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document does not contain any photographs. The image shows a typed report with various redactions, but no visual elements other than the text.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text found in the document:

On July 29th I was first and seen of the witnesses (or at least called to the place by the neighbors) to an unidentified flying object which was hovering over a residence, and we were pointing them out and two small children when they first came into view. It was a very large object, generally what to be called saucer-shaped, I just saw it hover over the door when it came. But, said he lock those of him so I stooped the vapor trails and last object to view the vapor trails and last on the ground and to saw vapor trails.

It was a greyish color, and did a double waving motion and then was obscured by the trees below, but it came to above the trees and then disappeared below the trees and left "no visible smoke or vapor trails. It is possible that it was a jet that was flying around and came suddenly. 

I couldn't tell the shape. It was just an object and was shiny and looked about the size of a jet.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 31st day of July 1952.
