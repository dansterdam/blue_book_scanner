22. In the following sketch, imagine your eye at the point shown. Place an 
"A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon 
when you first saw it. Place a "B" to show where it was when you last saw it.

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was 
when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place 
an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the trajectory of an object with points "A" and "B" to mark the starting and ending positions above a horizontal line labeled "Horizon," with "Your eye" indicated as the observation point.

The second sketch also shows the trajectory of an object from "A" to "B," but this time the trajectory is a straight vertical line descending behind a representation of trees and the horizon, again with "Your eye" observing from the left.

The third sketch illustrates a path marked by "A" and "B," with a text note stating it traveled on a slight arc, laid out over a compass-like representation with "EAST" at the top, "WEST" at the bottom, and the end points of the arc labeled "SOUTH" and "NORTH" respectively.
