The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an Air Intelligence Information Report related to Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document:

AF FORM 112—PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(1) Date and Time of Observation: 23 Jan. 1953
(2) Sighting Report: Oval, like a large burning flare, white to pale-red. 
(3) Manner of Disappearance: Went straight up, then moved rapidly westward, then seemed to turn and move north for several minutes before disappearing from view.
(4) Position of Observer(s): Y744 from view.
(5) Time of Observation: 25 January 1953, for 3 minutes (intermittently).
(6) Visual Observation: Bright, like a bright star, low on southwestern horizon.
(7) Airplane(s) or Astronomical Object(s) Unrelated: 7959A about 15' Continental Divide, New Mexico.
(8) Reliability considered excellent. (4/5 points, 4/5 color).
(9) Weather: High thin overcast, lower scattered clouds. Wind from 270° at 39 knots. Temperature 15-20°C. Visibility 15,000 feet.
(10) Radar Observation: Concurrently with visual observation.
(11) (9) and (10) all negative.
COMMENTS of Reporting Officer: Negative.
COMMENTS of Approving Officer: Negative.

Weather balloons are released daily at 0700Z (2000 MST) at points located near the Continental Divide in New Mexico. On 23 and 25 January 1953, 315 Springdale, east and 101 Wilcox, west, both had balloon releases on these dates. This might account for the sighting, since the balloon lightly illuminated would have the appearance described. This type of balloon would be visible only a short time as it ascended rapidly, then would disappear from view as it got beyond visual range.

The information given by the observer was such that the object sighted was less than a weather balloon under normal circumstances, yet the balloon could not be under normal circumstances be seen to ascend rapidly and move quickly over the horizon as described. The balloon could not under normal circumstances be seen as a large flare-like object for 3 minutes, and the radar observation was negative.
