TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On the afternoon of October 12, 1959, I was at my residence on Georgia...

At approximately 3 o'clock in the afternoon of this date, I began moving my lawn in a usual way. After I had mowed for some time, I came across strange streaks extending from an east to west direction across the grassy portions of my lawn...

After looking to the lawn for some moments, I decided that it was a type of mold or fungus...

After moving the entire section, I noticed that the coloring changed and became light in color and had shriveled up.

There I learned that some type of mold or fungus had attacked something on my lawn. I could see no insect life and the appearance of this stuff was as if someone had sprayed a poison on it.

Returning home at sundown, my wife and I went to the spot in the yard and I pointed out where the strange coloring had completely disappeared, except for the dead grass being still distinguishable by the grass being flat and brown.

My wife stated that when she went to work at approximately 7:00 o'clock, the same strange streaks she saw were still there. She pointed out the small amount of gray remaining at the end of her finger which was a mighty suspicious residue on her finger.
