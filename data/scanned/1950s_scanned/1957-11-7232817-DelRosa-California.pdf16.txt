AJ2 - U.S. COAST GUARD, NOV 7
A COAST GUARD COMMANDER REPORTED THAT A STRANGE OBJECT "HOVERED" OVER THE COAST GUARD COMMANDER REPORTED
THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A GALI..ON GAS TANK. IT WAS
OBSERVED ---
WARING, SKIPPER OF THE CUTTER, SAID THE OBJECT
APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A CLOUD BANK AT ABOUT 2,000 FEET.
WARING SAID IT WAS VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE ONLY WHEN IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN
A GREAT ARC AS IF IT WAS GOING IN AND OUT OF A CLOUD BANK. HE SAID IT APPEARED
STRONG. WARING ESTIMATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS GOING AT A SPEED OF 1,000
MILES PER HOUR. COMMANDER J. N. SCHRADER, SEARCH AND RESCUE OFFICER, SAID HE
OBSERVED TRAILS OF VISIBILITY BEHIND THE OBJECT. WARING SAID VISITORS
LEANED TOWARD HIM IN A RADIO ROOM IN THE NEW SHORE STATION AND SAID "THE
SEBAGO'S POSITRON." WARING SAID HE BROADCAST THE MYSTERY, WARING SAID THE MYSTERY MISSILE AROUSED AS THEY HAD NO CONFIDENCE THAT THERE HAD
BEEN AN ACTUAL SIGHTING. WARING SAID IT WAS JUST A PERSONAL OPINION THAT THE MYSTERY LIGHT
BORE NO RELATION TO THE CUSTER. HE SAID THE STORY OF THE REPORT FROM THE SEBAGO
HAD GONE OVER NATIONAL PUBLICATIONS THAT IT WAS HIGH SPEED AND UNUSUAL SPEED
FROM THE SEBAGO. WARING SAID THAT A NORTH-SOUTH TRACKER HAD PLOTTED THE OBJECT ON RADAR FIRST
TRACKING IT AT ABOUT 1,000 FEET AND ESTIMATED THE ALTITUDE REACHED TO ABOUT 23,000 FEET. WARING SAID THEY TRACKED THE OBJECT AND LATER SAW A BRILLIANT FLASH ACROSS THE SKY AT THE SPOT WHERE THE OBJECT MUST HAVE BEEN. HE TRACKED
IT GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY AND THEN SAW IT, KIRK SAID, "IT BEGAN
MOVING AND DISAPPEARED INTO A CLOUD BANK."
THERE WAS NO TRAIL, AND IT MOVED AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED.
OFFICER DISCOUNTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS A METEOR BECAUSE
THERE WAS NO TRAIL, AND IT MOVED IN A HORIZONTAL RATHER THAN A VERTICAL MOTION
ACROSS THE SKY.
