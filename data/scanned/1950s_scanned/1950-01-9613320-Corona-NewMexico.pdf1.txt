11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS

When first sighted it was at 45 deg. Object descended at 
approximately 60 deg angle from horizon to a position just above 
horizon caused by the mountain range where it leveled out and 
traveled approximately 10 deg East, at which time it dropped 
behind the mountain range out of sight. First appearance of obj 
was yellowish white. Object appeared to be more orange than 
originally with a trail of flame projecting out to its rear op-
posite the direction it was traveling. When it reached position 
where it leveled out it became a bright blue-green in color and 
remained that color until it passed out of sight. Round ball shaped.
