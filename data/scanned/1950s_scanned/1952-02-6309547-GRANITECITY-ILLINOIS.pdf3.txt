SUBJECT: Report of Incident

1. The following are the known facts concerning an unidentified "target" observed by personnel of the 8903D Radar Bomb Scoring Group, stationed at Granite City, Illinois on the night of 13 February 1952 during the conduct of radar bomb scoring mission.

a. Aircraft B925 was cleared from the IP of Jacksonville, Illinois, pressure altitude of 29,000 feet at a range of about 75 miles from the 8903D radar site. The B925 sites observed at the station for about 2230 hours LST.

b. Ground-to-air radar contact was established with a "target" over the IP at which time the range and azimuth of the "target" appeared on the PPI scope. The "target" proceeded northward on a straight course at a speed estimated as reported by the cleared aircraft.

c. The "target" was tracked in automatic tracking at about forty miles from the radar site, a continuous check was possible until at an altitude of 12,000 feet the "target" disappeared from the radar scope. It was assumed that the X-2 altitude doubler circuit was inoperative.

d. The "target" continued to progress at a normal ground speed and according to the radar graph until a maneuvering turn of approximately twenty miles from the site, except for the questionable altitude readings.

e. At about twenty miles from the site, the "target" increased its speed and turned to a new heading of about 197 degrees and began descending.

f. During the time the plotting equipment was switched from the main scale (1:250,000) to the plotting scale (1:120,000) per S.O.P, and the "target" disappeared from the radar scope.
