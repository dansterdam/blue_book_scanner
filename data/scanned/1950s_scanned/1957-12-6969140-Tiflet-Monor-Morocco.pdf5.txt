INFORMATION REPORT
OPREP FORM 56-63 (5-48)

CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED

REPORT NO.: 1-58

DATE: 9 December 57

After another minute or two, the light descended rapidly towards the earth, describing an arc as in Fig. (2). This movement was very rapid and definite. The thicker end of the light was pointing downwards and while the lighter end rose slightly, the light appeared to drop approximately 10 degrees. At this point, the light was either a meteorite or a returning Soviet satellite. At this point, a row of three blobs was observed.

When the view was again clear, the light had regained its former altitude, was in a horizontal position, and appeared to be heading in the same direction as before. However, its speed had increased and it was possible to determine the bearing but not the distance. The light gradually became dimmer and gradually faded from view. This gave the impression of movement straight away from the observer. However, this disappearance may well have been due to lack of reflected sunlight as the "object" entered the earth's shadow. Time of disappearance approximately 17/20 seconds.
