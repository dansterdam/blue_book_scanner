Page 2 N. L. Flying Objects.
UNCLASSIFIED

Mr. [redacted] observed that, in the case of this flight, an irregularly shaped yellow light appeared in the rear. The formation included three circular discs, and the are alleged to have swerved or pulsated in the direction of the object.

Mr. [redacted] stated that this flight, and described it as a group of individually distinct yellow objects, approximately twelve in number, traveling in formation at an extremely high velocity, each with an angular subtense that would be the equivalent of a small-caliber rifle bullet at a distance of thirty feet.

Mr. [redacted] described this flight as having the appearance of a group of from twelve to fifteen pale objects in the shape of a half moon, varying in brightness, and following a definite formation.

The two other observers, Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted], agreed to the above descriptions in their essential details.

The startling characteristics of this one flight made calm observation difficult to impossible.

The members of this group have been a local of ten University Professors who have been studying these objects between August 25 and about November 1, 1951.
