AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
T/O: 237th ACAW GROUP, AND 622
D/T: APO: 94
REFERENCE also IR 3-53, 517th ACW Group; and IR 1-53, IR 2-53, IR 3-53 from 22nd ACWG Group.
This report contains "a perusal with a series of sightings reported on 23 Feb 53 which ranged the Western part of Japan from Kushiu to Honshu". The reports have been reasonably well explained by further investigation on the part of personnel concerned. It indicates that:
- IR 3-53 (report on 3th 20) indicates object alleged to be a star
- IR 3-53 (report on 3th 20) suggests the possibility that a brilliant light may have been the planet Venus
- IR 1-53 (report on 3th 7), which suggests the possibility that a luminous glowing object may have been an aircraft, has been explained by further investigation as the result of an optical illusion caused by certain atmospheric conditions
- IR 3-53 (report on 5th 20) was supplemented by an additional late report from another agency which stated that the object sighted was determined upon further investigation to have been a meteor.
The weather section at this Headquarters confirms the legitimacy of initial explanations VENTS as specific cases, could have caused the phenomenon related to these sightings.
This Headquarters believes that, in all probability, sites 3 and 17 also may have seen VENTS or a bright star.
