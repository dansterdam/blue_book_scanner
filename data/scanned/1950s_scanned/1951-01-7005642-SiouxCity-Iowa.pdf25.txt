Startling Performance of Strange Plane Over City Related by Fliers
Airline Pilot, Air Guard Captain Tell of Amazing Speed
Reports grew today of a startling performance by a strange plane over the city Saturday. The plane, which was moving at a high rate of speed, was observed by several persons, including Captain Richard L. Keith of the Iowa air guard and First Officer Donald H. Schuck of Central Airlines.
Captain Keith said the plane was first spotted by him and Schuck shortly after 1 p.m. Saturday as it passed over the airport at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet.
"We were on the ground at the time," Keith said, "and we both saw the plane go over. It was moving at a terrific rate of speed - much faster than any jet plane I've ever seen. I'd say it was traveling at least 1,500 miles an hour."
Keith said the plane disappeared in a northeasterly direction. A few minutes later, he said, it was spotted again, this time over the downtown area, where it was seen by several other persons.
Robert McNeely, Sioux City, said he saw the plane as it passed over the downtown section. "It was traveling at a terrific rate of speed," he reported. "It appeared to be silvery in color and was going in a northeasterly direction. I'd estimate its altitude at about 3,000 feet."
The plans described by the fliers and other observers were similar to reports received by the air force of "flying saucers" and other strange aerial phenomena.
At the Sioux City air base, it was stated that "we have no knowledge of any high-speed aircraft in this area at the time the plane was reported seen."
