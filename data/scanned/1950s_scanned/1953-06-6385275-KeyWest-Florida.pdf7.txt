U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)

On June 19, 1953, at 1913, EST, a skiff was sitting in a storm of 40-knot winds and close to anchor on the Bahia Honda, Florida area., 24°44' North Latitude, 81°23' West Longitude. The skiff's operator, , observed a strange light descending at a 45-degree angle at a speed estimated to be about 1000 mph. The light remained stationary approximately 30 seconds, then shot straight up at a speed estimated to be approximately 1500 mph. The skiff's operator stated that the light was about the size of a half-moon and was a greenish-white color, with a greenish-yellow trail. After about 2 seconds, the light went off for about 2 seconds, then illuminated again for 3 seconds, made a 90-degree turn, and disappeared behind a cloud bank.

There were no ships or anything showing in the stream, and not even a ripple. There was no noise of any kind, and indeed, no skiff in any place near us. There was no moonlight. The night was partly cloudy. The sea was running more or less due east, and a light breeze approximately 10 mph was blowing from the WNW. The light was observed through 7 x 50 binoculars. Estimated height, 8000 ft. The size was similar to that of a half-moon. At the end of the maneuver, the scene was illuminated for approximately 2 more seconds and then became dark.
