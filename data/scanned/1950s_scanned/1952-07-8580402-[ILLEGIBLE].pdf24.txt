ACCORDING TO HER OBSERVATION THIS PLANE APPEARED TO BE AT A HIGHER ALTITUDE THAN THE LIGHTS.

LT STRONG WAS ABOUT ONE (1) MILE CLOSER TO THE INITIAL "BURST" OF LIGHTS THAN WAS CAPTAIN DOUGHTY. LIEUTENANT STRONG'S OBSERVATION AND DESCRIPTION THEREOF APPEARS TO BE MORE COMPLETE AND DETAILED THAN CAPTAIN DOUGHTY'S OBSERVATION.
