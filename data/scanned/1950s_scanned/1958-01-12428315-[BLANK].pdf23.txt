The image contains a page from an old UFO report document with a photograph of two dark objects in the sky. The text in the document discusses the "Enigma of the Skies" and mentions a television program called "The Circle Theatre" that will be airing a story about "the riddle of the Flying Saucers." The text poses several questions about the nature and origin of these "Flying Saucers," including whether they are real or imaginary, and whether they are secret weapons or spacecraft from other planets.

UFO: THE ENIGMA OF THE SKIES
FADE IN: CLOCK (SET 6 SEC. BEFORE 9:30) 
SUPER: EDWARDS
EDWARDS:
Good evening everybody, coast to coast. This is Douglas Edwards.
Tonight the Circle Theatre sees after a most unusual story: the riddle of the Flying Saucers. 
Because of the nature of the problem ... and the controversy involved ... we will depart from our usual format. Instead of dramatizing an adventure, we will share one. 
Instead of merely observing, we ask you to participate. Are UFO ...Unidentified Flying Objects real or imaginary?
If these so-called Flying Saucers are real ... where do they come from? Are they secret weapons being tested by our own or foreign governments ... or are they ... as many believe ... spacecraft from other planets, invading our atmosphere, observing life on earth?
