STATEMENT

1 April 1953

I was scheduled to fly the night of 31 March 1953, in an F-94 aircraft. I took off from Kisarazu, Tokyo, and near Tateyama, Choshi, I sighted and turned toward an object. The object was very large and brilliant and seemed to be approaching me. The object was at my six o'clock position at a range of approximately 10-12 miles and seemed to be flying at an altitude of 18,000 to 20,000 feet. The object appeared to be metallic and the light was very bright and seemed to be pulsating. I closed to within about 2 miles of the object at which time it suddenly accelerated and climbed out of sight, traveling at an estimated speed of 1200-1500 mph. After the object had climbed to an altitude above the horizon, bearing 330 degrees magnetic, it seemed to disappear and reappear several times. The horizon was very bright and no other stars were discernible until about 20 degrees above the horizon. I am convinced that what I saw was not a star or any other known aircraft. The object was definitely not reflecting sunlight, as it was observed at night. I must admit that I am puzzled as to the identity of the object. There were no other lights or objects observed, and I have no explanation for what I saw.
