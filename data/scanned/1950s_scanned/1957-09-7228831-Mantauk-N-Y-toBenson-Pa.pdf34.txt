MR. ****:

(Paraphrased) Reference inquiries regarding Martha's Vineyard sights indicated by General W.J. Hull. Particulars are in a brief report not entirely correct. This incident was made observer across tracks.

Track was picked up originally by two stations in New York. Unit contact was at Montauk, N.Y. However, unit units along line (paraphrased) to 5 were alerted. These units did not have any confirmations.

Sic - 102 aircraft were scrambled from various bases in Michigan and Illinois. No conclusion was reached. Nothing but normal activity.

A radar team was set up to study this incident, including the radar investigating team that was in the original radar unit that sighted the track closely identical. On 25 September. It appeared. They reappeared when the previous channel was broken. 

A check of the second radar unit disclosed that there were two GGAC units that the same match dropped targets. It was also determined that the targets detection and characteristics of other comparable units were also checked by this investigation. Conclusion:

a. The information and data studied from all pertinent units appeared to be understood and in fact corroborative to each other.

b. It is, therefore, difficult if not impossible to draw any valid conclusions, although there is no compelling reason indications that the checks were invalid.

A full report will be on your desk upon return.
