10. 25 June 1952, Japan/Korea area.
This is not a single report but a collection of 13 similar reports which occurred in 1951 and 1952. No adequate explanation has been given by the radar experts for any of them and therefore I can not as yet as any judgement as to their cause. This is one simply for the radar experts.

11. 22 July 1952, Maxwell, Texas.
Evaluation as possible meteor is not tenable if object was seen to climb from 2,000 feet to 14,000 feet, then to hover, then to drop 5,000 feet. It was reported by four air police and a staff sergeant. This is clearly a case which should have been followed up, but proper classification: insufficient followup, or insufficient information. 

12. 22 July 1952, Uvalde, Texas.
This is an interesting case, with two witnesses. The weather observer for Trans-Texas Airways was thoroughly familiar with planes, weather balloons, satellites, etc. He observed an object covered as an arc of approximately 100 degrees at an estimated distance of 2 miles. It was observed to have a gyrating movement. No sound. Object seemed to climb higher every few seconds and move from in front of a cumulus cloud to 3/4 back of it, thus giving some estimate of distance. Object observed for several minutes. It is too bad that this case had not been more thoroughly investigated since there were two adult witnesses and one is carried as unknown. I have rated it 12 of 15 of reliability.

13. 24 July 1952, Carson Sink, Nevada.
Sighting just three to four seconds in duration, too short a time for accurate identification. However, two trained Air Force colonels flying a B25 at 11,000 feet saw two qualified witnesses, case must be considered as unidentified (limited data).

14. 28 December 1953, Marysville, California. 
A onesightings case even though observed by a fairly qualified witness it is very strange that there were no other witnesses since the sighting occurred over a populated area.
