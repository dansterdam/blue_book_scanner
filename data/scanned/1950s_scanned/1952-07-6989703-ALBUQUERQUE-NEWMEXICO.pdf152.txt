There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed document describing a sighting of a "flying saucer" over Miami Beach, Florida.

From The Miami Daily News 30 July 52

Copy of cutliness, which did not reproduce well:

Four views of the "flying saucer" that flashed over Miami Beach last night are reproduced here from the film taken by Marine Pfc. Ralph C. Mayher. The film was released without comment by Third Marine Air Wing officials. Miami Daily News artists did not retouch the "saucer" itself, which loses some detail in reproduction, but did retouch scratches on the film and designated the object with arrows. 

The photos show the "orange, yellowish object" was bowl-shaped with a projection on top. It speedily vanished, after being watched for more than three minutes.
