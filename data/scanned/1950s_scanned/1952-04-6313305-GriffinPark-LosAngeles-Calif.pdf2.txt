1. Mr. ********* residing at **********, Downey, California, visited this Headquarters today and delivered three photographs that he thought might be of interest to the Air Force. They were taken showing unusual scenes and when developed, the one showed objects in the sky that were apparently unidentified.

2. Mr. ********* is aware of the fact that the developing process might have brought about an imperfection, but believes the objects viewed were real and that a detailed analysis by technical representatives would be appropriate. Recent issues of Life Magazine showing pictures of so-called "flying saucers" prompted him to submit his thoughts.

3. The following information was obtained from Mr. ********* with regard to these photographs:

a. Mr. ********* is in business for himself - selling building supplies and hardware. He has no connection with any contractor doing business with the Air Force.

b. His phone number is ***-******.

The pictures were taken from Griffith Park Planetarium, Griffith Park, Los Angeles, California on 20 April 1952, about an hour after sunset.
