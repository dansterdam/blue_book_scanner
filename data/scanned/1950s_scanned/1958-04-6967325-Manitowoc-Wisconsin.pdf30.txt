There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document page, likely from a Project Blue Book UFO report. I will now proceed to OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and transcribe the text found in the document:

Could you see any features or lit? No, it seemed to be at an even keel. As it came down it was a dim white light.
Could you see any porthole?
Any windows?
Was the object moving when I saw it?
Do you rotate like that?
It seemed to tumble.
Was there a tail on it like a tail or a comet?
No, it could see.
At times it seemed to trail or sparks at any time?
Did it seem to have any exhaust like that of jet airplanes?
A distant object moving swiftly, appear to come down slowly, behind clouds or trees to trees. I watched as it came down. You could hardly see it come down.
Did you hear any sounds?
In what direction did these objects appear from you?
Well, I usually watch them that direction this afternoon.
Then a radio announcement came on. One of the sisters heard it and said there was a report of an unidentified flying object near.
You were looking for it early this morning.
On you have any number of times.
Sister Clotus was there for a lecture. She was telling us all about it.
How high above the horizon would you say it was?
I'm not a good judge of distance. I would say --
The were higher than the trees.
You'd say 1,200 ft?
About that. Sisters could think. It could be higher too.
When you first noticed them, were there 2 of them, two together?
They were pretty close together, about the same distance apart and about so far.
