Dear Mr. ******,

We are in receipt of your letter dated 21 October 1958, in which you report an unidentified object sighted by your father, and others.

The information which you have submitted is very limited in nature, and insufficient upon which to base a firm conclusion.

Therefore, it would be appreciated if you would have your father and one man from each of the other boats fill in the attached questionnaires in as much detail as possible. Upon completion, please return the forms to this Center in the enclosed envelopes.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

3 Incls
