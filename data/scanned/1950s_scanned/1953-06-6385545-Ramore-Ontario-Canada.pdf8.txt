HEADQUARTERS
932ND AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON
Ramore, Ontario, Canada

2 July 1953

STATEMENT

At about 2345 hours on the 30th of June 1953 while on duty as 
Squadron Charge of Quarters my attention was called by personnel 
on duty at the Radar Site to view an unidentified object. I viewed
an elliptical object of a reddish orange nature hovering over the
horizon approximately north of the domestic site. Within a half hour I 
did not seem possible for the moon to travel that great a distance
in that short a time so what ever I viewed could not have been the
moon.
