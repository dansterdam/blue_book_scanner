ON the night of Cactober 27, 1952 at approximately 2135Z, a bright object was observed in the vicinity of Kyushu Island, Japan. The object was first seen at about 2135Z while the observer was proceeding to the vicinity of Sasebo, Kyushu for a training flight. The object appeared to be round and quite bright, maneuvering erratically before around his vicinity. At approximately 2140Z the object took on a pillar or cigar shape, and at this time it appeared to be approximately 10 miles from the observer. The object then extended outward into 2 smaller lights, then back into the original shape. This was repeated several times in rapid succession, and it was impossible to judge the size or altitude of the object. The speed was fantastic and the object suddenly disappeared,only to reappear again in the same area. No sound was heard and it left no trail. To the best of the observer's knowledge, there was no trail, exhaust or burning. The object disappeared, reappeared, and disappeared again. It seemed to be coming toward this station, do not know what it was.

Just I spotted it with a pair of 7/50 binoculars while I was standing guard. The flight path of the object took it approximately 10 miles away, and I continued to observe it until it disappeared from view, which was about 2-3 minutes later. The object appeared to be round and quite bright, maneuvering erratically, and changing shape several times. The speed was fantastic and the object suddenly disappeared, only to reappear again in the same area. No sound was heard and it left no trail. To the best of the observer's knowledge, there was no trail, exhaust or burning.

The above report is a statement of what I saw on the night of October 27, 1952 while on duty here at Sebuli/Japan D/F.
