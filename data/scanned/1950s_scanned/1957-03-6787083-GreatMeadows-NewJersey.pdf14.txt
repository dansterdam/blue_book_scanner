Text from the document:

"I saw the object for about an hour and a half at the time from New York City. I saw it while I was standing in the city. As this instance when I returned from my work to the home of my husband at the time. I called the people in Fuller detail when I joined him at 7:30 that evening standing in the city. As this the instance's light that evening indicated its account and answered many questions which would bring back the some of them at the presence of M.S. at 13 West Street, N.Y.C. I told my students / to several other friends in the next three days (March 7, 8 and 9) ,but I did no formal report to any authorities, pending a final verdict. The evening of March 9, my husband and I were visited by two persons, whose identity, circumstances with which they claimed some connection with us, interesting us. But [REDACTED] and his wife were 'away for a few days, resting', according to the woman who answered their telephone. She was unwilling to get in touch with the persons by long-distance phone unless we were to tell her who we were. This we did not do, and we have not subsequently heard from them."
