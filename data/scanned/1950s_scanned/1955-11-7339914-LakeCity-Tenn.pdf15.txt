III. SUBJECT'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCES observed two objects from approximately 5:30 P.M. 29 November 55 until an observation of 29:30 from the horizon. The objects were observed at 2122:35, Nov 55 and was "fairly bright." They maintained a high rate of speed and appeared to gain or lose elevation occasionally. The objects emitted a light, luminous, oscillating or flashing and approximately 35-foot section, and were silver and yellow in color, consistent with lighted objects. They did not change brilliance or color and were easily seen, though rather small against the sky. During the observation, Subject lost sight of the objects temporarily, but reacquired them shortly thereafter. The objects appeared to be solid. The sighting ended when they moved away in a high speed above the horizon. SOURCES had never previously witnessed such a sighting.
