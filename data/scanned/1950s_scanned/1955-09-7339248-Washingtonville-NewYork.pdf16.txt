UNCLASSIFIED (SECURITY INFORMATION when filled in)

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

ORIGINATING AGENCY: Det 3, 4602d AISS
REPORT NO.: D3-UFCB-5-55
PART SIX
PAGE 12 OF 13 PAGES

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the object sighted by the different groups of observers was possibly a celestial phenomenon.
2. The description of this object follows along the description of a fireball which explodes at the end of its flight.
3. It is believed that the report as given by the crew was in error as pertains to the distance of the object.
4. Tiny stated that the object appeared one-half to one mile directly ahead of them. USCO for a moment, headed in a southwesterly direction at a distance of 32 seconds disappeared off their left wing tip. It is believed that this distance can be discounted in view of the fact that FIL A/L over Albany, NY and Flt 3 approximately 10 miles north of their position and in cumulus clouds, also reported that the object at the same time was very much closer and approximately directly under them.
5. In the phenomenon of a fireball the estimate of the distance of the object can be misleading.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was probably caused by a fireball exploding in the atmosphere.
