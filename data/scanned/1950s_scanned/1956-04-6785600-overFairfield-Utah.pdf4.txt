Transcribing the text in the document:

1. It states that the object observed was more horizontal than vertical with no regular pattern. The speed would be estimated to be very rapid and irregular, one which no aircraft could accomplish. The object did not disappear until it penetrated the overcast into Salt Lake City Radio. The object was in my sight for approximately 25 minutes.

2. The sighting was part of Serial 53-2057 as 37,000 feet on a heading of 290 degrees at an indicated air speed of 250 k. Home station is Hillafb.

3. The light conditions were between the hours of 1950 to 2015 EST. The light conditions were excellent for sighting. It was a clear night. I was 1,000 feet on top and the object was several thousand feet very brilliant. It was however night and distances are very hard to accurately establish.

4. The object was oval-shaped and illuminated. Then from a distance the object became dimmer, then brighter again with a reading of 250 degrees and the object was first sighted 20 minutes out of Fairfield and lasting 10 minutes and went out from a reading of 313 degrees inbound to Salt Lake City and into the overcast.
