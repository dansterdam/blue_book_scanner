Statement of Observer

1. The single object that I observed appeared to be a full-color, brilliant light. It seemed to be moving like an airplane, but was difficult to determine because of the fast speed. It seemed on several occasions to be moving like an airplane, but was difficult to determine because of the fast speed. It seemed on several occasions to be zig-zagging or oscillating, and the size was difficult to determine. I estimate the size to have been from 2,000 to 2,500 feet in diameter. I heard no sound from the object.

2. I saw the object at 1750 hours on the date indicated. It was in sight for about 15 seconds.

3. Observation was made by naked eye from the ground.

4. I was on the east side of George Air Force Base when I sighted the object. It was vertically overhead and proceeded southward at 25,000 to 28,000 feet altitude.

5. I have a high school education and am taking instruction in civilian flying.

6. Visibility was good, skies were clear and there was little wind in the area.

7. There were no special conditions, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

8. There was no physical evidence, fragments, photographs, etc., of the sighting.
