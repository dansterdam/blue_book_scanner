AIR FORCE
PATROL SQUADRON TWENTY SIX

DARK OBJECT (I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT)
(NO LIGHTS AT ALL
VERY DARK â€¢ NO EXHAUST

SILHOUETTE

WE SAW THIS BEFORE DARK, 
AGAINST THE SKY FEDGE    JUT ABOVE EARTHS SURFACE
IF ANYTHING THERE SPACED WIDER AS THIS SHOWS
BRIGHT WHITE
LIGHTS
I CANNOT ESTMATE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN LIGHTS AND I DO NOT KNOW THE SIZE OR BRILLANCE OF THEM

AFTER DUSK ALL WE COULD SEE WAS THE LIGHTS (NO COLORED LHTS) 
STEADY, THEY DID NOT SEEM TO SEPARATE. I AM INCLINED TO TAN THAT THE LIGHTS WERE ON THE SAME OBJECT.
THERE WAS NO DEFINITE PATTERN TO WHITE LIGHTS.
