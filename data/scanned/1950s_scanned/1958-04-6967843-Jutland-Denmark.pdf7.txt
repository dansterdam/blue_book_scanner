Release of UFO Information

SAFIS-3, Major Fackler

23 JUN 1970

A/FCIL-143

A1c4/7/Sgt J.O. Bolliew/m/59216

1. A thorough check of our files indicates that the two sightings referenced by S/Sgt █████ were not received by this office and no findings are available for release.

2. Our interpretation of S/Sgt █████'s request is that he be given permission to release the information concerning the two sightings for civilian analysis - not the findings of analyses made by this office.

3. Reference paragraph 2 of G██████ letter. Paragraph III, AFR 200-2 means exactly what it says. It, repeat, it, to AF personnel, other than those of the CIS, or those so directed, will contact private individuals concerning UFO cases. A military person, even in an unofficial interview, might still be quoted, and when he is quoted his statements are usually construed to be those of the Air Force.
