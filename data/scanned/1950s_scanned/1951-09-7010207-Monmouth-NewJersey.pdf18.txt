1. On 10 September 1951, an AN/MPG-1 radar set picked up a fast moving low flying object (exact altitude undetermined) at approximately 1140 hours northeast from this headquarters, at a range of approximately 27,000 yards. The target appeared to follow the coast line, the changing it is range only slightly all the while, at such a speed as to necessitate continuous tracking. The object was too fast to be tracked by SCR-584 radar, but in this case was too slow to be followed intensively. The target was lost to the Northwest at a range of about 15,000 yards.

This target also presented an unusually strong return for a large aircraft being operational in this locality. Several maneuvers beyond the normal flight patterns were observed. The observer concluded that it could not be a ship after he observed its extreme speed.

2. On 10 September 1951, 1515 hours, an SCR-584, serial number 133 tracked a target which moved about 35 miles in 15 minutes, giving an average speed of approximately 135 miles per minute or approximately 8,100 mph. (altitude approx. 93,000 ft.)

3. On 11 September 1951, 1030 hours, two SCR-584's serial numbers 217 and 215 picked up the same target northwest at an elevation of 1 degree 10 minutes and a range of 31,000 ft. The sets tracked it manually in a smooth and steady manner to a maximum rate altitude 31,000 ft) The sets tracked it automatically in a smooth and steady manner at an approximate speed of 700 mph. In this case however, both sets found it impossible to track the target in order to hold it accurately. The target was tracked in order to demonstrate the operators' ability to track a target, but the extreme speed of the aircraft made this impossible due to the limitation of the radar units. The operators, however, the echo signal occasionally fell off to a low or normal return volume. This change in signal indicated a possibly high and fast maneuver.

4. On 11 September 1951, at about 1330 a target was picked up on an SCR-584 radar set. Serial number 215, The target was approximately 10,000 yards at an elevation of 1 degree 45 minutes. This also presented an unusual maneuverability. The target ranged in, as close as 6,000 yards and then moved out as far as 10,000 yards. The operators concluded that the object could not be a normal jet aircraft.
