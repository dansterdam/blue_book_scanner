This document does not contain any photographs. It is an analysis of photographic material, describing the visual study of reprints in both cinema projection and frame-by-frame examination using a recording device. The text discusses the quality and characteristics of the reprints, including their brightness, sharpness, and the apparent visual distortions. The document also mentions the use of an overlay celluloid to trace the relative motion of objects in the images. Additionally, it references the recording of azimuth and altitude data of the mid-point on the line of the objects under these conditions.

Analysis of Photographic Material
-2-	Serial 01

Visual study of the reprints, in both cinema projection and frame-by-frame examination on a Recordak, an iconology of traveling microscopes. The original data was collected on a solarized film. The reprinted film copies from this original but apparently were applied correctly for the reprinting. On many of the frames they are largest and brightest on the first ten or twenty frames and gradually fade away until they are no longer discernible. They are largest and brightest on the first ten or twenty frames and gradually fade away until they are no longer discernible. Many of the frames, most of them are less bright, less distinct and they appear to be random phenomena, these are indications or disturbances caused by imperfections of the film or the processing.

The analysis of the two objects was carried out by tracing on an overlay celluloid the relative motion of the objects with respect to fixed reference points. As far as the image the azimuth and altitude of the objects were measurable with approximate accuracy.

The Recordak as a film projector similar to a Recordak but equipped with accessories remotely controls the starting and stopping of the film. It was developed by Douglas I. Bopp, and is manufactured and serviced by Geoscec Inc., Los Angeles 69, California.

Also a reprinted 35mm film was analyzed and proved to yield accurate results. However, four frames, viz, 1177 to 1180 were missing in the 35mm reel.
