III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On 23 June 1955, at the CASTELLANA HILTON HOTEL in MADRID, SPAIN, at the time of the observing (between 9:30 and 11:00 PM) SOURCE witnessed the following:
Object appeared to be saucer-shaped, somewhat larger than the standard aircraft, and was observed for an estimated period of two (2) minutes. The single object appeared to be black and became chocolate colored as it reflected the light of the setting sun. It hovered over the hotel at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet.
Source observed the object to descend steadily at a uniform rate and then rise again at the same rate, without any apparent indication of motive power. The object traveled in a horizontal course without gyrations. Source had the impression that the object was under intelligent control.

IV. SOURCE'S OPINION: 
SFRGS has no opinion of what the object could be but is definite that it is not a known type of aircraft, weather balloon, meteor, or astronomical phenomenon. He is at a loss to account for what he observed.

The source observed what he contends was a small, saucer-shaped object maneuvering and hovering above the Castellana Hilton Hotel between 9:30 and 11:00 PM on 23 June 1955. Duration of sighting was approximately two (2) minutes.
