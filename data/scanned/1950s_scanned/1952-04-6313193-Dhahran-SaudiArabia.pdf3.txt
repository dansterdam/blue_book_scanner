HEADQUARTERS
1414TH AIR BASE GROUP, MATS 
AND 6319TH OPERATIONS SQUADRON
NEW YORK, NEW YORK

21 April 1952

Major General John A. Samford
Director of Intelligence 
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear General:

I never thought it would be said that I would join the great army of flying saucer seers. However, note the attached report. I know that you have some very recent reports of a section that is considering these reports, therefore I should like you to read this and give me your pass it along to those at the best judgment. 

The duration, distinctness, and the details surprised me, as my rating leaves me positive of the details of my report. Never more will I be skeptical of anybody's report. I know now that those that were made to my Chief of staff a few years ago were right. I well believe the best of the best. 

That personal regards.

Sincerely,

Brigadier General, USAF
