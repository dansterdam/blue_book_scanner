The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from the Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a "Situation Sheet" and appears to provide details and analysis of a reported UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

JOINT MESSAGEFORM - CO. SITUATION SHEET
SECURITY CLASSIFICATION
TO: COMDR, ATIC
SUBJECT: Corridor plot (Aero Charts, WAC. NO. 392) and analysis
The object was observed to be at an elevation of approximately 45-50 degrees and moving rapidly to the East; object descending to SW, and over large body of water "glowing" like reflection of lights, and peculiar reflection of sunlight off some aircraft's fuselage in the distance. This is a well-known type of reflection baffles an aircraft in a brilliant white or even red hot light, generally reaching to the wing tips and tail surfaces - giving it a thin, slender, cylindrical appearance.  Gen. Brandt's description of a pencilike appearance and brilliant, little condensation except this appears this.
Checks here with appropriate agency do not indicate any balloons or reports of any UFOG or any other known craft from radar, ADC, or other units and persons in that area and time. Your checks will probably require military and civil aircraft flight checks for the area. (Par 5a, AFR 200-2) Remote possibility of daylight tracking, being checked out here, but improbable.
Significant to point out that instead of an electrical report being made of incident for expedition action, incident was reported by routine 112, without copies to interested agencies, and sole report to ATIC.  UFO not reported until 12 July 58, all in general non-conformity with AFR 200-2 for immediate reporting and transmission ATIC'S findings.  Therefore, this action has been taken.
