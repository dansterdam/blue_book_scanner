INCIDENT: SIGHTING OF AN UNUSUAL AERIAL OBJECT
EVALUATION: UNUSUAL
SUMMARY: At approximately 10:12 PM CDT, 25 June 1952, the on-duty officer at the Abilene Air Force Base Radar site observed on the radar scope a target which was traveling at extremely high speed and made a sharp turn. The target was observed for approximately 1 minute 20 seconds before it disappeared from the scope. The object was estimated to be traveling at a speed in excess of 1,800 mph and made a sharp turn of approximately 30 degrees. The object was not tracked by any other radar installations and no visual sightings were reported. It is the opinion of the radar operators that the target was a genuine one and not a false echo or malfunction of the equipment.
