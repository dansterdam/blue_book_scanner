Mansfield, Ohio
RED #3
Sept. 22, '58

Mrs. William H. Fitzgerald,
234 East Drive,
Sheffield Lake, Ohio

Dear Madam,

The report of your unusual sighting has been noted in this morning's Cleveland Plain Dealer. I am a private researcher in the field of Unidentified Flying Objects and this case has my interest.

Our studies have indicated that some people have had their eyes strained or hurt as well as other physical ailments which presumably result from observing UFO's at close range and for an extended period of time. However, your report indicates that you experienced no aftereffects at all, I am suggesting that you secure the immediate services of a Doctor: if you have not already done so, in order that your ailment is due to the viewing of a UFO this can be of great protection and value to the American people.

Our trouble, Madam, is that your and my government tries to tell us that UFO's do not exist - for that you know nothing. We know better, and we do know that this situation is not a desirable one. Hence, our efforts at present is directed to securing any lever to pry open the truth from our government departments, primarily the Air Force and the Defense Departments. Such an affidavit as I have suggested could be of utmost value.

Too, if you wish I would like to know if any government agent covered your vicinity with a Geiger counter.

Most sincerely,
/s/ Dan E. Haber
