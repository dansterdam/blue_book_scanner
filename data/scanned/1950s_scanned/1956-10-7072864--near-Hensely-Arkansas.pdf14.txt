There is no photograph present in this image. The text appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report from October 1956, describing various UFO-related incidents that occurred during that time period. The text contains detailed descriptions of UFO sightings and related events, but does not include any photographic evidence.

I have produced an output of all the text found in the document:
