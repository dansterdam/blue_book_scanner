TEXT OUTPUT:

THIS REPORT REMAINS A PROBLEM. THIS IS ONE OF THE CASES WHERE THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WHICH SO OFTEN ACCOMPANIES REPORTS OF THIS NATURE IS LACKING. THERE IS NO MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHICH CAN BE STUDIED OR ANALYZED.

THE WITNESS TO THE INCIDENT APPEARS TO BE A CREDITABLE AND INTELLIGENT PERSON. HIS DESCRIPTION IS QUITE DETAILED AND CLEARLY PRESENTED.

IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A HOAX. THIS INDIVIDUAL, WHO HAS CONSIDERABLE INTELLIGENCE AND TRAINING, WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO FALSIFY SUCH A REPORT. HIS REASONS FOR REPORTING THE INCIDENT WERE QUITE APPARENTLY TO SECURE CLARIFICATION.

ADVERSELY, THERE IS ALSO NOTHING WHICH CAN BE CLASSI-FIED AS POSITIVE EVIDENCE. AND YET - ELEMENTS OF THE REPORT GIVE RISE TO SOME DOUBT.

IT DOES NOT SEEM PROBABLE THAT THE WITNESS COULD BE MISTAKEN AS TO WHAT HE SAW. HIS DESCRIPTION SEEMS TO RULE OUT OTHER COMMON NATURAL PHENOMENA. FROM THE REPORT, IT DOES APPEAR THAT SOME AERIAL OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY THE WITNESS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFIED.

PENDING THE RECEIPT OF FURTHER INFORMATION WHICH COULD TEND TO ESTABLISH THE RELIABILITY OF THE WITNESS OR THE EXISTENCE OF ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO ARRIVE AT A DEFINITE CONCLUSION. THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE THIS AS EITHER A GENUINE UFO OR AN EXPLAINABLE INCIDENT.
