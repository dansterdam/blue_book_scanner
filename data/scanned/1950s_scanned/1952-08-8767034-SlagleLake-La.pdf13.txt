REPORT OF OBJECT OBSERVED FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE FIRST OBJECT

The object observed from the direction of the first object as described, was in the nature of a small, bright, round object which appeared to be approximately twice the size of a star. It seemed about three (3) minutes of arc in diameter, was of a pale, greenish white color and with some interior coloring or markings. It was viewed as a point source.

(Note: First object observed will be identified as "object 1" and second object will be identified as "object 2" for remaining data.)

Both objects observed in place approximately one (1) minute, object 1 was observed to make a course change in an easterly direction as it moved slowly in a westerly direction. After object 1 had moved approximately three (3) minutes of arc, object 2 became stationary in approximately the same position originally occupied by object 1.

Upon completion of the movement of object 1, object 2 remained stationary for approximately thirty (30) seconds after object 1 had moved. Object 2 then changed color rapidly to a deep reddish red and pulsating red light, followed by pulsating green light which appeared to be entire object 2 for a period of time. Object 2 occupied in this area. During object 2 movement to south, south west, object 2 was observed to show its movement clearly with apparent decrease in size and return to its original position previously occupied. Object 2 is now moved as it was stationary approximately three (3) minutes.
