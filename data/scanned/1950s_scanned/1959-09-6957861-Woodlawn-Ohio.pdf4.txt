Was like info or this. First saw object at about 8:30pm, seemed to be some 4500 to 8000 yards from my location on a lower horizon. As it approached I could distinguish it as a round object, somewhat elliptical in shape, extremely bright almost fluorescent in appearance and emitting no sound. It continued toward me, passing nearly overhead at an estimated distance of less than 1000 yards from my position, but fairly high in the sky. The object then continued on a straight course beyond my view, but did not appear to gain any noticeable altitude. I watched it for approximately 30 seconds or a minute before it disappeared. I could not detect any structural features, it was simply a round glowing object.
