THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
EMERSON McGILLIN OBSERVATORY
COLUMBUS 10
25 June 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Of the last batch of 4 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is any question is the 12 June Covington, Georgia - it is essential to make the distinction of sighting. A lot depends on this (can you get this for us?)

Regarding the Detroit 11 June case is there anything in this that a good landing light would not explain? Likewise Godge AFB 10 June - it would appear that when tracked on the signal-did-not-tick-up-the-audion-and-lost-probable explanation.

And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and unequivocally Venus.

Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.
Anything new on:
5 March Shaw AFB
5 March (also AFB) - Film?
27 Feb San Antonio
12 April Stead AFB

I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's clearance so we can get organized in a more business-like manner. I know you can't do anything about this but just mentioning it anyway. I hope it comes through before your successor is appointed.

Cordially,
Allen Hynek
