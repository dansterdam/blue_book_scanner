It appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated at six hundred (600) miles per hour. During this observation the object made an abrupt change in altitude, dropping down to an indicated altitude of two hundred (200) feet above the ground, and continued in flight for several minutes. The object's speed being six hundred (600) mph ground speed, without any indication of falling or slowing down, which indicated vertical maneuvering capabilities.
