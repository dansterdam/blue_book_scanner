REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

OUR REFERENCE WAS A LONG OBLONG Object which appeared to be about 35-40 feet long and about 10 feet thick at the center tapering to about 5 feet on the ends. It was silvery in color and seemed to be spinning or rotating on its longitudinal axis. When first sighted it was at approximately 15,000 feet altitude and moving in a westerly direction at an estimated speed of 300-500 knots. As it passed overhead, the rotation was visible as the reflected sunlight played on its surface. As it receded in the distance, it seemed to gain altitude and speed and was lost to sight.

Near it, at about 10,000 feet, was a smaller object which appeared to be a light gray or white in color and rectangular or elliptical in shape. It was motionless and remained in the same position relative to the larger object during the sighting.

What was very strange about this was that it was perfectly silent--no sound was audible at any time. Also it was a clear, cold day and visibility was excellent, so these objects could not have been any kind of natural phenomena like meteorological balloons or the like.

These two objects were sighted by several highly reliable and thoroughly competent observers, all of whom gave practically identical descriptions. Their sightings lasted about 2 to 3 minutes before the objects disappeared. Every effort was made to get additional information, but it was impossible to do so.
