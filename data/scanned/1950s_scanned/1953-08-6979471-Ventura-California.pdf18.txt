AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

From: (Agency) 
354 PTB 

a. The light was estimated to be traveling at a heading of 170°, particular to the runway which headed 205°. 
b. The light was estimated to be at least 500 knots at an estimated altitude and disappeared suddenly.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
The detailed report by highly competent observers indicates that the light was traveling at an estimated 500 knots at an estimated altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. This indicates that the light was probably something much faster than the conventional aircraft known at that time. The high speed and disappearance of the light is quite indicative of the unusual nature of the object.
