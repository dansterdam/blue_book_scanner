My Dear Sirs,

In the interest of possible facts, and because this article describes so closely the phenomena witnessed by my friend and self at approximately the same hour and day, I offerther this account.

We are two World War I Nurses (non-ex-drinking) who driving me from her home in East Oakland, to my home on the line which divides Oakland from Piedmont. 

As we witnessed this 'mysterious' sign, I remarked to her, 'let us remember what we have seen, and watch for reports.'

The 'object' appeared from a 'southerly direction' and slowly 'flickering' eastwards.

Submitting this account for what it may be worth,

Respectfully,

A CERTIFIED TRUE COPY:
