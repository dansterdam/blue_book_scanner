The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and a curved line labeled "B" to illustrate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second sketch contains two drawings, one larger and one smaller, showing a landscape with a person standing on a road. These appear to be examples or illustrations rather than photographs.

Here is the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
