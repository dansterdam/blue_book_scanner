IT APPEARED TO BE BETWEEN 30 AND 40 FEET IN DIAMETER. AFTER OBSERVING IT FOR 30 MINUTES, THE OBJECT SUDDENLY DARTED STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AT A TERRIFIC SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. THERE WERE NO SOUND EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT. MRS. - IS A RELIABLE PERSON AND HER REPORT IS CONSIDERED CREDIBLE BY INVESTIGATORS.
