with Aldebaran as the brightest star, dis­ tinctly red in hue, it is easy to identify.

To the left of Taurus is Auriga, the charioteer, with the star Capella, another of the first magnitude.

Descending from Capella, we come to Gemini, the Twins, with the stars, called Castor and Pollux, of which the latter is the brighter. And between Gemini and Canis Major stands Canis Minor, the lesser dog, with Procyon as the brightest stare.

Over towards the southwest are found the remnants of the constellations of the autumn evenings. Near the horizon, at seven or eight pm., Vega, which is earlier than the evening, Vpge, about all that is left of Lyra, the lyre. Above and to the east is Cygnus, the swan, with Deneb.

Brightest of the stars is Sirius, the dog star, east of Canis Major, the great dog who shows near the horizon. However, its low altitude causes a partial elimination of its light. Later in the night it climbs higher in the southern sky and is then even more conspicuous.

On the astronomers* scale for rates of bright­ ness, Sirius is of magnitude minus 1.4, which mea upon any other star that can seen in the nighttime sky. Com­ pared to Venus, however, it is relatively dim and the light of that planet’s at mi mg ft they

It will not be quite as thin a crescent as that of the moon, but more bike the moon ween a few days later, or before ft days fewer more this '

reason for usm phases is found in the fact that, on the mm side of the earth, it presents to our view varying amounts of its illuminated half.
