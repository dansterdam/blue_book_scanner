34. Date you completed this questionnaire:

Day_____Month_____Year_____

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

It was 13 years ago I saw this object at the time no one believed what I saw I decided to send it I hope someone will see the same thing for I feel some alone with what I saw I believe someday the truth will come along and we will know the truth about flying saucers. This is the last I can offer and the truth I saw it I will never forget it.
