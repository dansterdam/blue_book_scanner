The text visible in the document is as follows:

MAY 29 1967

SAPOICC/Mrs Gassel/nd/79079/29 May 67

Dear [redacted],

This replies to your letter reporting your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

However, without essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sighting, etc., a comprehensive evaluation cannot be undertaken. Also, your location was undetermined, which prevented the exact determination of the area covered by your sighting. Therefore, it was obviously not familiar to you.

We define a UFO as any aerial phenomenon or object which is unknown or the origin of which is not established to the observer's observation will be aided for identification purposes.

We would be interested in evaluating your photographs, if you will obtain the original negatives from Bell for us.

Thank you for your letter; we appreciate your interest in our project. I am attaching some reading material that I think you will find interesting.

Sincerely,

BARRETT E. YOUNG
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
