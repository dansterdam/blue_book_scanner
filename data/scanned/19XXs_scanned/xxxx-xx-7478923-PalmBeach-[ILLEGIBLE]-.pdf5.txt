UNCLASSIFIED

An object was observed on 20 August 1952 at 1:00 AM EST near Palm Beach, Florida. The object was described as a bright orange light, about the size of a "washing machine", which appeared to be hovering about 100 feet in the air. The object was observed for several minutes and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The witness, a private citizen, reported the sighting to the nearest Air Force base. This sighting was investigated and analyzed by Project Blue Book, the official U.S. Air Force program for investigating unidentified flying objects. Based on the available information, Project Blue Book was unable to identify the object as any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. The sighting was classified as "UNIDENTIFIED".
