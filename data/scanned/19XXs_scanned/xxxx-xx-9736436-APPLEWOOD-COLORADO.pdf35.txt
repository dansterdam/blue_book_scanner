There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report. The image contains text from a letter dated September 19, 1967, written by the Chief of the Civil Branch of the Community Relations Division of the Office of Information for the Department of the Air Force. The letter responds to a previous letter concerning the observation of an "unidentified flying object (UFO)". The letter indicates that the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be helpful in identifying the observation and thanks the recipient for reporting the observation to the Air Force.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sir,

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). With reference to the description of the characteristics, angular velocity, or weather information, we are unable to make a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigators at your nearest Air Force base, this investigation would have been made immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been conducted.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
