2. Here is the 23-year-old lieutenant's account as related to a representative of this office on 2 September 1952: The lieutenant stated that on the afternoon of 1 September 1952, at approximately 1730 hours, while standing in an open area on the base, he observed four (4) circular, metallic-appearing objects traveling toward the southwest at an altitude of approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. The objects were estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet and were observed for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The objects appeared to be approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter and were traveling in a horizontal line, with one object slightly ahead of the others. The objects appeared to be moving at a speed estimated to be in excess of 500 miles per hour and were on a steady course, without any noticeable change in altitude or speed. The objects disappeared from sight in the southwest.

3. The objects appeared to be traveling at a constant altitude but moving in a horizontal line. No trail or exhaust was observed. The objects appeared metallic and were not blinking lights. No sound was noted.

4. No additional information was obtained. The lieutenant stated that he was offering no theories as to the identity of the objects.
