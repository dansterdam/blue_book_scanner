The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with handwritten text.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
    3      Day      Month      Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This might be a REAL OBJECT that COULD TURN.
The object was under good control, with the nose section to the west and the body to the east, the object was just hanging there, the object left slowly, without any noise, at normal speed, and with no trail, or other signs.
There was no other object or light visible or noise heard.
The object was rounded or oval in shape, with no other details.
It was hard to judge the height or distance, it was up fairly high.
That's about all I can say. I can't recall any other details.
I hope this information is of some use.
