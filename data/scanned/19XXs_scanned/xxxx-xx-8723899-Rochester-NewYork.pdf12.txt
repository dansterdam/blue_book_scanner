UFO OBSERVATION & PHOTOGRAPHS, 
Rochester, N.Y. 15 July 1966

1. Reference your recent observation and subsequent photograph
of an unidentified flying object. The negative was submitted to
Wright-Patterson AFB, Photo Lab for analysis. 
Examination revealed a far too dense image definition which precluded
positive identification. A positive print was therefore provided.
2. If the original copy negative, there-fore, it does not contain the granular structure
of the original evidence presented as actually identical specifications
in terms of determining the exact stimulus.

3. If you ever acquire another UFO as you contact the
nearest APRO. Each base has its own UFO investigator and such
a person is in a better position to conduct an on-the-spot
investigation.

Director of Technology and Subsystems
