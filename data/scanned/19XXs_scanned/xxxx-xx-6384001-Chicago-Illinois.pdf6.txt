Roger: Chicago

At 11:55 p.m. a bright light was observed in the eastern skies. We watched the object for sometime. The object was oval in shape and appeared to be a dull orange color. The object remained stationary at first, then suddenly moved at a high rate of speed west-northwest and disappeared from sight. The object seemed to be approximately 10 degrees above the horizon. The observation lasted about 3 minutes. The weather was clear and calm.

July 29 - 8:30 p.m. 
July 30 - 9:25 p.m.
