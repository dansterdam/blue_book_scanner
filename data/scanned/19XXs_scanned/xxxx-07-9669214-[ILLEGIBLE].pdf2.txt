Transcription:

At 2045 hours, 6 July 47, Staff Sergeant Livingston's attention was called by a neighbor (a Mrs. Gallagher) to witness some "flying discs" in the west of Birmingham Ala. They appeared to be 2000 above the horizon at a 15 degree angle. They were traveling southwest at an estimated 600 to 800 mph. They were approximately 10 ft in diameter, and round. They produced a dim glow or light and were traveling at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 mph. The objects appeared to be traveling level in flight. One would appear and then another would appear behind it but not always in the same path. One seemed to some slight way. The view of its source was obstructed by a nearby house but upon reaching the altitude of approximately 2000 ft it started off in the same direction as the others. Sergeant Livingston says that he did not at any time see more than one object at a time, and that it could have been one object it was his personal opinion that they were several in a group and passed one another at varying intervals.
