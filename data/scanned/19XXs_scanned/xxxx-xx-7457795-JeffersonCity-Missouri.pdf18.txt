The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements other than the handwritten text. As requested, I will proceed to act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and produce the text found in the document:

The image contains the following handwritten text:
"The ground lights were strange, erratic and darting movements, the object was self-illuminating or they own was source of illumination. The pace was at estimated 1500 mph. I observed this object overhead for approximately 5 minutes. There are other times those seen than this one event."
