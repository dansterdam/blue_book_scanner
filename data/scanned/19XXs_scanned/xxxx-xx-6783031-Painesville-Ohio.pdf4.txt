There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

The text of the document is as follows:

"FACT: I had suggested to him that the object seen May 24 were meteors which was immediately contradicted by the witness. 

As to the UFO seen, the witness said the entire pattern of the object appeared to be a circular and metallic nature. He estimated the diameter to be 10 - 15 feet. The object was silver in color and apparently self-luminous. It made no sound. It hovered or remained stationary for a period of time, then began a horizontal movement at a fairly rapid rate of speed to the west. It was then lost from sight behind some trees. The witness felt the object was definitely mechanical in nature and under intelligent control. He was able to observe the object for a period estimated to be 45 seconds to 1 minute.
The object was seen early in the evening, it was still daylight. Several other witnesses in the neighborhood corroborated the sighting. The witness is considered reliable and his observations are felt to be accurate. No reasonable explanation for the sighting has been established."
