There is no photograph present in this page of the Project Blue Book document. The image appears to be a form with a series of checkbox questions and handwritten responses.

The text from the document is as follows:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE? 
WAS IT STILL OR MOVING?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE GLOWING?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
DRIFT LIKE A LEAF?
MAKE A NOISE?
FAINTERS OR VISIONS?
TAKE ANY ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

She could get much clearer than expected, they seemed to hold the light or air reflected through, one was suddenly a very bright light but nearly came to the ground, and some later and was moving very steadily east, but that was very clear and very close, there were 2 near later, one was a brighter light that suddenly went dark, many saw it, it could have been 8:30 or 9 PM.

OR IT DID SOME OTHER THING LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?

It changed bright and moved steadily as far as I could see, it moved quickly up then angled across my view, it didn't move straight but varied its course.
