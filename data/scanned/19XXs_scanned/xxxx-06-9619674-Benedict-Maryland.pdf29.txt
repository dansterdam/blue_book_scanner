STATEMENT

On Saturday night the 21st of June 1952 at about 10:20 P.M. while walking home from the Depot Theater with my mother (Mrs. Benedict) she and I both noticed a peculiar light in the eastern sky. It was easily noticeable because of its strange movements and rapidity of motion. When first seen it appeared to be bouncing around in the sky, moving very quickly in one direction and then another.

After watching for what seemed to be about 5 minutes it suddenly disappeared. It was only visible for a short Lapse of time, which appeared to be climbing, and then it disappeared completely. We watched it for about 3 minutes in all. I could not get a good look at it as it was moving so rapidly. It appeared to be larger than a star and give off a peculiar glow. The motion was so rapid that it was noticeably larger than any star and so light as to remain visible in a dark sky. It seemed to be noticeably larger than one would expect a star to appear to be at that distance and to still remain visible. What it was I am at a loss to explain, but I am quite certain that the motion could not have been caused by any known aircraft, and feel sure that the motion could not have been caused by the wind.
