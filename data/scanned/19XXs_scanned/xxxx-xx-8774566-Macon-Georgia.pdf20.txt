There is a sketch of a partial elliptical shape labeled "Overhead" with the observer's position indicated as "You" and the label "Horizon" on either side. This sketch appears to be illustrating the positioning of an observed object.

The text from the document is as follows:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead

Horizon          Horizon
         You

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you can recall, such as the thickness, length, relative speed, and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
