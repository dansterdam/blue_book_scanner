AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IR-37-52 11 August 1952
STATEMENT OF LT. NA RODSKY
From: Second Lieutenant Leo M. NA RODSKY 05-01l/57O9 USMC
To: Commanding Officer, Marine Ground Control Intercept Squadron 3
Subject: Unidentified Radar Sighting
1. On 6 August 1952 I had the duty as Senior Watch Controller at MGCI-3-CIC from 2000 to 2400.
2. At 2027 I was "spiking", or readjusting, the tuning of the controller plan, in order that I could ensure that the radar taller reports all contacts. In so doing, I observed a target to the west, 30 degrees in azimuth, which was between 20,000 and 21,000 feet in altitude. This target was traveling at an indicated airspeed in excess of 1,000 knots. It appeared to be a fairly large aircraft, but I could not determine its exact size or shape. Its travel path appeared to be straight and level.
3. I alerted my relief, the Co-Senior Watch Controller, and he observed the contacts also. We remained on watch, checking and double checking our instruments, until 2100, at which time the target left our range. It was traveling at such a high rate of speed and at an altitude in excess of 20,000 feet that it could not have been a conventional type of aircraft. No more unusual sightings were made during the remainder of my watch.
4. I did not see any lights or exhaust on this target, nor did I hear any unusual noises. The image was clearly and distinctly displayed on the radar scope. It appeared to be about 2 or 3 miles in diameter.
5. At approximately 2040, the target made an apparent ninety degree turn to the south, and then proceeded on a straight, level course. It maintained this speed and altitude without any fluctuation until it left our range.
6. I have had considerable experience as a radar controller, and I can state with certainty that this was not a known type of aircraft, either military or civilian. The performance characteristics were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.
