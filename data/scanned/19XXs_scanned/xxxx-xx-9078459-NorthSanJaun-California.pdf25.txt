Flying Saucers in North San Juan?
Boys Say Pictures Show Such Craft
Are North San Juan's flying saucers real? Schoolteachers believe it, members of a religious order believe it and the Air Force is investigating it. 
The UFO "sighting" began June 15, when 15-year-old Tony Broom and his companion, Johnny Bradshaw said they saw a saucer land in a hydraulic mining area north of town.
Take Pictures
The boys, armed with a 73-cent Brownie camera, purchased for the purpose, took pictures of the object on the ground. In the air, and next to Tony's saucer grade teacher, Harold Trizzolara.
When contacted, Trizzolara stated that the saucers but the pictures clearly showed an aircraft foreign to any pictures he had seen of earth-type aircraft.
Yesterday at North San Juan two members of a religious order visited Tony. North San Juan residents believe it.
An investigator for a UFO investigation organization examined the ground where the craft had landed, listened to Tony's story and apparently concluded the craft and its occupants had landed there.
The Air Force is the mean-while investigating the saucer incident. Personnel from Beale Air Force Base examined the ground, talked to the boys and had the pictures examined.
Their conclusions, if any, have not been released yet. Copies of the pictures, the boys say, are available for discussion at their store, the S&C Market at North San Juan.
The Sprulls, polite and patient but becoming somewhat exhausted by the deluge of questions, appear to be glided to some, extend on the information regarding the saucers.
