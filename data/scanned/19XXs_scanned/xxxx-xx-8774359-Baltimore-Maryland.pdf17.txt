RESTRICTED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting Report

DATE: 25 Apr 1952
TIME: 7:25 PM EST
LOCATION: Baltimore, Maryland

DESCRIPTION: On the above date and time, a bright light, moving at a high rate of speed, was observed passing over the city of Baltimore, Maryland, by several witnesses. The object was observed to be approximately 1 mile in diameter and was described as a round, flat, disc-like device surrounded by a bright luminescent glow. The object was observed to make a sharp, right-angle turn and then accelerate to a tremendous speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. No sound was reported associated with the object. The weather conditions at the time of the sighting were clear.

INVESTIGATION: An investigation was conducted by the Air Force to determine the nature and origin of the reported object. Interviews with the witnesses revealed no discrepancies in their accounts, and all were considered to be reliable and credible observers. No known aircraft or meteorological phenomena could be identified as the source of the sighting.

CONCLUSION: The sighting is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The object observed does not correspond to any known aircraft or natural phenomena, and its nature and origin remain unexplained.
