The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

AS AGAINST IT AS AT THIS TIME -2-

THERE APPEARS TO BE NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF ANY RELIABLE NATURE THAT WOULD
INDICATE THAT THIS OBJECT WAS OTHER THAN SOMETHING PROSAIC SUCH AS 
BALLOONS OR AIRCRAFT. WHILE THE OBJECT DESCRIBED BY THE OBSERVER DEFI-
NITELY MERITS INVESTIGATION, THERE IS NOTHING THUS FAR FOUND TO INDICATE
THAT IT IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN SOME CONVENTIONAL OBJECT. THE CHARACTERISTICS
REPORTED, IN THEMSELVES, ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE ONE TO CONCLUDE
THAT IT IS ANYTHING UNUSUAL. APPARENTLY THE THING WAS SIMPLY SOME TYPE
OF AIRCRAFT OR BALLOON WHICH THE OBSERVER WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY POSITIVELY
AT THAT TIME.

WHILE THE REPORT DOES NOT INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS PHOTOGRAPHED, IT IS
REGRETTED THAT ADDITIONAL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE SUCH AS PHOTOGRAPHS OR MOTION
PICTURES OR PERHAPS TRACES LEFT ON THE GROUND AFTER THE OBJECT DEPARTED
WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION. SUCH PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WOULD BE MOST
HELPFUL IN EVALUATING THE NATURE OF THE REPORTED PHENOMENON.

THIS IS SUCH A CASE AS COULD VERY WELL BE EXPLAINED SATISFACTORILY IF
ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WERE AVAILABLE. IT IS HOPED THAT THE OBSERVER DID
NOT LOSE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE SUCH EVIDENCE.

WHILE THE REPORT IS INTERESTING, IT CANNOT BE EVALUATED AS INDICATING 
ANYTHING MORE THAN SOME KNOWN OR PROSAIC OBJECT. THE DATA AVAILABLE IS
SIMPLY INSUFFICIENT TO PERMIT ANY DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS.

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS CASE BE FILED AS INDICATING NOTHING OF AN
UNIDENTIFIED NATURE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY REASON TO CONSIDER
IT FURTHER AT THIS TIME. SHOULD ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE BECOME AVAILABLE,
IT WOULD THEN BE APPROPRIATE TO REVIEW THE CASE.

YOURS TRULY,
