Dear sirs of Bradloring,

On March 26, 1967, between 7:15 & 8:45 PM I was watching a strange light that grew brighter until it was disc shaped and a reddish color. At first I thought it was more a star shining through the clouds and thought maybe it was a second coming and smaller one appeared Directly then the first one started to back up as if making a pass about to land right at my car. The next one backed up again over my friends said another was small and appeared louder and for the left. The second one backed to a path little while the thing one turned I was and disappeared quite. She then flew getting. Took 3 pictures One without flash and two with the flash. Dont see at the time while they came and went.

8:45 PM 26 U.F.O. Strictly packed completely away. The second one faded away brighter the first one faded away.

IF the whole story appeared in the Northampton report of our state on Northampton. I thank you.
