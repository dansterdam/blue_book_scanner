At exactly 4:25 a.m. I was awakened by a light of some sort. As soon as I looked out the window, I saw a bright light, not too far up in the sky, about 3/4 the size of the moon. It was silently hovering just above roof top level, and then started moving slowly to the right (west). It moved along for about 2 minutes, then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.
