AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
TR-37-59
PAGE 1 of 3
5. I called Captain VERNON, the assistant operations officer, described the strange blips and Richmond 18's report, and was advised to inform Devastate Able.
6. To ensure as accurate a report as possible, I wrote down the times, bearings, and distances involved between flights of Richmond 18. This confirmed the accuracy of his original report.
7. Richmond 18 reports that the blips appeared to be broken off from one another and moving at a very high rate of speed -- that they would have indicated a speed in excess of 1,000 knots were it not for the fact that I considered that it could not be possible that they were actually behind the other, moving at 5 to 600 miles per hour rather than only one aircraft.
8. As this is the first time that phenomena of this type have been reported to me by an Air Force pilot, I called Devastate Able on the AC-GI phone and endeavored to send the report as quickly as possible.
9. Richmond 18 reports strange con conventional aircraft passed him 500 yards on his starboard (port?) side at a very high rate of speed. Aircraft was not seen again. When later questioned, no further details were known. Aircraft was going at a very high rate of speed. He notified me when the incident occurred.
10. On being relieved at 2400 I instructed my relief to ask for amplifying information from Richmond 18 when he reported outbound. Richmond 18 had nothing further to report.
