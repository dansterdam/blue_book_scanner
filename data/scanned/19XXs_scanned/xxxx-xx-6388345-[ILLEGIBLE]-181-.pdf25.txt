STATEMENT

UNCLASSIFIED 
28 January 1949

I, BARTON HALTER, 2nd Lt., USAF, 40-878470, age 26, do hereby make the following statement.

My present duties are Radar and Communications Maintenance Officer, and Radar Observer Night Fighter with the 58th Fighter Squadron, 347th Fighter (All-Weather) Group, AFC 754.

On 15 October 1948, my pilot and I started out on a routine mission off the northwest coast of Kyushu. When, at 2305 I, we were approximately 50 miles at 330Â° from Fukuoka, I picked up an airborne target. It showed up at a range of five miles, dead ahead and slightly below us. We increased our speed to approximately 220 mph and obtained an advantage of 20 seconds. The target showed no evasive action at first, and we thought that it was probably one of the fighter aircraft from our home field. As we closed in, I noticed a slight change in azimuth and a rapid closure between us. Shortly thereafter, a matter of seconds, the target gave the indication of diving beneath us. We dived in an attempt to follow the target and before we could get a visual, it was passed beneath us and was gone. I was notified by my pilot that we were diving at a rate of 3500 feet a minute at 300 mph. I had intended to ask the pilot to peel off after the target, but this maneuver proved unnecessary.
