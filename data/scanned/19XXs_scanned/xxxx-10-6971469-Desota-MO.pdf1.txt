Observer sighted a bright white light in the sky. The light was stationary at first, then started moving rapidly and oscillating back and forth. The observer was driving in an automobile at the time and the object was quite close or quite large. Since the light appears as stationary first, then started moving rapidly, the description, other than the noise, is consistent with that of a satellite.
