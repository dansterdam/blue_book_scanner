The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

JUL 3 1 1967

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your observation and subsequent photography of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on March 16, 1967.

The photographs you continued in hopes of identifying the object. The object appeared to be circular, basically flat in shape. Lack of sufficient foreground and/or background detail precluded a scale factor to size the object. This lack of descriptible features prevents a positive identification of the object.

Enclosed are the photographs which you submitted for analysis.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

DANIEL S. YOUNG
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
