Transcription of the text:

They is a 10:30 light. It came on and lit up the whole area. Then as it went over a hill it want out and then it came on again. This light was a round light and was a bright light. It seemed to be as large as a full moon. It went out all at once. As it want out the light made a trail and that trail was 50 to 75 feet in length. This light could have been a UFO.

I would not do a report about this object.
