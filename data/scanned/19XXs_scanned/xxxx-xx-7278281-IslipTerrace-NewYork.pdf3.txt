Dear Sirs,
Con, C.?9. 11?67 at 545
Concerning a recent visitation October 11, 1967 at 545 (17:45) of an unidentified device over our backyards Islip Terrace, N.Y. We saw the object up there for a considerable length of time. It was traveling at a slow rate and then suddenly increased its speed and disappeared. Towards the end its the object appeared to glow, and then it suddenly increased its speed and disappeared from our view. We have a considerable knowledge of aviation and we feel this phenomenon is probably extremely important if properly investigated, both scientifically and technically.
Please advise us concerning the proper channel at which we should report this occurrence. We are sincerely hoping it receives serious consideration by your authorities.
Sincerely,
