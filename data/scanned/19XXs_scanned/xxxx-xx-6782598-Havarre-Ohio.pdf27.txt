Havarre, Ohio
14 March 1952

1. On 14 March 1952 at approximately 2000 hours, this observer noted a round, luminous object of a yellowish-orange color approximately 20 feet in diameter hovering over an open field approximately 1/2 mile west of Havarre, Ohio.

2. The object was first observed at an elevation of approximately 70 degrees above the horizon and remained stationary in that position for approximately 3 minutes. It then began to descend rapidly in a vertical direction, coming to within approximately 50 feet of the ground before suddenly accelerating at a high rate of speed in a horizontal direction to the west, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.

3. No sound was heard during the observation. Visibility was clear and the night was calm.

4. This observer has had considerable experience in the observation of aircraft and aerial phenomena and is confident that the observed object was not any type of known aircraft or meteorological phenomenon.
