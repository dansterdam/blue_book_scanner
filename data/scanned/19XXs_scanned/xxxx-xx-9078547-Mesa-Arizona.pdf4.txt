HE STATED THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE "ABOUT THE SIZE OF DUCKS" AT SHOTGUN RANGE *. HE STATED THAT HE WAS NOT SO AWARE OF THE INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS AS HE WAS OF THE FORMATION AS A WHOLE. HOWEVER, ON REFLECTION HE SAID THAT THE OBJECTS WERE "V DISK SHAPED".

MADE A SKETCH OF AN INDIVIDUAL OBJECT THAT COULD BE DESCRIBED AS KIDNEY SHAPED. FROM THE OBSERVER'S ACCOUNT, HIS SKETCH IS NO APPARENT FIRM EXPLANATION. OUR POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE SIGHTING ARE (1) LIGHT REFLECTING FROM A FLIGHT OF BIRDS OR BATS, (2) A METEOR SHOWER, (3) A TANKER WITH ITS REFUELING LIGHTS ON, AND (4) A LARGE AIRCRAFT WITH ITS LANDING LIGHT ON. OF THESE THE FOURTH SEEMS TO BE THE MOST PLAUSIBLE.
CONCLUSION.
