The phenomenon was very bright and was traveling at a high rate of speed. I could not see what the object was distinctly but I could not see what the light was attached to. It traveled in a particular manner of motion and could have been some type of aircraft - it was much higher and moved faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. It was very dark and would appear and disappear in the sky. It was merely a bright light and could have been some sort of natural phenomenon as a meteor or celestial object having the radiance and disappearance of the red light. I would estimate the distance from the observer to the object as approximately 10 miles or more.

21. NOTICE ANY ODOR, NO ISE OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF. ANIMALS OR MACHINERY IN THE VICINITY. [YES] [NO]. IF YES, DESCRIBE:

Yes, I noticed a strange electrical effect, I believe it was caused by the phenomenon. The area seemed to be disturbed and the hill where the phenomenon disappeared had disturbed the soil.
