December 6, 1967.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

With reference to your letter, regarding a disc shaped
object observed on April 17, 1967, at Cedar Falls, Missouri
from 9:50 PM until 10:05 PM CST, we are sorry that we have
not answered your letter sooner. The disc was brought
from my desk for several weeks and upon my return I inquired
about any complaints being received on any observations of
this kind and received word that we did have complaints.

Upon checking, it appears that some local kids had placed a
plastic bag, or substance of some kind in a plastic bag, on
customers after they have been cleaned and after inflating
the cement bag is some way the substance gives a lighted
effect and it floats off into the air.

We hope this will answer your inquiry and again apologized
for the delay in replying.

If we can be of further service to you at any time, in the
future, please feel free to call us.

Yours very truly,

CLAUDE E. SHORT
Chief of Police
