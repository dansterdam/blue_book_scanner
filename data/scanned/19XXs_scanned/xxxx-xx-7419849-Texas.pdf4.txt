Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This replies to your recent letter concerning your observation of a flying object (UFO) on August 12.

We are unable to offer an explanation because of insufficient data. Insufficient information, such as detailed flight characteristics, weather information, and angular velocities are needed in my investigation of UFO sightings. Had you reported your observation to the nearest military installation at the time, an on-the-spot investigation could have been made.

Perhaps the enclosed Project Blue Book report will help identify what you have seen.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

ROBERT B. YOUNG
