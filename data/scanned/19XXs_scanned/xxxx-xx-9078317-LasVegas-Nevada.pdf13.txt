The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

When I sighted across the terrain to the south, there seemed to be a pulsating red light on the ground. At first I thought it might be a searchlight but on closer examination I recognized it as a fast moving and unusual object. When I was able to study it more carefully I saw that it was a definite circular or spherical object hovering about 100-200 feet above the ground and maneuvering rapidly in various directions, sometimes disappearing then reappearing. The object appeared to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. It gave off a brilliant light, reddish-orange in color, which seemed to pulsate or throb. The light was not steady but appeared to be irregular and changing in intensity. At times, the object seemed to send out beams of light in various directions. It was an awesome sight and I watched it for approximately 15 minutes before it disappeared from view. I have no explanation for what I saw that night. Please let me hear from you.

Sincerely,
