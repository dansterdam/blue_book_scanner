The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed letter on the letterhead of the "University of Colorado". The letter is addressed to "Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr., USAF (Ret.)" from the "Research and Aerial Phenomenon Div." and is dated "30 September 1968".

The text of the letter is as follows:

"We are beginning the process of closing up the project shop! Here is a case file from the reported sightings which apparently originated on 31 August 1967 - 25 miles southwest of Wichita, Kansas. If you will see from the handwritten notes it was not possible to logically conclude what will be seen from the handwritten notes. It was made of the case.

If you have a record of or other things that ought to be returned to your office it would certainly help me. The girls at Woodbury now have not been around long enough to really find things. Mariet has been lost and the girl has lost everything so far.

Sincerely,"
