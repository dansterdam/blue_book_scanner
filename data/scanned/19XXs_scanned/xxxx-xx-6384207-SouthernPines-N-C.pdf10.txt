Washington, D. C. - 0500 EDT 8 August 52
(As telephoned to ON-202 on 8 August 1952)

1. "Bigger than four-engine airplane", dark color object, no noise, "rocket-like", wings perhaps, "erratic speed" no trails, no exhaust, flowed through vapor clouds, an out, and headed in (slightly southerly) direction.
2. 0500 EDT 8 August 52. Observed for 1 or 2 seconds.
3. Visual with naked eye from ground.
4. Observer at home (had been asleep) when neighbor's alarm clock awakened him). 45 degrees from vertical elevation at 6:00 elevation. A brilliant maneuver was witnessed and observer assumed it was from poor visibility conditions.
General:
Impression of shape very vague. Viewed from rear with no definite outlines but seemed larger than 4-engine aircraft. Color was possibly lighter than full cloud base although 15,000 ft observations been higher. Concluded that this object was very fast and dark making no noise.
