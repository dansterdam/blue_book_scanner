Spurious 'Spec-l-Men'? 100 UFO Experts Call Saucer Photos Fakes
By Wallace A. Legorio

MARYSVILLE -- The nation's top unidentified flying object sleuths agree, at least unofficially, that photographs taken by a 12-year-old boy of a flying saucer near North San Juan, Nevada County, are fakes. The boy said he photographed the saucer and the object as it occupied two trees. I have not ordered further tests because they are not that interesting.

Saunders also said the pictures were shown to an unimpressive group of UFO investigators attending the conference. 

When Saunders learned the photos taken in North San Juan had been purchased by a Sacramento television station, he said, "I hope they didn't pay too much. They would have paid too much, however, at any price."

Tony Spruill, 12, who claims he took the pictures, today insisted they were not fakes. He was told experts called them fake.
