About 8:15 - P.M. Dec 9th 1949
My husband and I were coming home and we saw something that looked like a large round object diving, and it came nearer and nearer us and lit up brighter and brighter and was a very bright red light on the object. It looked rather strange and about the size of a small airplane and it seemed to stand still for a few minutes like it was searching or something. It looked rather unusual and unlike anything I'd ever seen. It looked like a big red light and like it might be some kind of flying object. It looked rather strange and like it might be a flying saucer. We looked rather while and like it had stopped and just hung there in mid air, and then it suddenly started off again and went across the sky and disappeared. I was rather surprised and puzzled and rather frightened to see it, as I'd never seen anything like it before.

A bright red light on the sight on the object on the back, banking or swerving on and off and a sort of yellow light or left side. We watched it for about ten minutes or a little more. It was headed in the southward direction as far as I could tell.
