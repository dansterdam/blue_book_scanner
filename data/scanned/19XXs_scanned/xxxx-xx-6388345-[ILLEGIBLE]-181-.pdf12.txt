There is a photograph present in the image, which appears to show an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky, described as a "cigar-shaped" object.

Incident, 1946 -- near Dayton, Ohio -- 13 October 1948
There is no astronomical explanation for this incident. Since the speed of the object was 133 m.p.h., if it had passed through a cluster of balloons, a flock of birds, or any other group of relatively stationary objects, they would undoubtedly have appeared to observers within the objects traversing by, such as "collisions" poles appear from a window of a speeding train. Little credence can be given to the pilots' statement that the objects passed not have been artificial, birds, or any other known substance for identification.
