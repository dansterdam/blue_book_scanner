29 MAY 1953

Dear [redacted],

The procedure outlined in my letter of 27 April 1953 has been accomplished. This procedure included a detailed study and analysis of the reported incident which was featured. To report, a detailed analysis was made of the clipping from the newspaper which was enclosed, and a field check of the area indicated in the clipping was made. A careful study of all factors involved was made, and it is concluded that the object reported was not of extraterrestrial origin.

It is considered possible that this reported incident was influenced in a manner similar to recent incidents which have received considerable public attention and have been the objects of detailed investigation. These recent incidents have been found to be the results of either hoaxes or the misidentification of conventional aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,
[redacted], Colonel, USAF
