IT WAS ABOUT AS BIG AS A SILVER DOLLAR HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. IT WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO BE FLOATING. IT MOVED WITH VERY LITTLE NOISE IF ANY. I TRIED TO CALL MY NEIGHBOR BUT SHE DIDN'T HEAR ME. I WATCHED IT FOR SOME 30 MINUTES AS IT MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY GOING FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE GOING VERY FAST.
