A clipping from Portsmouth, Virginia, tells of a young man who saw a UFO the size of a small plane cross the road about a half mile ahead of him at 5:30 one evening, while driving along U.S. Highway 17. His car engine cut out, but it re-started without difficulty 30 seconds later. The young man, named Steve L. Anderson, reported the incident to Langley Air Force Base.
