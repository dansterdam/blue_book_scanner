The image contains a page from an old UFO report document. There are no photographs present, only text describing several photographs that were apparently part of the original report.

The text output is as follows:

PICTURE ANALYSIS:
PICTURE #1: (A) This is a picture taken from approximately 150 feet away. #1 represents the shadow I questioned on the top of the ufo. (B) This is another picture from the same distance. #2 represents the double exposure(?) #3 again shows the shadows of the craft. (C) This was supposed to have been taken after the craft was about 50 feet in the air above where it represented the "lift-off" that cause our #2.
PICTURE #2: (A) Taken from the top of the hill and pointed straight down. (B) was where the boys were standing and they felt the wind from the UFO that came by. (C) Also taken from the top of the hill pointing up by the dirt road. This shows the path traveled by the UFO in landing. #2 is where the UFO was.
PICTURE #3: This picture was taken from the top of the hill where the boys said they took the pictures. #1 represents the route traveled by the UFO in landing. #2 is where the UFO settled.
PICTURE #4: Taken standing on the ground where the UFO sat. It represents the tracks of the UFO. It was a few feet away as compared to the size in the boy's picture #4.
PICTURE #5 & 6: The boys said they came to the area from point A. They took pictures 1,2,3 from point B. They went to point C. The UFO came over the evergreens from point D and landed on point E. (The distribution overlap to give an overall view.)
This page had two other negatives which were not printed. One shows the object as described in the picture. There were also what seemed to be wires in the picture, not just the UFO. There was a final picture which later disappeared which the UFO moving over it. The wires were again visible in this picture.
