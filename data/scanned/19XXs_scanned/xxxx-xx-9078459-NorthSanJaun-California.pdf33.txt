Flying Saucer 
Disappoints 60
at No. San Juan

North San Juan's bid for a flying saucer failed to materialize Saturday as fewer than 69 persons were on hand to greet the Centaurians, according to predictions made by 12-year-old Tony Spirulf.

Tony, who said he had received orders from the leaders of the space ship operated by the Centaurians on June 2, had predicted Saturday's landing.

The predicted "close encounter" never occurred as townspeople, instead, stood around asking each other what would happen next even though some members set up cameras and discussed what to do if the Centaurians did show.

A few hippies were on hand, for the most part they stood in the sun, talking of the predicted saucer of was a non-happening.

No new predictions on the space ship's return or possible visitors are forthcoming.

The only positive statement made during the day was by a television newsman with a dead line to meet. About 3:30 the television cameras showed up him and he said "Well, the saucer should be here by now."

He refused to elaborate on his knowledge of the answer landing time.
