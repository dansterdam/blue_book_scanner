1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report which occurred on 27 September 1967 at approximately 0932Z. The sighting was of 5 lights that were seen off the South Carolina/Georgia coast. According to the information received the lights were approximately spherical, steady, and incomplete. The duration seems to have been 3 to 14 minutes, but the course of the objects (lights) is not really stated.
