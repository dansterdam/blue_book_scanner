1. Approximately 2100 hours on the night of 24 March 1967, a truck 
driver by the name of Dywer D. Laurel, Montana was proceeding approximately 2 miles southeast of the turn-off to Belt, Montana, he claimed to have sighted a strange object emitting an intense bright light and in a ravine approximately 1 1/2 miles south of the highway. Mr. 
Laurel parked his truck and approached the object. As he approached, the object lifted off the ground only to settle back in a ravine hidden from the highway by a ridge. Mr. Laurel flagged down a passing motorist (Mr. G.T. Ciolkosz) and requested that the Sheriff's office be notified. This was done by Mr. Ciolkosz and a highway patrolman was dispatched to the scene (Mr. Bud Naden). Mr. Naden reported that upon reaching the scene he observed an unusual light emanating from the area that the truck driver, Mr. Laurel had indicated. The ravine where the object was claimed to be located was extremely steep and rocky and not accessible to the highway patrol. Further numbers of officers were dispatched from the Sheriff's Office of Cascade County.
2. Numerous reports were being received by the dispatcher at Base Operations. At 2205 Lt. Col. Lewis D. Chase, Base UFO Investigating Officer, was notified by the Command Post of the reported landing. Sequence of events following the notifica-
tion were as follows:
2215 - Check was made with Base Operations as to aircraft movement in the area. An outbound transient aircraft departed Great Falls enroute to Glasgow, Montana. Departure time was 2109. All other aircraft were accounted for. 
2230 - Discussion with the Sheriff of Cascade County revealed that he had dispatched additional deputies to the area. Requested
