SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON 
29TH AIR DIVISION (DEFENCE)
MCGUIRE AFB, NEW JERSEY

5 September 1952

STATEMENT:

On the night of 27 August 1952, an aircraft control and warning radar operator at the 752nd ACW Squadron, McGuire AFB, New Jersey, detected an unidentified target on his radar scope. This target was tracked for several minutes and was determined to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, estimated at approximately 700 mph. The target was observed to make several abrupt turns and
changes in altitude, maneuvers which could not be executed by any known type of conventional aircraft. Attempts were made to establish radio contact with the unidentified target, but these were unsuccessful.

Despite the fact that the target was picked up on both height finder and search radars, no visual sighting was obtained. The target was finally lost when it went out of range of the radar sets.

Details of this incident have been forwarded through channels to the appropriate authorities. If this was an unidentified aircraft, it exhibited a performance far in excess of the capabilities of any known type of aircraft.
