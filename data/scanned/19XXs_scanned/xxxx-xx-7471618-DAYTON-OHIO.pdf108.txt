The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The document contains various notes, sketches, and calculations, but no photographic evidence.

As per your request, I will now act as an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system and produce the text found in the document:

KNOW ANYTHING THAT WILL HELP MAKE THIS AS AN 60 SHOW HIM THIS EXAMPLE. INCLUDE CARD LAYOUT. ANY DETAILS WHICH ASSISTANCE. CLASSIFICATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN SHOW THIS SHEET AT INTERVIEW.  
ALLOW 3 MINUTES AND INSPECT. HOW MUCH COULD BE DETECTED BY THAT PERIOD. HOW MANY OBJECTS AND SHAPES DETECTED. INSPECTION MUST INCLUDE EXACT CARD ANALYSIS

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HELD WATCHED AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF THE SHOWN SUBJECT. SUCH AS A BASKET OVERHEAD COULD BE SEEN. HOW IS THE OBJECT SIZED AS COMPARED TO THE OVERALL MATCH. HOW IS SUCH ABILITY TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PERIPHERAL WAS COVERED BY THE MATCH WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED.
