The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which is a United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text on the page is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 17 APRIL 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting:

MANY UFO'S HAVE BEEN SIGHTED HERE IN LAS VEGAS. MOST OF THEM PROVED TO BE EXPERIMENTS CARRIED ON BY THE AIR FORCE AT NELLIS AFB OR SOME SORT OF WEATHER EXPERIMENT. THE OBJECT I SAW CHANGED BRIGHTNESS SUCH AS AN EARTH SATELLITE WOULD DO WHEN TURNING ON ITS AXIS. WHEN IT DISAPPEARED I THINK SOME MATERIAL FELL OFF IT. I BELIEVE IT WAS A WEATHER EXPERIMENT OF SOME SORT.

IF POSSIBLE WOULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME ANOTHER FORM PD 169. IF SO, PLEASE MAIL IT TO THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS:

[Address redacted]

I WOULD APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU!
