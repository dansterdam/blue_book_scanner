The image contains a compass rose diagram in the top half, and two sketches illustrating different viewing perspectives in the bottom half.

The text output from the document is:

HOW IMAGNINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE A FAR ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM
WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A DOT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AS YOU THINK PROPER THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN AND AS IT
MOVED. SHOW THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT, AND GIVE APPRECIABLE DETAIL ON SIZE, SHAPE, COLOR AND
OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHARACTERISTICS. IF THE PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVED TO CHANGE IN FORM OR BEHAVIOR
DURING THE OBSERVATION, SKETCH OR DESCRIBE THAT CHANGE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE
THE LARGER SKETCH.
