Dear Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

I am typing this for my Grandma sometime in March 1967 about 2:15 A.M. My Grandma heard the two big dogs Tarzan and Rex barking. She got up to let Cindy our small dog out and quite the big dogs as they were barking. Cindy jumped out and ran up the road barking, my Grandma looked up the road and saw a large object with red yellow and blue lights that was hovering over an orchard about a 1/2 or a mile away. She went back to bed because she was scared, about twenty minutes later she looked again and it was gone.
