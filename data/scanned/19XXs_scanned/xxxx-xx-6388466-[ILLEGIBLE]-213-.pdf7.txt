The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with text describing an object sighted after release time of an Indian balloon. The text discusses the object's appearance, movement, and how it was sighted for several hours after the balloon release.

P.o. 212. Object sighted three hours after release time of Indian-sported and F. I. a. of balloons, Definitive balloon could not have travelled low enough to be seen and upper winds indicate that such a balloon would have been in the Dayton area at the time sighted. All other explanations seem to indicate that the object was a weather balloon.
