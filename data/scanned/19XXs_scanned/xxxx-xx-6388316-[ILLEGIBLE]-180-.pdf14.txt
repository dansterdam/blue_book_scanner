THE UNCLASSIFIED REPORT
On December 1, 1948,
out through our office a report received from the following incident:

"At approximately 12:10 am on October 13, 1948, while looking darkness towards Clear (indecipherable) of their flying objects, bright that they could see the. The fact that they were a vehicle other than a car as they travel fast and west, or southeast. And travel about flight elevation of about 500-600 feet and (indecipherable) of vision for perhaps 15 to 20 seconds."

While I watched the object described place faded as moving toward the southwest. Whatever the object was, it was traveling at a high rate of speed and left no visible trail. However, on observing it through binoculars, I thought I saw what appeared to be a small white light near the rear which seemed to be blown off, though I cannot say definitely that this occurred. 

The object appeared to be a bright white light of the approximate size intensity of a star of the first (indecipherable) though we were able to distinguish it as a distinct and separate object from the stars. At the termination of its flight, the light appeared to dim in intensity before disappearing. Its speed was so great that it was not possible to obtain more than a fleeting observation. The movement of the object was unlike that of a meteor, airplane flare, or shooting star. And travel lasted what I estimate to be between 15 and 20 seconds.
