September 9, 1954

Dear Mr. XXXXX,

This is in reply to your letter of August 31, 1954, requesting information in the new UFO sightings or reports.

The only information to your inquiry is that these recent reports are being evaluated by the Air Force as rapidly as possible, and you will be advised of the results as soon as the evaluations are completed.

Included with your request was a self-addressed stamped envelope for a possible evaluation. However, at the present time, we have no information that would warrant returning the envelope to you.

You may be assured that your interest in this matter is appreciated, and we shall be glad to provide you with any information that may become available.

Sincerely,

HASTON N. JACKS
Major, USAF
Chief, Information Division
Office of Information Services
