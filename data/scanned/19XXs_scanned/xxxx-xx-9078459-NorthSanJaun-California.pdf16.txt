Flying Object Tale Excites Town; Return Is Forecast

NORTH SAN JUAN, Calif., June 11 (AP) - This community of 120 residents still is talking about the strange object sighted near here and the residents are convinced the object will return.

Sprull and John Bradshaw, who saw and photographed it, said Air Force officials have taken the photographs and interviewed them, but declined to disclose any information about the object.

The residents say the object descended slowly, hovered and then shot away. They say if the same object returns, as they say it will, they will notify the Air Force again.

The stir in this Sierra foothill town began Tuesday when the Sprull boy said he saw the strange object near the cemetery. Bradshaw, who is an insurance agent, and his wife were walking near the cemetery and also saw the object.

Sprull said he and his wife were in their back yard when they saw the object. "It came down very slowly as if it was going to land, then it just took off," Sprull said.

"The aircraft was described by Sprull as white, as if it had taken off almost straight up. But then it moved off at an angle," the article states.

The article also mentions that the object was about 5 feet in diameter, according to the Sprull boy, and that it was "the best he had ever seen".
