Dear Major Quintanilla,
Being a Air Force officer (1952-1956) I heard several things opened discutia on U.F.O.'s all the Air Base where I was stationed. These were mere of an unverified nature than anything else.
I really never paid any attention to the flight line. I thought maybe UFO's were claimed in several magazine articles I have read. Some of the things I heard were in sound fascinating to me. How true they were I do not know.
I am the first few years I may have with members of my family have seen light that seem to be hovering in the sky and disappear. Sometimes like a bright light and at other times a nebulous light. Just for an instant and I immediately realized it was not true.
