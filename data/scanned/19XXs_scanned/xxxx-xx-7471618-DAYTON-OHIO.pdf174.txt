MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subject: UFO Observation, 2 November 1957

The text in the memo describes an observation made by a witness on Cooper Street, Dayton, Ohio 45427. The witness saw something blue, red and white moving very slowly. It scared him and his friend "half-to-death" and they saw it again later, when they saw it four times altogether. The witness said his friends would fill out a form, and three forms will be sent to his friend and his friend's mother.
