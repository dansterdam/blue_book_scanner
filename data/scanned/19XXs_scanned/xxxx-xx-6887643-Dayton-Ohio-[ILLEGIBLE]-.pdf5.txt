There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten narrative describing a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The view from our apartment showed a beautiful long strip of the sky. The evening of June 12 was cool - the cloud might Janus came over the land, somewhat beautiful, shiny twilight earlier in the evening. My husband, after he had watched - came out of the living room - so we did the one from lather - "I saw something with light." I don't know what it was."
