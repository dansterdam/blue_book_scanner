Regarding the text, the OCR output is as follows:

My wife and I have collected decrease. I have been on the teaching staff of St. Olaf's College and am now employed in one of the research laboratories. I must ask you to keep this strictly confidential, as it must not be revealed for at least 5 years else I will lose my position. You should not destroy this report as we have tested this and have found it is nearly impossible to avoid any deception. I cannot identify the exact location as I wish to avoid any publicity. It was a very unusual night.

Your truly yours.
