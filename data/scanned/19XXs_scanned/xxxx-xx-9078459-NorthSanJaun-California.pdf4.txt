The image contains a handwritten text that describes an incident involving some boys who claimed to have seen a flying saucer. The text mentions that the boys showed a picture postcard with an image of a flying saucer to the narrator. However, there does not appear to be any photograph or image included in the document provided.

The text produced by the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system is as follows:

The boys ran up the road and entered the tavern where Johnny's father was. Tony was very excited. Johnny was more scared. Of course, nobody would believe them but the boys said they had pictures of it. They then went to the S & C Grocery Store to tell Tony's mother. She didn't believe them either. Tony's father came in a little later, and did not believe their story. The boys told it several times that they had pictures of it.

That evening the boys went to *** grandmothers home across the street. A neighbor, Mrs. ***, was also there. The boys told their story to the women and they talked a long time about the incident. Mrs. *** called a Mrs. *** and told her about it. The boys talked to Mrs. Barnes on the phone and were told that she had had contact with the Venetians and had many books and tape recordings by experts in the field and even some from the Venetians. Mrs. *** gave them a picture postcard with a picture of a flying saucer on it. The boys showed it to me and said the UFO strongly resembled the one they had seen.

On Friday, 2 June, Mr. *** took the roll of film into Tyler's Photo Store in Grass Valley for developing. The proprietors said they could be picked up on Sunday.

On Monday, 5 June, both Mr. *** and Tony went into Grass Valley to pick up the pictures. As soon as they received them they opened the envelope and looked at the pictures. Only three had turned out (been printed). Tony was excited. His father could do nothing else but believe him at this point. Mr. *** carried on his own investigation, questioning the boys over and over, adding them back to the scene. The more he believed them.

NOTE: The boys told many people about their experience and showed the pictures around. Many people then started to claim that they had also seen flying saucers and space ships and had contact with people from outer space.
