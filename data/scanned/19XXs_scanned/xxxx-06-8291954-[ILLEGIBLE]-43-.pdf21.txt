SEMINOLE FLORIDA 33240
2/8 MOUNT VERNON VICTORY
AT 9:40 PM JUNE 22 NORTH 172 EAST

DEAR SIRS:

AT ABOUT 4:40 THIS MORNING I WAS AWAKENED BY WATCH OFF TO A BRILLIANT LIGHT IN THE SKY. THIS LIGHT SEEMED TO BE APPROACHING AND IT APPEARED TO BE A UFO. I WAS SO INTERESTED IN UFOS THAT I OBSERVED IT FOR SOME TIME. 

ABOUT FIVE MINUTES EARLIER, I HAD COMPLETED RE-READING THE LAST THREE ISSUES OF THE SIGHTING INVESTIGATION FILES. MY INTEREST WAS AROUSED SO I WAS WIDE AWAKE AND ALERT.

THE OBJECT WAS DEFINITELY A SOLID BODY AND IT MADE NO SOUND. IT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING OVER THE PASTURE AREA IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE. I OBSERVED IT FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND IT SEEMED TO BE OSCILLATING BACK AND FORTH IN A RATHER ERRATIC MANNER. THEN IT SEEMED TO BE ATTRACTED TO THE ELECTRICAL DISTURBANCE OF SOME KIND WHICH SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM A TRANSFORMER ON A NEARBY UTILITY POLE.

BY THE TIME OF MY ARRIVAL ON THE SCENE, THE CLOUD FORMATION HAD ALREADY BROKEN UP AND ITS EDGE WAS SOME 500 YARDS FROM ME. IT WAS BOTH ROUND AND ELONGATED. AS IT MOVED, IT SEEMED TO BE FLATTENED AND CYLINDRICAL IN SHAPE RATHER THAN SPHERICAL. IT WAS OSCILLATING AND MOVING VERY ERRATICALLY. AFTER HOVERING FOR SOME TIME, IT SUDDENLY STREAKED AWAY WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION. I DID NOT HEAR ANY SOUND OR SEE ANY TRAIL.

I COULD NOT DETERMINE HOW LARGE THE OBJECT WAS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ANY POINTS OF REFERENCE. IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL AUTOMOBILE. THE LIGHT EMITTED FROM IT WAS A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT IN THE CENTER, SHADING INTO BLUE AND THEN GREEN TOWARD THE EDGES. I DID NOT NOTICE ANY PORTHOLES OR OTHER STRUCTURAL DETAILS. AS IT STREAKED AWAY IT DID NOT SEEM TO MAKE ANY NOISE AND IT LEFT NO TRAIL.

I SHALL BE GLAD TO FURNISH ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT BE OF ASSISTANCE TO YOUR INVESTIGATION.

SINCERELY,

[ILLEGIBLE]
