The image contains a photograph of an old document, which appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document discusses an incident that occurred in West Virginia in the summer, where a family group reported seeing a large monster or creature that they observed from a hill. The document describes the creature as being ten feet tall, with a bright-colored body and a blood-red face, and states that the witnesses were terrified and ran away from it. The document also mentions that the object was first observed as a meteor, and that the incident is the subject of a new ballad. No human faces are visible in the image.

Monster in West Virginia

The final incident in the summer's panic occurred on the evening of September 15, when a family group near the town of Sutton, West Virginia, saw a flaming object descend behind the hills above their home. Hurrying out to investigate and, on reaching the hill, smelled an unpleasant odor. When they turned on their flashlights, they stated, they saw two red eyes glaring at them; a huge monster, ten feet tall, breathing fire, with a bright-colored body and a blood-red face, crawled toward them, and they turned and ran [5].

Air Force investigators concluded immediately that the flaming object first seen was the meteor observed that night by thousands of persons in Virginia and West Virginia and reported officially to various observatories, and that the hilltop and flashed the light was probably the glowing crater left by some mundane creature of the woods. A local group of civilian amateur investigators rejected this explanation, as usual, and after making its own study concluded that the monster story could very well be true! [p. 129]

The monster is now confirmed in West Virginia history, and forms the subject of a new ballad [5], set to the tune of "Sweet Betsy from Pike." One verse and the chorus will suffice:

The size of the phantom was a sight to behold,
Green eyes and red face, so the story was told.
It towered in the air with fingers of flame.
It was gone with a flash just as quickly as it came.

Chorus:
Oh, Phantom of Flatwoods, from Moon or from Mars,
Please tell us why you by our town appears.
The world will be watching, the news will be sent,
The world will be questioning, why on earth you were sent.
