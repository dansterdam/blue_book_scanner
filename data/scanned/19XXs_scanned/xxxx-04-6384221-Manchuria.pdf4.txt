AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO.

DATE: 9 April 1953 
SUBJECT: Observations of Unidentified Flying Objects over North Korea
LOCATION: 40 52' North, 129 3' East, CCF-4 Sector, North Korea
TIME: 22:47 to 23:02, 29 March 1953

SUMMARY:
On 29 March 1953 an F-84 pilot observed 5-8 triangular shaped objects, approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter, over North Korea. These objects were observed at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet and were moving at a ground speed of approximately 100 knots with a climb rate of approximately 1,000 feet per minute. They flew in a tight formation and were observed for approximately five minutes. Weather at the time was CAVU (clear above visibility unlimited).

DETAILS:
These objects were described as triangular shaped, in the opinion of the pilot they appeared to be the size of a C-47 cargo plane. Their color was reported as bluish-yellow. Two objects were observed to be connected with a thin cable or streamer attached to the bottom portion and trailing behind the objects. The objects were observed for approximately 30 seconds without the aid of binoculars. Friendly aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting were flying at a speed of approximately 500 mph or .93 mach. The appearance of these objects was described as brighter than the known friendly aircraft.

It was the opinion of the pilot that these objects could have been released from the Antung airfield (37 2000N/128 E000') as the wind was coming from that direction at the time of the observation.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
J.R. This flight making this observation consisted of 2 F-84 aircraft, as identified by the pilot. The altitude of the sighting is estimated to be 10,000 feet. The size of the objects is estimated to be approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter. The ground speed of the objects is estimated to be approximately 100 knots.

On 19 April 1953 another F-86 pilot observed similar objects at 30,000 feet over the mouth of the Yalu River. His reported size of the objects to be larger than the 10 April 1953 observation. No other visual or radar contacts of the objects were made. The report indicates the objects were observed for approximately 5 minutes during both incidents.
