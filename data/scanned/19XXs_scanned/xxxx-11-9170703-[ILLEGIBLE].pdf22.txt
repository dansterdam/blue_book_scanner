TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1966

DULUTH, MINNESOTA 19 November 1967

I attempted to call Mrs. [REDACTED] in Duluth, Minnesota but was told telephone had been disconnected and no phone at all was listed for the person. Since she is a 20 year old practical nurse, she may be itinerant and floating from job to job. Description is that of "typical" (1) UFO, complete with "hovering" and "hush."

This should have been followed up immediately and Johnson contacted before she moved away. Pretty hard to trace.
