The document contains no actual photographs, but there are two sketched images. The first image is of a compass rose with the cardinal and intercardinal directions labeled. There are two letters, "A" and "B," placed on the compass, suggesting the directions of a phenomenon at the first and last sight respectively. The second image is a landscape with a person standing in the middle of a road, flanked by trees, and looking towards the sky where a dotted line with "A" and "B" marks the trajectory of a sighted phenomenon. To the right of the landscape sketch is a small circular inset magnifying the path between "A" and "B" in the sky.

Here is the text as it appears in the document:

---

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON OVER AN "*A*" AND "*B*", THAT IS, SchematicALLY SHOWING WHETHER MOVEMENT
APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE
THE LARGER SKETCH.
