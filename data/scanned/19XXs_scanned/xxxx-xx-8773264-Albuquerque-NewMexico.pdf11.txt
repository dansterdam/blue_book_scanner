Transcription of text from the document:

I, J.W. * * * being first duly sworn, upon my oath report and say:

That I am a citizen of the United States, a resident of the State of New Mexico and 53 years of age, having lived in Albuquerque for the past 8 years.

That on Saturday, August 9, 1952, at approximately 6:00 P.M., I and my wife were driving in our car near the * * * * home near Albuquerque, New Mexico, when we observed an object in the sky above the trees which was first seen by my wife and which I also saw. It appeared to be a round or slightly oval-shaped object, silvery in color, and it was moving at a fairly high rate of speed in a descending manner, and appeared to come to a stop in the sky. It remained stationary for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, then started to ascend in a straight line leaving no trail and disappearing from view. 

After observing this object for about three minutes, I then drove my automobile to the * * * * home where I obtained my camera and returned to the approximate location where I first saw the object. However, I was unable to locate the object again and it did not reappear.

I have had considerable experience in observing aircraft and am familiar with the appearance of conventional aircraft, both military and commercial, and I am confident that the object I observed was not any type of conventional aircraft.

Dated at Albuquerque, New Mexico, this 12th day of August, 1952.

Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 12th day of August, 1952.
