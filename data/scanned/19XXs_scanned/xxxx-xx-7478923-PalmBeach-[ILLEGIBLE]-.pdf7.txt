Palm Beach, Florida
JOHN E. SCH, 19 July 1952
I WAS AWAKE THERE WAS A HALIE CAR AND SUDDENLY CALLED AND SAID, "LOOK
UP, THERE IS A LIGHT IN THE SKY." I SAW THIS THING GO DOWN SWIFTLY AND THEN
HOVER THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT, THEN IT ROSE SWIFTLY AND SHOT OFF AND
WENT OUT OF SIGHT. I SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT UP THERE. . IT WAS FOLLOWING US
SEEMED TO BE DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. WHEN IT MOVED OFF IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT
SO FAST IT ALMOST DISAPPEARED. I KEPT WATCHING IT AND IT SEEMED TO CHANGE
SHAPE A LITTLE BIT, IT WAS ROUND AT FIRST AND THEN IT SEEMED TO GET A LITTLE
LONGER. I SAW THIS THING TWO TIMES THAT NIGHT, I WATCHED IT GO UP AND DOWN.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS. I WATCHED IT AS LONG AS I COULD SEE IT. IT
SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 3,000 FEET UP. IT WAS AN OBJECT AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED.
IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A SHOOTING STAR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT SEEMED
TO BE JUST HOVERING THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEN IT SHOT OFF SO FAST
THAT IT DISAPPEARED. THAT IS ABOUT ALL I SAW.
