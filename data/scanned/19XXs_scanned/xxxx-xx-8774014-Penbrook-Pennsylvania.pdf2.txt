SUMMARY: "Korefer to AK 37 64602 this Headquarters' reporting this incident under date of 24 May 1952." Investigatiomeconducted by this office has brought out the following information: 
AUGUST 1, 1952 - Investigatior by these-office inoated that the objects _____eserved during the time period mentioned were very likely conentional aircraft. The "objects" were seen to have-wing fts and to be maneuvering in the conventional manner of aircraft.
The "red trails" observed were very possibly the result of the aircraft's landing lights being reflected off residual moisture in the air. The "hovering" reported was very likely the "apparent hovering" often observed with aircraft at cruising altitude, wherein the craft seem to hang motionless in the air, but are actually moving, however, at a sufficient distance to make this motion undetectable to the eye.
A number of Air National Guard fighter aircraft are known to have been active in the area during the time of these incidents. It is considered that the "unidentified" phenomenon was, in all probability, these conventional fighter aircraft.
