SIR, THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL, A GROUND VIEW
SPEED UP ABRUPTLY
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
STANDS STILL, THEN SPEEDS UP
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR
SOUNDS A POOF?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

BEYOND SOME CLOUDS.

is it disappear or beyond some clouds.
