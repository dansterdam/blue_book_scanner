Raw text from the document:

On the evening of 18 March 1952, at approximately 11:30 P.M., AFRO observer sighted and tracked an unidentified object through radar scope. Object was first detected at a range of 3 miles from the AFRO observation point and subsequently tracked for a period of 15 minutes. During this time the object was observed to make a series of abrupt course changes at high speed and to reach altitudes in excess of 20,000 feet. At the completion of the 15 minute observation period, the object faded from the radar scope. 
The radar equipment employed was of standard AFRO design, fully calibrated and operating within normal tolerances. The object observed had a radar return characteristic consistent with an airborne target of substantial size and metallic composition.
