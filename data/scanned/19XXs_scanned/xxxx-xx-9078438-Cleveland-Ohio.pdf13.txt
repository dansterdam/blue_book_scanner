The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely a report from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects.

Transcribed text:

The weather conditions of approximately 12:30 p.m. was clear and I was in good health. The distance from where I was to where I saw the object was approximately 1/2 mile. The size of the object was approximately equal to a half dollar at arm's length. The shape of the object was round or circular. The color of the object was white or silver. The object moved in a straight line and then disappeared from sight. It was not making any noise. I saw the object for approximately 10 seconds. I feel the sighting was very real and I am quite sure of what I saw.
