TEPR(UFO) LT COL QUINTANILLA/70916/mha/10 JUL 63
UFO Observation, 13 June 1960

Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company
Akron, Ohio 14 Jul 63

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Dayton, Ohio, which occurred on 13 June 1960 between 0015 - 0030 hours, EDT.

2. The description of the UFO was similar to past descriptions of your billing. If the billing was operating in the Dayton area on the night of 12/13 June 1960, such information would be quite helpful to us.

3. Thank you for your continued assistance.
