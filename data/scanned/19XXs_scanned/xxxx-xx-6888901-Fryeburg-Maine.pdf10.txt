The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document with handwritten text. As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

The text on the page is handwritten and appears to be some kind of report or documentation. The text is difficult to fully decipher, but it seems to mention something about "a form" and "Mr. Cannon" along with other references that are not entirely clear.
