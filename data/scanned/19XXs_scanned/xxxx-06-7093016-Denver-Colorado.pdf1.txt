There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Denver, Colorado

10. CONCLUSION
Insufficient data for evaluation

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a large, fiery object falling toward the ground. It looked like an aircraft but was descending too fast. The object looked a bit like it was going to be a helicopter, but later movements ended this idea. The observers then thought the object looked as if it was going to crash, but it suddenly took off and disappeared from view. As the observers turned to go, it took off and finally disappeared from view.

Without an exact date it would be extremely difficult to determine any activity in the area which could have accounted for the observation. The information the case is being evaluated as insufficient data.
