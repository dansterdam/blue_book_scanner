FIREBALL OF 1952 SEPTEMBER 15
A.M.S. No. 2369
E. A. HARRIS and C. P. OLIVIER

On this date at about 8:55 p.m. a "slow" fireball was observed. The fireball's brilliancy is reported to have been noticed some time after the actual observation began. At first it was mistakenly thought to be a jet plane seen from the side illuminated by the quarter moon. Indeed several of the blighter stars in Aquila were mistaken for the object at the start. The direction of travel was from south to north. No clue as to its direction of course was given by the observer as the object appeared to travel in a straight line across the sky. At 8:58 p.m., near the eastern horizon and about 10 degrees above it, a bright point, all in Michigan, was seen to flash for an instant and then disappear. The fireball was observed for 2-3 minutes.

Sideral time at end point 2h 53m 42s, = 42°.8 = 2h 51m 12s.
Radiant area  R.A. 19h 47m Dec. + 5°  ± 2°
Projected length of path 300 km
Length of path less than 300 km (about 250 km or so every unsertain)
Velocity for curvature 43 km/sec (very unsertain)
Deceleration on entering atmosphere s = 300, h = 21 km
Radiant corrected a = 295°, d = 17°.

If our position of H3 is correct, the fireball pithed above the northern and eastern corners of Green Bay, or perhaps even in the Lake Huron in Michigan. Probable error, 12% and 15% respectively in determining altitude and azimuth.
