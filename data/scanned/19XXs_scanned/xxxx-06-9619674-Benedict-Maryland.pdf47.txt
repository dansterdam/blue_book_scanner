Dear Colonel Bower:

A further investigation of the incident referred to in your teletype of June 29, 1952 concerning the sighting of a lighted 100 gram pilot balloon with an ascent rate of about 1000 ft./min. which was released at 22:00 EST June 20, (210302) from the Loukes-Tyson Airport near Knoxville. This balloon was observed for 15 minutes at which time the lighting united. The 0902 radiosonde balloon from Nashville was followed presumably by an AST 658, to an altitude of 25,000 ft. No winds above 25,000 ft. were reported by this flight.

The 210302Z wind data from this area are as follows:
