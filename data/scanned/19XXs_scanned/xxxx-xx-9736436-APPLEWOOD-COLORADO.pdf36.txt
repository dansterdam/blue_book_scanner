Proposed reply to letter from July 30, 1957

Dear [redacted],

Reference your recent letter regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) which was observed in March 1957.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If your grandmother had reported her observation to the nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data base.

The enclosed brochure on the Air Force project on UFOs may be of interest to you. Thank you for bringing the observation to our attention.
