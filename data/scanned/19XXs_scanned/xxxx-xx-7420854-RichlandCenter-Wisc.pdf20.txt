MARCH 24, 1951, RICHLAND CENTER, WISCONSIN

On March 24, 1951, at about 9:30 P.M., Mr. Fred J. Braun, a 70-year old retiree, was walking home from a meeting of the Richland Center Rotary Club. As he was walking along Main Street, he noticed a strange object in the sky. He stopped and observed it for several minutes. The object was silvery in color, cigar-shaped, and completely silent.

Mr. Braun described the object as being about 50 to 100 feet long and 10 to 15 feet in diameter. It was traveling in a straight line at an estimated speed of 500 to 600 miles per hour, and was at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet. The object was visible for about 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from sight.

Mr. Braun reported the incident to the Richland Center Police Department, who in turn notified the United States Air Force. An investigation was conducted, but no definitive explanation was ever found for the strange object Mr. Braun had observed.
