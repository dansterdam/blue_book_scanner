This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document, containing a letter from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Wallops Station addressed to Colonel Hector Quintanilla, Jr., the Chief of the Aerial Phenomena Office.

The text of the letter is as follows:

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION
WALLOPS STATION
WALLOPS ISLAND, VIRGINIA 23337

May 10, 1968

Lt. Colonel Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
Department of the Air Force
Headquarters, Aeronautical Division (AFSC)
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

In reply to your recent memorandum, Wallops did not launch any rockets on September 27, 1967 which would have been responsible for your reported sighting at 0930Z. However, we did launch two Barium vapor experiments here on October 3 and 4, 1967, which were visible for hundreds of miles (copy of news release enclosed).

If we can be of any further assistance, please let us know.

Sincerely yours,

Joyce B. Milliner
Public Information Specialist
