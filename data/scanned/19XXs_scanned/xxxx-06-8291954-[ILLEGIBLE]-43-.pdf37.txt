Output of the text found in the document:

WHEN THE OBJECT FIRST APPEARED IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A QUARTER HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. IT WAS OVAL SHAPED AND HAD A METALLIC LUSTER. IT APPEARED TO GIVE OFF A REDDISH-ORANGE LIGHT. IT REMAINED IN ONE POSITION FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY IN A STRAIGHT LINE. AFTER IT HAD TRAVELED ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY ACROSS THE SKY, IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. THE ENTIRE SIGHTING LASTED APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE.

THIS IS A CASE OF THE TYPE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED A 'FLYING SAUCER'. VISUAL SIGHTINGS OF THESE OBJECTS HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS AND WELL-DOCUMENTED. MANY RELIABLE WITNESSES, INCLUDING MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PILOTS, HAVE REPORTED SEEING THEM. THEY SEEM TO POSSESS PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. THEIR ORIGIN AND NATURE REMAINS A MYSTERY.

TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE LACK OF ANY INFORMATION TO THE CONTRARY, IT DOES SEEM UNLIKELY THAT THIS PARTICULAR SIGHTING CAN BE EXPLAINED AS A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR BALLOON. THE HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND ABRUPT CHANGE IN DIRECTION SHOWN BY THE OBJECT ARE NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF KNOWN VEHICLES.
