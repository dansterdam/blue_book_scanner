The image contains a sketch and a compass illustration, but no photograph. The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show the path the object or objects made. Place an "X" on the same curved line to show where you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
