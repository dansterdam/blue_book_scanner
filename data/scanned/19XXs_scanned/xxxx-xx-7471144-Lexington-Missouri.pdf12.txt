There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a letter from Lt. Colonel Barnett B. Young of the U.S. Air Force Community Relations Division.

The text of the letter is as follows:

AUG 1 1967

Dear [redacted],

Reference your observation of March 12, 1967, and subsequent photographs of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Photographic analysis revealed that a certain amount of vertical distortion was present in the original "negative" or image of this object in the foreground. The vertical panning suggests that the object was sliding or falling and not hovering across the sky. The photography also indicates that the object was between the house and the observer, signifying that the object is much smaller than the fifteen or twenty feet in diameter reported in your observation.

We are including all of your negatives and prints along with an additional print of each negative.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

BARNETT B. YOUNG
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
