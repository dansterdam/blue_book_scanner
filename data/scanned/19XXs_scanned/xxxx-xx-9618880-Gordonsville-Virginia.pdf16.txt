Text in the document:
3. The Rescue Control Officer of the reporting organization checked with the Air Defense Ground Control and found that no aircraft was cleared to fly in the area at that time and that no aircraft was known to be operating or airborne. In addition, a check was made with the Transportation Officer at Ernest Harmon Air Force Base, Goose Bay, Newfoundland, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stationed at the Campbell's Creek area. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer stated that the noises in the Campbell's Creek area were so loud that road traffic noise could be distinguished from other noises.
4. The reporting officer stated that the reliability of Father Dominic, who had reported the matter, was unknown, but it is assumed that he undoubtedly heard some type of engine noise motivating him to make the report.
