The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photograph. The page is a questionnaire or form with questions, but the space for responses is blank.

As an OCR system, the text contained in the document is:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:      Day      Month      Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
