The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting on August 16.

Here is the text found in the document:

This replies to your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on August 16.

We are unable to offer any explanation because of insufficient data. Essential information, such as details which would allow characteristics, time of observation, location and evaluation of the report are missing. Further investigation of the alleged UFO sighting has not been possible. The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

BARNETT B. YOUNG
