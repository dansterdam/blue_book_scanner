IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT AN INTERESTING FACT BECAME APPARENT. THIS WAS THAT THE LOWER RIGHT-HAND QUADRANT OF THE CLOUD WAS VISIBLE & VISIBLE THROUGH THE GLARE OF THE SUN. THIS QUADRANT WAS SLOWLY DIMINISHING IN INTENSITY FROM BACK TO FRONT.
THERE WAS ALSO A DEFINITE POINT OR FOCAL POINT FOR THIS RADIATION THAT WAS NOTICED. IT SEEMD AS THOUGH THE RAYS WERE RADIATING FROM THIS POINT & DEFINITELY DIMISHING IN INTENSITY FROM THE BACK SIDE TOWARD THE FRONT.
WHILE I BELIEVE AN X-RAY PROJECTION CAUSED BY THIS SILENT OBJECT'S SURFACE ACTING AS A LENS OR PRISM & REFRACTING THE SUN'S RAYS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PRODUCE THIS EFFECT. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT AGREE WITH OBSERVED CHARACTERISTICS OF KNOWN PHYSICAL OR OPTICAL EFFECTS. AND IT IS THIS DIFFERENCE WHICH I WISH TO CONVEY.
THIS EFFECT, WHICH I WOULD CALL CORONA BUT WHICH IS NOT THE SOLAR CORONA, WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE & QUITE STRIKING. IT WAS LIMITED IN ANGULAR EXTENT & VERY LOCALIZED RATHER THAN AN ALL-OVER HAZE OR GLOW. IT LASTED FOR SOME MINUTES & THEN SLOWLY DIMINISHED UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER.
I HAVE AVOIDED DISCUSSING THIS SIGHTING WITH ANYONE, INCLUDING THOSE OTHER THAN OFFICIAL AGENCIES WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED PROFESSIONALLY. HOWEVER, I FEEL THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD BE REPORTED, AND I WILL EVENTUALLY DO SO.
I THINK WE REALIZE WILL WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. I WILL WANT TO GO AS FAR AS THIS LETTER HAS AND TO TRY TO COME UP WITH AN HYPOTHESIS TO EXPLAIN WHAT I OBSERVED.
YOURS TRULY
