There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text and a series of questions related to the observation of a UFO.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
it just seemed to fade away - very fast but gradual, there one minute and gone the next.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:
It seemed to move behind a cloud, but I'm not sure. It's hard to say for certain because it happened very quickly.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?  
(Circle One):   Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:
It seemed to move in front of a cloud, but I'm not sure. It's hard to say for certain because it happened very quickly.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - It made no sound at all
b. Color - Bright silver, metallic in appearance, no color changes

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match stick. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match stick?
Difficult to estimate, but it was a fairly large object, maybe 30-40 feet across.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
