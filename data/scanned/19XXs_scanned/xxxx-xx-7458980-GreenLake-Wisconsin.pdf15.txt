There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can output the following text found in the document:

"We wanted to notify us that it because of a strange sighting that happened and again the changing colors lights on the we call them a object so cannot say that we just happened to notice it in the sky. 
It seems that the object hovered and were and the varied in color
very slowly until this as no joke what we actually saw was a bright object hoverable it seemed to stand still all over  
against over in the sky and it disappeared  it long with other paper to know just what it was we saw
Thank you very much
