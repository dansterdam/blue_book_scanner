Galley 65-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
1) The photographs confirmed this reconstruction of a so-called "flying saucer" as well as size of the object was that of a twenty-foot sphere—photographed from a distance of 30,000 feet.
2) The pilots of the interceptors never saw this jet. What they saw—what their gun radar detected, and what their airborne observers saw through their scopes—was a spherical balloon, that had been released from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base that morning shortly before the sighting. Ground radar, on the other hand, never picked up the balloon.
3) The chief reason for the confusion was that ground radar did not have a height-finding device. When the operator notified the pilots that his scope showed a blinding of the return produced by the pursuit jets and by the unknown, neither he nor the pilots had any way to tell whether the unknown was directly above the jets or at a level too high to see the Cleveland jet far below them. But they did see the balloons above them and naturally assumed that it was the object they were supposed to be chasing.
4) Since the ground radar stopped functioning at this point, the operator could no longer track the course of the unknown or of the interceptors. If the radar had been working, he would have seen that the target continued on to the southwest while the interceptors were searching in a different area to the north.
