C. ANALYSIS
1. AERONAUTICAL FLYING - "Helicopter-like" Observed were two objects moving at a high rate of speed over Lake Huron that had a silvery color and appeared to have "legs" protruding from them. The objects were over 7 minutes.
2. I checked the following local military and commercial air activities and determined that there were no known aircraft in the immediate vicinity at the time of the sighting.
3. MAGNETIC - Major Ward, USAF Opns. Cen. reported that no unusual magnetic activity was observed at the time.
4. OTHER ASPECTS - Sergeant Annapolis, Passport Control, describes the shape and motion of the objects as being like that of "helicopters with legs protruding." He and three other persons observed the objects from a distance of about 2 miles for approximately 7-10 minutes.
