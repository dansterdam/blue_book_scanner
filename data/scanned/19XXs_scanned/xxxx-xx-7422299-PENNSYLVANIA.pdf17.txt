Pittanning, Pa.

Dear sir:

On the 13th of September, 1967 while on a deer spotting trip S and the others saw an object with red and green lights hovering around in the vicinity. The object was hovering at the end of the field approximately 500 yards from our position and it appeared to be a large object. It seemed to be about 50 feet or more in diameter. From our one and informed glimpse of the object it also seems to me that there was a very bright light in the center of the object. At this time the object started to move back and forth and up and down a distance of approximately 15-20 minutes. At this point it took off very rapidly towards the horizon.

Returning back to the area the next evening we discovered 3 small objects in the only moonlight across the field. The lights only lasted for a short while but anyone could not have missed them. The lights were not the usual red, white or green colors seen. The markings were very dim or may have been changing constantly across the skyline of the mountains in Pittanning (about 5 miles from Pittanning).

It seems the object of the 13th was about 700 feet or so in diameter.

I am a student of biological science at the Penn State University. I have seen this phenomenon before but cannot account for its true nature. I would like any information regarding this sighting if available.

Thank you.
