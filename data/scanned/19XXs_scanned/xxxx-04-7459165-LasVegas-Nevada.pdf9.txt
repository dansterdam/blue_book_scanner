There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a diagram and some handwritten text.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
I ONLY SAW THREE OBJECTS ONLY AFTER THE PRIMARY ONE HAD STOPPED MOVING AND THE TWO FAINT OBJECTS MENTIONED EARLIER DROPPED OUT IT APPROX. 1/2 TO 1 SECOND APART.
