REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
Many sightings
Mr. P. J. Burke, of Glanmire, Co.
Cork, Ireland, reported numerous
sightings on November 29.
Patrick Keardon of Glanmire, Co.
Cork, reported seeing a strange luminous object on November 29, about
eight minutes after 7 o'clock. As this
device passed overhead it appeared
to the observer at first like a childish
spinning top, slightly luminous and
about the size of a large orange.
It moved rapidly and silently, being
visible for about five minutes. As the
device approached it appeared larger,
and color seemed to vary. It was then
observed to be circular in shape, with
a central core and an outer rim, both
of which appeared to be luminous.
Color was grey, and appearance
reminded the observer of a large
mushroom or toadstool, suspended
in the night sky. He then lost sight
of the object.
The witness is a man of integrity
and sobriety. He was very definite
in his observations and could not
remember any illumination of the
object.
