The image does not contain a photograph, it shows a sketch or diagram with some text instructions related to UFO sightings and reporting. 

Based on the OCR, the text in the document is as follows:

27. In the left-hand sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" at the same curved line to show how high the object was when it passed closest to you. Place a "C" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.

28. In the circle, draw the path the object followed. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. 

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
