Transcribed text from the document:

ON 3 DECEMBER 1948, MR. X, CHIEF CLERK, ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, STUDEBAKER CORPORATION, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, REPORTED TO THE CHIEF, ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, STUDEBAKER CORPORATION, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, THAT ON WEDNESDAY, 15 OCTOBER 1948, AT APPROXIMATELY 11:45 HOURS, HIS ATTENTION WAS CALLED TO THE SKY BY WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A SHOOTING STAR. HE STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE FLASHING ON AND OFF AS IT TRAVELED ACROSS THE SKY FROM WEST TO EAST. HIS ATTENTION WAS ALSO CALLED TO THE UNUSUAL APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT. THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE LARGER THAN A SHOOTING STAR AND HE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. HE STATED THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME NEW TYPE OF TEST AIRCRAFT.

G. MR. SOUTH BEND, ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT, ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, STUDEBAKER CORPORATION, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, STATED THAT HE DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT AND SINCE HE HAD PASSED THE 60TH BIRTHDAY, HE DID NOT SAY ANY MORE ATTENTION TO CALIBER EMPLOYEES, AND WERE, IN HIS OPINION, TWO PERSONS THAT COULD BE REGARDED AS RELIABLE.

G. IN AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN MORE INFORMATION, THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL CHECKS WERE MADE:

A. THEY WERE NOT SURE THE OBJECT WAS ROTATING, BUT GAINED THAT IMPRESSION BECAUSE OF THE FLASHING OF THE SUN FROM ITS SURFACE.
