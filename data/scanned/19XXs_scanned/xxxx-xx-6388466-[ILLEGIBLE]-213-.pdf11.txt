Incident #212 -- Dayton, Ohio -- 9 December 1943

Little can be determined from the meager evidence concerning this incident. Two half-second pulses of light were observed. It is believed that these were caused by some sort of electrical disturbance in the atmosphere, and possibly a glint of light from the ground. Little information was obtained, and the circumstances surrounding the observation do not permit a good evaluation.

See report on incident #213, which apparently refers to the same observations.
