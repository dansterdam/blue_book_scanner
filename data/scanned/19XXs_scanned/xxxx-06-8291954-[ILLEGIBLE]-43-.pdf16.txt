28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.  

See pages 10, 16.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how were they related? For example, were they in a formation, and traveling in the same direction.

Clearly one object during 10 to 15 minutes on 2/25/50 at about 7:55 p.m. fighting. This object appeared circular and silver or white. It flew over my house, according to Lt. Reminger's report and my own. See page 15, contra.
