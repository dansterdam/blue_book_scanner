STATEMENT

On the 19 August 1952, at approximately 2000 P.M., Algiers took control of a target and from Cospas at 13,000, position 35,240N, longitude 3,05E at which time the first signal was received. A slight fluctuates in size and direction took place from 2000 to 2010, at which time the object appeared to have landed. Swann's Red leader then called Algiers stating that he was ready to engage the object as soon as he received clearance. Algiers advised him negatively, but Swann's Red said it could possibly be a "big photo flare" because Algiers was instructed to investigate the strange object.

Algiers then instructed Swann's Red to investigate the stranger. It was also that Algiers had no CPS-6B equipment in operation at Algiers at this time.

Lieutenant Colonel Swann's Red Leader, then reported that upon turning into the object, it began to move away in a southerly direction and disappear. Swann's Red was unable to overtake the object.

Algiers did not make radar pick-up on the unusual sighting at any time.

This called the controller Captain Barone) at Algiers and after listening to his description, he agreed that it did not appear to be any known aircraft. The air battle section was informed of the incident.
