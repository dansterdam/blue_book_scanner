The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document, possibly a report or letter.

Perhaps the last, cheeping, was over the hill, dropping the instruments to focal bore. When the night light appeared, which were affected to the pilot, I have tried to recall the facts. There was no actual landing or even approach or the sky was completely clear. Some J would not have paid very much attention to the lights if I didn't think I saw something. If I may suggest, a possibility is the delay in reporting. Here, my studies of the Area College say that I became aware of the incident through my own sources, necessitated the delay.

Sincerely yours,

P.S. Please notify me if the above does not accord with your understanding. I would be glad to have you reconsider if so.
