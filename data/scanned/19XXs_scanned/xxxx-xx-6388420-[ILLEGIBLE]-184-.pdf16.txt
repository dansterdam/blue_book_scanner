Incident was -- near Needlore, Germany -- 24 October 1943

It is very unlikely that this incident has any astronomical explanation. No trail nor luminescence was observed, and the object flew a straight and level course. This is quite different from the situation involving a possible astronomical hypothesis.

Could the object reported here have been a conventional aircraft viewed in a foreshortened aspect?
