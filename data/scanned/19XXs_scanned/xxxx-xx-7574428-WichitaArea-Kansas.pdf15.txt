WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

Dear Mr. Stuckey:

Reference is made to your letter dated July 2, 1957, concerning an unidentified flying object reportedly seen in the Wichita area of Kansas on June 30, 1957.

The file on this report has been reviewed, and it appears that the information supplied by the observer was not sufficiently descriptive to permit definite identification of the object. The report indicated that the object was silvery in color, round in shape, and estimated to be approximately 25 feet in diameter. The object was first seen at about 8:55 p.m. and was observed for about 2 minutes as it moved across the sky in a southeasterly direction at a relatively slow speed.

In accordance with your request, this report is being returned herewith. If any additional information should become available on this or any other unidentified flying object sighting, we would be pleased to receive it.

Sincerely yours,

Signed

CAPTAIN, U.S. AIR FORCE
Assistant for Unidentified Flying Objects
