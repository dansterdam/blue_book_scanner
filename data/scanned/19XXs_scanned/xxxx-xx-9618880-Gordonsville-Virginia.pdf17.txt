The image does not contain any photograph or visual information. It appears to be a typed letter or document. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document:

Reference is made to your recent telephone call to ATIC reporting an unidentified aerial object observed on 22 June 1952.

The Air Force appreciation of your offer to take measurements of the unidentified objects should they ever appear again. It is the policy of the Air Force, however, not to encourage the private citizens to expend their time and effort on the project unless it is routine that you may wish with some other interests.

The report that you gave to ATIC has been studied and incorporated in our files.

Very truly yours,

ROBERT B. KENNEDY 
Major, USAF
Air Adjutant General
