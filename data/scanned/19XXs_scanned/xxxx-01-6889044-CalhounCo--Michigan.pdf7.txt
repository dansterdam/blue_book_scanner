8. Conclusion by Mr. [redacted]
Believe it to be the last detached portion of the recently launched second stage object, approximately eight (8) minutes, as compared to four previous observations of "fire balls" disintegrating within 3 to 4 seconds. May be due to a far superior material and/or much colder atmosphere.
