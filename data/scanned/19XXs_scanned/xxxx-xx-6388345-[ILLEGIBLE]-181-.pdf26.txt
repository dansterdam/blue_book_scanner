UNCLASSIFIED

It pulled "G", but it was gone too fast.

The next, or second, interception was from the rear of the target as was the first; however, the target added a burst of speed dead ahead and outdistanced us immediately.

On the third interception, my pilot called a visual at 600 portables. By the time I made the pickup it was at 450 port 3000 and 50 below. My pilot made a violent starburst turn in attempt to head off the target. By the time we got easter of it, it was off again in a burst of speed and disappeared between nine (9) and ten(10) miles.

On the fourth interception, the pilot called to me that we had been passed from above from the rear by our target. I picked up the target as it went off my scope from five to ten miles dead ahead and slightly above. On the fifth and sixth interceptions, the target appeared at 9 plus miles doing approximately 200 mph. We had an advantage of 20 mph, making our IAS approximately 220 mph, a fast closure for a F-61 type aircraft. We closed in to 12,000 feet then, with a burst of speed the target pulled away to the outer limit of my set which is 10 miles for airborne targets. This took approximately 15 to 20 seconds.
