PROJECT BLUE BOOK
UNCLASSIFIED
SUBJECT: Project "Sign"
JAN 7 1949

TO: Chief of Naval Operations
Navy Department
Washington 25, D.C. 

This command is responsible for investigation of all reported incidents of unconventional aerial objects, commonly referred to as "flying at saucers".

Several incidents listed as "objects" in the past have been identifiable as conventional aircraft, balloons, astronomical phenomena, etc. It is possible that some of these reports may have been caused by the recent extensive publicity given to "flying saucers", which might have caused some individuals to report objects with more enthusiasm than objectivity. 

ANY ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS INFORMATION AND SUGGESTIONS
ARE REQUESTED.
