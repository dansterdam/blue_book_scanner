The UFO came up within a 1/4 mile of the witness and was about 200 feet in the air, dime shaped, silver in color and 30-40 feet wide. It hovered for about 15-20 seconds, then quickly accelerated straight up out of sight. The witness reported no sound coming from the object. No other witnesses were known.  The object was visible from 11:15PM to 11:30PM. The report states that the witness was not mistaken and his description was credible. The report concludes that the description matches other reliable sightings of unidentified objects and that it does not appear to be any conventional aircraft.
