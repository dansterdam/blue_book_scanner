The image contains a photograph of a handwritten form from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a report of a UFO sighting. The form includes questions about the sighting, such as whether the object disappeared, moved behind something, or moved in front of something. The witness has provided detailed responses to these questions. The form also includes a drawing of a round or disc-shaped object labeled "Perfect Round", which the witness has sketched to illustrate the shape of the observed object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The object continued to a central bright spot which then went out like a candle.
15. Did the object move behind anything at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what in front of
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Like a blaring siren on and off for a second
b. Color: White
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
