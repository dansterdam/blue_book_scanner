BLACK BRANT IIIB ROCKET LAUNCHINGS

A more powerful Black Brant IIIB rocket, built by Bristol Aerospace of Winnipeg, was launched yesterday at 2:26 p.m. EDT by NASA at the Wallops Island, Virginia launch site.

The Canadian rocket, using a higher impulse solid propellant, carried a payload to an altitude of about 135 miles. The present Black Brant III is capable of carrying an 88-pound payload to 114 miles.  

Two of these uprated rockets were scheduled to be fired from Wallops Island for vehicle testing. The first was successfully launched at 1:57 p.m. on February 23.

NASA contracted with the company to modify the existing Black Brant III for a more powerful propellant to enable the rocket to reach altitudes in excess of 200 kilometers with nominal scientific payloads.

Ralph Bullock was the Bristol Aerospace Project Manager. Arthur A. Rudmann was the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Vehicle Manager, and Roger P. Havaree and Robert E. Smith were the NASA Wallops Island Project Engineers.
