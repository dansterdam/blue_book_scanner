The transcribed text from the document is as follows:

"I have read over the book & would call the same a UFO. In the daytime there were several of them and a large one. These a) got as big as 27 ft. or more in the sky, they could hover and turn at all angles very noiselessly. They made maneuvers and figures through the sky at great speed that ordinary planes cannot do. I was on the local side road just west of hwy. 3127 in Plaquemine, La. and know what I saw. I think you for your interest and sincerely thank you for your help."
