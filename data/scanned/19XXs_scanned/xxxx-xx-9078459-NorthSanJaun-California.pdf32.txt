North San Juan Waits
In Vain To See Saucer
Then a Catholic nun from St.
Mary's Academy in Grass Valley reported she had seen and talked with the flying saucer, the
whole affair began about two
weeks ago when two boys
said they had seen a flying
saucer. They said they were
at first surprised and then
alarmed at the sight. One of
the boys, a 13-year-old, told a
California Highway Patrolman
of seeing the flying object on
June 12, yesterday the people
who came to North San Juan
to see the saucer were disappointed. No saucer appeared.

The lay then reported that it
was coming back the month
of July, so the people waited.
But as June 17, yesterday,
rolled around, no saucer appeared, and the disappointed
people began to go home.
The town that normally has a
couple of hundred residents
was the scene of more than
a thousand visitors the last two
weeks, all looking for the flying saucer. The bars were doing a landoffice business.
The one point still in doubt Bars the that the stories still are very difficult to obtain.
