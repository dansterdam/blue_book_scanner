STATISTICAL REPORT OF VISUAL RADAR INDICATIONS

TITLE: CHICAGO (IDYWY) AIRPORT TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER
LOCATION: CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 
DATE: 2-13-47

CONTACT HISTORY: This is a report of visual radar indications observed by controllers of this facility on duty from 2230 to 0230 CST. Weather was scattered clouds, visibility 10-15 miles.

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION: Sightings were made on the PPI scopes of the GCA and ASR radars. These targets were observed to move at speeds estimated in excess of 1000 mph, with sharp changes in course and rate of speed. Their course was directed to the east and then southeast until target extinguished beyond range of radars. The targets appeared at irregular intervals over a period of 2 hours.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: Air Defense Command was notified at 0112. This notification was acknowledged. No other aircraft were in the area and no visual sightings were made. The targets were first picked up at 5314 and were tracked to approximately 3312Z, when they disappeared from radar scopes. No returns were noted on the scopes for the remainder of the watch.

EQUIPMENT CONDITION: Radars were operating normally throughout the time period and contact history as described.

CONCLUSIONS: The objects observed exhibited performance characteristics beyond the capabilities of any known type of aircraft. They maneuvered at speeds far in excess of anything attainable by current aircraft design and their course headings showed no conformity to any known air traffic pattern. The targets were real and unidentified.
