The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions for an exercise. The diagram includes a compass rose and a sketch of an object in the sky, along with instructions for the observer to imagine the object's path and position.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point marked "A" and are looking at the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

A compass rose is shown below the diagram.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
