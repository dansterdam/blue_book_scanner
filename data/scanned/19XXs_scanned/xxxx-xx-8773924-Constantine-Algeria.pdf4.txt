METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying the motion and behavior of their "shooting stars".

Mr. G. A. Linnartz, an officer aboard the American C. S. S. Norman, reports that at 1720 Greenwich, December 16, 1955, he observed a brilliant meteor. It appeared near Deneb at 30° altitude bearing 310° and moved toward the horizon and disappeared at an altitude of about 5°, at which time it became very bright and left a trail which lasted about 25 seconds. During the entire time of observation the meteor appeared to be of a greenish-blue color.

On the same night, at approximately 29.94 inches, air temperature 81° F., sea temperature 55° F., another similar meteor was seen both before and after the first, but only for a very short period of time.
