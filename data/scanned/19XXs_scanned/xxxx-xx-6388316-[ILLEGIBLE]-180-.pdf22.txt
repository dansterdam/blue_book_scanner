ATTN: MCICO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, GIAXS-2-2, dated 9 March 1949, subject: "Unidentified Flying Objects." Your first indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summarizes 173 through 233 have been checked against the information which was made by the Air Force, Navy and Intelligence Bureaus. Comments based on this review are included.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 3, "Direction of Flight" of flight of objects should be clarified so that "vertical motion" is distinguished if possible, and so that motion is qualified as to speed which should be recorded. It is difficult to secure reliable estimates of speeds of objects observed. The observation and recording of this type of data requires careful techniques and should be standardized.
