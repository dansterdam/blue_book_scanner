Dear Sir, I appreciate your willingness to take such an interest in the flying saucer matter. However, I must decline to discuss the details of any particular case further, since in view of the fact that the matter was covered in the newspapers, publicity is undesirable. I hope you will accept my sincere thanks for your time and cooperation in this regard.

Sincerely yours, [Redacted]

P.S. I would like to have an answer as soon as possible.
