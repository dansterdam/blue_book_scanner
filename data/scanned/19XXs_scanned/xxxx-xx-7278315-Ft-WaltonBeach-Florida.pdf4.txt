My son and I were fishing for bass and spotted a strange object in the sky. It was silver, disc-shaped and appeared to be in control of an experienced pilot. It hovered above a hill for approximately 45 minutes. The object then zoomed straight up at high speed and disappeared. This occurred on June 25, 1954, around 5:00 PM near Ft. Walton Beach, Florida. The weather was clear and the object never came closer than about 1/2 mile. It made no noise and did not seem to have any exhaust. There were no other witnesses, but my son and I are confident of what we saw. I would appreciate any information you can provide on similar sightings.
