Dear Sir:
My sister, Mrs. --, enclosed to me to write and tell you our experience with the UFO. We were on Highway C in Bourbon, no. on Tuesday March 7th. I looked out the window at 6:55 p.m. and there was a disc-shaped object hovering over the trees directly across the road. It was a bright, silvery thing and it stayed there for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. My sister called her neighbor Esther about it. Esther said that she had also seen it. After that it took off and it vanished suddenly. It was just like it had vanished. Later in the evening, around 8:30 p.m. we heard a noise outside and went to the door to look. We saw it again, very close to the ground, hovering there and then it went down on the ground after we lost sight of it and stayed until 9:30 p.m.
 They never came from or went to any place to place. It was just like it had vanished. Later in the evening, around 8:30 p.m. we heard a noise outside and went to the door to look. We saw it again, very close to the ground, hovering there and then it went down on the ground after we lost sight of it and stayed until 9:30 p.m. 
I didn't sleep after I saw this, was worried about my sister. She and her husband who has had a stroke are alone out there. There have been a lot of people in and out of there since this thing. 
I called the Highway Patrol. They told me they had reports each that this was happening. Then I called the airport in St. Louis. They told me to call Scott in Belleville. This man answered you have the wrong dept. I can't be of any assistance in this matter. I would have to try the State Police again if you need any more information.
