2 Deputies Spot UFOs
Two sheriff deputies, one in North Brevard and the other in South Brevard, reported seeing unidentified flying objects Saturday night. 
Deputy Jim Schmidt reported seeing a blue star-like object showing very fast towards the southwest. He said he saw it over SR 520. 
The other sighting came from Deputy Dick Granger who drove black objects across the northwest over the Banana River. He was on SR 520.
Both sightings lasted two minutes. Granger reported watching the two UFOs through binoculars.
