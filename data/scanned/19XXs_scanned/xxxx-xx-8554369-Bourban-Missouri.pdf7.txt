Approximately three feet long protruding from all sides except toward the back of the object. The legs had white lights on the end of each one. The object emitted a whirring noise whenever it moved, and the whole object appeared to be covered by a "haze". The object seemed to receive a "beep" signal on her TV whenever the objects were in the area. Also, the furnace made a roaring noise and acted erratically whenever the objects were present. Many people in the area had complained of unusual luminance or strange odor of ozone peel in the outside area when the object had been sighted.

The objects appeared to the witnesses as well as clouds during rain and wet storms. They can be seen shortly after dark and sometimes stay throughout the night.

Mrs. dog seems to sense the objects, and barks whenever she is in the vicinity.

Mrs. attends an invalid husband and is fearful of going outside to investigate; therefore, has never attempted to approach the objects.

There is a garden approximately 100 yards from Mrs. home containing rhubarb, and she claims that one of the leaves was torn and burned, and some stalks pulled out of the ground.

She has counted as many as a dozen lights at one time hovering and flitting about her yard. It is the garden and in the trees. She has observed them more than once, but this did not make them more distinct in form.

Mrs. has been told that the area is a magnesium deposit, and feels that "forces" foreign growing into this matter and saving it for their own use.
