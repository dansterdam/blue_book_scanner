REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighted Over Columbia, South Carolina on June 26, 1952.

1. On 26 June 1952, this office received a telephone call from Mr. E. K. Pinson, stating that an unidentified flying object had been observed in the vicinity of Columbia, South Carolina, at approximately 1800 hours on that date.

2. Mr. Pinson reported that while driving on U.S. Highway 21, approximately five miles north of Columbia, he had observed a bright, disc-shaped object in the sky. The object was traveling in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed and at a high altitude. Mr. Pinson stated that the object appeared to be approximately fifty feet in diameter and was visible for approximately two minutes before disappearing from sight.

3. This office immediately dispatched an investigator to the area to conduct an on-site investigation. The investigator interviewed Mr. Pinson and several other witnesses who had also observed the object. All of the witnesses provided consistent descriptions of the object, and it was determined that the object was not a conventional aircraft or other known type of aerial vehicle.

4. The investigator was unable to locate any physical evidence or other tangible data relating to the sighting. No photographs or other documentation were obtained.

5. This report is submitted for your information and further action as deemed appropriate.
