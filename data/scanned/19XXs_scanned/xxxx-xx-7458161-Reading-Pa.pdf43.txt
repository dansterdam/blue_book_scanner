"Additional Information

A survey of the area around the key property was made on April 22nd, 1952, by Capt. Ralph S. Mayhill. The surrounding fields are very low, and the terrain is generally flat. It is between 3 and 4 miles from the nearest town, Reading, Pa. The only buildings in the immediate vicinity are a few farm houses.

The object was first sighted by Mr. Hubert L. Heckert, who lives on the Stettler property. He was feeding his cows about 6:30 p.m. on April 22nd, 1952, when he noticed the object in the sky. At first he thought it was an aircraft, but after watching it for a short time he realized it was not an aircraft, as it was hovering and making no sound. He called his wife and son to observe the object. They watched it for about 10 minutes, during which time it did not move from its position. It then suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. Witnesses described the object as being silver in color, round in shape, and about the size of a "basketball" at arm's length. They also stated that it gave off a dull glow.

The Witnesses:
Hubert L. Heckert
Age: 46
Occupation: Farmer
Address: Stettler property, Reading, Pa. 
Ethel Heckert (wife)
Age: 44
Occupation: Housewife
Address: Stettler property, Reading, Pa.

The Air Force report concluded that the object was a reflection of the sun on a weather balloon. The Chief has directed that no further investigation is necessary on this case."
