Transcription of the text in the document:

Sensational flying saucer photograph was investigated as to authenticity. The photograph is enclosed and shows an object which appears to be a flying saucer. The object was photographed on August 23, 1952 and is approximately 11 feet in diameter.

Photo 7 miles north of Riverdale, Maryland indicates that the object was hovering and no sound was heard. The witness, a university professor, was able to take 3 pictures of the object before it disappeared. A physical examination of the original photograph reveals no indication of tampering or double exposure.

Based on the investigation, it is the opinion of this office that the photograph is genuine and represents an unknown type of aerial vehicle. The witness is a reputable person and there is no reason to doubt his story.

Pending this report, it is suggested that if further information or additional evidence comes to light, the case should be reopened for additional investigation. Please advise if you require any additional information.

Respectfully yours,
