The text of the letter is as follows:

SAFOTCG/mrs Cassel/jad/72079/8 May 67

MAY 8 1967

Dear Mr. Cassel:

This replies to your letter reporting the April 22 unidentified flying object (UFO) sighted by you and your friends.

However, without essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sighting, etc., it is impossible for me to analyze and evaluate the data. Nor can I determine the time and location of your sighting. I don't know what it was you saw - it may or may not have been a UFO as any aerial phenomenon or object within the atmosphere can be classified as such according to the ordinary usage of the term.

Thank you for your letter; we appreciate your interest in our program. I have attached some reading material which I think you will find interesting.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
