PRODUCED TEXT FROM OCR:

I am enclosing herewith a copy of a report which has been turned over to me by Mr. _________________, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, concerning his observations of a strange aerial object which he claims to have sighted over Pittsburg, Pa., on April 7, 1959.

Mr. _________________'s report is essentially as follows:

At approximately 8:50 P.M. on the evening of April 7, 1959, the witness was standing near the rear of his home at 7________ Street, Pittsburgh, Pa., looking northward. He noticed a bright object high in the sky which appeared to be moving slowly. He observed the object for several minutes and noted that it seemed to change colors from white to red and back again. The object was silhouetted against the night sky and appeared to be elliptical in shape. It moved in a straight line for a time, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The witness states that he has no explanation for what he saw and that he has never before observed anything like it.

The report is of interest inasmuch as it is one of a number of reports received by this office concerning strange aerial objects sighted over the Pittsburgh area during recent months. In the absence of any conclusive proof or scientific analysis, however, this office can make no definite determination as to the nature or origin of the object described. The report is being filed as part of the records of Project Blue Book for such future reference as may be warranted.
