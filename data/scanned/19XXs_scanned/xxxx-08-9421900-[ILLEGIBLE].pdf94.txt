The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a section titled "Saucer-Type Object 'Seen'" that provides a description of a sighted unidentified flying object. However, there is no photograph or image present in this particular document page.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Saucer-Type Object 'Seen'
At approximately 2:00 P.M., April 29, 1952, Mr. XXXXX reported that while en route on U.S. Highway 75, between Denison and Sherman, Texas, he observed a saucer-type object. 
Mr. XXXXX stated that the object was round, appeared to be silver in color, and was traveling at a high rate of speed. He estimated the object to be about 50 feet in diameter and at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. 
The object was in sight for about 5 to 10 seconds. Mr. XXXXX stated that the object appeared to be under control and was traveling in a level flight path.
