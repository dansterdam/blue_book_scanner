There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing questions and text fields for the observer to fill out.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The observer has provided a handwritten response, which appears to say "Just vanish out of sight".

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
The observer has circled "Yes" for this question.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The observer has circled "Yes" for this question.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Quiet
b. Color - White

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The observer has provided a handwritten response, which appears to say "Just a tiny bit".

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving.
The observer has provided a simple sketch of an oval-shaped object.
