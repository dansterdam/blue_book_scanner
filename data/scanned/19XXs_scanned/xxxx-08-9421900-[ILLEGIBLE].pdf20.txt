CALLED WAKE ISLAND CONTROL TOWER AT 1811303Z AUG AND ASKED IF AF0
PE53087 HAD SIGHTED AN OBJECT AT 1715172. TOWER REPLIED NEGATIVE, HAD SEEN NOTHING "AT THAT TIME". SPEED OF THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF A JET FIGHTER ON FINAL APPROACH, BUT THE MOVEMENTS DESCRIBED COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PERFORMED BY AN AIRPLANE. NO WEATHER BALLOONS WERE KNOWN TO BE IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME. AND BY VIRTUE OF THE REPORTED INTERMITTENT BLINKING LIGHT AND MOVEMENTS OF THE OBJECT CONSIDERED COMPARABLE TO PREVAILING WINDS IT IS CONSIDERED UNLIKELY THAT THE OBJECT WAS A BALLOON. BIRDS ARE RULED OUT BECAUSE OF THE BLINKING LIGHT AND THE REPORTED SPEED OF THE OBJECT.  
NO SEARCH-LIGHT WAS REPORTED IN OPERATION ANYWHERE IN THE VICINITY AT THAT TIME. THE PREPARING OFFICER CONSIDERS THE TWO OBSERVERS TO BE HIGHLY RELIABLE. BOTH REPORTED THAT THEY SEEN ANYTHING WITH WHICH TO COMPARE THIS OBJECT. NO OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE OTHER THAN THAT CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.

AT NOTE: ADV CY DELIVERED TO DIA and NIN.
