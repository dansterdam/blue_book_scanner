Text from the document:

I am submitting this statement as I read some months ago that the Air Force was desirous of having reports of unexplained sights or objects that might be of interest in establishing probability is a very simple explanation. I left Jackson by plane at 7:00 a.m. on the next Thursday, 18 May 1967, and I do not know whether there were other public reports of this incident.

If this statement is deemed worthy of investigation, I would appreciate receiving information on any findings resulting from such an investigation.
