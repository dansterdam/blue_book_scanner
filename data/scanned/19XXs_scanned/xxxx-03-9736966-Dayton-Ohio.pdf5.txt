The image appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains two illustrations - one showing a sketched diagram with compass directions and angles, and another showing a compass-like symbol. 

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there? ONLY ONE
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

REALLY SURE THERE WERE ONLY ONE OBJECT IM NOT CERTAIN THAT THERE WERE
