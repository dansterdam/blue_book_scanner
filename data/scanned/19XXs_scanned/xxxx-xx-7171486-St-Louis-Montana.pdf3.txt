There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document, with text handwritten on it. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

"27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. 
If it had been a plane at about 3000ft to 5000ft, I'm sure I could have heard some noise, even if the engine had been cut. I'm sure I could hear the swish of the air with this thing I heard absolutely nothing."
