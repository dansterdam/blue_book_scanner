The image appears to contain a black-and-white photograph of a handwritten or typed document. There is no photograph or image of a UFO visible in this particular page. 

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially indicate trails or vapor trails.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
                  b. Like a bright star
                  c. Sharply outlined
                  d. Don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
