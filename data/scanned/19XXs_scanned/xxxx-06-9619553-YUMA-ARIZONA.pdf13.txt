Object was sighted approximately 1430 (2:30 pm) on a very clear day with little or no wind at the sighting. The object was starting as it was spotted and was showing face up a little at the edges. It was spinning rapidly and noticed it just before it started moving away. As it moved away, it was slowing down and rising up. It was possible to estimate its speed and size, but not knowing its exact distance, it was not possible to estimate its actual size. It was impossible to estimate its size or height with any degree of accuracy.
