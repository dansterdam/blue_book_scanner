What did you observe and what was peculiar about the thing as it appeared to you?
This object was observed and there was the fighter plane at the pattern and the thing, they disappered all of a sudden and the lights went out.
HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? It disappeared gradually and then all of a sudden the light went out.
DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND, IN FRONT OF, OR ALONG SIDE OF SOMETHING LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? No, I don't see that. It was up in air and it was by itself, an unusual object.
