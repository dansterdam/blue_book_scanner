Just was me standraa on he edoe of he highway and saine some lirnt objects up In the sky. They appeared ro be to erge for aeroplanes and I wes told that they wore stsrs. However some three of them appeared to be glmag off the grounu and I saw thes glee alowly up and then fall quickly to the ground seaet sny eaplosion or noise. Another time I was flying in an airplane and I saw three objects that appeared suddenly and then disappearad just as suddenly. They appeared to be like lights similar to the lights on sn airplane but they had no wing or tail and they moved at a speed thet I could not comprehend. Another time I was driving alone and suddenly three objects appeared in the sky and they jast seemed to stay stationary for a few seconde and then suddenly moved off at a terrific speed, first one way and then another at speeds that seemed incredible to me. Also there seems ro be a lot of activity at night in the sky over this area and many people have reported seting strange objects. I cannot give you any more specific details on this as I have only seen thee things a few times and my observations are limited. But I am convinced that there is something going on up there that we do not understand.
