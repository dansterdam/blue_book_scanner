Text in the document:

Dear Sirs:

I would like to report a UFO sighting. We were driving to grand field-target shooting vicinity on April 17, 1954. At approximately 10:30 PM, on a clearnight sky, my wife and I saw this black, egg-shaped object fall from the sky, and hit the Ground near the river, and it then continued on along the bank for about 30 yards and then lift off again. I then followed it on my car for 3 or 4 miles until it went out of sight. The object appeared to be about 750 feet long, oval shaped, and passed less than 100 feet over our car traveling at a very high rate of speed. We saw no visible means of propulsion, just silence. I would like to get this on record to your department. Please advise.

Sincerely,
