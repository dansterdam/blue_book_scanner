Air Intelligence Information Report
From: (Agency)
Date: (Date) 19 August 1952
Subject: Algiers, Algeria

Statements:
On the 19 August 1952, at approximately 2000 PAST, Algiers took control of an unidentified flying object which they were able to track for some periods of time at a speed of approximately 250 mph.

The pilot did not appear to be a man as he had a strange shape and it was difficult to determine what type of being he was. He could possibly be a 6-ft. Photo because it appeared to be a large vcon affair.

Lt. Otis, former Air Leader, then reported that when turning into the strong wind, it appeared to have no difficulty in moving, in fact, it seemed completely under control in moving away from them in an easterly direction and disappearing into space.

Algiers did not make radar pick-up on the unusual object at any time.

The Cdt. did consider that the object seemed to have an appearance of a large vcon affair, but it did not have on the stronger as it was in our clutter area, in the vicinity of La Maison Blanche.
