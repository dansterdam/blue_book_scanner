Incident: 2CCD

At about 1610, 17 Oct 1948 Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] observed a small silver colored object appearing above the trees. It was preceded in a southerly direction by a greenish flash of light. The object remained in view for about 1.5 seconds, traveling at an estimated speed between 20 and 25,000 feet. The object made a 15-20 degree turn and then appeared to speed up. As the object reached the sun, its outline became very sharp, at which time the sun hit it topside, the object then made a sharp turn to the south and gradually disappeared.

The subject is about 17 years of age, of good character and reputation. He is considered reliable.
