The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten text. The text appears to be a description of some type of unidentified flying object observation. It mentions two objects, one larger than the other, and describes their behavior and movement. The text also includes a request at the bottom that asks the reader to "Please Answer as Soon as possible, send me some UFO and Pamphlet Free of Charge".

Extracting the text from the document:

the light seemed to explode, then contract. It changed colors it always stayed the same 5 colors. It would speed up to cover a great distance in a second, then slow down to a crawl. It was hovering with the approach of an airplane when it suddenly disappeared. When South west to south east way it could of been a ship.
There were 2 objects. one about one quater as big as the other. object appeared from the bigger one. (we think it was because it want over to look at the other one. it curved around and came down again and moved away. ) then the little one stopped the bigger one, and started up and kept going. disappearance, it was going FAST.
Please Answer as Soon as possible, send me some UFO and Pamphlet Free of Charge.
