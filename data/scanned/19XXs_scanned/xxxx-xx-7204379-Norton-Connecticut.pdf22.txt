The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with handwritten text.

in reply to the questions on the enclosed carbon copy of a letter from Major Tucker, are the following:-

1) The angular estimation of the object observed was through the binoculars.
2) It was an estimate of a portion of the angular size.
3) The field of vision of my binoculars, when focusing on the object, is close to 5Â°.
4) I have never seen a meteor through binoculars.

N.B. There was no trail or brighter portion or change in intensity.
There are no search lights in this area. There was no haze or clouds.
