North San Juan Boy: Saucers May Return
NORTH SAN JUAN (UPI) -- that the saucer people, recently said the saucer people come to see humans and had children with them. They even talk like humans, explained the boy who said the saucer people told him two of their ships have been shot down over a California mining town Saturday, a 12-year-old over military missile installations. They told the lad "they'll be back this month," and then got more specific. He said the saucers will land Saturday, he took six photographs of the Unidentified Flying Object which is round, landed. The Air Force isn't taking any chances, Joseph A. Nile, information officer at nearby Air Force base, said, but there's no doubt in my mind of Tony's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Russell Spruill from Mount St. Mary's Academy. "Tony knows things that none of us know," said Mrs. Spruill as they exchanged information on their sightings and related incidents.
