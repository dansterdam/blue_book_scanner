The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, likely an eyewitness report or account of a UFO sighting.

Suddenly from a great distance, a faint light began to grow an oscillating character would number it. It moved nearer it became more luminous, and seemed to be pulsating. A bright reddish-white light emerged, which had a triangular section in it's center. The object remained quiet and motionless and this is the way it remained.

There was a number of the family, who I knew were awake and witnessed the object. It seemed to be circular in shape and was visible to others. By the time the light seemed to diminish, but I watched it until it disappeared from sight.

The spectator went back to bed and I lay watching the expectation of seeing a witness to the object's return. But I saw nothing more, until gradually the huge orange light was in full view, with no sound, and continuing to diminish as if just before motion.

These are facts, just as they happened, related as accurately as I possibly could recall them.
