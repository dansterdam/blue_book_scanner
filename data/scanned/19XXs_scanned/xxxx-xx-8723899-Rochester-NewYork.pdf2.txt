The image does not contain a photograph, it is a page from an old UFO report document. 

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
went the horizon

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes   No   Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Metallic 
b. Color red luminous

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
A quarter of the UFO

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
