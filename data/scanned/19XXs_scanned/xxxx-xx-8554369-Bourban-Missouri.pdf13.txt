DEAR MR. * * *

This refers to your inquiry in behalf of me regarding the unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings.

Within the Department of Defense the Air Force has the responsibility of investigating UFO reported sightings. In determining whether or not these objects constitute a threat to our national security. This program, Project Blue Book, is explained in the attached brochure.

Blue Book personnel at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base inform me that they have not received any UFO reports from Mrs. Brees' area. However, since February 1, 1967, six reports have been received from your state - these were from Bluebird, Missouri, Kansas City, and Springfield. Two of the reports have been evaluated as the planet Venus. Venus, with a stellar magnitude at this time of year of -3.4, is the brightest astronomical body in the western sky. The other reports have been evaluated as possible aircraft performing various maneuvers, refueling missions, etc.

I have included an AF Form 117 which is used in officially reporting a sighting to the Air Force. If Mrs. * * * will complete this form, an attempt will be made to evaluate the sightings in her area and if other evidence should be made available to NICAP/AFSC, Headquarters USAF (AFRDC).

It has been a pleasure to be of assistance to you in this matter.
