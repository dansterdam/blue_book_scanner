The date and time when I say the object was December 28, 1955 - about 9:30 pm. I was driving north on Highway 85-87 just north of the intersection of Highway 105, about 5 miles north of Monument, Colorado. The object was first spotted in the western sky, and it moved very rapidly in a horizontal direction, from right to left, disappearing completely after about 10-15 seconds. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape, and it was a bright orange-red color. There were no other lights or appendages visible. The size appeared to be approximately the diameter of a full moon. The weather was clear at the time, with no clouds in the sky. The object made no sound that I could hear. This was the only observation I have ever made of this type of object.

33. When and in what did you report that you had seen the object?
