The text of the letter is as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON D.C.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

September 4, 1968

Dear [redacted],

This replies to your letter of August 28, in which you reported sightings and your friends' sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFO's).

Without additional information, we cannot offer explanations of what either of you might have seen. However, if each of you will supply one or more witnesses, we will then be in a better position to investigate further and make an on-the-scene investigation. If your local Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to investigate further and make an on-the-spot investigation, they will be advised to report this sighting. It is very important that as large a number of people as possible see the questionable objects, because we cannot accept accounts of sightings by a single observer.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the Commanding Officer, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. He will then be able to take steps to have an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sightings by matching the characteristics of objects reported as UFO's in the news media.

Sincerely,

(Signed)
JAMES H. ATCHISON
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
