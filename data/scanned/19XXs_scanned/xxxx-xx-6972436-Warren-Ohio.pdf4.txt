1. Refer your letter to your letter of 28 May 1963. Attached is a summary on the 3 March 1963 satellite decay observations and a general plotting of the reports we received on this sighting.

2. Unfortunately, we do not have any meteor reports for 19/20 March 1960. However, if we do come across any for these dates, we will immediately forward copies to you.

3. We have a UFO report for 12 April 1963, 2330 EST, from Warren, Ohio. The witness sighted several brightly-lit objects that traveled westward. They were observed for three to four seconds and were described as flying in a "V" formation. Did you receive any meteor reports for this date and time that could account for the sighting?
