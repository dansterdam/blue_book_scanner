26. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object of similar shape, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

I'd estimate the shape to be a sphere or saucer-shaped, rather metallic or reflective, and flew with some reasonable speed without apparent external propulsion. It sounded like a fairly typical UFO report.
