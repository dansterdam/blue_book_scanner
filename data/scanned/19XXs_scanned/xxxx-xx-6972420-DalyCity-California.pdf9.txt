The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a horizon line with a curved line above it, representing the path of an object observed in the sky. There is also a compass rose diagram in the top right corner of the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass (skyline) to show the direction (compass bearing) when you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass (skyline) to show the direction (compass bearing) when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was *MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? _nine_.
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
they spread out like this as they m made the change in direction.
after the change in direction, they reformed like this: they were still in this formation when they disappeared.
