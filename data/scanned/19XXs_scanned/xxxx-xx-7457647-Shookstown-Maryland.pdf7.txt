There is no photograph present in this document. The document appears to be a handwritten letter from someone describing their UFO sightings and theories. The text of the letter is as follows:

"night and the wind was blowing just a little bit. See drawing "B".
Now that I have finished with my sightings, I will start with my UFO theory. You have heard about Jean Dixon, the Washington, D.C. woman who predicted J.F.K.'s murder? In many cases people have communicated with space beings through "mental telepathy", a type of U.S.P. I believe that clairvoyants like Jean Dixon are probably the first of people on earth to have "the gift of prophecy". I also believe that in the near future somebody will invent "nonrocket interstellar travel". I think that we aren't too far behind our space neighbors, I say about 25-30 years. I would like to have any information you have on UFOs.
I would appreciate a reply to my letter as soon as possible.
Thanking you, I am
Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]"
