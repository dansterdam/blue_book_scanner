The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a form with questions and space for handwritten responses. The form appears to be from a report related to Project Blue Book, an official United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Shape
b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had compared this at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
