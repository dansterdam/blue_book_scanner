The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose diagram with directions labeled. The second sketch shows two illustrations of a person standing in a landscape, with the text "STRAIGHT" written above one of the illustrations.

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "+" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "+" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE PATH. THE OBJECT MAY HAVE APPEARED STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
