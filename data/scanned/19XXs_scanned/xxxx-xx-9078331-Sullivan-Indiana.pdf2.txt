The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, possibly a UFO report, with handwritten text.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

On the night of May 7, 1973, about 9:30 PM, my wife and I were standing on the front porch of our home located 3 1/2 miles east of Sullivan, Indiana, when we noticed a bright light in the northwest sky. This light appeared to be hovering and at first we thought it might be an airplane, but it was much too bright and seemed to be stationary. After watching it for several minutes, the light suddenly shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared. A few minutes later it reappeared in the same general area, hovered briefly, and then shot straight up and out of sight. This sequence was repeated several times over a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The light appeared to be round or oval in shape and was not blinking or flashing like an aircraft. There were no other lights visible on or around the object. The weather was clear and there was no moon. The object seemed to be several miles away but it was difficult to judge the exact distance or size. This is the first unusual aerial phenomenon my wife and I have ever observed.
