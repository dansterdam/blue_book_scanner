Shortly after 8 P.M. on the date mentioned, my father and I began watching the western sky. We noticed several [brightly] lighted objects which appeared to be moving in an irregular pattern. These objects would become larger and smaller in size, and the western sky was still rather bright. Only the planets Venus and Jupiter were visible in the west, along with the object(s). We watched these objects for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. At times they appeared to be maneuvering, moving rapidly up and down, and darting about in seemingly unnatural motions. I had the impression that it was moving, not just "being moved", toward and away from our position at a rapid rate of speed. It continued in an apparent erratic course, moving up, down, and from side to side, rather than in a straight line. When it would seemingly disappear, it would reappear almost instantly at another point in the sky. We could not hear any sound associated with the object(s). The experience was so unusual that it remained in our minds as an unsolved puzzle, which we discussed at length. It appeared to be a solid, metallic object, reflecting light, and would have passed for a very large jet at great distance but for the odd, jerky motions it displayed. I feel that it was definitely not an aircraft or any known celestial body.
