Mrs. stated that she had thought people were imagining things when they reported anything like this and she hesitated a long time before she reported this to Stewart AFB. I asked her if she had seen a helicopter and she replied that this was her first thought but decided it couldn't be since there was no sound.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: None.
