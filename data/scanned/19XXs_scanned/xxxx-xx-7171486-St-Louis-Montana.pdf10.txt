14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON? It was bright enough to get my attention.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? After it descended to the 5.000 ft. it moved North, North Est more & less straight until it went behind some trees to the North & that's the last I see of it. Then it just went out.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? I yes I will describe.
