Dear Sirs:

The image shows that it may be the same for years you have had various reports of Unidentified Flying Objects from throughout the United States. Since you may consider credibilpreciate, while others you may believe. You may make your own conclusion of my reports.

This object was sighted by my father at 5:00 P.M. traveling in a East - West-Northeast direction. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed, approx 500-600 M.P.H. It was traveling towards the area known as Des Plaines, Illinois.
 From this information, you may come to believe that it was a declining phenomenon. There are three reasons why this is impossible:

1) This sighting lasted only a short time and left no physical or photographic evidence.

2) This object DID NOT HAVE any of the required running lights that are called for by the Federal Aviation Agency. It was a yellow-orange color.

3) This is possibly the most important. It was not the shape of any aircraft I know. I have heard about or read about. This object is dismissed as unknown.
