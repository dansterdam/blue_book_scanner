The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Dear Sir:

We are very much interested in obtaining the following photographs of unidentified flying objects. As you can help us locate these prints for possible inclusions in our magazine, we would appreciate it very much.

We would like to obtain the photograph taken by the United Press International Air Force Base at Dayton, Ohio, at 11:00 A.M. on August 29, 1952. This is identified as our file No. 235, 0.005 second exposure on 35 mm. film.

Also, we would like to obtain a print of photograph taken by United States Weather Bureau at Enid, Oklahoma, on April 28, 1952 at the Salem, Mass., Air Station.

We would also very much appreciate it if you could send us any other good clear photographs of unidentified flying objects that you may have on file.

Thank you for your kind cooperation.

Very sincerely yours,
