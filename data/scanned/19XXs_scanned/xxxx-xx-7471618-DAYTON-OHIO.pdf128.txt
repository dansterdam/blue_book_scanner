The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and a compass diagram. The sketch appears to show the motion of an object or objects, with instructions to draw a picture illustrating the motion along a path. The compass diagram is likely included to provide context for the orientation of the object's movement.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
