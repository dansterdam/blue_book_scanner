TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

8 August 1952
Description of Incident
At 1552Z, a radar track appeared 20 miles NNW of Wright-Patterson AFB. The course was NW at 100 knots. The F-66's under GCI control were then located ten miles NW of the radar return. The fighters stayed with the object for approximately 10 minutes and made visual contact at 1553Z.
Interrogation of source, an AF radar and lieutenant, reveal the following:
- The F-66's climbed to 14,000', fell off, and then made a second climb to 14,000'. The major told the men in the second climb that he "ran the second time and received a radical build-up on his instruments from 14,000-0,000" as his altimeter read 14,000'.
- The radical build-up of his instruments and the tremendous climb back to 14,000' is substantiated by the range capability of the F-66 which has a ceiling of 47,000'. This would indicate that the object was operating at an altitude of 14,000'.
- The object appeared as a "fuzzy ball" in diameter and source said his optical sight just covered the object. The object appeared to be drifting and making small movements.
Comments:
The object was not a balloon, since the speed was too fast. The object moved against the wind. The UFO was not a mirage since the shape did not change and its motion was very rapid. The object's movements were so erratic, that it could not have been astronomical. The sighting occurred in mid-afternoon, and the weather was clear.
Conclusion: Unknown
