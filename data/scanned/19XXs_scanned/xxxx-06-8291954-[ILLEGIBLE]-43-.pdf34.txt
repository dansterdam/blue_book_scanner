TEAR SIRS:

AT ABOUT 4:50 THIS MORNING I WAS AWANENED BY WATCH OFFICER WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED ME THAT HIS SEARCH RADAR HAD DETECTED A VERY STRANGE OBJECT MOVING AT TREMENDOUS SPEED FROM SOUTH TO NORTH.

ABOUT FIVE HOURS EARLIER I HAD COMPLETED RE-FUELING THE AIRCRAFT ON ACCOUNT OF THE EARLIER REPORT THAT SEVERAL OBJECTS HAD BEEN TRACKED MOVING AT HIGH SPEEDS IN THE AREA.

IT APPEARS THAT WHAT WAS DETECTED THIS MORNING WAS ALSO TRACKED ON RADAR ABOUT 5 HOURS EARLIER, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. HOWEVER, THE VISUAL CONTACT WAS MADE UNTIL THIS MORNING. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED, AND DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. SEARCH EFFORTS BY AIRCRAFT PROVED FRUITLESS.

BY THE TIME I ARRIVED AT THE OFFICE THE CLOUDY CONDITION HAD CLEARED CONSIDERABLY AND VISIBILITY WAS GOOD. HOWEVER, NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS OBSERVED EITHER VISUALLY OR ON RADAR. SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT DETECTED WERE:

1. TREMENDOUS SPEED
2. BRIGHT LIGHT 
3. STRAIGHT COURSE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH
4. DISAPPEARANCE FROM SIGHT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT WAS INVOLVED, IT IS MY OPINION THAT WHATEVER WAS TRACKED BOTH VISUALLY AND ON RADAR COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT. INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING AND ANY FURTHER INFORMATION WILL BE FURNISHED.

SINCERELY,
