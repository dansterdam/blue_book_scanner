MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: UFO Observation, 12 Jun, 0200 hours
Mrs. (redacted), Dayton, Ohio 45416 called the UFO station on 12 June 1967. They had been up at approximately 0200 hours when she looked up in the sky and saw what appeared to be a star moving. Observed object for approximately ten minutes, moving north to southeast. Looked like a star, but brighter. Zig-zagged and paused, also changed direction from south to southeasterly. She thought that maybe it was a satellite except that it changed direction slightly and zig-zagged. Explained that satellites give the appearance of a slight change in direction and that zig-zagging was also common in satellite observations due to the atmosphere. Told her I would send her some DVR forms 154 for her and the other witnesses to complete so that we could check thoroughly. She would like a reply as to whether a satellite was their at that time.
