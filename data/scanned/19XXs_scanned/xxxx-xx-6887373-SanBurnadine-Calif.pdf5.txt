P.S.: One April 23, 1952 evening, citizen observing an unusual object in the sky. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed. It was illumination all over. The object appeared to be about 100 to 150 feet in diameter. The object seemed to descend and then climb upwards. The sighting lasted about 6 to 8 minutes. The witness could not identify the object.
