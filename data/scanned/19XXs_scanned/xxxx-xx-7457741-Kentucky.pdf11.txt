Mr.       Greenup, Kentucky 41144

1. Reference your recent unidentified observation. We have a few additional questions regarding the 1972 Form 164 that you recently forwarded to this office. On question 2) you indicate that you observed two objects. Would you clarify: were there actually two objects or was there only one object?

a. Did both objects appear simultaneously?
b. Did they appear to act independently or as if they were attached?
c. Did they travel at the same rate of speed?
d. Did they fly at the same altitude?
e. Did the objects stay at one spot for a long period of time and then "jump" to the next spot or was it a steady movement?
f. How did each object disappear?
g. In what direction did you first observe the objects and in what direction did they move?
h. Did any aircraft pass over the area while the objects were in sight?
i. Enclosed are two Form 164s. If you wish to complete one on each object, please do so; however, request you also include the answers to the above questions.

3. Thank you for your assistance in providing additional information on your sighting.
