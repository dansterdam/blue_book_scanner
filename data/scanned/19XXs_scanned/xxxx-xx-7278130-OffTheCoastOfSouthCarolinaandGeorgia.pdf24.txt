Stapleton International Airport, Denver, Colorado 80207

July 16th, 1968

Lt. Colonel Hector Quintanilla Jr.
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office

Production Directorate

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

In reply to your letter, July 9th, requesting information on which sightings of September 27th, 1967 or about 0930.

The pilot reports that we have on that date are more than six hours earlier, and in the Savannah area.

Also, I would like to mention, there were no catalogued satellite re-entries on that day.

I am sorry that we can not be of any assistance at this time.

I am wondering, perhaps, if it might be of some help to you, to add you to our mailing list for copies of pilot reports as we receive them. Although this would include reports from all areas of the world, you could easily discard the ones that do not apply to this particular case.

While many of these reports are meteoritic in nature, they may prove of some scientific interest to you in your work. I have found that all too often, especially in high density areas of habitation, many sightings are apparently controlled flight characteristics. This does not, of course, rule out the possibility of there being a great amount of "sightings" of material during the initial stages of re-entry. In this connection, it would appear that while a meteor is quite solid in nature except for the slightly less dense "atmosphere charges" which are modest, the sightings of such characteristics which are numerous, may be far from modest.

Please let me know whether or not you feel this would be of help to you.

Sincerely Yours,
G.T. Roth, Project Director
