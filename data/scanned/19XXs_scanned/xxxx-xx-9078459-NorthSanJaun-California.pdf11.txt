PERSONAL COMMENTS AND CRITIQUES
1. There were many contradictions in the story's story.
2. Although Cony was very excited, Johnny limited himself to a few statements and explanations and never deviated from the few words he said.
3. Because of the religious/mystic cult with which the area is completely saturated, the reliability of the boys and people in the town is lowered considerably.
4. The boys later stated where the ear was and Tony could not tell me where. He said they went to the top of the hill from another route, not down.
