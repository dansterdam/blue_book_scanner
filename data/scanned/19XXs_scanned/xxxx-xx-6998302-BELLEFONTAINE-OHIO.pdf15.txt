2. Bellefontaine, Ohio - 1 August 1952 -
At 11:50 AM an unknown object was ground radar tracked from Wright-Patterson AFB sighted 
an unknown object on its scope. Two T-33's from the 97th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron 
were scrambled and informed of the object but failed to make visual contact. A ground 
radar contact was not made but attempts were made to get the object above the climbing cage 
of the T-33's and observed a silver-round object. The object was above the climbing speed
of the T-33's and appeared to be steadily gaining altitude when the fighters were
instructed to break off the pursuit.

The gun camera film showed a moving object which is too indistinct
to make any detailed analysis.

Solution: Was a balloon. There were local balloon releases prior
to the sighting.
