Dear Sir,
As the head-lecturer at the Edgerton Memorial Planetar. of the Stamford (Conn.) Museum and Nature Center, I have always car-ried questions from the audience about "Flying Saucers" with the statement "Never having seen an U.F.O. I cannot say." Will you consi-der the following and let me know if I saw an U.F.O.?
At close to 9:30 P.M., E.D.T. Sunday Oct. 5, 1953, while observing the double cluster in Cassiopeia with a 4 inch telescope, I suddenly shot into my field of view a faintly luminous area, shaped like a parabolic crescent, trailing the horns. The shape remained for a few moments and then seemed to swing (or trail) or in other words, curved swept-wing-like. It managed to keep it in the field of the binoculars until it was cut off by my house, be-ing at a point near Beta Pegasi.
Its intensity was uniform over its area and well above that of the background of the Milky Way, but not bright and was unvary-ing while I saw it. It was about 0.5° to 1.0° across the horns, and its speed was uniform, covering about 40° in less than 2 seconds, and its path appeared to be a straight line.
During this period of observing, "seeing" was the best I've seen in months. with the binoculars I was able to see M31, M13, M15, and Asteroid 47 (Iris). The temperature had dropped from over 70° F in mid-day to about 50° at this time. No one else was with me.
May I please have your comments?

Yours truly,
