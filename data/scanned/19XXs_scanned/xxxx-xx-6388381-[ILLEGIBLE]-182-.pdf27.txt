STATEMENT OF [REDACTED] 

At about 1610, 17 October, 1949 while in my garden at Crescent City, Cal. I saw a small silver colored object resembling a small plane proceeding in a southerly direction S.E. of Battery Point, Crescent City at a high altitude estimated at between twenty and twenty five thousand feet, this object remained in view for four to five minutes, at one time the object made a 180 turn and bank to the right, a sharp bright flash came from the object as the sun hit the topside, the object then made a sharp turn to the south and gradually disappeared. No smoke or sound came from this object.
