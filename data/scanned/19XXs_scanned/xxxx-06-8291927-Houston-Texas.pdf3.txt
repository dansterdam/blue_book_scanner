TRANSCRIBED TEXT:
"There was no color other than a sort of yellow-white - no mixture of color."
"There was only one (1) at a time - if there was more than one you couldn't see them. There was nothing protruding - it looked just like the two arms - like this." (Informed arms cut from shoulders - palms up.) "No trail or exhaust streaks were visible."
"Judging from the speed of jets - I would say it traveled faster than a jet - but occasionally when it would make one of those drops it would stop fast. It dropped right straight down - towards those trees - I would think it was going to go to the earth, just to stop." It would, like a butterfly in flight except when it dropped down. Then on the level I would say its speed was around 700 - 800 miles an hour. I was out hours on the sun porch - it just simply took right out here and kept going in that direction." (He pointed to the trees on the horizon - straight ahead.)
(2) "It was probably between 9:30 and 10:00 - about the same length of time - about a half-hour or so each time. Tuesday it reappeared about the same time but it was visible only for a short time - still North of the Hospital."
When asked how far he believed the object to be from Denver, he stated: "Over the city limits - it looked like it might be directly over those trees - about a mile from here."
Weather conditions: "It was a dark but clear night each time."
