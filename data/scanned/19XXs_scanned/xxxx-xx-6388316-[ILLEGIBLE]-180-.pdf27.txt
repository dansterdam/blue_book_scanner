Highly recommended as to character. Ability to judge
color; O. K., ability to estimate speed & size of objects fair.

At 1711, observed object in sky. While watching a conventional plane failure
from view another object caught the attention of witness. At first the object was a pinacle or space of paper but on closer oberservstion noted that it was much higher that it would be possible to see a piece of paper. As the object became larger, the witness observed that it was silver in color and seemed to be turning or tilting. The shape could not be determined sitize the observer was certain it was not an airplane. It appeared to be traveling a direct course from northwest to southeast and was seen for periods 15 to 20 seconds.
