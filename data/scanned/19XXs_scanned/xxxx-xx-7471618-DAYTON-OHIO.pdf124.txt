Miss
Beavermont village
Witnessed by :
Called by telephone at 4:00a.m., 7/1/73. An observantion of an object which at first appearance, seemed lighted and elongated.
Mr. said the oval shaped object descended to the vicinity of his house. The object moved back & forth with an oval shaped lighted area.
The object visually was 4-5 times as bright as the surrounding area. The object appeared somewhat smaller than the radio tower he was observing.
The exact duration was 10 min or more. It appeared no larger than a bright star and then diminished in size & light.
The object suddenly was observed as it moved out and was no longer visible. It appeared to have a bright center with a glow surrounding it.
The moon was not a factor. It was clear & no other night lights observed. Altitude of 2,000 feet.
