U.S. Air Force Intelligence
Temple, Pa.

Dear Sirs:

I have just read that the air force has been issued a directive to treat U.F.O. sightings seriously, so I thought I would report my experience, hoping in some small way, to help uncover the mystery of the so-called "flying saucers" which I am sure, do exist.

I have been flying since 1929 as a private pilot. Presenting: holding license # 123458.

I was returning to Reading, Pa. from the coast, New Jersey shore, at an altitude of 3,000 feet. When about 10 miles southeast of Philadelphia, Pa. I sighted a movement out of the corner of my left eye that caused me to turn my head sharply in that direction.

Coming from behind and slightly below me, on a course about 15 degrees more westerly than my own, were two circular objects. The one slightly to the side and rear of the other.

Due to the clearness and daylighting the evidence was very excellent view. I could distinctly see that they were made of a bright, shiny metallic material. They were about 40 to 50 feet across, about 6 to 8 feet in thickness at the center, tapering to a thin edge.

The objects were traveling, apparently, at a very high rate of speed. It was surrounded by an orange-reddish glow or flame, quite a bit of smoke.
which traveled at the sides.
