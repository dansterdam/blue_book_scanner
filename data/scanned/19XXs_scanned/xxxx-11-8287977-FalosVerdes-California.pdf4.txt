Great was the surprise of all of us when we saw this mysterious object which hovered over the ocean for about 15-20 minutes. It appeared to be a bright light, bigger than a star and seemed to be stationary. There were no wings or appendages visible. This was a clear night and the moon was not out. The object appeared to be hovering, and then it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared. There were some other strange phenomena connected with this sighting, but I don't feel free to discuss them at this time.

Sincerely,
