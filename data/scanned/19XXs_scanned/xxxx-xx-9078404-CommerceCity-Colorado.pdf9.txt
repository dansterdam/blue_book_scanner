14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
After it moved horizontally over the area for a few seconds, it suddenly increased its speed and disappeared

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle one): Yes   No   Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes   No   Don't Know.  IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: The sound was like a low whistling noise, increasing in volume as it approached

b. Color: It was silvery-white in color

18. We would like to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
Match stick covered about 1/4 of the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, fins, tubes, etc. Also indicate the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

[The image shows a handwritten diagram of a curved elliptical shape with an arrow pointing to the right.]
