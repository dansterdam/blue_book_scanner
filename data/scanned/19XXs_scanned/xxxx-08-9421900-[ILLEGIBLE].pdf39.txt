The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Neither of the two enclosures have been released to the press or submitted for publication. I have removed addresses and locations from the August 18, 1955 report. If you desire any more information of this report, you can contact me.

Two weeks ago I sat down with the Old Testament and put the Prophet Ezekiel's writing into today's technical knowledge and terms. You may not agree, but it does make interesting reading. For me it does not distract in the least the message that God was delivering to Ezekiel.

Very truly yours,
