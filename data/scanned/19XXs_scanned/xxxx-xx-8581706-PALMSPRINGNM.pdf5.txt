Several unidentified flying objects consisting, according to the many witnesses, of a white cross-like illuminated object with smaller similar appearing objects in the vicinity were observed at about 9:00 PM on 26 July 1952 over Beaumont Pass, California. The objects appear to have been stationary when first sighted and then began moving rapidly and erratically, disappearing and reappearing and moving in various directions, then began ascending at a rapid rate and finally disappeared. All observers reported that the objects appeared to be maneuverable and self-luminous.
