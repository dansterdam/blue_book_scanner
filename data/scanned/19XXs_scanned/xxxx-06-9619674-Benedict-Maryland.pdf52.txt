Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (FLYOBRPT)

DESCRIPTION:
An intense blue-green light was seen traveling at a high rate of speed at an altitude of about 40,000 feet. The light was traveling in a south-easterly direction as a line "between Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Wellington, Colorado, towards Limon, Colorado, nearly 150 miles." 

The source of the light could not be determined. No objects of any shape or form were observed. The blue-green lights seemed to be a high frequency flash at a distance. These flashes occurred at irregular intervals and without a definite line of flight, as sound could have provided, and any type of propulsion was not discernible.

TIME:
0800 The time described above was observed on 22 June 1958, at about 0615 Mountain Standard Time.  Due to the daylight fact of the place as which the object was sighted, the sighting duration was relatively short.

MANNER OF OBSERVATION:
This sighting was visual, by trained observers, who were the only observers at the time of the sighting. The object was seen for a short period, and it was observed to work at the same time, with no sound or electrical or electronic equipment used in conjunction with the observation.

Mr. [REDACTED] has been a night watchman in the area for 12 years, and is thoroughly familiar with aircraft and other objects in the sky. During the course of his years of employment, he has observed numerous phenomena, but states that this is the first time he has ever observed this type of object.
