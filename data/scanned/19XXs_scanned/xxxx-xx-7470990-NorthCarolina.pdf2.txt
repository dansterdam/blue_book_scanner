The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Transcribed text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, it just went into the clouds.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No Don't know If you answered YES, then tell what: It moved behind and on the other side of the clouds.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No Don't know If you answered YES, then tell what: It has appeared in front of the clouds.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Like an airplane, only without the normal airplane engine noise.
b. Color Blue on top, white underneath the sides.
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a pencil at arm's length, line up the end of the pencil with one edge of the object and note how much of the pencil's length is covered by the object. Then, before moving the pencil, slide your thumb along the pencil to the other edge of the object. The distance between your thumb and the end of the pencil is the angular size. The object would not fit on the pencil, it moved too fast, only a cloud and look again.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object (that you saw) such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The text appears to be a questionnaire or form for documenting a UFO sighting, with various questions about the observed object's behavior and characteristics.
