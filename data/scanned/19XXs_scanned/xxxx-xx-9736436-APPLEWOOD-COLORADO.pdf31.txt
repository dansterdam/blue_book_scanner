27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the farthest line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass when you first saw it. Place an "C" on the compass when you lost sight of the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
