The Saucers 
Come in Sets
Like Dishes

NORTH SAN JUAN (UPI) -
They come in three sizes -
small, medium and large - look
like human beings, flying in a 
zig-zag pattern. A 12-year-old 
resident of this town of 150, said
he photographed an unidentified
flying object landing in the 
hydraulic mining area north of
the Nevada County community
two weeks ago.

He took six pictures of the 
object landing, taking off and
hovering over the objects. They
also were seen by several adults
over an abandoned car. The
auto has disappeared.

An unidentified flying object
also was sighted by an unidenti-
fied man from Mt. St. Mary's 
Academy in Grass Valley.

Tony and the nun exchanged
information about the descrip-
tion of the saucer creatures -
they resemble human beings. 
The youth said they had chil-
dren with them and have made
previous contacts, he said. He
said the saucer people talked
with him and told him two of
their ships had been shot down
over nearby military missile
installations.

Tony told the nun, "They'll
be back this month," later be 
said the saucer will land Satur-
day.

Joseph H. Nix, an information
officer at Beale Air Force Base,
said another officer had taken 
some material gathered about
the sighting to a conference be-
was scheduled to attend at the
University of Colorado.

Tony's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Seymour Sprull, operate a small
grocery store in North
San Juan.
