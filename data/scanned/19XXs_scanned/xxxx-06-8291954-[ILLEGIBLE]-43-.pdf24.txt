REPORT VERSION VICTORY
AT ____ 28 JUNE 54

SUBJECT: 

IN REFERENCE TO MY ENCLOSED SIGHTING REPORT AND ALSO THE 16 DEC 65 3/6 1830-34AN REPORT (VOL III, NO 5)?

VIEW OF THE EXPERIENCE AND ACCOUNT: 

THE OBJECT MOVED WITH A ZIGZAG OR ERRATIC MOTION, AT A RAPID RATE OF SPEED, AND AT TIMES APPEARED TO BE HOVERING. WHEN VIEWED, IT GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF A SOLID OBJECT, AND DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 1/2 MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

IF A SOLID ENTERS THE ATMOSPHERE AT A SUFFICIENTLY SHALLOW ANGLE, 

IF IT CONTINUES LOSING ALTITUDE, AND

IF THE OBSERVER IS AT A SUFFICIENTLY LOW ALTITUDE, AND

IF THE SIGHTING IS DISCONTINUED PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE BODY AT THE SURFACE, AND

IF THE TRAJECTORY, WHEN EXTENDED, FALLS BEHIND THE OBSERVER,

THEN THIS CONTINUOUSLY FALLING BODY WILL APPEAR TO THE OBSERVER AS A CONTINUOUSLY RISING BODY.

WHEN I FIRST OBSERVED THE OBJECT, IT APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING AT A RELATIVELY RAPID SPEED AND GENERALLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE COURSE. DURING THIS TIME IT DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY UNUSUAL OR ERRATIC MOTION. HOWEVER, AS THE OBJECT CONTINUED TO APPROACH MY POSITION, THE APPARENT MOTION BECAME INCREASINGLY ERRATIC. AT TIMES IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OR OSCILLATING IN FLIGHT. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IT MADE ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION ALMOST AT RIGHT ANGLES. WHEN VIEWED THROUGH BINOCULARS, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE DISC-SHAPED, METALLIC IN APPEARANCE, AND APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 40 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT, EITHER MILITARY OR COMMERCIAL. DURING THE ENTIRE SIGHTING, THE OBJECT MAINTAINED A CONSTANT ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 3000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. WHEN THE OBJECT FINALLY DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT, IT SEEMED TO SIMPLY FADE OUT, RATHER THAN ACCELERATING RAPIDLY OR CHANGING DIRECTION ABRUPTLY. MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT WHATEVER IT WAS, IT WAS UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL AND OPERATING IN A DELIBERATE FASHION AS A SCOUTING OR OBSERVATIONAL VEHICLE, RATHER THAN AS A CHANCE OVERFLIGHT OR ACCIDENTAL INTRUSION INTO THE AREA.

WHAT I SAW COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A KNOWN AIRCRAFT, EITHER MILITARY OR COMMERCIAL. I AM QUITE FAMILIAR WITH ALL TYPES OF AIRCRAFT, BOTH JET AND PROPELLER-DRIVEN, AND THIS OBJECT DID NOT CONFORM TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ANY OF THEM. IF WHAT I SAW WAS A PRODUCT OF SOME HIGHLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, THEN IT REPRESENTS A CAPABILITY FAR IN ADVANCE OF ANYTHING PRESENTLY KNOWN TO EXIST.
