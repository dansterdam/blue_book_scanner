I have a very good knowledge of astronomy and aircraft, and I have never seen anything like this object before. It was round and came up from ground level at great speed and then went straight up and out of sight. It was very bright and gave off an orange glow and it went faster than any known aircraft. I feel it was probably a U.F.O. and I can make no other explanation for it.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
5/70
