10. CONCLUSION
(OFFICIAL (UNCLASSIFIED REPORT)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a control object that appeared to be hovering or suspended and measured about 150 yards from his car for about 15 minutes then it sped away.
OBSERVERS COMMENTS: The observer said that he returned to the area. What he observed was just hovering and gave three similar objects. The observer did not think they were balloons or airplanes because they did not have blinking lights or make any sound. The observer's witness said the object was round and gave off a faint glow. The observer felt this could be what they saw and have since concluded to the foregoing conclusion.
