Performing OCR on the text in the image:

J ust had a sigheing of a UFO. Observed a bright circular light in the sky traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. Light was too bright to see any definite outline or shape. Craft disappeared in the east. Observed for about 30 seconds. No sound was heard. This is the first time I have had an experience like this and I am at a loss to explain it.
