He appeared again the next evening with his final report on the UFO sighting. The boys had given them a space helmet and vest supposedly given to them by the "Centaurians". Mr. [redacted] had the helmet and vest analyzed and found that the helmet was made of a "cheap plastic" and the vest was a synthetic rubber. He gave the chemical names of the components of each object. The chemist also stated that the helmet, to the best of his knowledge, was a toy - manufacturer unknown. He further stated that if the helmet was given to the boys by space people who were advanced enough to travel that far and land on the earth, they would not make a protective helmet out of such cheap material. The TV would not commit to a true or false conclusion and left this up to the Univ of Colorado and the Air Force. His whole newscast was very skeptical in nature.

A final newspaper article appeared in the Grass Valley - Nevada City UNION on 22 Jun. It was accompanied by a rather humorous, or satirical, report on another sighting. Contents of this article were not investigated.

This concludes my report. Any further developments will be forwarded to both offices.
