EYEWITNESS REPORT
RETURN OF THE UFO

There was one object, round in shape, appeared to be hovering. This object seemed to be about five to six hundred feet in the air. It was a silvery color and appeared to have lights of some kind blinking on and off at intervals.

The object was viewed for about fifteen minutes, during which time it remained stationary. After the fifteen minutes it slowly moved off to the west and disappeared from sight.

The object was silent and no noise was heard from it whatsoever.

This object was later identified as a typical flying saucer type of UFO.
