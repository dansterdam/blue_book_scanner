Proposed reply to letter from 11 November 1966

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Reference your recent letter regarding your 27 June 1966 observation. As you most certainly implied in your letter, it was a most extraordinary sighting. To date, we have been unable to reach a definite explanation.

Dr. Hynek, Air Force consultant to Project Blue Book, has studied the case and can offer no conclusive explanation. It was a quite interesting observation and the case is being carried as unidentified since no definite explanation is apparent.

To Saforie 19 Jun 67
