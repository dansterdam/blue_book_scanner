The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter or document from Project Bluebook, the United States Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects. The text states that a photograph was taken in Rochester, New York on February 24, 1966 with an inexpensive camera using 127 size black and white film, but the letter indicates that the photograph is not the result of mistaken observation or natural phenomena.

Gentlemen:

A photograph was taken in Rochester, New York, at 8:45 p.m., February 24, 1966 with an inexpensive camera using size 127, black and white film. I am submitting it to you for evaluation.

Being the photographer, I can assure you that the photo is not a hoax, and, that the incident recorded is undoubtedly an unusual natural phenomena. Accompanying me when the photo was taken were Mr. Ron and Mrs. Evelyn H. of Rochester, N.Y.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Very truly,
Rochester, New York 14613
