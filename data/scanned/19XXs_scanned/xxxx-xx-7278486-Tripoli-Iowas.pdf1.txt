CONCLUSIONS

Tripoli, Iowa (location)

The observer felt the object he was watching did not seem to fit in the picture, and don't disappear or a clear silhouette. 

Observer sighted object the size of a football, that seemed to him brighter. Observer heard the sound of an idling plane.

CONCLUSIONS CONTINUED: The object does not state if object was yellow and white all at once or if object alternated in these colors. The object did not give any behavior or the plane, and observer could gave additional necessary information but the rest was not reusable.
