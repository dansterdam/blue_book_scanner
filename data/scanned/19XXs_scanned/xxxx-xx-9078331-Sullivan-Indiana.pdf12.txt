DRAFT PROPOSED REPLY
Mr. [redacted]
1. Reference your recent observation of an unidentified flying object: We have attempted to determine what you observed; however, to date we have been unable to locate the exact stimulus. You did mention that the aliens left behind a box of angel hair. We asked for the opportunity to review some of the material; however, none was received. We have not received any additional reports from the Graysville, Indiana area on 19 May 1957.
2. In the future, if you should observe another UFO, contact the nearest Air Force installation, which is Bakalar AFB, as near Columbus, Indiana. They are in a much better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The UFO investigator at Bakalar is Major Richard J. Seeport, 3334th Troop Carrier Wing, Bakalar AFB, Indiana 47201, area code 812, 372-2501 extension 202.
