The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report. It does not contain any photograph, only text. Here is the text from the document:

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

The report of an unidentified flying object you submitted on 6 October 1956 has been evaluated and the official opinion of the Air Technical Intelligence Center is as follows:

The most likely explanation for the object reported by the spark trail is that the object was reported as being greater than the actual size and being pointed such that it appeared similar to the shape of an artillery shell. The fact that the object was reported as being greater than the actual size is not uncommon and being pointed so that it appeared similar to the shape of an artillery shell does not preclude further investigation as a possibility.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
