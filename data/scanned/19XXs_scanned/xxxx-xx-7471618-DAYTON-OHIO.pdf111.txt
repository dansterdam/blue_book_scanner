The height came from below that the thing only and bright. The height came and went and high was. The light came and went like a flash and seemed as if a dull was appearing and a little was coming the light. the same solid got very bright very suddenly. I would like to say that it seemed like a perfect sphere. The color would be like a silver color and the edges sharp and clear. I would like it to explain that the same was an aircraft or an object that I was not able to recognize. It seemed again very that the small or light moved away. The center where the light crossed was a cleaner, darker phase, the outside was a lighter very clear then the inside. I'm not sure this is effect more with dawn or was coming up but it seemed there for a little while.
