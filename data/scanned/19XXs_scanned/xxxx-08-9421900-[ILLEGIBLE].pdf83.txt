The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, likely an old UFO report.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

The object was flying and circling over the house. It passed over the house several times at an estimated altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. The object was described as being round and approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It gave off a glowing grayish white light and appeared to be oscillating or rotating. The object circled the house for about 10 to 15 minutes until it suddenly accelerated and disappeared to the west. 

Mrs. Cunningham said she could distinctly hear the humming of the craft, which to her sounded like a generator. She stated the object was almost directly overhead at times and appeared to be examining the house. She also said it seemed to be under intelligent control.

The fact that the object was sighted by two thoroughly reliable witnesses, who were not the least bit excited and who described the object in a consistent manner, lends considerable weight to the reliability of their report. Their observations also seem to be supported by the fact that the object was seen to perform maneuvers which are beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.

In view of the foregoing, it is recommended that this case be classified as "Unidentified" in the records of Project Blue Book.
