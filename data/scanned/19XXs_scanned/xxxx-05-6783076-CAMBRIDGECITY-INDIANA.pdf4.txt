"ON OCTOBER 23, 1951, AT ABOUT 8:00 P.M. EST, WHILE OBSERVING THE CONSTELLATION CASSIOPEIA IN THE NORTHERN SKY, A BRIGHT OBJECT APPEARED WHICH ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN AT A POINT APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND REMAINED VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS. DURING THIS OBSERVATION, THE OBJECT CHANGED DIRECTION TWO TIMES, FIRST MOVING UPWARD AND THEN DOWNWARD. AS SOON AS I OBSERVED THE OBJECT, I RUSHED INTO THE HOUSE TO INFORM MY HUSBAND WHO CAME OUT IMMEDIATELY, BUT THE OBJECT HAD DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THE COMPASS SKETCH"
