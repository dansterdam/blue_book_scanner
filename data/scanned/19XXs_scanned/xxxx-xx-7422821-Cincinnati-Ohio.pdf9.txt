20. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
(Circle One) Yes No
IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate? Appeared to move at a very high speed.

21. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One) YES No 
IF you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was? Several hundred feet, near an object in the sky.

22. Where were you located when you saw the object?
(Circle One):
a. Inside a building
b. In a car 
c. Outdoors
d. In an airplane (type)
e. Other _____________________

23. Were you (Circle One)
a. In the business section of a city?
b. In the residential section of a city?
c. In open country/rural?
d. Near an airfield?
e. Flying over a city?
f. Flying over open country?
g. Other______

24. IF you were MOVING IN AN AUTOMOBILE or other vehicle at the time, then complete the following questions:
24.1 What direction were you moving? (Circle One)
a. North b. Northeast c. East d. Southeast e. South f. Southwest g. West h. Northwest
24.2 How fast were you moving? _____miles per hour
24.3 Did you stop at any time while you were looking at the object? (Circle One) Yes No

25. Did you observe the object through any of the following?
a. Eyeglasses Yes No
b. Sun glasses Yes No 
c. Windshield Yes No
d. Window glass Yes No

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. My initial thought is that the object was a star or meteor. They have a similar high speed movement and visual appearance. However, the description doesn't fully match a typical star or meteor, so I cannot say with certainty what it might have been.
