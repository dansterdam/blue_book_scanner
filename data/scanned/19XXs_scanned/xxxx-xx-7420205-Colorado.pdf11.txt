My only comment is that I still cannot understand why he would object so violently to my going by air or car. He must have had some reason that was not clear to me. Back to the original - object was oblong, - object was whitish, Front frange of brightness around object of indefinite sharpness - might have been glow or light reflection. Shape and brightness unnatural. Seemed motion unsteady or oscillating flight - motion not like any flight pattern I have ever seen or heard of.
