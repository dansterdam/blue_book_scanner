EUPODO-ADIABATIC DIAGRAM
CHART ML-129A

(1) Absolute temperatures are pressure-sensitive
(2) Negative slopes indicate a decrease in dew-point with height
(3) Solid angle cross-section is approximed by triangles
(4) Broken traces correpond to cloud layers considered
(5) Ceiling estimated from intersection of traces
(6) Ground winds were 300 degrees at 7 knots

The text on the chart provides technical details and measurements related to atmospheric conditions, but does not mention or describe any photograph.
