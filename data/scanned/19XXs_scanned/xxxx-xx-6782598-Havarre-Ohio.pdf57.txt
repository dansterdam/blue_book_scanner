WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES MAY 26-JUNE 1, 1969

The weather maps prepared by the National Weather Service and printed in the Daily Weather Maps are too voluminous to reproduce on this page. Thus, only a brief summary of the data for the period covered is shown. The wind direction and speed at the surface and aloft are shown in degrees true and knots, respectively. The highest and lowest temperatures (degrees Fahrenheit) and precipitation amounts for the 24-hour period ending at 1200 GMT on the dates of the report are shown. Also shown are dateline reports, station location and identification, and other data useful to those interested in meteorology.

The price of these maps is $3.50 for 50 copies or less and $0.07 per copy for orders in excess of 50 copies. The Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, will receive your order and payment.
