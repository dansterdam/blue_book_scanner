DETAILS: 
1. This investigation is predicated upon letter, 17th District Office of Special Investigations, Kirtland Air Force Base, Kirtland Field, New Mexico, dated 20 January 1949, stating: "A. F. Bldg., Amarillo, Texas, observed what he described as a 'green fireball'." 

2. Mr. [REDACTED] was interviewed on 31 January 1949 and gave the following:

On 13 September 1948, accompanied by Mr. [REDACTED] (identity unknown), to the vicinity of Meyers, Colorado. They appeared to see a "green fireball" fall to the ground. Subsequent investigation on 15 December 1948 in this vicinity revealed no physical evidence of any kind. However, the people in the area confirmed that they had observed a "green fireball" moving horizontally and westwardly at a very fast rate of speed. It was approximately 2 minutes in duration and disappeared over the horizon. 

During the interview, it appeared to this agent that WRIGHT was above-average in intelligence and that the "fireball" was not just a figment of his imagination.

4. Reference is made of radio reports in Oklahoma Area stating "fireballs" were seen on nights of 31 January 1949 in southern New Mexico.
