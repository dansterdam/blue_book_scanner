SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF Two Polaroid Prints (black & white)
QUALITY POOR

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 67-59 submitted by JUANA to describe the content of the object photographed.

2. ANALYSIS: The photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. Examination of the two submitted Polaroid-type prints has revealed double exposure and/or retouching. The object appears to be circular in platform, basically flat in cross-section with a round superstructure. The object size is relatively small, smaller in diameter than the outer sections. Source did not indicate a size for the object or distance from the camera to the object when photographed. Lack of sufficient foreground and/or background detail precluded a scale factor to size the object. No satisfactory explanation could be made of the unidentified object.
