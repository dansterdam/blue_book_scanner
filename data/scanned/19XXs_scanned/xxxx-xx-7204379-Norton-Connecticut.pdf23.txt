At close to 9:30 P.M., E.D.T., Sunday Oct. 9, 1955, while observing the double cluster in Perseus with a pair of 7X50 binoculars, there rapidly shot into my field of view a faintly luminous area, resembling a probable celestial crescent, trailing the horns. The size remained constant, no motion or trail (no rotating, boomerang or a swallow gliding or tail) or in other words, curved swept-wings. I managed to keep it in the field of the binoculars until it was out of sight, being at a point near Beta Pegasi.

Its intensity was uniform over its area and well above that of the background of the milky way, but not very bright, and did not vary while I saw it. It was about 1째 across the horns, and its speed was uniform, covering about 10째 in about 4 seconds, and its path appeared to be a straight line.

During this period of observing, "seeing" was the best I've seen in months. That night I was able to see M3, M5, M13, & Iris (ast.?).
