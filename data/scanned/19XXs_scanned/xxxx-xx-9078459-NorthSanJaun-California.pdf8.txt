Mrs. Rodenberger stated that Mrs. ***** could be contacted in Tyler and could give us much information, including books and recorded tapes left by the Venusians.
***** San Juan was in the residence visiting at the time. (It may be noted that she was laughing quietly all through this interview.) She said that she had been in the ***** Grocery Store and saw the boy with a book about UFO's. She asked him where he had gotten it from and that she would like to read it. Tony told her that he had gotten it from a school, but he would not give it to her. She further stated that the parents were resentful for asking questions. She apologized and left.
We went to ***** home, ***** N. San Juan, the grandmother of Tony. She would not answer any questions put to her. We asked her if she had a book by Michael X. She said she had lent it out, but would not reveal the name of the borrower. Asked if she believed in flying saucers, she responded, "Of course, didn't you see the pictures?"
The keys had still not returned to the store. We went to Tyler,a little village about 5 miles southeast of N. San Juan. We contacted ***** and asked to talk to her. She was in her late 70's, estimate. She took us into her home and seemed very excited about us being there. She showed us all her books - dealing with flying saucers, mystic powers and religion. Her home was filled with many religious pictures, etc. She said that she was a member of a group known as the Understanding Group which was formed in 1954, and had its present headquarters in Merlin, Oregon. She had been a member of the club since its formation and had gone to every meeting.
She stated that had guest lecturers and many tapes were played, stated to have been left by the Venusians. She had many booklets distributed by a Venusian to various people dealing with the beliefs in flying saucers, life on other planets and mystical powers. She said that she use to hold meetings.
