The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Mr. ---- - Civilian, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio.

The following is my own personal opinions about this object:
1. I think it was a manmade object, as evidenced by the outline and functional appearance.
2. It's size was not far from 25 feet with a percentable canopy.
3. The path followed by the object appeared as though it might have been dropped from a great distance.
Seeing this was not a hallucination or other fancies of a sense.
