The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

J. Preparing Officer: 2Lt S.T. Martin, Jr., Box 693, Whiteman AFB, Missouri 65301. The UFO sighting was reported by Mr. and Mrs. and the accompanying report. Mr. is an educational background that sustains a degree of credibility to his observation. However, other reports of the observation do not substantiate the details given in this document.

The report indicates that the witness firmly holds suspicions concerning such objects and has subjective feelings toward them. I feel that his viewing of an object is valid, but his description of the details of the object may be exaggerated due to his emotional condition at the time of the sighting.
