The image contains a document titled "Official U.S. Air Force" on Page 3. There is a diagram showing an illustrated sketch with instructions for placing an "A" and a "B" on the sketch to indicate the height and direction of an observed object. Below the diagram, there is a prompt asking the reader to "Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made."

Text extracted from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you first saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
