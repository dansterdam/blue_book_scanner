3. PRESENT FACTS: Bourbon, Missouri is a small community on Highway 66, approximately 75 miles southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. The area of the sightings is approximately 2 and 1/2 miles northwest of Bourbon. The terrain is rolling hills and heavily wooded, with areas of a few hundred yards to one mile. Areas around the homes have been cleared and are maintained as lawns and/or open fields. Most of the remaining area is in woodland.

The first sighting occurred on 8 February 1967, and sightings have occurred almost nightly since that time until the present. Generally, the objects appear as a reddish glowing light the size of a large peerless fire, originating from the trees in her backyard. They sometimes move out into the open and increase in size until they approach the house, when they can be seen to increase in light intensity, changing to a brilliant white light which bathes the entire area in light as though an outdoor house light were turned on. On occasions they have come to ground level and given off sparks (described as like popcorn shooting into space). The objects wander about, sometimes drifting into the trees or over the house, and sometimes disappearing behind trees or clouds.

b. The lights have distinct form, although a solid vehicle has not been observed. Sometimes three lights appear as a triangle. Approximately five feet separating each light. On other occasions a single light has been seen as an elongated object with legs.
