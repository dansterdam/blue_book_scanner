The image does not contain any photographs. However, it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON 
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL A ANYTHING?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS? 
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?

MY FRIENDLY MR. XXXXX AND I CAME OUT AND SAW THIS CREATION OF STRIKE.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
A VERY BRIGHT HOUSE BLOCKED OUT THE VIEW.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE SEEMING OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
FROM OUR VIEW IT SEEMED TO MOVE IN FRONT OF THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE BLOCKED OUT OUR VIEW.
