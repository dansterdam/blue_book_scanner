Dear Sir:
On April 26, I had noticed an object in the sky which appeared to be a very bright light which appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed. I was quite sure that it was not a star or a planet. I watched this object until it disappeared from sight. It was traveling in a northerly direction. As it went out of my sight, I noticed that there was something trailing it, as it were. This trailingbeing perhaps a half mile or so behind the object. I could not make out what this trailing object was. It seemed to be moving at a very high rate of speed also. I watched this for about two or three minutes. The object which appeared first was a very brilliant white light, almost blueish in color, and seemed to be about the size of a star. As it traveled I got the impression that it was leaving a trail of some kind behind it, although I could not be certain of this. After it had traveled for about two or three minutes, it suddenly seemed to increase its speed and just disappeared from sight. The trailing object which I had noticed seemed to be a much dimmer, reddish light and was about half the size of the first object. It too disappeared from sight. I am wondering if you have had any other reports of this nature, and if so, what your conclusions have been. I would appreciate any information you can give me on this matter. I will be glad to furnish any other details that may be required.

Sincerely yours,
