feet, an unidentified object appeared in front of them. The object 
approached them about 1500 yards behind Lt. Talmage and about 500 feet 
to the left. It appeared as though the object between the two aircraft, 
trying to hit Lt. Hobart, and Hobart made a sharp left turn, told

Lt. Hobart is now sure the object was not an optical illusion.
