Family Sees UFO Over Belleville
Belleville, Pa., Saturday, August 21, 1965 - Members of a Belleville family, including a professional engineer, his wife, and daughters, Judy, 9, and Becky, 13, said they watched an unidentified flying object pass over their home Thursday evening.
Orville A. Wilson, a professional engineer, his wife, and daughters, Judy, 9, and Becky, 13, said they watched the unusual object pass over their home.
Judy had started talking about satellites, and then the family saw the object. We went out in the back yard and sure enough there it was, huge and bright, much brighter than any stars. As it moved, it seemed to change shape from round to oblong. It was moving from north to south, we watched it for about 10 or 15 minutes and suddenly there was a flash of light and then it disappeared. It was about the size of a small plane, but much brighter. Just before it disappeared, there was a flash of light which seemed to come from within the object, and then it was gone.
Orville A. Wilson, my wife and two daughters, Judy, 9, and Becky, 13, said they all saw the object and were quite amazed by it. About midnight, my youngest daughter, Judy, came running in and said she had seen the object again, only this time it seemed to be larger and lower in the sky. We all rushed out but could not see it. I wasn't the only one. I don't know what it was, whether it was a satellite or what, but it sure didn't look like any unidentified flying object that I've ever heard of.
