The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was the official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. The text on the page describes an incident that occurred near Sutton, West Virginia, involving multiple witnesses who observed a large, luminous object in the sky.

The text describes the object as being "as big as a house" and "brighter than a house on fire." It mentions that the object seemed to be made up of several parts and had bright, greenish-orange beams of light emanating from it. The document also discusses the reactions and descriptions of the witnesses, including one who claimed to have seen what looked like an animal's eyes in the light.

Here is the full text transcribed from the image:

SEPT 12, 1952 - HILL NEAR SUTTON, WEST VIRGINIA (BARBER R 231)
A HUGE GLOWING MASS APPEARED OVER A HILLTOP, MOVING FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER. OTHERS SIDE WITNESSES OF THE HILLBILLIES CAME TO THE SPOT ABOUT 900 FEET AWAY. IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 1500 FEET UP, AND WAS BRIGHTER THAN A HOUSE ON FIRE. IT WAS AS BIG AS A HOUSE AND SEEMED TO BE MADE UP OF SEVERAL PARTS TO SHINE AND BLINKS AS.BIO AS A HOUSE IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER A COMPLETE SPHERE WAS SEEN, OR A HEMISPHERE.

NONE HEARD NO NOISES. OTHERS SAID IT MADE A WHOOSHING OR BEATING SOUND, SOMETHING LIKE THE SWISHING SOUND OF THE HELICOPTER, LATER THEY CLOSED THEY EARS TO THE NOISE. IT WAS MAKING. IT BECAME DARKER, THEN ALL LIGHT WENT OUT, AND IT SEEMED TO HAVE DISSIPATED.
THEY DID SEE IT COME ON ONE SIDE AND MOVE ACROSS AND GO OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE.THEY THOUGHT THEY SAW ANIMALS EYES IN THE LIGHT AND FLASHED ABOUT 15 FEET TALL, OR FOR IT WAS UNDER THE OVERHANGING LIMB OF A TREE AND THE LIMB WAS OF THAT HEIGHT.
IT MADE POSSIBLE THE REPORTED SIZE. THEY ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING SIMILAR BEFORE. IT WAS FINALLY DESCRIBED ONLY BASICAL IN THEIR THROAT AND SUFFOCATE YOU.
WHEN ASKED IF THEY HAD MOVED TOWARD THEM, THEY SAID NO, IT JUST STOOD UP AND DOWN. OTHER OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE.
