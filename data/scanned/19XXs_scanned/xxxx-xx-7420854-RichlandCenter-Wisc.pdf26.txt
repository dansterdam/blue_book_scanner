The image contains a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, which appears to be a report or questionnaire related to a UFO sighting. There is no photograph present in this image, only text and simple sketches.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as color, construction, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an arrow inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
