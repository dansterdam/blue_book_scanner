The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Thank you for your unidentified observation. The information which you have submitted is not sufficient for a scientific investigation. For your information, this case has been accepted for study and evaluation by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and will be handled further by that organization.
