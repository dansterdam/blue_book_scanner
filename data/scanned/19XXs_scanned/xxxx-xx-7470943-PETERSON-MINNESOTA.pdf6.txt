Transcribing the text:

I would like to amend my previous report to you of March 6, having given that report shortly after the incident and not being completely assured of all the details at that time.
I am really quite certain that the light I saw passing over were not any normal aircraft lights. The passage over my house was most definite, taking perhaps 4 or 5 seconds at the very most. The light was large, brilliant, and oval or disc-shaped, and seemed to pass at a fairly high altitude, probably 2,000 to 3,000 feet. There was no sound whatsoever, and the passage was swift and entirely silent.
