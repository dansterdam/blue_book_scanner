Transcription of the text in the document:

PART I. DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT REFLECTED LIGHT OR WAS SELF-LUMINOUS AND WHAT COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHETHER IT WAS SOLID, SEMI-SOLID, GASEOUS, OR LIQUID. INDICATE WHETHER IT GAVE OFF SMOKE OR VAPOR, WHETHER IT MADE ANY NOISE, AND JUST WHAT FACTORS THERE WERE THAT CAUSED YOU TO THINK THE OBJECT WAS NOT JUST AN ORDINARY OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.

A. Some kind of light, blue-green (brighter than normal) and round in shape looked unusual - nothing to indicate a point source but rather like a piece of the sky itself was emitting light. It appeared to be suspended in the air and remained in one place.

B. Round, very bright, white-yellowish light, larger than a star, moved at a fairly fast speed, then stopped momentarily and disappeared.

C. Feezy

D. point of light, brighter than stars, about the size of a dime held at arm's length, no noise, no trail, no apparent motion relative to the stars in the background.

E. Bright and larger than a star
