UFO's Plan Revisit To North San Juan
(NORTH SAN JUAN, Calif. (UPI) - Flying saucers people said they saw here medium and large - and they may visit again this Saturday, according to a town Saturday, according to sources.)
Tony told the man they'll be back this month, and said the "saucer people" will land Saturday.
The Air Force isn't taking this seriously, said an information officer at Beale Air Force Base, and material gathered about the sightings will not be taken to a conference at the University of Colorado.
But there's no doubt in the minds of Tony's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Tony Sprull, who operate a small grocery store here.
He also took a picture of the object, which was shaped like a "frosted doughnut" and was hovering over an abandoned car. The auto has disappeared.
Tony said the UFO also was sighted by an unidentified nun from Mount St. Mary's Academy in Grass Valley. He said they exchanged information on their sightings and agreed that the saucer people resemble humans and had children with them.
"They even talk like humans," he explained.
