Coming your Air Force career I had a strange experience. I was almost certain at the time that I had seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO, as we called them. This occurred at approximately 11:50 P.M. on September 19, 1957 while I was stationed at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The weather was clear, very little wind, and visibility good. I observed a strange luminous object in the sky which appeared to be hovering for approximately 10-15 minutes. It was shaped like a crescent, casting a soft blue-green glow. After hovering for a while, it started moving swiftly horizontally and then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from sight. I radioed the control tower on the base and was informed that they had received no other reports of any unusual sightings at that time. I have not had any other sightings since then. This is the only UFO experience I have ever had. I would be interested in any information your office can provide me on this incident. Thank you for your consideration.
