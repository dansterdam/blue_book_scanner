Dear Sirs:

At approximately 9:45 this evening, my younger sister and I observed a U.F.O. in the sky while stargazing. I am 15 years old and my sister is 11. For the past 4 months or so, I have been a serious student of the U.F.O. mystery but believe me, I never thought I'd see one myself. Let me tell you what I saw and perhaps you may be able to find an explanation for it.

My sister, an unbeliever in U.F.O.'s, sighted the object first and attracted my attention to it. My first impression was that it was some sort of a plane or satellite, but after watching its strange behavior it was something out of the ordinary. It was a faintly bright, consistent white light, with occasional flashings of red. It first appeared directly overhead, moved across the sky a distance, blinked off, and continued to do this again and again. The object then completely vanished, just like a light being turned off. That was the last we saw of it. And another strange thing, the U.F.O. disappeared as it entered the north-east sky. It then completely vanished, just like a light being turned off. That was the last we saw of it. And another strange thing, the U.F.O. disappeared as it entered the north-east sky. It then re-appeared about 10 minutes later and went off in the same direction from which it had disappeared. Please believe me, I have never seen anything like this before. I would be happy to fill out one of your U.F.O. sighting forms, in hopes that you may be able to explain what I saw.

Yours truly,
