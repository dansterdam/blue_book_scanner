Gentlemen:

On April 11, 1959, our family was about 5 mile NW of Piqua, Ohio, on old route 25. The moon was very bright and we were observing it through binoculars when our attention was arrested. 

Our entire family of 5 observed it by the naked eye and through binoculars. It was an object that moved through the sky at a tremendous speed. It was visible for several minutes. At times it displayed alternating colors of blue, green, and red. It was many times the size of a star. It would suddenly disappear and then reappear. It did many things that a conventional aircraft could not do. However, it was not high up in the sky. It appeared to be at a very low altitude. 

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
