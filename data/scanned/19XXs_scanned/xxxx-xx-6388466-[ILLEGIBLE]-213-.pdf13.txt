No. 213. Evidently refers to the same object as in Incident No. 212, but with entirely different description which, if accurate, would constitute material and collation on No. 212 obviously incorrect. It not same object, certainly not a weather balloon, as definite pattern of motion, as described, not possible under existing wind flow conditions.
