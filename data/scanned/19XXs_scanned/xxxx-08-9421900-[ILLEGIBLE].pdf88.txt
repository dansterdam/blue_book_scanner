The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from the Project Blue Book UFO archive, describing a report about a "Mexican Saucer Flag" incident that occurred in Mexico City, Mexico on August 19, 1965.

The text of the document is as follows:

MEXICAN SAUCER FLAG CONTINUES: We now have further information on the saucer landing at Mexico City's National Polytechnic Institute, described at the top of our December issue. A France Press wire service story dated August 24th gives the date of the landing as August 19th. The original source of the story is apparently "El Grafico," a Mexico City newspaper, and the witnesses were two students at the Institute. They claim that the flying saucer left behind a strange metallic tablet, which was submitted to the Institute's technical laboratories for analysis. We unfortunately do not know the results of this analysis.  

The students also state that the landing took place at 8:30 a.m., and involved a large luminous vehicle, with a cabin in its upper part, and with a gigantic tripod landing apparatus in its rear section. There was also a "radiation" of some sort, which buried all the rocks and foliage in the vicinity. Furthermore, slightly under 3 feet tall, got out of the machine, they had something resembling gas masks on their faces, before the eyes of the terrified students, who left the metal plate on the ground, and then climbed back into their machine and flew away. 

A France Press bulletin dated August 25th tells of a night-time sighting of a dozen UFOs in the skies of Tiajuna, Mexico. A group of witnesses made observations of these strange phenomena at close range, and made signals to them with their lanterns; whereupon one of the craft left the formation and came down, almost to earth. The signals had been made in jest, and when they seemed to be answered, the startled witnesses panicked, abandoned their vehicle and other equipment, and fled.
