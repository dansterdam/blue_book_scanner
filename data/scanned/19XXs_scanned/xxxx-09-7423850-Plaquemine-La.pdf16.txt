UFO Observations Photograph September 3, 1967

1. Reference your unidentified flying object observation and subsequent photograph of September 3, 1967. Photo sunlight was accomplished by photographic experts at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, following your request.
2. Analysis of the photograph showed the unidentified image to be generally round in shape and positioned in the approximate center of the frame. It was noted that the unidentified image appeared to be blinking or pulsating, and this condition resulted from camera movement/vibration recorded by the Polaroid Swinger camera. The source stated that the object had a "pulsation" - that is, the unidentified image appeared to be blinking or pulsating, and did not move fast enough to stop motion. The photography indicated the camera shutter recorded was the small camera movement/vibration induced image displacement that occurred when the experts experimented with the photography. The Chief of Quality Control, indicated the unidentified image to be as described.
3. Enclosed are your Polaroid photograph and one enlargement. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
