WMLT
DUBLIN BROADCASTING COMPANY
P.O. BOX 699
DUBLIN, GEORGIA
September 23, 1952

Major Robert E. Kennedy, USAF,
Air Materiel Command,
Air Technical Intelligence Center,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Dear Major Kennedy:

In receipt of your letter of September 19, with additional negative to the recent unidentified aerial photograph.

Permits me to say that I did not see the phenomena. The people involved, Mrs. [REDACTED] and Mrs. [REDACTED], have telephoned their report of the sighting to the newspapers and so many other persons that it seems no earnest were they in their reports, and apparently are convinced that what they saw was not an explainable natural phenomenon. As I am not an expert in these matters, I can only pass on the information as it was given to me.

I appreciate the two officers and the interest you have in the report and regret that I can be of no further service.

Sincerely yours,
Parris Carr Williams
