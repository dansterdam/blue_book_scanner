Brownsville, Ky. 6-29-52

Security Officer
Godman Air Force Base
Ft. Knox, Ky.

Dear Sir:

On Monday, June 16, between 7:50 and 8:15 P.M. C.S.T. I saw a flying object that I could not identify. It looked very much like an extremely brilliant object. It disappeared while I was watching it. It appeared to be a very great distance from me.

With the county surveyor's instruments I got the following readings from a point 3 miles southeast of Brownsville, Ky.: Sighted - - - Altitude - - - Range 35 miles of flight path - - - Direction 3-5 degrees northeast.

I am positive that it was not an airplane and almost as sure it was not a weather balloon because I was on the wrong side to see reflection from the sun.

You may pass this information on to whom it is appropriate. I do not want any publicity as far as my name is concerned.

Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
