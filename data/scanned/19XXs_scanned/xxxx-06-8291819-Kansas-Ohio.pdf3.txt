Gentlemen:

For your information, on Wednesday morning, June 8th 1966, around 6:43 a.m. I was driving from my home north of Bowling Green, Ohio (Seneca County), I was on my way to work in Toledo, Ohio. As I have been doing 100 miles each day for some time now, I looked up and suddenly saw an object, it seemed to be coming up at me from behind a cloud. I was traveling straight west on Sandusky County Road #1 headed south and northeast toward Fremont, Ohio. This object was traveling very fast at first and then it slowed down considerably. It seemed to be a flying object just above and ahead of me a little to the right of my car and just above the tree tops of the small woods. This object was round and whitish in color and as it came closer it seemed to be a plan [sic] buzzing my car. The first thought was that it was a plane buzzing my car, but the second it focused on the object again, it appeared to be flying a level (low) course. It appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate. Just as it appeared to be flying a level course, it suddenly took off at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared. I was not able to pick up a tail, fins, windows or props. It was shiny new silver metal looking. It was blink [sic] clear shining. I heard no noise, although I did not turn off the engine of my VW or roll down the right window to listen. I tried to get a picture but my camera was not working. It is possible that it stopped to be a balloon or a plane or something, but it traveled NE from me and disappeared over a wooded area a mile away. I could not follow it after that point.
