The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document describes a UFO sighting that occurred over Yaak, Montana, including details about the visual observations, estimated size and distance of the objects, and other relevant information. The document is classified as "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom.

The text in the document is as follows:

The objects were visible at times, and other times were observed by radar. They were military authorities. One while light was as it of a cigarette and several smaller ones were observed jettloned from the larger object which was circular in shape and was estimated to be approx. 30 to 50 feet in diameter.

The objects were observed over a period of an hour, from about 10:55 P.M. to about 11:55 P.M. on 6 September 1952. The objects on the PPI scope were tracked from 10:55 to 11:50 P.M.

Visual observation from the surface by two airmen, and by three airmen in an aircraft, were mounted on a standard type B-29/TB-50. The last visible and longitude observed, both visually and on PPI scope, were as follows: Latitude 56°52' North, Longitude 115°06' West. The objects were observed to be about 30 to 50 miles from the observers, and at an elevation at about 10,000 or 15,000 feet. The objects were observed to move at a speed of 20 to 70 knots.

Observers:
(1) Visual: A/1C Harvey, Earl G., AF 16468671, DAFSC 27250 
A/1C Oversier. Leonard E., AF 15368997, DAFSC 27250
(2) Electonics: A/1C Hamilton, James L., AF 16400717, DAFSC 27250 (3) All these observers were familiar with conventional aircraft and warning operators.

A few of this class were in the sky. The period was just before dawn so the sky was somewhat dark but clear. No activity or condition, weather or otherwise, which might account for the sighting is known.

a. No physical evidence exists.
b. No interception was attempted because no fighter aircraft were available.
