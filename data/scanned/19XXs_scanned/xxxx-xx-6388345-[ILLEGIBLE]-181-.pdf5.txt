Part II Information obtained from ground radar only periodically as it flew in and out of permanent ground return area in which search was conducted. Time of incident was identified as one was friendly and was known. Radar tracking was obtained showing objects were descended at high rate of speed, confirming visual sighting. The only object detected at any time by ground radar and the detector of this command airborne at the time of sighting. Estimated distance between interceptor and objects in flight is as follows: 

First picked up at 10 miles and Lost at approximately 5000 feet.
Third picked up at 3 miles and Lost at 10 miles.
Four, five and all plotted up to 5 miles. Lost at 3000 feet.
The last three sightings took place during a 10 minute period, each lasted approximately 5 miles ahead, slowly closed to within six 1000 feet when object suddenly accelerated and dived steeply.

Interceptor attempted to effect normal pick-up by diving also but were unsuccessful. Altitude of these objects confirmed by C.C.C. Reports and Digi 13 at Paine Chima at 32,000 feet.

Part II. Radar sites mentioned in previous reports are site 1 at 32° 105'N - 115° 12' COF pease and site 13: at Paine China at 32° 15'N.
