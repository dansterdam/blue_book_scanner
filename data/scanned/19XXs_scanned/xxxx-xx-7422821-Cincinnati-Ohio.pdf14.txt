The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO reports. The text on the image reads:

4 Oct. 1967
Called the Reading City Police Dept. (513-821-1035).
They have nothing in their logs about a UFO report on the night
of the 15-16. However if someone called and just asked for
information, it would not be recorded.
