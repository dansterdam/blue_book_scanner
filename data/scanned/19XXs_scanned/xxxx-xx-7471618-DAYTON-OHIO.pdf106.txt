GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENA, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS SHARPLY OUTLINED OR VAGUE, WHETHER IT GLOWED OR GAVE OFF A REFLECTION, WHETHER IT FLASHED OR PULSED, ETC.
It was the sight of my lifetime, the clearest and sharpest. The outline was perfect, it glowed and pulsated every few seconds, but remained stationary. The size seemed to be as a large star or small planet, with a slight trail of discoloration behind it, something like shooting sparks.
I believe was the view of the object.
It was solid, not transparent, and seemed to be hovering at a point of altitude.
It maintained this hovering position for a short time, then disappeared in a flash, leaving no trace.
