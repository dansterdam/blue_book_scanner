Dear Sirs,

About a month ago I filed in my answers to questions you mailed to me regarding my contact with an aerial phenomenon and immediately mailed them back to you, and still I have not heard from you. I have only just now received the enclosed letter from Congressman Vorys Morris which letter he had received from Department of the Air Forces, Washington and I have not received a letter from them. I am just wondering how long it is my take them to get to and examine my report.

I wish to inform you that I am corresponding for offers for the information regarding my contact with the aerial phenomenon, and most of all what is contained judging by the two senses, toric and small, the only means of course, by which I could or could, to determine the aerial phenomenon's contents to my satisfaction and I will accept the largest offers for same that will be given me with the near future providing the largest.
