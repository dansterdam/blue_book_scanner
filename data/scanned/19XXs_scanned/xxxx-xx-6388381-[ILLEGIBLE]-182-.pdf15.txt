Incident: 2000
While conversing with Mr. [REDACTED] on Battery Point, Crescent City, California, a household object that reflected light was observed. The object was elliptic in shape and was traveling southeast to northwest at a high rate of speed. It remained in sight for several seconds and then made a sharp turn and proceeded in a plane flying north. Shortly after sighting, the object made a sharp turn to the right and then assumed a horizontal course, disappearing from view. The object gave no noise or sound and was heard from the object. At all times the object remained brilliantly illuminated.
Mrs. [REDACTED], 70 years of age, of Swiss extraction, and is a long-time resident of Crescent City. She is of nervous intelligen ce and has a good character and reputation. She had no fear of speed, noise or altitude. She thought the object different than any other object she had ever seen. The brightness of the object impressed her most.
