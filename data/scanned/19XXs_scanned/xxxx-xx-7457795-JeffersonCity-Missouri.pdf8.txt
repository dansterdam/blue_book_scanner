To whom it may concern:

This report is being made at the request of the Air Force concerning an incident which occurred near Jefferson City, Missouri, on the afternoon of November 2, 1958. 

At approximately 3:15 p.m. on that date, I observed a strange object in the sky while driving on Highway 50 about 5 miles west of Jefferson City. The object was circular in shape and appeared to be metallic or silver in color. It was hovering in the sky at an estimated altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet. After observing it for about 2 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight within a few seconds.

I am a mature and responsible individual, and I can assure you that I was not imagining this incident. I have no reason to fabricate or exaggerate any part of this report. I am simply trying to provide you with an accurate account of what I saw on that afternoon.

If you have any further questions or require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
