"Comments:
When the clarity of the discriptions it is difficult to determine exactly what occurred.
It was apparently an ordinary light in the sky, however, no specific data and times are available except for the observer's own testimony. The summary descriptions of the objects are not sufficiently detailed to permit any definite conclusions. The objects were reported to be quite low near the ground. The witness felt that the lights were moving from the woods. There are no indications that the objects were mechanically propelled. It does not appear that the capabilities were comparable to those of present-day aircraft. The lights were reported to be seen in all directions, from different angles. State Trooper Shelton had the same witness recount the event, but upon inspection, no physical evidence could be determined. Since the identification of the lights is not clear, and the information available does not permit a positive identification, the conclusion the case is being carried as insufficient data for evaluation."
