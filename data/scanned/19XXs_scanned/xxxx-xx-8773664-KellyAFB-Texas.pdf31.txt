STATEMENT

We, the undersigned, are members of the 7th Air Depot Wing, Kelly
Air Force Base. We are eyewitnesses and work-men Base Building 1610 on the
Flight Line. We had just finished lunch 14 August 1952 and were lying
on our backs near Building 1610 resting and awaiting the end of our
lunch break. At 1130 hours, Central Standard Time, we noticed an
object in the South sky heading North in a straight flight. The
object appeared to be moving at an estimated speed of between
200 and 750 miles per hour at an altitude of between
5000 to 7000 feet. The object appeared oval in shape, and gave off
a dull whitish color. A B-36 flew over approximately fifteen minutes
later at about the same altitude and we decided that the object was
about one third as large as the B-36. We could hear no noise and
could see no wings, tail, or any other visible appendage features.
We did not see any trail or exhaust. We watched the object fly on its
course about thirty seconds, or a minute until it disappeared.

We certify that the above statement is true and correct to the
best of our knowledge:
