REPORT OF SIGHTING

Kirkland Air Force Base, New Mexico, do hereby wish to make the following statement:

At approximately 1316 CST on the 5th day of August, 1952, I did see an object in the sky. The object was first sighted by several people standing to the road looking up. This object was round in shape and resembling a metallic disc. The area surrounding it was clear. It was very bright in color and lost to sight at a high rate of speed. It appeared to be approximately 7 to 1000 feet in diameter. This object was for a short period hovering with no visible means of propulsion. This object was low in the sky but could not be identified as to any known aircraft. The object disappeared in a northerly direction.

Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 13th day of August, 1952.
