It appeared to me like a duck at right head on. It wa s like a shape like a duck but seemed ot be about twice the size of a duck. It had a grayish color and when I noticed it, it just seemed to be hovering not gaining or losing altitude. It didn't have wings or propellers or anything visible on it that I could tell. It just seemed to be hovering with no visible means of support. It appeared to be silently. 
It seemed to be directly overhead with a reddish tool.
