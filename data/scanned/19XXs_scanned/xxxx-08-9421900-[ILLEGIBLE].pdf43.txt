There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

On Thursday, July 22, 1965 between the hours of 2000 and 2100 I was sitting on our front porch at Lawton, Oklahoma 73505.

I was in the general direction of which is located approximately one-half mile to the north-east of my residence. The field of view from our front porch is from the east to west-north-west. The object was 2 coming from the south-east and traveling in a north-west direction. The object was at an altitude comparable to commercial aircraft coming into and leaving the airport, and its speed was a little faster than the commercial aircraft.

My time of observation could not have exceeded ten seconds, and could have been shorter. I was observing the object broadside and its path.

The object appeared to be as bright as molten metal, or silvery in color. The nose, or leading part of the object appeared to be as bright as molten metal, or silvery in color. Only a small portion of the underside of the object from view. At times it would appear to be a momentary flash of bright light, or silvery in color.

The object disappeared from view at the north-west horizon, seemingly going behind a house. This was the only object I observed during that time. I have never observed anything like it before or since.
