The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing handwritten responses to various questions about an unidentified flying object sighting.

Transcribing the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, suddenly - I could not follow it - it vanished by going straight up so fast I could not follow it.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): 
Yes - It moved behind something. No_ Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:
A dark cloud that I could not see through - I could still see the object but it was obscured by the cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):
Yes - It moved in front of. No_ Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:
A dark cloud as it went out of sight.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: No sound - just like a light tank looking steady at about 10,000 ft.
b. Color: Bright silver or white - glowing very bright. 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
Match the 1/2 length of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
