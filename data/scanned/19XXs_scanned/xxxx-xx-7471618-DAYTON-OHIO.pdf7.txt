The image contains two sketches. The first one is a circular diagram with directions labeled around the perimeter, such as NW, N, NE, E, and so on. This appears to be some kind of compass or orientation diagram. 

The second set of sketches shows two landscape scenes. The larger one depicts a road or path leading into the distance, with hills or mountains in the background. The smaller sketch shows a similar landscape scene, but with a person standing in the foreground.
