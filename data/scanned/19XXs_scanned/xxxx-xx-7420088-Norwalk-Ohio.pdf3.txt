Transcription of the text in the document:

at about 8:30 PM, we observed what appeared to be a "silver" or "station" in the eastern sky, just north of Norwalk, Ohio on Rt 250. We were in the air at the time and I stopped to get a better view to see if it was a plane since it was a clear, calm night and the object climbed and then descended. She then the object climbed slightly and altered and then just descended and continued westerly. I estimated an altitude of 10 minutes. I stopped my car and my father and I observed the line across the sky for about 10 minutes. Again I stopped and we were convinced it was a plane reflection. It was distinctly noticed, and slowly it moved westward. It maneuvered erratically, and was comparably large. When it was observed, its location was over the Elyria - Norwalk area, 6-8 miles from our location.
