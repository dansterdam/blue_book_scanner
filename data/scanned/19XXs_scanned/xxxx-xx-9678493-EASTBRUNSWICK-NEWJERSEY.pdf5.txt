"Perhaps Dore (?) there is a matter over some such incident. Wanted to be more elaborate in describing it. Seemed to be some description of a circular flying object travelling slowly at about 1,000 feet altitude at slow speed. Seen from a distance. Disc-like in shape and apparently about 30 feet in diameter, appeared to revolve or rotate on its axis, at random intervals was dark or obscured from view, then became visible again as before. Was seen by observer for several minutes through 7 x 50 binoculars. Observer is apparently a competent observer. Facts seem generally consistent and credible, but not enough detail to fully evaluate. Should retain for further questioning on specific aspects if possible.
