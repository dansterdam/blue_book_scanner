27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the diagram where you first saw the object. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and draw any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
