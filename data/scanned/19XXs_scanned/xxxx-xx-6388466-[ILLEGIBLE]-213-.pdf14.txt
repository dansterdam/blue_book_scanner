SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: Commanding General
Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, OHIO

1. Reference is made to letter from your Headquarters, CIAS, dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects", and first information memorandum dated 21 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 have been checked and additional information regarding the cause of these incidents has been furnished as indicated.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 15, "Direction of object's movement" should be changed to read "Direction toward which the object appears to move." This would clarify the intention towards which the object appears to move rather than the direction from which it came.
