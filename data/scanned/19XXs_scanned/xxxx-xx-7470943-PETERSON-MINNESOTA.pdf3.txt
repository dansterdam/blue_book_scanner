Dear Sirs:
6120 Louis Boulevard. Sighting of Flying Saucer
At 0:50 AM CST on May 23, 1967 at approximate elevation of 40 degrees above the horizon to the south, observed a round, bright metallic object appearing to hover slowly. It moved slowly for about 30 minutes, then moved very rapidly out of sight in a northerly direction. The object appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter and had a brilliant light in the center which illuminated the entire object. There was no sound associated with the object. My wife also observed the object.
But the most peculiar thing about it, was a red light strobing on the top of the object. Unfortunately, my camera was not working and I could not get a photograph. It emitted a bright steady white light, but there was a red light on the top of the object which strobed or pulsated rapidly. The object was visible for about 15 minutes.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
