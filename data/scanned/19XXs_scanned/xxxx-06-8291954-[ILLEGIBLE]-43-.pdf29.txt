there is extremely little public knowledge of the inter- and work being conducted in gravity and anti-gravity. Many experiments, theories, and developments are classified and unpublicized. Even if it is known publicly that mass###### inertia exists, policy being made must be guarded against the pronouncements that UFOs are other than what they really are.
It is predicted that unless the truth of USAF interest in UFOs is made public, the ridiculous spectacle of its becoming the prime political consideration of the western world will continue impressing mankind at a time when scientific knowledge is lagging, once started on unearned propaganda sensations of five-million americans now having seen saucers hovering over their homes, and their planet, into sensations of ever-increasing wildnesses and more rapid developments of sightings of ufo forms of a much more mystical and startling nature. This campaign of ridicule, starting with inauspicious pronouncements by government agencies, to the detriment of the serious scientific and objective consideration of phenomena is intensified for other than openly avowed scientific reasons.
Indications of traditional policy when viewed from the other side of the area, wherein and that is where most of us are, and there is little in literature to support the intimation that human beings are utilitarian beings.
