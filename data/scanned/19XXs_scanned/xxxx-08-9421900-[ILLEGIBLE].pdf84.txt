SAUCER LANDING IN NORTH CAROLINA: Through researcher George Fawcett it was learned of a landing that occurred near Mount Holly, N.C. on November 1, 1956. The witnesses were Mrs. E. J. Buchanan and her husband and Mrs. J. Blackburn. The noise behind the house was similar to the noise sometimes reported as "humming sounds." The lady was so frightened that it took her some time to get behind the windowshade and look out. When she did, she saw an object on the ground beyond the driveway. The object was observed beyond the driveway for some time and then disappeared. The next morning, a flattened and or depressed area was found, forming a circle about 15 to 20 feet in diameter, and some small tree leaves were free of line, as if they had been fluttered or shaken. The family were fearful of remaining at the location and moved out shortly. A geiger counter indicated that remnants of the mysterious circle still remained. A glowing reddish substance that stained the ground was taken still later by Mr. Fawcett, but it was no longer glowing.
