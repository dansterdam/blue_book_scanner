The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document that includes instructions and questions related to sketching and describing the motion and shape of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

The text in the document reads:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was then you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead
   B
         A
Horizon      Horizon
    You

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.
Motion not discerning. Too high.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
