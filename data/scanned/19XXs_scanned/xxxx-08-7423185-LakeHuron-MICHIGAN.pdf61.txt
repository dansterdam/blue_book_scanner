14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes, it appeared to pulse and at times disappear in brightness.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes, (Circle One) Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what -
It moved behind a bright white object - pulsating cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes (Circle One) Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what -
In front of a bright white pulsating cloud. 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None
b. Color - Grayish - Pulsating in brightness

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
At arm's length, the object would have covered about 3/4 inches at the most, in diameter. It appeared to be half as large as the moon.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you can remember, such as markings, wings, or other projections. Please on another page beside the drawing if you need more room.
[Drawing is provided, showing a saucer-shaped object with some annotations.]
