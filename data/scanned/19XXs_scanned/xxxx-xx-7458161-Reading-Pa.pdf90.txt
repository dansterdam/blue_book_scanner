SIGHTING ACCOUNT

The sighting started about 9:00 PM PST, Friday, 4/22/66. As the witness, Miss XXXXX XXXXX, was driving slowly northward on Boyertown Road, just north of Reading, Pa., she noticed a very large, bright object in the sky ahead of her car. The object was stationary and appeared to be resting on the ground at a slight distance ahead of her position. She continued driving toward the object, and as she approached it, the object lifted up slowly off the ground and started moving slowly in a northerly direction at a height of about 40-50 ft. above the road. As the object moved, she drove under it and was able to observe it closely. She described it as being about 40-50 ft. in diameter, round in shape, and having bright, flashing lights around its perimeter. The flashing lights were of a blue-green color. The object moved slowly northward for about 1/2 mile, then it suddenly increased its speed and accelerated rapidly out of sight to the north.

However, the witness was certain that what she saw was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other type of conventional aircraft. She believed that what she observed was some type of unidentified flying object.

The sighting lasted for a total of about 3-4 minutes. The witness was quite shaken and upset by the experience.
