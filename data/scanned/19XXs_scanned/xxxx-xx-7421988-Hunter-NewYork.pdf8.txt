Traffic, no apparent change. The sighting was not observed again nor moved.

That it was anything more than some sort of natural occurrence I could not be sure.

There was no noise, no movement, no exhaust or lights, other than what you would expect from something like a Star suspended in the sky. It looked pretty close but from the long distance could be as much as 50 - 75" up.

With preliminary caution this subject is reluctantly reported. Any significant dimension, observation or measure which might assist in identifying the phenomena observed is regretfully omitted as my observations were of a necessarily casual nature and from a distance not conducive to accurate assessment.
