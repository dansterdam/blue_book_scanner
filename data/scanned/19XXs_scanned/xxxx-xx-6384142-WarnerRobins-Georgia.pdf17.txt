AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SPOT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
1. Unidentified Flying Objects:
  a. Observer: Maser Robins, Robins AFB, Ga.
  b. Location: Warner Robins, Georgia
  c. Date and Time: 15 September 1952 at 1925 hours EST
  d. Weather: (Official Report of Base Weather Station) 1300 hours = visibility 15 miles. Temp. 79 degrees F. Wind calm. Ceiling = clear. Altimeter setting 29.92 inches.
2. Major sightings reported by a crew consisting of 4 officers:
   At 1925 hours, on 15 September 1952, it was stated that an estimated 4 to 8 objects were sighted, colored white, of a luminous nature. The objects were hovering and oscillating (2) which gave the impression of a pulsating or flashing light. The objects were observed for approximately 12 to 15 minutes.
3. The objects were moving in a circular motion at an altitude estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. The objects appeared to be approximately 10 to 20 miles south southwest of the observers' position. The objects did not leave any trail of exhaust or vapor. When the objects moved, they would make a slight turn and then accelerate at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight in 2 to 3 seconds.
4. Objects appeared to be all alike in size, color and maneuverability. They seemed to be under intelligent control.
5. Observers did not take any instrumental bearings, and at no time did any of the objects appear to be closer than 15 to 20 miles from the observers' location.
6. The sighting lasted for approximately 15 minutes.
7. The objects were not under the influence of intervening weather at the time of sighting.
