U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION
This questionnaire has been prepared so that you can give the U.S. Air Force as much information as possible concerning the unidentified aerial phenomenon that you observed. Please try to answer as many questions as you can, and be as accurate as possible. This information will be used in connection with any statements that you may have made to other agencies. Do not hesitate to give any information that you feel is pertinent, even though it is deemed unusual, as this will assist in the proper evaluation of this phenomenon.
