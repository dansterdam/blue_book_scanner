SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

Air Material Command  
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

ATTN: MCIAIO-3  

1. Your letter from your Headquarters, MCIAIO, dated 1 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects", has reference. The incidents summarized through 233 have been checked against previous evaluations made by the Air Force. Reports and further information on these incidents are inclosed.  

2. It is recognized that the "Guides to Identification of Discernible Objects in the Night Sky" issued as an "Air Intelligence Information Sheet" is an excellent aid, but it does not appear to cover all characteristics and motions which are distinguished by possible and impossible, and in that motion is signified no more than relative change in apparent position, it would seem that any motion is possible. A radar set indication of any "unidentified flying object" should include a statement as to the type of
radar set used.
