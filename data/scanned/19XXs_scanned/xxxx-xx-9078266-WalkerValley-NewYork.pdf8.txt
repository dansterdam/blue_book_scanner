UFO Report (Your Ltr, 5 Jun 67)

JUN 14 1967

1. Your UFO Report, on a unidentified flying object observation of 1 May 1967, is being referred to your office so that your UFO investigating officer will have the opportunity of evaluating the information contained in this report.

2. The information in this report is not only confusing but worthless as it does not contain sufficient specific and detailed information needed when filling out a UFO report. It is quite apparent that someone is screening the reports and sending them in without any thought as to their content.

3. We do not intend to accept the "weak excuse" however, as an example of incomplete information we would like to bring to your attention the information contained in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5, we cannot determine in which direction the object was moving, its distance, and elevation of the object was 50 above the trees. How tall are the trees?

4. Request you reaccomplish this report in accordance with all the provisions of AIR Force Regulation 60-17.
