Dear Mr. ****,

I acknowledge and thank you for your letter dated 6 October 1959, addressed to the Civil Air Patrol, concerning an unidentified flying object sighting at Norton, Connecticut on 9 October 1959.

A preliminary analysis of this sighting suggests you observed a "moot or unusual aerial phenomenon, possibly for the first time through binoculars." The fact that it was seen through binoculars would indicate a relatively clear identification.

In order to complete a final analysis and/or evaluation of the sighting, your original letter needs expansion and in some instances clarification.

I am enclosing a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet for you to complete. In addition, under remarks on page 10 of the form, will you please answer the following questions:

1. What was the angular estimation of the size made through the binoculars or with the naked eye?
2. If angular estimate of size was made through the glasses, is this estimate of size made through the glasses?
3. What is the field of vision of the witnesses' binoculars?
4. How wide or narrow a sector was observed a meter through binoculars?

When the form is completed, will you please forward it direct to Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. They will then complete the evaluation of your sighting and you will be advised of their conclusions.

Many thanks again for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

/s/ LAWRENCE J. TACKER
