TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
on the door and Mr. Bradford finally appeared. (He was drunk and didn't walk or talk very straight.) He said he had returned 2 hours ago and let the boys off. They never returned to the Grocery Store, where our military vehicle was parked. Mrs. [Redacted] did not know of their whereabouts and did not seem particularly concerned that they had not returned. I asked if I could have the negatives at that time. She stated that Tony had changed his mind again and did not want to give them up. I asked if he could call me that evening.
Tony called that evening and when asked where he was, he stated that he did not know we were looking for him. He said he did not want to release the negatives.
(Before I left N. San Juan that afternoon, I was approached by a [Redacted] Old Main Street, N. San Juan, who said he had seen a UFO 14 years ago in this farmer's field and it looked like the picture. He said there were no windows or people visible to him. It made a strange sound and was shiny "aluminum." He said it was 20 feet across with a rounded dome and was flat on top. He also said it 10-12 feet high. He said that he was backing down a hill very fast when it landed. (He described the top of the UFO very vividly - a difficult feat if he was backing away and down for the object.)
I was absent from the area from Sunday until Tuesday evening for the UFO Conference at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. I returned late Tuesday evening.
I had been called many times by the Grass Valley Newsman, [Redacted], a UFI representative very interested in playing the story and pictures up because "there is a lot of money in it for me" and if it is released.
(Second 3 as pronounced) The boys did not testify on and the tape extensively. There was a filmed report and interview with the boys.
