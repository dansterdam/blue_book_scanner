Dear Sir:

It has recently come to our attention that you may be interested in reports of unusual objects in the sky. There have been several reports of such objects in this area recently, and we would like to submit them for your consideration.

During the past month we have been observing the phenomena and collecting as much data as possible. We have observed several objects of various shapes and sizes, some of which appear to be metallic and others which appear to be non-metallic. The objects have been observed at various times of the day and night, and their movements have been erratic and unpredictable.

While we have not been able to determine the exact nature of these objects, we believe they may be of some scientific interest. We would be happy to provide you with any additional information or data that you may require.

Sincerely, ..."
