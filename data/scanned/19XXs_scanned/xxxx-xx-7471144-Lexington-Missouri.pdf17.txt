Dear Major

I have some very interesting data of an object that I lost around 12-15-63 about five minutes after a fire in the afternoon. The object was hovering above the trees and was about as big as a basketball and was about 10 feet above the ground. It was a glowing green and was going to the southeast. It was moving a lot and I was manning to the southeast. It was soming very fast and seemed to be about 20 feet long. I did not get my camera. The day off you are not interesting because the recorder's react did not come in the stone.
