DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES MAY 12-18, 1969

The lines on this map represent the contours of equal barometric pressure, where the pressure gradients are sufficient to produce motion of the air. This is indicated by the patterns of closed isobars, which show the wind direction and speed at the observational levels.

The Highest and Lowest Pressure figures show the maximum and minimum values in the 48-contiguous-state area for the reporting period, with the observational times at which they occurred.

The precipitation data includes the rainfall, snowfall, and state of the weather. The movement of cyclones, anticyclones, and fronts are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled.

The symbols used on this Daily Weather Map are defined at the bottom of the panel. They describe the observed current weather and compare it to the normal climatological conditions for the same period.
