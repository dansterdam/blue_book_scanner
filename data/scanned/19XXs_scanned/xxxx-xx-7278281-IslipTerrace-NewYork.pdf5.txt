The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document containing descriptive text and a diagram or diagram-like elements.

Thems something like they could be on a plane. I have a little son about... but i can't tell you about... that on the other field...

The diagram portion of the image contains various labels and numbers, but without more context, I cannot confidently interpret their meaning.
