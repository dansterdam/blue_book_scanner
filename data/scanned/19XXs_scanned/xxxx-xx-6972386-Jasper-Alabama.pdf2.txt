This replies to your letter in which you reported your unidentified aerial object observation. The description you provided in your letter is similar to that of many other reports we have had concerning such sightings. These have been placed in the "Aircraft" category since there is nothing in your report to indicate that the object was an "Unidentified Flying Object" rather than some conventional aircraft.
