(2) Locate 3 18 residence

1/15/52 or 2 observed that the terrain was extremely rugged, with steep cliffs and canyons in the area, which would make it almost impossible for anything to land in the immediate vicinity without detection by the observers or others in the area.

2. Identification or Certification Action Taken: None.

Comments of Investigator: There is no explanation for the reported sighting by the observers. They are very certain of what they saw, but it does not appear to have been any known object or phenomena. The object remained visible for a considerable period of time and was observed by more than one person, but no physical trace could be found. The case remains unidentified for lack of positive information.
