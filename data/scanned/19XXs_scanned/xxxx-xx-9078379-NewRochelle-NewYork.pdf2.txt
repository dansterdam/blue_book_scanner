I have information which I believe would be of interest to your organization concerning an incident which occurred at New Rochelle, New York on May 3, 1967.
 
As you know, we have been investigating a number of such incidents in this area and I do not believe that the phenomena observed on the above date has any explanation at this time. The form report # 93017451 of the incident is attached.
 
I do not wish to make any public release of this information at this time as I would prefer to wait until a more thorough investigation can be made. However, I felt it my duty to bring this matter to your attention as soon as possible.
 
Thank you for your consideration.
 
Yours truly,
