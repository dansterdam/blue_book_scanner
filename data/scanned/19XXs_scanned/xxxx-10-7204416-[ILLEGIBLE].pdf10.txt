UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SIGHTED IN GULF OF CAMPECHE

PART ONE
I. INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS AND RESULTS:
On 28 October 1958, this organization was directed to investigate the sighting of an unidentified object which was sighted over the Gulf of Campeche. Two U.S.S. Aiss investigating officers, Capt. PATRICK J. WHELAN and 1st Lt. ELMER L. SCOGGIN, were assigned to conduct the investigation. A BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS Message, 231942Z was expected to arrive in the BROWNSVILLE area between 291800Z and 300600Z Oct 58, from the MEXICAN NAVAL EXCHANGE, BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS. However, this message was not received.
As effort was made to procure its transportation to CIUDAD del CARMEN, the investigating officers conducted personal interviews and obtained information from various sources. The flying services of the U.S. Border Patrol aircraft, which occasionally operates in that area, were utilized to transport the investigating officers. The investigating officers also considered the possibility of chartering a private aircraft from a local fixed base operator. However, the cost involved was prohibitive.
After exhausting the possibilities of air transportation to CIUDAD del CARMEN, the investigating officers conducted personal interviews and interviewed the United States Coast Guard representatives, the Commanding Officer of the USGC Center at BROWNSVILLE.
Lt. FORD was born in CLOVIS, New Mexico and is in his middle of life. He has been married and has one son. Lt. FORD has served in the USCI for more than seventeen years, the last nine years with reconnaissance and destroyer escort on an anti-submarine duty between BOSTON and the MEDITERRANEAN. He was assigned to the investigation for approximately one year, with his previous duty assignment in Florida. He was stationed in Florida with his previous duty assignment is Guantanamo, Cuba. Upon being questioned on his knowledge as the Capt. Lt. FORD's ability to identifying unidentified objects, after being given a description of the object sighted, he stated that the object would not be eastbound to assist the investigating officers in determining the object.
