MAKE COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT, OR PLANET IF POSSIBLE.

We felt that all the object was definitely round in shape, as far as could be determined in the dark, and it appeared to maintain its shape throughout the sighting. It seemed to emit a low hum or whirring noise. There appeared to be a sort of bluish-green center portion or light that was slightly brighter than the surrounding area. The overall size was approximately the size of a dime held at arm's length. The object seemed to move slowly and noiselessly from north to south, maintaining a steady altitude, and finally faded from sight. The duration of the sighting was approximately 10-15 seconds. There were no visible wings, rudder, or other appurtenances, and it seemed to be self-propelled. The sky was clear with scattered clouds, and no stars or moon were visible at the time.
