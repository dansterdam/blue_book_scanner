M20 FOR THE RECORD: 23 FEB 67 

Contact with Sgt. Jackson, WESTOVER AFB (ext 2316) provided the following information: 

Sgt. Jackson said that shortly before the observation, a trainee, route plover, was traveling an route from the base at Syracuse. There was also at approximately 10 minutes later a Capt. Hill (flying aircraft 5/39,75) noticed the object from another angle but did not think it was a.Lrcraft. 

Sgt. Jackson said there was also a hit by a Training aircraft at 2235;33 and gave the following details: The object did not seem to be moving steadily but would suddenly speed up and then slow down. It was an apparent size smaller than a silver dollar held at arm's length in the sky. It was a bright white in color and was seen for approximately 15 minutes. 

Sgt. Jackson said he did not think the policeman could have seen the sighting from the COCO unless the time of observation was closer to the sighting by the two aircrews.
