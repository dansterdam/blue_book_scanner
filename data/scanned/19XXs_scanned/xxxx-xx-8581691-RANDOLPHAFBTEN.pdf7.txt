3.110th FLY TGM WG (MI), RANDOLPH AFB, TEX

1. At approximately 1230 hours, 22 July 1952 the Wing Intelligence Officer received a report that a civilian had observed an unidentified object on the evening of 21 July 1952.

2. Immediate investigation revealed that the civilian was a Mr. Raudolph [sic]. Interrogation revealed that the object sighted appeared to be in level flight traveling from the northwest to the southeast. It had a domed shape and was emitting a silver color.

3. Other aerodynamic features of the object could not be determined. The object was visible for approximately 10 minutes.

4. The object flew in a straight line at level flight from the north west to the south east. No other details concerning the object's flight were obtained.

5. The sighting was made at approximately 1830 hours, 21 July 1952. It was observed for several seconds (at least 3 minutes and not longer than 5).

6. The observation was made virtually from the ground by two witnesses (two civilian lattice and steel workers) who were outdoors at the time. The sighting was in the direction of the south west to the north east. The object appeared to be low and near the horizon to the south west. It was at an altitude of approximately 1500 feet above the ground.

7. Civilians below the flight path did not notice the aircraft and 4 Military planes in the vicinity. This occurred during the daylight flying conditions which could account for why the flying object did not resemble anything the observers had seen before.

8. There was no interception or identification of the flying object and no photos were taken of the object.

9. The only air traffic reported was 4 B-29's flying locally in the traffic pattern at Randolph AFB.
