Dear Major Tacker:

Thank you for your communication of 14 April 1958. I am quite familiar with the requirements involved with reference to obtaining stock motion picture footage from the Defense Department Library. We were only recording the purchase of such film.

I note with some interest your caution of reference to the film-footage that over Wright-Patterson AFB on 20 August 1955, and about which I also inquired. You can surely verify the origin of this very rarely the existence of that film, as it was cleared by the Air Force to Funk Magazine, 1952 and was reproduced in the December 1953 issue.

I do not know if this film would adequately register on a television screen. I haven't the slightest doubt that it would register most satisfactorily on motion picture screens.

As I have said to Captain Marley, I feel that your co-operation on this project proves recognition - sincere even though on a very limited basis - will help to allay the curious questions of the Air-Believing public pertaining to this subject from the public, and would certainly be a step in the right direction to improve public relations and to encourage my productions to an honest, historical documentary of the Air Force's aide as I am the various other factions.

Sincerely,
PRODUCER OF DOCUMENTARY MOTION PICTURE FILMS
