SUBJ: UFO OBSERVATIONS, 22 June 1968
Lt Marano called Mr. [redacted] with regards to his aerial advertising plane. 
Mr. [redacted] was flying in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton and Kettering on the night of 22 June 1968 and was over Franklin at approximately 10:12 pm on 22 June 1968. His plane was visible for approximately 15 miles distance. He was advertising for [redacted] of Miamisburg for their sentinel.

Mr. [redacted] also said that his plane was in the area for the Mt Healthy sighting that we had written about. He didn't know if his plane was in the area at the other sighting since he didn't know the exact location of it. We told him it was about 20 miles up river from Cincinnati. He said that his plane is visible for approximately fifteen miles in the distance and that he had been operating as far east of Cincinnati as Mt Washington. Lt Marano said that we would write him a short note listing some of the towns in the area of the sighting.
