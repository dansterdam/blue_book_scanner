The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, describing an interview with a film developer in Grass Valley, California. The report discusses an incident where some pictures were taken of an unidentified flying object, but the report states that the pictures were not tampered with and were not included with the report. The document also mentions that the camera used had a fixed focal length and that there were no further developments to report at the time.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:

The film developers in Grass Valley were interviewed by me and the photographer on Saturday morning, 10 June. They said that the pictures were not tampered with at all and the only thing they did was to develop the film.

The 79# camera which the boys used has a fixed focal length.

After the report was prepared, there was another article in today's Sacramento Bee newspaper about this article. The general text of the article was that the "Flying Saucer" was reported and the pictures were shown on the screen. He said that since the pictures were already out, he thought he may as well verify. He further stated that because of the fixed focal length of the camera and the quality of the pictures, it appeared to be a less than 3 feet diameter object. Because a picture taken not at infinite focus, he polished off the wire and lenses in the two pictures not included in this report, and stated that there were no indications in the area of the images that corresponded to the area of the UFO landing.

Any further developments will follow.
