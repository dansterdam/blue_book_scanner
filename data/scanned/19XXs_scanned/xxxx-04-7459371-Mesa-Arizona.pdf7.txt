FROM HIS ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVATION AND THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AND PRINTED IN MY PRESENCE, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS A PLASTIC SACK SUSTAINED BY HEATED AIR. THIS TYPE ACTIVITY HAS BEEN NOTED IN THIS AREA IN PAST MONTHS AND IS A FAD WITH CHILDREN. THE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MAKING HOT AIR BALLOONS WITH CANDLES AND PLASTIC SACKS OBTAINED FROM DRY-CLEANING ESTABLISHMENTS.
