1. Under provisions of AFR 200-2, dated 29 April 1952, and in the absence of AF report 112, this report of unidentified flying object is submitted:

Colored lights were observed in the sky southeast of this station. At about 2310 the first sighting was made. The lights appeared to be stationary, and of a flashing color pattern, varying from red to yellow to green. The lights were observed for about 15 minutes, and disappeared abruptly. Several minutes later, another group of lights was observed, in a rather erratic pattern, and changing colors occasionally. The last observation was at about 2330, when the lights suddenly diminished in intensity and disappeared. The witnesses stated that the objects did not appear to have any definite shape, and seemed amorphous in shape. A long white vapor trail was left when the objects disappeared.
