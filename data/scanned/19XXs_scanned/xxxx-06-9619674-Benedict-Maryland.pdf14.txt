The image contains a photograph, which appears to be a side view and head-on view diagram of an observed object. The diagram on the right shows the "Brilliant white" object and provides measurements such as "Head-on view 3,800-4,000 feet" and "Side View 105 feet." The image on the left shows a triangular shape that is likely a side view of the observed object.
