Dear Mr.

I appreciated learning of your most exciting experience. 
It must have been a truly fantastic observation.

I depict disbelief on your behalf concerning the validity 
of your observation on UFO investigation by the Air 
Force. Speaking as Chief of Project Blue Book, I know of 
no evidence on which to base my statements that I possess 
with the same certainty as yours.

NICAP is in no way associated with the USAF or any agency 
of the armed forces. NICAP is a private, non-violent UFO 
investigation group and has no relationship with Project 
Blue Book.

Again, I want to thank you for reporting to the Air Force 
your recent unusual observation. The information you furnished has been forwarded to my office for evaluation. Although I personally cannot determine the validity of your claim, I will submit your case file to some upper air research physicists for their evaluation.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF 
Chief, Project Blue Book
