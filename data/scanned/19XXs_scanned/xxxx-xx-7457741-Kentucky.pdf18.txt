The image contains a sketch diagram and a compass illustration. The sketch diagram depicts the sky with an object above the horizon, and instructs the viewer to mark certain points on the diagram. The compass illustration appears to be a visual aid to help describe the object's position and motion. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve: line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were grouped, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
