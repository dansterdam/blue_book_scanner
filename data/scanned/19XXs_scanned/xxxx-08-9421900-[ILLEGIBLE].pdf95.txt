On the night of Sept. 15, 1959, Pretoria (South Africa) police 
were called to investigate a strange object in the sky which proved 
to be a flying saucer like object. Their report is summarized as
follows:

The District Commandant of Pretoria North, Lt. Col. J.B.
Brits, instructing his staff, was informed by a "reliable authority" 
that a sighting of a highly secret nature and an inquiry is 
being conducted into the incident.

About 23.30 on the night of Sept. 15, several persons were 
being concerned in the area about a strange object in the sky.
Police were immediately sent to investigate. The UFO was 
not belatedly sighted, but their report was already on record.

The lift-off was quicker than anything I have ever seen. 
The police spotted the UFO first, and then Lockrem and de Klerk
saw the lift-off. As the police were watching the object, it shot up
suddenly and swiftly (amazing) towards the northwest.

About ten seconds after Lockrem and de Klerk spotted the UFO,
it suddenly lifted from the road. The instantaneous take-off 
left a brilliant bluish-white blast of flame below it. It 
then streaked off across the sky, rapidly disappearing from 
their sight.
