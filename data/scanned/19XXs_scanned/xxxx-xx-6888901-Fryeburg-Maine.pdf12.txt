The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose with directions labeled around the periphery. The smaller sketches appear to show a landscape view with a person standing on a road, and a closeup view of a cloud or object in the sky.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "Y" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. GIVE AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE PHENOMENON AND RECORD IN THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SPACE PROVIDED.
