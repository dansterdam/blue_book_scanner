UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS REPORTING (SHORT TITLE: FLYOBJRPT)
MIDDLE TOWN, PA.

John L. Briggs, 23 Lt, USAF, civilian observer

Air Force Letter No. 200-5, 23 Apr 52

Mrs. P. a group of Hagerstown R.D. #1, Pa., reported an observation of a group of strange lights in the sky while at a drive-in theater at Greencastle, Pa. 

The observation was made between 0230Z and 0330Z hours on 20 June 1952.

The observer described the lights as being strange in appearance and not resembling those of an aircraft.

This Office believes that the lights may have been a reflection of some sort of lights located approximately fourteen miles west of the location of the observation. However, this report is forwarded because of the many alleged sightings of flying objects in this area of late.

These so-called sightings may have been stimulated by the recent newspaper publicity on the subject.

(NOTE: This office was advised by Captain Ruppelt, ATIC Project Officer, that to confirm or deny any speculation concerning this incident would be inadvisable.)
