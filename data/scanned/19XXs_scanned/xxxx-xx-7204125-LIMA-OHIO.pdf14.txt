AFR 80-17(C)

ATTENTION IS DIRECTED TO THE WARNING THAT MUST BE ATTACHED TO ANSWERS GIVEN IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

C-4. WHY DID YOU TAKE UP THE QUESTION OF THE OBJECT'S IDENTITY SO ACTIVELY? WHAT WERE YOUR REASONS OR MOTIVES?

IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE OBJECT DID NOT MATCH ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT OR OTHER IDENTIFIABLE OBJECT. THUS WARRANT A FULLER INVESTIGATION.
THEREFORE I FELT THE MATTER SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY BACK UP.
