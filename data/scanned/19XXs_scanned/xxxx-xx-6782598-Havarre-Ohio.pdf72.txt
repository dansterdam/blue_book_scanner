Transcription of the text in the document:

This mage illustrates the impression of radar reflections at various altitudes in the general vicinity of Havarre, Ohio. No definite objects were observed on the radarscopes, but indications of random scattered returns were noted at irregular intervals. Attempts to track the "targets" were unsuccessful. The lines and areas shown represent an abstraction of the general pattern of the radar returns as interpreted from the scope presentations. No definite shapes, sizes or identification of any specific objects can be made from this illustration.
