There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a US Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a letter dated June 24, 1968, from the University of Pennsylvania Flower and Cook Observatory to a Col. Quintanilla, discussing a "solution" for the reported sighting of a Russian ZOND satellite. The letter mentions a report from March 3, 1968, and states that the writer has nothing further to add regarding the April 12 object.

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

As last I have made a full solution for the anomalous sighting of the 1968 March 3 object, which I have mentioned been informed was the reentry of a Russian ZOND satellite.

As you know, this curiosity I have made a solution of its orbit, as if it was a helio-centric motion.

As many of the reports you would like to your office, I can mention that this solution is the next still like 300 words. It would be about the equivalent of 300 words or texts. At a time I.

This merely a suggestion, as such a publication may not be feasible due to the thought you should have just of a part of which I have nothing on the 12 April object which you asked.

Sincerely yours,
