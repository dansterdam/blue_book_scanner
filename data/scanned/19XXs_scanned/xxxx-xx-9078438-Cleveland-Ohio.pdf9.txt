The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. The sketch shows an elongated, cigar-shaped object with an arrow pointing to it. There is no photograph present in this image.

The text in the document reads:

"IT DOES NOT IMPLY ANY CONCLUSION ABOUT THE VALUE OR AUTHENTICITY OF THE INFORMATION IT IS DESIGNED TO SHOW MERELY THE NATURE OR CHARACTER OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS IF SEEN. INDICATE IF AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE OBJECT WAS MOVING."

"A SKETCH SHOULD BE AS ACCURATE A LIKENESS AS POSSIBLE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH. HOW IS THE MATCH RELATED TO THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE OBJECT? THIS RATIO WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON."

The handwritten text at the bottom of the page states: "the detail is hazy and it is difficult to determine what the object was."
