Dear Mr.

Reference your recent correspondence in which you described your unusual observation of May 17, 1957.

Investigation into reports did reveal a probably explanation. The Federal Aviation Agency at Harkins Field, Washington, Virginia, reports the sighting of a strange sight 172,172 azimuth (235A) toward an electrical navigating light, was reported to have departed 009 degrees at 5107 pm on March 17, 1957. This appears to have been the phenomenon observed and temporarily considered unusual.

We cannot conclusively identify the object you observed; however, the evidence suggests your observation may have been of a normal situation which is consistent with past descriptions of airplanes in normal flight situations.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

FARNEST E. YOUNG
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Complaints Evaluations Division
