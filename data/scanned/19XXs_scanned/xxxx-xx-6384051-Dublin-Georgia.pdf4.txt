2. Mrs. Irma Warne, Dublin, Georgia, was interviewed by a representative of this office at 1735 hours, 3 September 1952. She stated that she observed a bright unidentified object in the sky which appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed and emitting a bright light. The object was first sighted by Mrs. Warne and appeared to be moving toward the Veterans Administration Hospital. It was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes during which time the object changed direction and appeared to be hovering over the area. The object then moved off at a high rate of speed in a northeast direction and disappeared from sight. Mrs. Warne states that she is very familiar with the types of aircraft in the area and stated that this object was definitely not any type of conventional aircraft or known object. She could not determine its exact size or altitude, but stated it appeared much larger than a conventional aircraft and was at a high altitude.

3. No other witnesses to the sighting were reported. The object was not picked up on radar, and no other aircraft were reported in the area at the time of the sighting.

4. Mrs. Irma Warne has taken no particular interest in the subject of flying saucers and has no known tendencies to present imaginative or fantastic reports. The facts as presented seem to indicate an unidentified flying object was observed in the Dublin, Georgia area.
