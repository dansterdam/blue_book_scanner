The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text. As an OCR system, I will reproduce the text found in the document:

Appear luminous and trailed
considerable graphic search
Tried to the closeness at which they
passed, I had an excellent view.
Estimate they were within 150 feet of my
car, and plain in a straight line
towards the west and seemed to lighten a
spacecraft after passing me.
Estimate they were 8 to 10 feet think
in center, no middle, and appeared
to be thin discs. The matter 2 to 3 feet apart
to be spinning and emitting the orange
yellow flame brightly, appeared distanced
around the edge. I estimate they were 40 to
50 feet across.
