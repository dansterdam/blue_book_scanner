UFRO/UFO (Witness: Quintana/11.a/70316/ems/9Junfig?)
UFO Observations on 9 June 1967

USAF (SAPOCC)

1. Reference correspondence from Mrs.  concerning the sighting of unidentified flying objects since 9 February 8, 1967.

2. The witness has stated that she made several low level training flights; however, since air activity records are usually destroyed after thirty days, it is impossible to check these records. 

3. It does not appear that aircraft, balloons, or ground lights would have been seen in all directions and under all types of weather conditions.

4. The witness did state that she had contacted the State Highway Patrol concerning her observations. Contact was made with the Battle Creek, Michigan State Police, and they stated that a Trooper Skelton, went to visit the witness on 8 March 1967. During his visit, the witness claimed to be a USAF'the light configurations which she had observed over a period of time. However, the witness was unable to provide any photographs or physical evidence.

5. Mrs.  has sighted a number of lights on different occasions, and it is impossible to definitely identify each of her observations. Since it is now over six months since the original sighting, the details are obscure. There is no way to question her claim that she has been seeing lights and that she is convinced that they are unusual. This is a question that Mrs.  has been asking ever since the sighting and that she is convinced that they are not normal lights.
