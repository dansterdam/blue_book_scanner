Incident ^393 -- near Sterling, Utah -- 16 October 1948

There is nothing astronomical in this incident.

It should be pointed out that, since the object was in sight just a few seconds, even a conventional aircraft under power probably would not have allowed much more detailed observation. Probably the distance is grossly underestimated.
