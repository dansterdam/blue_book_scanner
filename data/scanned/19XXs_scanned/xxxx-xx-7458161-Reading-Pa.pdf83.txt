DRAFT

SAF-OICO/MISS Turnure/76526/July 29, 1968

Dear 

Your recent letter to President Johnson concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) has been referred to this office.

Unfortunately, you did not report your sighting soon enough so that a detailed investigation can be made. We have found that after thirty (30) days, precise details tend to become vague, and an investigation would serve little scientific or technical purpose.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

We are, however, including a copy of the latest Project Blue Book report. By reading it, you may be able to discover what it was that you observed.

Sincerely,

Attachment:
Mr. ****, Blue Mount, Illinois 62513
