The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches labeled as "SKETCH B" and "SKETCH C". The image appears to be an old document from Project Blue Book, focusing on describing the observed features of a UFO sighting.

The text reads:

18. On the following Sketch B, label a at the apparent position of the object when first seen and b at point last seen. Trace the apparent path of the object between points a and b. If possible label 1, 2, 3, etc., along the traced path to show the successive positions of the object after equal intervals of time during the sighting.

19. In Sketch C please show the observed features of the object such as:
A. Apparent shape, (were edges pointed or rounded),
B. Apparent direction of motion (show by arrow), and
C. Other details, exhaust, trails, tail, surfaces, etc.

20. The sun and the moon are shown below as they appear in their correct relative size. In this sketch D, show the apparent size of what you saw.
