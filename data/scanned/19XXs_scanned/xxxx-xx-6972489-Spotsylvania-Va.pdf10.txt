What did your attention to the phenomenon?
I observed a bluish-green spherical object that seemed to be about 300 feet above the ground. The object was moving north at a moderate speed. Then suddenly it accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared from view. The entire observation lasted about 5 minutes.

How did it finally disappear?
It just disappeared as though it was shut off. It was about two miles away when it disappeared, north of town.

Did it pass behind or in front of something, like a cloud, tree, or building at any time?
It went behind some small clouds near the north horizon, then came back into view and then accelerated and disappeared.
