FLYING SAUCER SEEN BY HER OVER HER CITY
Mr*. Grace Winams gave the flying saucer neighbor
She saw it was moving toward her home at South Fourth
Street , then suddenly moved away, vanished completely as
if a broken mirror or a badly dented saucer pan.
She said she saw it from her window at about II p.m.
and then went outside to confirm her 38 year-old eyes.
It was about the color of a harvest moon, and she explained
but very brightly.
The object was in the southeast sky, and moved upward, curved downward behind some clouds. She was not impressed
by its speed, however.
She said all the family was out looking at the stars all
before.
