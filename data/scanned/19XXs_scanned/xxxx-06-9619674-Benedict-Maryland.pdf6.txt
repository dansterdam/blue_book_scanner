STATEMENT OF SERGEANT JAMES KINNER, JR., CONCERNING FLYING MISSILE:

On 22 June 1952, Staff Sergeant MOORE and myself were driving around the west end of the runway when we observed a bright object in the sky. It was about four (4) feet in diameter, when it got to the end of the runway it made a 90 degree turn and went straight up at a very high rate of speed. It was about one half (1/2) mile apart.
