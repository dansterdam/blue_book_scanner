Aug 13, 1967

Dear Sir:

This is in reference to an object which I past several nights ago. I first sighted the object about 9:30 P.M. and watched it for about 10 minutes. The object was very bright and appeared to hover and drift off to the west, about five miles out over Lake Huron, and then suddenly disappear as if someone had turned off a light. I was able to see it quite clearly, and it was definitely much higher and larger than a normal aircraft. It appeared as an oval shape, with a slight glow around the edges and a brighter spot on the center. 

It looks over an hour to get out of sight, and I went out to try to get a better look, but it took off too fast to make it out clearly. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but people with scientific training who know about these things will, I hope, help give me some information as to what I have seen. 

The direction it was heading - - - - - - - - - - about 15 miles east of St. Clair, Ont, Canada.

Sincerely,
