The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten drawing and text. The drawing appears to depict a timeline with annotations, indicating when the phenomenon was first seen and the presence of a "x Scout". The text below the drawing states "Detect project", which seems to be a reference to the project or investigation.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

1. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME BEARING AS WITNESSES OR INVESTIGATORS, AND INDICATE AGAINST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.
