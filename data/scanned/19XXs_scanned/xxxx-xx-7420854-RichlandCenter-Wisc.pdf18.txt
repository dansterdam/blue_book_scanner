PROJECT BLUE BOOK
SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

This report is a comprehensive study of "Unidentified Flying Objects", more commonly referred to as "UFOs". It presents the results of investigations and research conducted by the United States Air Force on this subject from 1947 through 1969.

The study was initiated in 1947 when a large number of reliable observers reported seeing strange objects in the sky. As a result, a special project was established within the U.S. Air Force to investigate and analyze these reports. This project was designated "Project Blue Book" and was headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

The primary objectives of Project Blue Book were to determine the origin of the reported UFOs and to assess the possible threat to national security. During the 22 years of its existence, over 12,000 sightings were reported and investigated.
