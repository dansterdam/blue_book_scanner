Dear Mrs. Van Diver,

Captain Van Diver in our Safety Office sent me your letter in which you requested information and books on UFOs. I would first recommend consulting the public library and, if they are not able to satisfy your requirements, you might write to:

NACA-CIC
Washington, D.C. 20030

That agency, part of the Secretary of the Air Force's Office, is geared to answer specific questions and provide more information than we can.

In regard to your questions about helicopters, they can be answered in a general lilnir as you can see in the attached photo, one of our Kirtland helicopter pilots in flight.

The search lights used on the night in question are a series of lights rather than one single light of the World War II searchlight variety. They appeared to be attached to a small helicopter or similar aircraft hovering and moving the lights in large clouds of dust from the wind generated by their rotating propeller, as well as red and green lights.

One of our helicopters should be in the Los Lunas/Valencia area next Thursday evening (1 June) and you might be able to compare what you see earlier.

We in the Air Force are doing our best to answer UFO queries in an open and honest manner. We try to explain each sighting. Your sighting is an example of our efforts to investigate and determine what was sighted.

If we can be of more assistance, please write.

Yours truly,

JOHN W. DUEMMEL, Captain, USAF
Director of Information
