"The lived about a mile from Mrs. on the highway, and about 1/2 mile off the highway. According to their report, the objects came across from the entrance to their side road which can be jerky from their property. Around a month ago they had commented on the bright car headlights at the junkyard. After the sightings, they claimed the lights still shone and then seemed to dim. They flew overhead briefly and then the lights seemed to turn off and on. They would dim and then get bright again. They watched the lights for approximately 1 1/2 hours and have seen them since.

COMMENTS:
a. There is no doubt that these people have seen something, and are not inventing their imagination plays tricks on them.
b. The area is in the country, with no street lights. The nearest town is at Sullivan, 5 miles distant, which is a small community and has no night time air traffic as far as is known. There are no radio or television towers in the area. The nearest airport is at St. Louis, over 50 miles distant. While knowledge by the reporters that they were at various elevations. Initially, the sightings were made without knowlegedge that other people had similar experiences. Although there are farm ponds throughout the area, the land is generally swampy. There were elevation changes noted, no doubt dry and rocky before, but now too wet and soggy probably should rule out as these sightings occurred initially in rather cold weather.
c. I was impressed by Mrs. character and interest in this matter. While most of the people in the community were very rational, and were curious as to what this unusual phenomena might be. I feel that it is especially significant that a minister would confirm these sightings, and could vouch for Mrs. character."
