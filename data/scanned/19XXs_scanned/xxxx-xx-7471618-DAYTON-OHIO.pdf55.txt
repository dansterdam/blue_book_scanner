The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains two illustrations. The larger illustration appears to be a compass or directional indicator, with labels for the cardinal directions and instructions on how to use it to indicate the position of a reported UFO sighting. The smaller illustration depicts two landscapes, with a human figure standing in the foreground, seemingly observing something in the distance.
