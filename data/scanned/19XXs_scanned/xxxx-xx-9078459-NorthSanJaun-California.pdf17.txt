UFO, Occupants Are Reported By Boy, Nun

From Page A1:
The article states that Tony, a 13-year-old boy, reported seeing a UFO with occupants on Saturday. Tony's parents whispered to him that they had told the police, wondering if he should tell them what he saw. Tony announced "The time has really come for me to release the pictures." However, Tony said he could not take the pictures as a photo he had taken for investigation had been confiscated. 

The article goes on to describe Tony's account of the UFO sighting, including details about the object's shape and the beings inside it. It notes that Tony apparently enjoys telling the story, but the reporter wanted to keep the negative attitude the article was taking.
