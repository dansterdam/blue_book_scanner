8/29/54. Believe this question: All other pages, 9/20/54.

Information which you call familiar and which is now unfamiliar to me because I do not recognize your lighting. (9/20/54, page 9).

Your purpose seems to be the sighting of a common object, yet we seldom recognize in the UFOs which are supposed to be seen in the air these if the object is not familiar and does not appear to be. Instead we put up ourselves out in the strange.

The reports concerning the sighting rarely, certainly rarely, contain original, novel, productive minds; instead, the reports are largely a repetition out of phenomena already known. It seems hardly thought that UFOs would be anything more since - as you think - they are simply manifestations of already known phenomena through your senses.

I do not object properly if the sight has not been thought to be of sufficient significance to be reported and not be correlated properly for the special. General interest is probably more the prime motive for those who are impelled to make report rather than the usefulness of the report. It seems that some of us still desire to waken through fantasy and through imagination what we have not yet found through reason and intelligence.

I suggest you allow for an ample span of invalid ideas and some $20 million in government allowance for those who chase UFO phantoms. But in view of the enormous government bureaucracy and the tendency of the latter to grow like a Frankenstein monster, I would not be surprised if the allowance for invalid ideas climbed much higher - say to any you have been subscribing.
