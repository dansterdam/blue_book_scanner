(Henry Wightman): PT was parked at the Old Garden Beach Parking Lot when he noticed the lightest I had ever seen. It raised to about 100 ft. When it was up about 10 minutes, it made an exclamation and as I looked,
I noticed the lightest. I made an exclamation also, as I looked. The object appeared as about
20 ft. in diam. It moved around very unusual, the same as a ball of light, with no sound. It
was about 20 minutes and then it shut off like someone had thrown a switch. The object was just like a ball of fire that appeared to be solid. It seemed to be a bright
object and it seem very usual, and a great thing to see. Wightman was very excited about
the object and the speed at which it moved. I watched it intently as long as I could see it.
