I do not drink or use drugs. I am 43 years old and married. I am a 3 1/2 year Veteran of World War II Air Forces. I flew 30 Combat Missions over Europe as a photographer and Radio Operator, was awarded the Air Medal and (6) Oak Leaf Clusters, held the rank of Staff Sergeant.

In this instance I have been able to relate a flying object with some known air object. I am not concerned or particularly interested in UFO's. My family considers me a skeptic on such matters (how they consider me).

Regards.

Very truly yours,
