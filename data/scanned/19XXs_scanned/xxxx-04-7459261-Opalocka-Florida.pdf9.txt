About made UFO

As a helicopter, said the past movement for several years. The Air Force report of this incident, did appear in the newspaper reports. It was frightened, and Air Force public to make it seemed like something they did not want to admit to.

One witness who was with the children at the time, saw the object as a half disc shaped, or saucer like. It was hovering about 40 to 50 feet above the ground, and then shot away at a very high rate of speed. The children were frightened, and Air Force public relations tried to change the story.

The object was seen by many others at the same time, and this should be in the official Air Force report. It was a good case, and if it's true, it shows the Air Force have covered up many UFO sightings in the past.

Many schools should look at it, it was a good case, and it shows what the Air Force is doing about UFOs.
