NORTH SAN JUAN AWAITS RETURN OF SPACE SHIP

North San Juan residents tomorrow will be awaiting the return of a flying saucer from the Alpha Centauri. The saucer, scheduled to land near here sometime for tomorrow, will be making its second trip, according to reports from the North San Juan residents. The first time it landed was on June 2 and was photographed by Tony Barilla, a 12-year-old North San Juan youth.

The return of the space ship has predicted by North San Juan residents, who reported that the Alpha Centaurians have made several visits to the area. Alpha Centauri is a star in the galaxy which is closest to our solar system, only four light years away.

FEW GATHERING TO SEE RETURN OF SPACE SHIP

Early reports from North San Juan today indicate that Alpha Centauri will have a few on hand to greet them. The Centaurians are scheduled to return to their star base in Alpha Centauri, a 25 million mile trip from their stop near San Juan sometime today.

According to the reports a pair of Sacramento residents with reservations at Haber's Skyways plan to hold an sighting. The saucer, first reported spotted June 2 by two boys, is reported to be returning to its home base in Alpha Centauri, 4.3 light years from earth and the nearest star to earth not including the sun. 

Habel Pinaglia, owner of Habe's Place and staunch advocate of civil rights said that if they did show up he would have no objections to serving them.
