With the exceptions since this original document has been reviewed, a study has been made of the evidence that was accumulated and of the conclusions reached. The evidence indicates that the object was not of extraterrestrial origin but was of earthly origin. The conclusions that were reached are briefly as follows:

1. The object was circular in shape and was seen to maneuver at a high rate of speed.

2. It is not possible to determine the exact size of the object from the evidence available. However, certain psychological factors indicate that the object was smaller than would be expected for an extraterrestrial vehicle.

3. All of the individuals who observed the object were pilots who were in a position to make accurate observations. Their descriptions are consistent and indicate that the object was a real physical phenomenon.

IV. THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS

The analysis of the eyewitness accounts (see Appendix A) indicates the following:

1. The descriptions of the object given by the witnesses are consistent and indicate that they observed a real physical phenomenon.

2. The object was maneuverable and was observed to change direction and speed in a manner which would be impossible for a conventional aircraft.

3. The object was observed by several witnesses simultaneously, which tends to confirm the existence of the object and eliminate the possibility of a hoax or hallucination.

4. In the opinion of the psychologist who analyzed the witness statements, the descriptions are not consistent with a misidentification of a known object. The psychological factors involved indicate that the witnesses did in fact observe an unidentified flying object.

It is the following conclusion of this investigation:

Based on the scientific analysis of the eyewitness accounts, it is concluded that the object observed was a real physical phenomenon and was not a misidentification of a known object. However, the evidence does not indicate that the object was of extraterrestrial origin.
