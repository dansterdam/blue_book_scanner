The objects extremely bright glow (described as like a bright blue flash) attracted my attention. When it began to flick up-and-down at a rapid rate, it began to flicker, and the flashing lights were recorded there were several other objects similar to what I have described, but I chose to explain this one in detail because of: 1. its closeness, 2. extreme behavior, 3. increased size & prominence. 4. favorable weather conditions.

Dear Major (Bluebook), 
This is the information I would greatly appreciate your looking into. Your assistance in this matter would be most welcome. Thank you.
Sincerely,
