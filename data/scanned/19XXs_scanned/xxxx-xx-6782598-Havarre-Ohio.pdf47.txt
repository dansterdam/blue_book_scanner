Havarre, Ohio
January 16, 1953 
8.40 p.m.

Ground covered with snow. Clear, calm. 
Witness: Mrs. Wilma M. Havarre, private citizen. 

Mrs. Havarre was in her backyard when she observed a luminous object moving rapidly across the sky from east to west. It disappeared behind some trees, then reappeared and hovered over the horizon for a few seconds before disappearing again. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was brightly illuminated.
