Serial number is ___. It states that the witness, a woman, was sitting with her husband in their backyard in Yuma, Arizona at 2300 hours on June 19, when they observed an unidentified flying object. The object came out of the north and spiraled around to the same spot. It was about the size of a star and emitted a bright, steady light. The witness stated she had never seen anything like it before.

The OSI (Office of Special Investigations) detachment at McGuire Air Force Base subsequently advised that they had also received a report of sighting an unidentified flying object on the same date.

On 2 July 1952, at 2155 hours, a physician telephoned the police to report that he and his mother and father had observed an object that was flying "zig-zag" over their home in Yuma, Arizona. The object appeared to be about the size of a star, but was moving steadily around 2000 feet above their home. The object was sighted on the eastern horizon, was also moving steadily northward, and changed color from reddish to yellowish-white. Another object was sighted approximately 15 minutes later, moving southward.
