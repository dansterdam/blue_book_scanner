While Mr. [REDACTED], a resident of Shelby, Ohio, was approaching the city limits at approximately 11:15 PM on March 1, 1952, he observed a luminous object hovering over the ground. The object was described as a luminous pulse of light that seemed to pulsate at irregular intervals. The pulsation increased in intensity and then diminished, giving the appearance of the object being turned on and off. The object was observed for about this period and it seemed to have been stationary in an easterly direction. It again remained visible, moving slowly in a northeasterly direction. The object was estimated to be approximately 100-150 feet in length. The color appeared to be a constant pale blue-white, and the outline was irregular in shape. The light remained constant during this 1/2 second observation. There was no sound. The night was clear, and there was a light wind. No planes appeared to be in the area at the time.
