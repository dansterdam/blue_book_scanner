14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Grew dim and faded.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Shape: points of light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
It would have covered all or any one.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. 
Please draw a sketch to show the direction the object was moving.
