1. I received a call from the Brevard County Sheriff's Department, Titusville, Florida, at approximately 2210 EDT, 21 August 1967. A deputy sheriff from Titusville had called in and reported seeing an unusual light west. While trying to determine any activity from the Cape Canaveral Gape weather, the command post got another call concerning two more sightings by sheriff's department in Rockledge, Florida. I requested information and details for Titusville.

Important report received concerning a bright light ahead of him and about 200 feet in the air. He reported over the radio that the light was moving from the southwest to the northeast. (See attachment #3 of UFO report dated 25 May 1967 for bridge location.) Upon investigating the person, the deputy reported that the light was moving in more than one direction, at a high rate of speed, to be white, very bright, and about 6 inches in diameter. One-half mile high. This light was observed for ten minutes and seemed to gain altitude as it moved. It disappeared into the clouds, no other unusual phenomena was observed to a street light.
