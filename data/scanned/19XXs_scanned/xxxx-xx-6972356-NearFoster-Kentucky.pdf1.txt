PROBABLY (AIRCRAFT WITH ADVERTISING SIGN).

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a series of red glowing lights that were in a fixed position. Some of the lights blinked on and off in a rhythmical manner while the others remained fixed. The observer first thought that it was an aircraft, but the number and arrangement of the lights indicated that there were too many lights for it to have been a plane.
