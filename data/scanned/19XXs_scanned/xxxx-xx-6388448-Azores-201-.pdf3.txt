CHIEF OF STAFF: Intelligence Information Report

A. Air Force sighting taken in the Azores area on 1 November 1955 by Army personnel. This sighting was investigated because of the details given by the observers, the fact that they were military personnel, and their desire to have the sighting officially recorded. The observers described an orange-red object which they estimated to be about 30-35 feet in diameter and 8-10 feet thick, which appeared to be hovering and emitting a pulsating light. The object moved in a southerly direction, maintaining altitude, and disappeared from view after about 2 minutes of observation.

B. It is requested that the status on the investigation of this incident be furnished.
