Gentlemen:

I was thirteen years old in May and I am very much interested in flying and flying objects. I used to watch what I thought were flying objects and until now I have never seen any so I printed some objects and photographed them with my younger camera. They were so realistic that some of my friends made me promise that I would acknowledge I was doing this. I am really sorry for my action. The witness I stated in my letter had no part in the matter.

I have been severely punished for my actions. I promise you this will never happen again.

Sincerely,
