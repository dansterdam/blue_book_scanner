Nov 7, 1967

Dear Torn:

This will reply to your letter, postmarked October 31, regarding your sighting of a UFO.

Many details necessary to identification of your sighting have been noted from your letter. However, we are unable to complete the attached questionnaire, and forward it in the enclosed envelope, as an examination of flight records showed no small disc-shaped UFO in the Liverpool, New York area on the date you reported. 

In the future, should you sight another UFO, please contact the UFO investigator as soon as possible, preferably by phone. By so doing, you will have a much greater chance of having your sighting adequately investigated.

In the meantime, we are sending you some material which may help you determine what you saw. We hope you will find it interesting, as well as informative.

Thank you for your interest in the Air Force project concerning unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Major, USAF
Acting Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
