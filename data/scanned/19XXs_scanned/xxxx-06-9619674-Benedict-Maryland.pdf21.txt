STATEMENT

At approximately 2220 hours on 21 June 1952, while walking in a field near Erdim, Germany, an observer was looking at the stars and pointing out the Big Dipper constellation, and the location of the North Star. On looking more directly overhead, I momentarily thought I saw a meteor but then realized this was not a burning object, but was a star-like object (pale white) round in shape.

It was below the stars, but close to the horizon, and was moving very slowly and steadily in a northeast direction. It did not appear to be burning or glowing and was steady rather than flickering, as a meteor would. I watched it for about 2 minutes, during which time it appeared to change brightness slightly, becoming brighter at times. 

It was about 3/4 the size of the North Star and was at the same altitude or slightly below. This light came from the direction of the north and appeared to be heading in a northeast direction. It maintained an even speed and altitude throughout the observation.

At this point I left a companion and telephoned the USAF base nearby, asking him to look out for any unusual objects in the sky. He saw nothing at that time.

At 2225, as I took another look, the object had disappeared. I waited and looked again, but it did not reappear.

As this was an unusually clear night, it was an unusual sighting. It was an extremely bright, star-like object, round in shape, pale white in color, and did not appear to be burning or glowing, nor was there any sound heard. There was no Moon or clouds in the sky at the time of the sighting.

I have no other explanation for this object, as it did not resemble any known aircraft, balloon, or astronomical object. The observation was 2 to 3 minutes in duration.
