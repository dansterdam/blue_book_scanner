The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will now proceed to extract the text from the image:

"We had to dom and completely disappear a few seconds. We had a bright appearing, and my father, and I, watching said he saw what appeared to be at least three solid fragments and some smoke where the object disappeared shortly after it disappeared. I chased the time of an accurately set electric light switch, but disappeared about 3 to .10 (pius or minus 15 minutes for human error). We saw nothing more of the object. We think the object was probably a rocket or satellite of some kind, but wonder why it went so slowly and then disappeared."
