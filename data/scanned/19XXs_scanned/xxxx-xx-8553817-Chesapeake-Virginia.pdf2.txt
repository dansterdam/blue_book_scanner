MEMO FOR THE RECORD

UFO Allegedly Sighted, 15 Jan 67

O'Hara, January 15, 1967. Telephone interview. Mr. O'Hara reported that he sighted a large oblong object which he could not identify. He sighted this object which appeared to be undersize creatures similar to members of the human race, possibly not more than four feet tall. They were allegedly wearing regular trousers and T-shirts.

He spoke in a coherent manner, although he appeared to be under certain mental strain. He claimed that he had not been frightened by the incident. His account ran from 2000 to 0400 hours. He stated that he was telephoning from his workshop but had no recollection of being elsewhere between 2000 and 0400 hours.

Case is carried as insufficient data, due to incomplete information.
