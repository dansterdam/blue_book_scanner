Our crashed car off the ***censored*** highway. He described it in detail. We made contact to get the story straight. It seem'd that they were pretty good shots. They knocked out my car. I have seen several other incidents. I believe their craft or vehicle was 50 ft. in diameter. I think he the pilot was injured. He seemed to be communicating by different means. He was very curious and intelligent looking. I have had several experiences but I haven't report all of them.
