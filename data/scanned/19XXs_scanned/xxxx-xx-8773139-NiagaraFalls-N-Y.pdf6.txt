1. This investigation requested by the Headquarters, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Los Alamos, New Mexico, concerning the observation of an unidentified aerial object by...

2. The following reported by Inspector, [Redacted], Security Inspector:

Approximately 2400 hours (CST) on 8 August 1952, I observed an aerial object shaped like a ball, the northwest (approximately 2900) from station 0130. The object was approximately 1000 yards in diameter and about 5,000 yards in elevation from the horizon. The size and shape was comparable to a B-47 elevation from the horizon. The size and shape was visible for four colors: red, green, blue, and yellow. The object travelled at an exceptionally high speed, giving the object the appearance of a circular motion. When a swinging motion was observed, I became convinced it was not an astronomical body, as the direction of the swing continued to vary. The object disappeared behind the clouds, and I also discontinued observation because of clouds. Security Inspectors on 26 April 1952 also observed the same object.
