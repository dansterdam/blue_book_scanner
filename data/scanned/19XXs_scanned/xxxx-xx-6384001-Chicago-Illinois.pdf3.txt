"2 Jets' Pierce 
Radar "Spot" 
At Chicago

Chicago, Jan. 13. - Two jet fighter planes from the Offutt Air Force base encountered a mysterious object on their radar screens over O'Hare International airport early today and chased it for several minutes, according to the United States Air Force.

The Air Force reported the planes picked up a reflection on their radar showing a "spot" moving at a high rate of speed which they could not identify. This was the first time to far as is publicly known that an Air Force plane has reported encountering a mysterious extra-terrestrial flying craft.

Capt. William W. Naultand and Lt. Beverly E. Brinell, told their commanding officer that they didn't see anything. We went through the target area and there was nothing there.

The mysterious "spot" was first picked up on radar at 4:17 a.m. today by civil tower operators at O'Hare who immediately notified the Air Force.

The radar reflections had them considerably concerned. These radar spots moved at incredible speeds and performed peculiar maneuvers. Though the planes sighted nothing in the air, the radar operators decided that the blips they were picking up could only come from some kind of aircraft, however, the object vanished from their screens."
