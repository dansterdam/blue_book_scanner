On 9 September 1947, September 17, 1952 at approximately 8:35 p.m. I was out in the Northwestclirection. It was traveling at approx. 600-700 m.p.h. 
I was able to see the object through the binoculars from our bedroom window. It passed quickly over the horizon. When I looked back, the horizon haze was still reflecting the glow from the object for about one minute. The glow was greenish-white and did not blink.
