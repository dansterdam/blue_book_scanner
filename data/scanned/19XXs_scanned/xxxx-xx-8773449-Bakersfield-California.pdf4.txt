DATE OF OBSERVATION: 6 September 1953
DATE OF REPORT: 28 September 1953
LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: 5 miles SW of Bakersfield, California, U.S.A.
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
The following is a summary and narrative of the observing pilot:
At approximately 11:15 AM PST on 6 September 1953, the pilot of a T-33 jet trainer aircraft observed a bright, elliptical-shaped object approximately 10 to 15 feet in diameter and a brilliant, silvery-white in color. The object appeared to be hovering at an altitude of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 feet, approximately 5 miles SW of Bakersfield, California. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, during which time the pilot took evasive action to obtain a better view, climbing to an altitude of approximately 19,000 feet. The pilot was unable to make a positive identification of the object, and it appeared to be stationary. The object then accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.
ACTIONS TAKEN: Reported to the nearest Air Force base.
