There does not appear to be a photograph included in this image. The image shows a page from what seems to be a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text in response to a questionnaire.

The handwritten text appears to provide additional information that was not covered in the questionnaire, discussing various details about an observed object. However, there is no photographic evidence included in this particular page.
