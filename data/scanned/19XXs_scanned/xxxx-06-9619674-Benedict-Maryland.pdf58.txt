Dear Sir:

I should like to report the sighting of an unusual aerial object which occurred on the evening of June 22, 1952 between 7:00 and 8:30 p.m.

I was pointing out the stars of Ursa Minor when the object first came into view. It was silently and slowly circling the area, which led me to believe it was either a helicopter or a small private plane. It was about as plainly visible as a star on a clear night, although brighter. The motion and maneuvering of the object were most unusual. It would fly for a while in a straight line, then suddenly dart off at a sharp angle, change directions, and come back to almost the same spot from which it started. This was repeated several times in the course of about 10 minutes. The object then left the area, with a sudden burst of speed, and I lost sight of it. The entire observation lasted around 15-20 minutes.

The object first came from the southwest, then circled to the west, north and back to the southwest, finally going out of sight in a northerly direction. In maneuvering, it gave the impression of having complete control and of being intelligently guided. Its size was difficult to determine, but it appeared to be a fairly small object, perhaps the size of a large plane. The color was a very bright, metallic-like white, which caught the eye immediately. It left no trail or exhaust of any kind. The illumination was constant and steady, with no blinking or flashing. 

I am enclosing a sketch of the object and the path it followed. The object was first observed at about 7:15 p.m. and disappeared from sight about 7:30 p.m. There was no noise heard.
