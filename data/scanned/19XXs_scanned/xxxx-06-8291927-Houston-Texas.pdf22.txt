OCR output:

On 16 June 1952, as 2030 hours, I started from the airstrip, 1520 to the lighter side, checked that there were 3 police officers on the field ready to see what object was going to land. At 2045 hours, a bright object was sighted approximately 1 mile east of the airstrip, at an altitude of 8-10 degrees to land. It stopped to watch the object and as it drew closer. I could see that it was not an conventional aircraft. There was no engine sound whatsoever. Either accelerating or jet.

The two objects passed over on a northwest, west, and traveling in a northwest direction. They appeared to be approaching each other, and then they separated, one going in a due west direction and the other going northwest. Both objects were approximately the size of a B-29 at a distance of 3-4 miles. I could make an estimation that they were traveling 500 to 800 miles per hour.

As they went overhead, the object on the right side, broke formation and appeared to the clear to a perpendicular to the present course.

The weather that night was fairly calm and very clear. There was no engine sounds on the flight line at this time.

Total time objects were observed was approximately 30 seconds.
