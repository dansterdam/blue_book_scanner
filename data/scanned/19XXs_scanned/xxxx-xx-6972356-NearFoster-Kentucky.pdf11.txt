WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
The strange thing was the thing we saw appeared to be a cloud in the air where there was no cloud. It started having a colored tinge and appeared to be metallic at first, all except the underside which seemed a little darker than the rest of it. The village of Hateley was about seven miles away and the thing was hovering over there. I watched it for probably ten minutes and it seemed to move in a purposeful way, though I couldn't tell exactly where it was going. This thing was definitely not a cloud, a plane, or any other common object I'm familiar with. I just don't know what it was, but it definitely was not natural.

HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
The phenomenon simply faded away slowly. I watched closely and it gradually diminished in size and brightness until it was no longer visible. I kept staring at the spot where it had been, but it never reappeared.

DID THE PHENOMENON REAPPEAR OR MOVE RAPIDLY TOWARD OR AWAY FROM YOU, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
It moved slowly but steadily, hovering over the distant village. It did not reappear or move rapidly at any point.
