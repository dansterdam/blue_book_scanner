20 July 1967

Mr.
Operations Officer
Laxkfield AFB, Texas 78330

Dear John,

I have the following information about a sighting on 13 July 1967.
An air force sergeant and an ad maintenance man stated that they saw a "disc-shaped" object which his mother, a widow, he is intermittently employed at Cape Canaveral.

I have contacted (1) a former cameraman (2) the local police captain, (3) a local traffic control station, and (4) the local newspaper to determine if anyone confirmed the sighting, but no one has recent contact with the reported incident.

Mr.
is an air force veteran and expresses considerable dismay about this being an unstable and unpredictable individual or situation.

About two years ago, he was the principal in an accident almost identical to that described, but was not able to produce any more than circumstantial evidence.

In view of the foregoing, I did not contact Mr. Roberts directly as it did not appear any reliability was credible.

Sincerely,

Joe T. Pound
Colonel, USAF
