Headquarters, 315th Air Division, APO 929 28 FEB 1945
TO: Commanding General, Fifth Air Force, APO 710

1. There was a total of six sightings of the unidentified aerial phenomena observed within the 315th Air Division, as follows:

a. 2 sightings were made on 24 November 1944 and 1 December 1944, which were "near-misses" of the aircraft of the 315th with the objects. The pilot made evasive tactics to avoid collision, and the objects were described as round, white, and luminous.

b. 4 additional sightings were made between 15 and 27 January 1945, by pilots and other crew members of the 315th. These objects were described as round, glowing, and traveling at high speeds. One pilot fired on an object but missed. Most of these sightings were made during daylight hours.

2. It is believed that the objects were not like any known to exist and may possibly be a new type of aircraft or guided missile. The pilots encountered control difficulties when these objects were near their aircraft.

3. It is quite possible that there were additional sightings by pilots and crews of the 315th Air Division which were not reported to this headquarters. The object was observed by approximately 50 pilots and crew members, and their estimates of size ranged from 15 to 30 feet in diameter and the speed of the objects varied from 300 to 600 miles per hour.
