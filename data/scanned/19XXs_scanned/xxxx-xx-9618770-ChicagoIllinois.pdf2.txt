AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ATI-10211-53    PAGE 2 of 2 

"I sighted it at about the left seat of a Douglas Air Force C-47 at an approximate altitude of 7200 feet, about 20 miles northwest of Chicago, Illinois, at about 1150 on 13 Jul 52. It was in the shape of a disc and appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. The color was white and the object seemed brilliantly illuminated, however, because the sky was so dark, the stars were fairly well visible and the object did not appear to be shining. It was moving and on a heading as near as I could determine approximately 270Â°, at a speed which I would estimate to be somewhere between 400 to 600 knots. I watched it for approximately four or five seconds before it went out of sight, behind some high cirrus clouds. It made no noise and gave off no exhaust or visible trail. I have a fairly good knowledge of aircraft and this was definitely not any type of conventional aircraft I have ever seen. I am a pilot with 3500 hours experience and I am quite certain that this was no type of known aircraft."

The object made a sharp turn of approximately 135 degrees and then continued on its original heading. The report is signed by the Commanding Officer of the Air Force base.
