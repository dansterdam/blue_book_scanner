There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR system, I will extract the text from the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
SPEED UP FAST AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE OR EXHAUST?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE IN SIZE?
FLASH OR FLARE UP?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FALL OR WOBBLE IN FLIGHT?
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PHENOMENON WAS?
A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
