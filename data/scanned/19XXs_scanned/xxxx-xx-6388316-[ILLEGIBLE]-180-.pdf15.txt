December 1, 1948

On Wednesday, October 13, 1948 at approximately 11:35 A.M., the [REDACTED] sighted an object which we believe to be a disc or ball traveling across the sky. It was moving very fast and was traveling in a straight line but at a slight angle from the horizon. The object appeared to be silvery in color and was estimated to be 6 to 8 inches in diameter at arm's length. It was under observation for a period of 5 to 7 minutes. As the object traveled across the sky, there was no trail or vapor, and it made no sound. In fact, it seemed to move without any propelling force being observed. At intervals, the object would seem to oscillate or wobble slightly, but it maintained a steady course from northwest to southeast. Its speed was estimated to be several hundred miles per hour, but the [REDACTED] was unable to give a more definite estimate of its speed, as he had no basis of comparison. This is the first time we have ever seen anything like this.
