DRAFT

Dear [redacted],

President Johnson has asked us to reply to that part of your letter to him in which you tell of seeing an unidentified flying object.

Unfortunately, you did not furnish enough information so that we could tell you what the object was. However, if you will complete the incident questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you have sight another unidentified flying object, please report it as soon as possible to the Air Force base nearest you. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sightings. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

[Redacted]
