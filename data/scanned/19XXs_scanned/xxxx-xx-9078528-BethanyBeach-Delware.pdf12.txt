Attention: TDPT/UFO

Dear Sir:

SUBJECT: Visual examination of hand writing specimens on enclosed F.T.D. Forms 10-C. This refers to your letter of 13 December 1967 in which you requested the assistance of this Division in the aid of enlarged photographs normally used for this purpose. However, it is indicated in the information filed the shape of Henry Beasv and Cleve Narion were both written by the same person. There are many points of similarity that were found.

As indicated in the request on page 6, item 13 of each set that a report was made in the people of Bethany, Delaware, under date of June 1, 1967, one at 10:50 p.m. and was other at 10:30 p.m. Both have been prepared in the same manner, and it is my belief that the possibility exists under this evidence the two statements may have been prepared by the same person.

Hoping I have been of some assistance in this matter and assuring you of my continuing cooperation in matters of mutual concern, I remain,

Very truly yours,

Sgt. G. A. Young
Investigative Unit
Forensic Section
