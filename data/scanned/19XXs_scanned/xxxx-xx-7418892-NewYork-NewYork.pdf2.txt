Dear Major Quintanilla:
I write this letter to tell you of one of my experiences with U.F.O.'s. As you know, I could not report this at the time as my friends and their mother was standing beside me. About a month earlier we had organized a party, the details of which I shall fill you in on.
One night, we were sitting outdoors late at night and were watching as a light appeared which seemed to be hovering at a high altitude and its moving was very fast. It would hover or appear to be stationary for a few seconds and then dart off at tremendous speeds only to reappear at another place some distance away. This went on for some time and then it disappeared. We were all amazed at what we had seen and discussed it at length afterwards. However, no one said anything about it at the time as we thought we might be ridiculed.
I am now coming forward with this report in the hopes that it may be of some value to you and your work.
