There does not appear to be a photograph in this image. The image shows a page from a document that appears to be a questionnaire or form related to a UFO report. The text on the page asks various questions about the observed object, such as whether it disappeared, moved behind something, or moved in front of something. The questions are filled out with handwritten responses.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
No.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? 
Yes. Don't know.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes. (Obscured). No. Don't know.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Audible
b. Color - Whitish, bright
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Little bigger than a match.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially show the direction the object was moving. If no picture, place an "X" inside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
