The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left appears to be a compass rose with the cardinal directions labeled. The smaller sketch on the right shows a person standing on a road or path with a landscape in the background.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "D" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LIKE SO AS TO SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "D". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT FOLLOWED A STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG.
