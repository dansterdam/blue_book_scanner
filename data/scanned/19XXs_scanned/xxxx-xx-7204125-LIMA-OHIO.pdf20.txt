Lima, Ohio
I could see the object clearly as it was going over my house. It was oval in shape and very bright. It made no noise and was traveling at a high rate of speed. It was in sight for about 10 seconds and then disappeared. I have not seen anything like it before. The object was approximately 20 feet in diameter.
