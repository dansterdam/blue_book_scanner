The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram illustrating the motion of an unidentified object. The diagram shows the horizon, the viewer's position, and the object's position when first and last observed.

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
