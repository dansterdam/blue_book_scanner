19 MAY 1958

Dear Mr. ______:

The procedure outlined in my letter of 14 April 1958 was the procedure for the purchase of official motion picture film.

I requested on 2 May 1958 that a Motion Picture Film Unit be dispatched to Baltimore, Maryland to film a UFO sighting reported by the Air Force and that Mr. ______ be advised.

Since this request, I have had no official Air Force opinion regarding it, as it was only my request. At the present records do not indicate the existence of any film taken on 9 August 1958 over the Baltimore, Maryland Air Force Base. Since there is no way of tracing any motion picture film at this time.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
