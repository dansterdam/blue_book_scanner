The image contains a sketch and a compass rose diagram. The sketch appears to depict an aerial object or objects and their motion, with instructions to mark the object's position and path. The compass rose diagram is likely provided for orientation and reference purposes.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object, and place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.
28. Draw a sketch that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
