27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object appears to have been in the sky. Place a "B" on the curved line to show how far away from you the object was. Draw a line from point "A" to point "B" and through the center of the sketch. This shows the path the object took as you saw it pass by. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the sighting.
