June 29, 1957

The weather was fine and the object was sighted at about 6:35 pm, while the observer was fishing in the Arkansas River near Wichita, Kansas. The object was first spotted moving fast and erratically. It was silver in color, circular in shape, and reflected sunlight very brightly. It appeared to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. The object made a 90 degree turn, then accelerated and disappeared from sight within a few seconds.

The observer reported that the object made no sound and exhibited behavior that was very unlike any aircraft he was familiar with. He does not believe it was a conventional aircraft, weather balloon, or any other known object. The sighting lasted only about 10-15 seconds before the object vanished.
