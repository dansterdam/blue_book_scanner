I, Gordon K. Kendall, do hereby wish to make the following statement:
I was observed on the afternoon of August 9, 1952-at approximately 6:30 P.M. to be about 6 miles from Albuquerque, New Mexico. This object was round and slightly larger than an automobile. It seemed to be rising from the ground, and after reaching an altitude of about 150 to 200 feet, it suddenly sped away in a northerly direction at a terrific speed. It seemed to disappear in the distance in a matter of 3 or 4 seconds. The object made no sound whatever. I am positive this is a genuine sighting, and I have no idea what the object could be. It was in sight for about 12 to 15 seconds.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 13th day of August 1952.
