SUBJECT: (Unclassified) Report of Information on Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: Director of Intelligence, DCS/O
Headquarters, USAF 
ATTN: AFOIN-C/CC
Washington 25, D. C.

1. In compliance with letter, Headquarters, USAF, AFOIN-C/CC-2, subject as above, 13 December 1951, the following information, as reported to this Headquarters by A. R. Authey, and C. H. Lewis, is forwarded. This report was not transmitted by electrical means due to the fact that no other activity or observer could be contacted in the area and deemed of sufficient value to warrant electrical transmission.

At this time, the lights then came together and made a right angle turn, and then disappeared at a high rate of speed. Both objects then began moving in a Northwestwardly direction, first slowly, then seemed to accelerate until they were completely out of sight in a few seconds. The objects had no tail-like appendages according to the witnesses.
