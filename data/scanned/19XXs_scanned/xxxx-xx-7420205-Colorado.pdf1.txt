TYPE OF OBSERVATION
BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS

The observers observed a bright red glowing object that moved across the sky at a high speed. It had a grayish vapor trail. After several minutes it disappeared.

COMMENTS CONTINUED: There would be no second or additional sightings on this date since the visible characteristics of the object indicate a natural phenomenon rather than an artificial device.
