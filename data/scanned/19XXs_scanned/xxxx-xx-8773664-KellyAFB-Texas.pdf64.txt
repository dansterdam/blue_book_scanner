The image does not contain a photograph, but rather diagrams and instructions related to a UFO sighting report. There are three sketches that illustrate the motion and position of an unidentified object as observed by the witness.

The text in the document is as follows:

22. In the following sketch, imagine your eye at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line to show where the object was placed when it reached its highest point.

23. In the following sketch, place an "A" to show the position of the object when you first saw it, and a "B" to indicate its position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of the path.
