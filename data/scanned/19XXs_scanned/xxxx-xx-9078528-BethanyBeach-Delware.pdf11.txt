1. Reference your telephone conversation with 2nd Lt. Carmon L. Marano on 12 December 1967. The enclosed PTD Forms 164 were allegedly completed by two different persons, the handwriting appears similar - Request your opinion as to whether both forms have been prepared by the same person or not.

2. Thank you for your time, efforts and assistance in providing additional information on this report.
