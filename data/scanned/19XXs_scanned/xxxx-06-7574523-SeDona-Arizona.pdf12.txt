The image contains a sketch or diagram drawn by the witness, along with some written text describing the observed object. The sketch appears to show a cluster of around 5-6 bright star-like objects against a dark background, possibly representing a UFO sighting. The text indicates that the witness observed an "OBLONG OBJECT" with "2 STAR LIKE OBJECTS" approximately 90 degrees above the horizon.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Both disappeared simultaneously.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No     Don't know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No     Don't know. 
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound No sound
b. Color No color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
ENTIRE OBJECT

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as wings, projections, etc., and especially indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
OBLONG OBJECT APPROX. 2 DIAMETERS OF APPARENT SIZE OF STARS. OBJECT APPROX. 90 DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON. TWO STAR LIKE OBJECTS APPEARED AT BEGINNING TO END OF SIGHTING PERIOD, APPROX. 30 SECONDS DURATION. CLUSTER OF STARS SEEMED TO MOVE AHEAD OF AND SLIGHTLY BEHIND OBLONG OBJECT DURING SIGHTING.
