The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will produce the output of all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? IT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY THEN REAPPEAR IN ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE AREA

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what: IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AND SHAPE OF A HUL AND ACROSS IT WENT

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: WE DIDN'T HEAR ANY SOUND
b. Behavior: MOTIONLESS EXCEPT FOR LATERAL MOVEMENT

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object it covers. From the position of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME ANGULAR DISTANCE ACROSS AS THE MATCH HEAD WOULD COVER AT ARM'S LENGTH. THIS WOULD BE ABOUT 2 OR 3 DEGREES

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially show trails or vapor trails.
