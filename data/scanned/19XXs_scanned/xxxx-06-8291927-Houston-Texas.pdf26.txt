6th Bomb Wing, Heavy, Intelligence
1. At first the objects appeared to be the outline of an aircraft with the size of the airframe approximating that of a medium bomber. However, after a second, the outline separated and became five or six separate objects. Due to the extreme rate of speed, the objects resembled members of an aircraft formation. The objects were sighted at a point several miles south of Walker AFB and continued in a straight Northerly line of flight and disappeared from sight several miles north of the base. The objects were at an altitude of 12,000-15,000 feet at an estimated speed of 500 to 600 miles per hour. In the opinion of the observer, the objects had a grayish hue and appeared to the observer as a disc about the size of a dime while under observation. They presented a flat view to the observer during the line of flight. The objects traveled at half moon formation during the curve facing the line of flight. While the objects were passing over Walker AFB, the most easterly object veered even more sharply to the east at about a 10 degree angle until the formation disintegrated into the rest of the objects or their speeding mass.
2. The object was first sighted at 2030 hours MST 16 June 1952 and remained under observation for less than 1 minute.
3. The object was observed visually by Sgt from the ground. He had no type of lenses or glasses for aid.
