UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) SIGHTING REPORT

Date: xx-xx-19xx 
Location: North San Juan, California

Description: At approximately 4:00 pm on [DATE] a local resident reported seeing two unidentified flying objects hovering over the wooded area north of the town of North San Juan. The objects were described as circular in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright light. The objects reportedly remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Investigator's Notes: The witness appears to be a credible local resident with no history of false reports. The location described is a remote, wooded area north of the town, which would be consistent with the reported sighting. No other witnesses or corroborating evidence was identified at this time. The case remains unresolved.
