My high-altitude ballistic camera operated in the 2 1/2 inch spectrum and took the photograph attached hereto. This photograph shows an object of 5-6 feet in diameter travelling at an estimated speed of 1000-1500 miles per hour at an altitude of approximately 65,000 feet. The object appears to be metallic in nature and was sighted at 11:24 AM on 3 September 1947 over Pine Grove, California. The object maintained a steady course and velocity and showed no signs of engine or propulsion system. It simply appeared and then disappeared from view. There was no sound associated with the object.
