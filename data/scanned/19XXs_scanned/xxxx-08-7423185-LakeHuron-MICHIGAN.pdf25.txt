NARRATIVE3 (continued) (Cape Ann, Mass. 8/2/67)
GROUP # 3.1 (continued)
(Paul Dumas): "While walking along the beach in a southerly direction I saw a group of 3 lights in a northerly direction. The lights were orange-yellow in color and appeared to be stationary. They seemed to blink or flash on and off occasionally in a regular manner as they hovered in the sky. The lights did not seem to move or change position. I watched them for a period of about 10 to 15 minutes as they seemed to hover and then gradually disappear. My initial impression was that they were unusual lights but I could not determine if they were attached to anything or how they were propelled. The lights did not appear to be attached to any conventional aircraft. I have no explanation as to what they were."

GROUP # 3.2
(Staples Aro): "While getting out of my car at around 11 P.M. on the night in question, I noticed an orange light moving across the sky from the northwest to the southeast. The light appeared to be about the size of a basketball and seemed to be moving at a moderate speed and altitude. The light appeared to be steady and did not blink or flash. It just moved steadily across the sky. There was no sound associated with the light. The light seemed to be an object with no visible means of propulsion. I watched the light for about 5 to 10 seconds until it disappeared from view to the southeast. I have no explanation as to what this light was."

WILLIAM CARROLL: "On August 2, 1967 at approximately 10:20 PM at the approximate location for the sighting, a female companion and I were looking in the area of the previous sightings. We were looking in a 1967 located beside the movie site. I don't know if this had anything to do with the sightings but there were no lights or any unusual activity observed at this time."
