It was a very dark object, probably hollow, like a large dirigible. The body was very quiet and drifted with the wind. It had no visible means of propulsion. It made a humming sound, like a generator, and appeared to be several hundred feet in length. The lights were at the base and gave a greenish cast to the object.
