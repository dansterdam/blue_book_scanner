The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The larger one is a compass rose diagram with directional labels. The smaller illustrations depict a person standing on a road with mountainous terrain in the background.

SA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE OBJECT FIRST APPEARED AND A "0" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT PROCEEDED.
THE FIGURES BELOW PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "0" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN, CONNECT THE "X" AND "0" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOTION. BE CAREFUL TO ALIGN THE FIGURE PROPERLY.
