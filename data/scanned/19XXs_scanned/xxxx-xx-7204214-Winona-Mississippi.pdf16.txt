I was watching the thing and it was sort of dipping and hovering. It would get brighter and dim at times. Sometimes it would seem fairly bright and other times it would be dimmer but I could still see it. It didn't seem to move too fast but there were times when it seemed to change directions or speed up a little and then slow down. I don't know what it could have been - it just seemed to be something up there that wasn't an ordinary aircraft or anything I had ever seen before. It was just very unusual and I couldn't really understand what I was seeing but I know it wasn't an ordinary plane or anything like that. It seemed to be some sort of light or object that would appear and disappear or change brightness in an odd way. I wouldn't know how to compare it to anything else I've seen. It was just a very strange sight.
