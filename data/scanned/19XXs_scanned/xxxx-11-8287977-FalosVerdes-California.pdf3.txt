Eskimo paper, flying object 6:45 p.m. 3 october 1957. The witness was in his car and stopped on the way home from work near the corner of Crenshaw Boulevard and Palos Verdes Drive in Palos Verdes, California. He states that he saw an object which appeared to be disc-shaped and was hovering silently at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet. The object was estimated to be about 50 to 100 feet in diameter. It appeared to have a brilliant white light in the center and a hazy glow around the edges. The witness observed the object for about 5 minutes before it silently accelerated and disappeared in the direction of the ocean. The witness reported the incident to the police shortly thereafter. No other witnesses were identified.
