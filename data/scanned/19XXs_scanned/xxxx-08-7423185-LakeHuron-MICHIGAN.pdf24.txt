NARRATIVE: (Condensed) (Cape Ann, Mass. 8/24/53) SIGHTING:
George W. Lippincott, 3506 Glencairn Road, Philadelphia, Pa. (Witness):
George Chignell, hie wife said she watched 3 objects in the sky, passing very swiftly in a group formation. They were traveling in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed and the appearance was that of 3 bright silver colored discs. She first observed them through the kitchen window and called Mr. Lippincott to come see them. He observed them for about 2 1/2 minutes through the telescope and they disappeared toward the north. He stated the objects were definitely not birds, planes, or any known type of aircraft. They were traveling much faster than any jet plane or other known aircraft. They made no sound and as he watched them, the objects seemed to flash or sparkle. His wife, who first saw the objects, is positive they were not anything she had ever seen before in the sky.

Capt. Irving Schall, Air Force Base (Near Philadelphia): On 8/26/53, this report was received and thoroughly checked. It checks out as authentic and credible. The sighting was made by a reliable person. The description fits in with many other "saucer" type reports we have received. The speed, formation, and appearance are indicative of the familiar "flying saucer" type of report. There is no doubt this is a genuine sighting of some unknown aerial object.
