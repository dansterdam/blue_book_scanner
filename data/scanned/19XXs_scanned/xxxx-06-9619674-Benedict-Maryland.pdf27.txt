STATEMENT

On the evening of June 21, 1952, my son-in-law and my daughter returning home from the picture show. It was about 10:20 p.m. The night was unusually clear and they observed an object in the northwest sky, which appeared to be about the size of a baseball held at arm's length. At first it appeared to be very bright, bright as a star. As it came closer, it appeared to get even brighter and seemed to be changing colors. It was a steady light, not blinking. As it approached, it slowed down and seemed to go into a downward direction. It moved in a somewhat zigzag fashion, but generally in a downward direction. It seemed to be about 20 minutes in the air, until it disappeared from sight. My son-in-law said he had never seen anything like it before. He had a good look at it for about 10 minutes probably, probably 8 or 10 minutes. When we first noticed this bright object, it was almost overhead. As it came closer it appeared to be descending, and I judged it was perhaps 300 yards or less from us. The object then went behind some trees and the light grew dimmer until it was out of sight.
