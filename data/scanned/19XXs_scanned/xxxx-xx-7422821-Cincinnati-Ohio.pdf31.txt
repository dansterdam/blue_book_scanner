The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. The sketch depicts some shapes and motion lines, with annotations describing the observed object as a "cloud" that "moved" and "obscured", and that the "color" changed from "red then changed to white".

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The object for about 5-minutes
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes. A cloud
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? Yes.
17. a. Sound: none
b. Color: Red then changed to white
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Possibly 15 or 20 covered by a match head.
19. The sketch shows a cloud-like shape, with some random motion patterns and an arrow indicating the direction of movement. The annotations describe "DETAILS OF CLOUD", "SAME RANDOM MOTIONS", and some other notes about the timing and observations.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as wings, protrusions, etc, and specifically exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
