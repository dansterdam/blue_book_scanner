TRANSCRIPTION:

Can concentrate on the large light at the end (apparent at least 15 miles off). This large light was separated into 2 somewhat distinct source segments which appeared to give off light separately from one another. This large light appeared to be 2 distinct sources of light which were in apparent close proximity to each other. Some smaller lights were observed nearby but it appeared that the main intensity was concentrated in the 2 separate light sources. This main double light appeared to be larger than a star but smaller than the moon. As the observers watched, the double light sources appeared to dim, then become brighter, and this sequence seemed to repeat itself several times before the light finally disappeared. No sound was heard in connection with the observation. The total duration of the sighting was around 30 minutes.
