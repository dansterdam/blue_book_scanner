There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will extract and output the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 2 Day 5 Month 1967 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

About 5 minutes (or less) following the disapearance of a UFO, 4 automobiles came overhead and flew in the same direction from which the UFO had disappeared.
