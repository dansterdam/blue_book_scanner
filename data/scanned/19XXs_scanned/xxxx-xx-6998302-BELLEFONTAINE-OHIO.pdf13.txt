I. Information of Maj Smith and Lt Hammer by Lts Pines and Oisson revealed following:

a. An F-86's climb to 48,000 ft.; then fell off; then made a second climb to 52,000 ft. Object was sighted in the second climb and received a radar contact at 12-20,000 ft. before it disappeared. This object was calculated to be from 40-50,000 ft.

B. Object size, accepting Smith's estimate of distance, is 24-40 ft. in diameter as projected from the fact that the gunsite has the field of view of two mils in diameter and the radar pip gave positive indication.
