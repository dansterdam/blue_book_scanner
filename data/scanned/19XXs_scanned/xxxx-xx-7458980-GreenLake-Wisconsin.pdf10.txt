Dear Sir:

May 7, 1967, at about 7:10, I and several others saw what appears to be a flying object. On April 26, 1967, at present it was going to house which is one mile west and one mile north of Green Lake. We went west a mile and then turned north and continued east on the road. At that time we sighted a bright object of fair size. It appeared from the ground and then seemed to move slowly upward and then disappear from sight. I would like to bring this to your attention.
