The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

Incident #134, 13th -- Monroe, Michigan -- 28 May 1948

There is no direct astronomical explanation for this incident.

This investigator wishes to call attention to the fact that the objects observed were seen at essentially the same level as the lower cloud stratum and that there was a high overcast.

Could it be that these officers saw successive shafts of sunlight, through breaks in the high overcast, illuminating small portions of the lower cloud deck or the distant ground when have been a combination of the relative velocity of the C-47 and the projected motion of the break in the overcast.
