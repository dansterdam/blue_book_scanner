1. Has any unusual preparation been observed to extend the range of ground clutter by this radar at this site, and did this condition exist during or near the time that unknown target were observed? 
- Yes, a condition of extension has occurred on several occasions when unknown targets were observed.

2. What effects of rain storms and lightning have been observed on this radar?
- No effects have been observed.

3. Were any checks made to determine if unknown target could have been one of our own aircraft? 
- Yes. Aircraft were directed to the target by the controller. Target was not seen by the flight leader.

4. Was any interception attempted? 
- Yes. Five details: Intercept was successful, but "GCA" (ground controlled approach) was too high for the aircraft to get close enough identification.

1. What technical data on the unknown target? Have they been questioned as to their opinion?
- None, as target was lost before additional data could be obtained.

2. Was a recorded track made of this target? 
- Yes. Target was tracked by the ground radar. 

3. At what range, azimuth, altitude, and time was the target observed? 
- Range 23 miles, azimuth 29Â°, altitude 16,000 feet, time 2230 to 2235 hrs.

4. How did the target appear in size and shape as compared with conventional aircraft targets?
- Normal

5. Was the target of constant size, or did it change rapidly?
- See, until target one minute after intercept.

6. Was the speed of the target constant or variable? Explain.
- Target constant speed, 400 knots.

7. Did the target appear "fuzzy" or clear and sharp as compared with a known aircraft target? 
- Clear until fade.
