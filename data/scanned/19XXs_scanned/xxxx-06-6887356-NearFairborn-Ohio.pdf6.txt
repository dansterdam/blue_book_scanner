The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this particular page.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

"The photosphere is as far into the sun as we can see. There, where the photosphere leaves off, is only a luminously of our own atmosphere equivalent to 0.3 millimeters of helium at the surface of the sun, continuing upward in various layers until the chromospheric region is reached. Even in this region the density of the atmosphere is not over 7,000 kilometers. The sun has been pouring out energy at the rate of about 25 million kilowatts per square meter of its surface for several billion years."

"The nature of the photospheric average appears 2700 F or greater. This is somewhat higher than the center of the disc, where the temperature is estimated to 5800 F near the solar surface where the emergent radiation is greatest. Thus the temperature of the solar atmosphere increases to higher levels on the average as the sun is inspected at higher and higher altitudes."

"The bridged general surface of the sun. They are indistinguishable from the bright normal surface of the sun, except that the edges appear darker in contrast with the brighter parts surrounding them. They are often confused with sunspots, but are really only shadowy indistinctions in the bright surface as observed from a distance."
