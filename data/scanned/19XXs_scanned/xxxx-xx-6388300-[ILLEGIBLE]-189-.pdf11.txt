Incident: 189
While acting as co-pilot on a C-47 aircraft enroute from Berlin Military Airfield to Tempelhof AB on 6 July 1952, the pilot observed at an angle of about 25°. The C-47 at the time was approaching Munster Field which was at an altitude of about 2,600 ft. The object was travelling at or near mach 2.0 and was an oblong cigar-shaped object at an angle of about 35°. The object then made a right angle turn and travelled at 1500 feet away and travelling at about 1,200 to 1500 feet at a rate of speed not determined by the pilots.
Ability to determine color, size, distance and speed of moving object difficult
Observers were in good physical condition, had normal sight and hearing and were mentally alert. Reliability of observers is regarded as high. No one else aboard the C-47 observed the object.
Observer was able to clearly corroborate information given by him and first interview. He appeared to be intelligent and sound character. It was the observer's opinion that the object was given a clearance by the observer and that it was a very unusual type of aircraft.
