THE SUBJECT TO Y FLIGHT SHOULD BE CLOSELY OBSERVED TO SEE IF:
- IT IS LIGHTED FROM ITS OWN INTERNAL SOURCE.
- IF A BODY ENTERS THE ATMOSPHERE AT A SUFFICIENTLY SHALLOW ANGLE, AND
- IF IT CONTINUES LOSING ALTITUDE, AND
- IF THE OBSERVER IS AT A SUFFICIENTLY LOW ALTITUDE, AND
- IF THE SUBJECT MAKES A DISAPPEARANCE OR ENTRY TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND
- IF THE TRAJECTORY IS EXTENDED, FALLS SHORT OF OBSERVER, 
THE OBSERVER IS BASICALLY TO SEE IF:
- WHAT APPEAR TO BE WINGS OR STABILIZING SURFACES ARE VISIBLE
- WHAT APPEAR TO BE EXHAUST OR PROPULSION EFFECTS ARE VISIBLE
- THE RATE OF DESCENT AND DECELERATION IS NOTED
- ANY UNUSUAL MANEUVERS ARE PERFORMED
- WHAT APPEAR TO BE MULTIPLE LIGHTS OR STRUCTURES ON THE OBJECT
ALL DETAILS OF THE INITIAL SIGHTING REGARDING MOVEMENT, SIZE, SHAPE, COLOR, LIGHTING, ETC., SHOULD BE RECORDED AS FULLY AS POSSIBLE.
