There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document containing text.

Transcribed text:

I also want to advise that while things happen that we are not sure. If your photographs are returned we would be glad to show any one of them. We do not want anyones reported so far except because people then days just dont think there is possible in the previous sour interilligance. In case of this matter people and the Groops some said that the people involved played a hoot. We will supply all the information about these cases if it is kept quiet.

Sincerely,
