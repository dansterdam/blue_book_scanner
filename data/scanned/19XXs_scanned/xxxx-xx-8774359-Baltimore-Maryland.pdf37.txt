IT COULD BE - BUT IT ISN'T
THIS new-type radar screen's resemblance to a popular conception of a flying saucer is coincidental. Dr. A. Spencer, an American designed this instrument for the International Radio Scientific Union Assembly to display the findings of the world (above) and jokingly referred to it as a "flying saucer". 
FLYING SAUCER EXPERTS SAY---
The world's experts on radar, the upper air and outer space are attending the International Radio Scientific Union Assembly in Sydney.
What do they think? It is claimed that some of the soundings of radar on "flying saucers" are traceable to various natural phenomena. On the other hand, Prof. H.S.W. Massey said that, while much remained to be learned about these objects, there was evidence that they were real.
Other opinions were:
Dr. C.E.R. Bruce: "The claims that the 'flying saucers' are aircraft of a type yet unknown to science are nonsense. They are merely the effect of natural causes interpreted in a supernatural way."
Prof. F.J.M. Stratton: "It would be futile to deny the existence of certain phenomena which are now attracting increasing attention, but equally futile to assume that they are of extra-terrestrial origin until we know much more about them."
