The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be some kind of hand-drawn or sketched image. The image appears to depict an abstract or surreal landscape, with various organic and geometric shapes and patterns. There are wavy lines, dots, and other abstract elements that seem to form a stylized, almost psychedelic representation of a natural or cosmic scene.
