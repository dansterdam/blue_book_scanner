While board the U.S. vessel Santa Iria, which was at anchor in the mouth of the Laguna de Terminos, off the west coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, observers on board sighted an object which appeared to be flying at an angle of approximately 75 degrees elevation. They were metallic in color and about a third the size of the full moon, or approximately 10-12 feet in diameter. After about 5 seconds one of the objects dived down to the east and disappeared from sight. Witnesses reported that the one I lost sight of the others, one of which increased in size as if approaching when it disappeared from view rather abruptly. The speed seemed very great and the objects were visible for only a few seconds each time they appeared. The objects appeared to be flying close together, one above the other, at an angle of about 75 degrees and the size was about 10-12 feet in diameter. From this single sighting no further conclusions can be drawn.
