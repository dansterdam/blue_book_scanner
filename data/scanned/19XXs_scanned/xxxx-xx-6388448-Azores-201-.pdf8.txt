II NEW "FLYING DISC" REPORT

At approximately 0230 on 31 October 1948, an unidentified object moving rapidly through the air was sighted and watched by three enlisted men stationed at Lagens, Azores. The object was variously reported as round, oval, and moving toward and then away from the observers in a northerly direction from an estimated altitude of between two and three thousand feet. It was observed within five minutes. It is believed by an authoritative source that the object was some form of balloon with an attached light device. This is substantiated by weather condition records showing the release of such a balloon at 0200 on 31 October 1948.
