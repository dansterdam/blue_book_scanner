The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a U.S. government program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the mid-20th century.

The text in the document reads:

Incident #36 -- Hollywood, California -- 6 July 1947

From the limited data available, there appears to be no astronomical explanation for this incident.

Building notice and entrance signs visible do indicate the incident to many others, which, however, did not exhibit the ray phenomenon.
