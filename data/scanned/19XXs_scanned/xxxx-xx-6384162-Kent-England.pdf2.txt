AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS REPORTED OVER KENT, ENGLAND.
DATE OF REPORT: 5 Jun 53
DATE OF OCCURRENCE: 16 May 53
EVALUATED BY (UNIT): RAF POLICE AND SECURITY UNIT
SUMMARY: (GIVING DATA AS REPORTED, AND SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION)
1. "B 12 reported that at 11.30 hrs on 16 May 53, an intelligence officer of RAF emplaned at Manston, saw a circular object hovering over the aerodrome. It was silver in color and appeared to move in a horizontal plane, rising and falling in a jerky motion. It remained in view for approximately one minute and then went out of sight in an easterly direction at high speed."
2. I have to believe that the intelligence officer concerned was quite certain of his observations as he reported the matter immediately.
AND FURTHERMORE, SEVERAL CIVILIAN CREWS OF VESSELS AT SEA OFF THAT PART OF THE NORTHEAST COAST OF KENT REPORTED SEEING A SIMILAR OBJECT AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING A BRILLIANT LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO HANG IN THE AIR, MOVE ERRATICALLY, AND THEN DISAPPEAR FROM VIEW WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT IT WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
IN VIEW OF THE RELIABILITY AND NUMBER OF THE REPORTS, THIS INCIDENT WOULD APPEAR TO BE OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE AND WOULD WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS A GENUINE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT THIS REPORT BE FORWARDED TO THE INTELLIGENCE AUTHORITIES CONCERNED FOR CONSIDERATION.
