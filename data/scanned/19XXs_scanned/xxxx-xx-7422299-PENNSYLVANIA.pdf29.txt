The image contains a compass-like diagram and two sketches. The compass diagram has labels for the cardinal directions and appears to be used to indicate the direction of an observed phenomenon. The larger sketch shows a person standing on a road with a horizon, while the smaller sketch shows a distant landscape. There is no photograph present in this image.

SA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE A ??X?? ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "T" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A STRAIGHT LINE. DESCRIBE ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE PHENOMENON'S MOVEMENT THAT ARE NOT COVERED IN THE LARGER SKETCH.
