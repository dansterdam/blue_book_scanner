The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and some text related to a UFO report. The diagram shows a curved horizon line and a compass rose, along with instructions for the viewer to imagine a point "A" on the horizon and draw a picture that will show the motion of the observed object or objects.

The text below the diagram states:

ALSO MOVE BACK AND FORTH DOWN SLOWLY

NO

If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
