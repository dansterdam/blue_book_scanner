The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the Department of the Air Force, with a letterhead and the heading "HEADQUARTERS COMMAND (AFSC) WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO 45433". The text of the document is as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
HEADQUARTERS COMMAND (AFSC)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO 45433

TO: SE3/Mr. Folm 90575

SUBJECT: UFO Observation J-C-3-63

The information obtained from the observation is not sufficient for a scientific investigation. The information received is not sufficient for a detailed scientific investigation. The scientific value of the described PID from 15h and known extent is too small to justify any special Air Force investigation.
