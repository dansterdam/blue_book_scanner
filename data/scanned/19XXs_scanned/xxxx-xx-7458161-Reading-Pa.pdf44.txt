Text in the document:

These sightings constituted and it is believed an important part of the official report made by the Army Air Force Intelligence regarding the so-called "flying discs" which had appeared first in the summer of 1947 and had caused considerable interest and speculation throughout the country. In the opinion of the investigators these objects were considered to be of a very high order of scientific development and exhibited characteristics which could not be duplicated by any known aircraft. The investigation of these sightings was conducted by the Intelligence Branch of the Army Air Force and the results were forwarded to Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, where they became part of the official files of Project "Blue Book" which was the code name for the Air Force's official investigation of "flying disc" sightings. The sightings herein reported were part of those official files.
