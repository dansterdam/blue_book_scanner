The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company

July 17, 1968

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433

Dear Colonel Quintanilla,

Thank you for your letter of July 10, inquiring about the whereabouts of our two Goodyear airships on June 13, 1968. Neither of our airships was in that area of Dayton, Ohio, on that date.

One was in San Antonio, Texas, while the other was in Rochester, N.Y.
One of the blimps was in Dayton from approximately May 7 through May 15, but neither has been in that area since then.

It would appear, then, that we cannot be of assistance in helping you to clear up the matter of the sighting in question.

Sincerely

Community Relations
