1st Lt. Robert Olason 
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olason:

Here are the comments on the recent batch of material. A few cases are certainly of considerable interest. Over-all, in this batch, Venus counts for only one case, but the Satellites for Planetary and moon counts for 14 cases; Balloons for four and Aircraft for three.

(Curiously the interesting cases: the Korean 20 April should certainly be followed up. This comes very close to being a security intelligence matter. It's certainly like to get more information on this. 1st Lt. Robert got sending a short form A to the Koreans. Actually, this should have been investigated on the spot by intelligence officers.)

Papperelli AFB 2 May: This has some similarities to the old German cases. Can Antonio 7 May: This has many similarities to the Lubbock Lights and Form A should certainly be sent if this has not already been done.

Finally, a Form A for the 29 April Syracuse stationary-disc sighting would help. 

The Miami 20 May green light sighting might have been jets but with the green lights sighting, jets should have been tracking for over radar to see green navigation lights. A second time interval also seems too fast. I hope that you can eventually send me information on these: 20 April (Korea), 2 May Papperelli, 7 May San Antonio. 

I am enclosing my report on our recent trip with which I hope you will concur. And keep 'em coming. It's easier to handle a few at a time and frequently than a larger batch at longer intervals. Send her regards.
