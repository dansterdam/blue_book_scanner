After what I may judge to be a two or three minute show, the image faded away, and I believe 23 to 25 seconds elapsed when the angle of elevation increased, and the object reappeared, about the same size, approximately halfway down toward the eastern horizon. On this occasion, however, I followed the object for several minutes as it passed overhead and was not seen again.

It is believed however that meteorology can confirm or refute the probability of similar flames as seen in aviation. I estimate the object to have been about 10 degrees elevation as it reappeared.

This case observation is viewed as the apparent attitude, which I could not follow in detail, however, owing to darkness being greater than the relative speed of the object. The possibility of this being the moon or a planet, through miscalculation of the relative size, cannot be ruled out.

The following observation is submitted in substantiating the probable accuracy of this adjustment of distance under conditions existing at the time. While the probable accuracy of my judgment of distance is uncertain, the relative movement of the object as compared with celestial bodies is peculiarly distinctive.

I am 41 years of age, in good health, with vision 20-20 in both eyes. I have had aviation for a long period of time as a Naval Aviation observer. I have had pilot training which tends to give me keener observational abilities than the average individual.

The above observations and estimates are made four days after the occurrence this interval having been due to my being on leave and unable to submit this earlier.

Respectfully,

Lieut. U. S. Navy
