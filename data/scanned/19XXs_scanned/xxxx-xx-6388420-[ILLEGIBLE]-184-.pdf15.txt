Incident No. 192 -- 24 Oct. 1952, between 1100 and 1330 GMT.
An Air Force officer, on a routine patrol flight at a high altitude, sighted a dark object at very high altitude approximately 10-12 miles above his plane. The object was observed for 10-12 minutes, making a flying maneuver which was inconsistent with a conventional aircraft at a range outside the limit of visual resolution.
