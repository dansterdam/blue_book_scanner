Attn: Major H. Quintanilla, Jr.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

As reported, this case is completely unidentified and much criticized. Immediate disclosure would not seem appropriate. It is conceivable that military intelligence or psychological warfare might have some interest if these objects picked up by radar coverage were these. Wireless indicates that jet interception may have been involved, although objects were visual in shape and were sighted by several aircraft. In one case they are described as "surrounded by a bluish green glow, and moving at a rapid rate of speed. Their maneuvers indicated they were controlled and intelligent in flight. Attachments: It appears that all persons concerned in this sighting should be furnished interrogation. I further suggest that a copy of this sighting be transmitted to the University of Colorado group.

Since the source of this information was himself a member of a military intelligence detachment, it is current all the more significance as confirming details that would otherwise be lacking.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
