NARRATIVE: The observer report forwards a narrative written and signed by and concerns his sighting of UFOs on 23 April 1967. It should be noted that this report is submitted in sub-mission to BDRM 4A3b.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICERS: A. On inquiry, it was ascertained that the witness described seeing a bright light which approached very closely. It seemed to be round and of considerable size. When it was at its closest approach, there was a brief flash similar to an explosion or brilliant flash at each change of direction. He thought that this flash was caused by some sort of connection producing an impulse or brilliance. He compared its motion to some sort of intelligent control, rapidly changing direction. B. The source stated that the witness seemed to be a mature and intelligent person, with no indication of any mental disturbance. He appeared entirely sane and sincere in his statement. Therefore, while the object itself could not be identified, the witness appears to be a credible observer who has described an unusual phenomenon in a reasonable and logical manner.
