630TH AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON
27TH AIR DIVISION (DEFENSE)
BILLINGS, MONTANA 
5 September 1952

SUBJECT: 

While on a Radar Control & Warning mission in the Yaak River Sector, at 1730 hours, 4 September 1952, 2/Lt J. A. F. 11234679, and Cpl. W. 11344879, observed a bright light in the sky. This light was first observed at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet, and at a distance of 40 miles. The light appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and at times seemed to change directions abruptly.

This light was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. It would appear and disappear at varying intervals. When the light was visible, it was a bright bluish-white color. There would be a short interval when the light would disappear, then it would reappear at a different location in the sky. The light would travel a distance of several miles in a matter of seconds. There was no noise or vapor trail while this light was observed.

By this time the airborne intercept aircraft had locked on to this light and were attempting to make an interception. However, the light would change direction and speed on a moments notice. This object seemed to easily out maneuver the interceptor aircraft. The intercept aircraft were finally forced to break off the chase as the light began traveling at a speed they could not match. The light then disappeared from the radar scope.

The last light observed was a short time later. This light appeared under the aircraft at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet. It was observed for several seconds and then disappeared from the radar scope.
