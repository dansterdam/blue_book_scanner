22 April 1959

Dear Colonel Pitts:

Captain Frederick J. Myers, USAF, flying a B-57 bomber aircraft, reported observing a bright light or object at approximately 35,000 ft. altitude near Baltimore, Maryland, on 15 April 1959. The following is a summary of the pertinent details of this observation:

Captain Myers first noticed the object when it appeared to be ahead of his aircraft, at an estimated distance of about 20 miles. It was a very bright, glowing, round object, approximately the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length. It was observed for about one minute, during which time it remained stationary. He then lost sight of it as it appeared to move rapidly away and disappear.

I would appreciate receiving any information you may have obtained relative to this observation, or any comments you may care to make regarding it.

Sincerely,
J.L. REID, Lt Colonel
USAF
