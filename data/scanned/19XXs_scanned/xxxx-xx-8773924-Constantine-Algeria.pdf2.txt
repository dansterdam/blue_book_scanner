MARCH - FIG 1102

At 2115 hours on 14 August 1952, two persons in the city of Constantine say a luminous object flying at high speed toward Guelma. According to the observers, the apparatures which had no resemblance to a flying saucer, emitted a very bright light. At the time this happened, the local weather bureau had not launched any weather balloons.

The same day, at 1920 hours, many people at the docks of Philippeville say in the sky an enormous red disk going from north to west, leaving behind a greenish trail.
