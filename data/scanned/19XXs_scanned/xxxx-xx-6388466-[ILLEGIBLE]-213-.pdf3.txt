The light was first observed approximately 40 degrees above the horizon, traveling straight up. The light was bright red in color, intensely brilliant, and appeared to be about the size of a golf ball or slightly larger. There was no sound heard, and it disappeared suddenly as if stopping the car. Its appearance and disappearance was more gradual than usual. It was observed for approximately 3 to 4 seconds. The light was approximately 1/32 of an inch wide if seen through a gauge at arm's length from the observer.
