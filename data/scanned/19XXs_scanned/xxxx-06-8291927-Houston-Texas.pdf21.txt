The image appears to contain a document from Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document describes a sighting of a group of five or six unidentified flying objects observed in flight from a point about one mile south of Walker AFB NMEX to a point one to two miles north of the base. The objects were observed at an altitude of about five thousand feet, and their speed was estimated at five hundred to six hundred miles per hour. The objects appeared to be in a half-moon formation, and the most easterly object veered off even more to the east at a ten-degree angle. The exact size of the objects was unknown, and the spacing between them in the formation could not be judged.
