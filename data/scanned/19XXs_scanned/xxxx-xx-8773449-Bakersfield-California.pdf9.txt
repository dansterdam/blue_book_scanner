DATE: AUG 22, 1955
TIME: 2230 HOURS
CASE NUMBER: 8773449

THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXCERPT TRANSCRIBED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

While stated in the report, I observed that a round, glowing object with red and green lights was sighted hovering and moving at a high rate of speed near Bakersfield, California on August 22, 1955 at approximately 10:30 PM. The object was observed for several minutes and was described as metallic in appearance, approximately 50-60 feet in diameter, and displayed an erratic flight pattern alternating between hovering and rapid acceleration. No sound was reported. The incident was investigated by the Air Force and the report concludes that the object's identity could not be established conclusively.
