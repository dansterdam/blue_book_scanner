The Beason came in my direction about 7:30 p.m. and stayed there about 15 minutes. They would go up and down, back and forth. Then they would stop and hover. I could see them plainly. They were a very bright orange color and very large. I saw two of them at this time.

I went in the house and told my wife and daughter to come and see them. When I came back outside they were gone. I don't know where they went. I watched for them for about 30 minutes but they didn't come back.

After I saw the first two my wife and daughter came out and we all watched the next two. The same thing happened, they came in about the same direction, hovered, went up and down, back and forth, then left.

We saw four in all that evening. They were very bright and very large. I have no idea what they were but they sure weren't any planes or anything I had ever seen before.
