The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

WHEN OBJECT WAS FIRST NOTICED IT APPEARED
TO BE MOVING TOWARDS US. IT GREW LARGER.
STARTED TO MY WIFE TO COME OUT AND SEE
THE STRANGE OBJECT. WHILE SHE WAS COMING
RAN IN TO GET MY 10-POWER BINOCULARS.
THROUGH BINOCULARS WE COULD SEE DIST-
INCTLY OUTLINE OF A SAUCER STANDING ON END.
THEN IT SEEMED TO RECEDE INTO THE DISTANCE
IT GREW SMALLER THE WE COULD NO LONGER
SEE THE OUTLINE. IT ALSO MOVED TO THE WEST.
FINALLY WE COULD SEE ONLY A REFLECTED LIGHT
THE SCATTERED CLOUDS (MOON WAS REFLECTED ON)
