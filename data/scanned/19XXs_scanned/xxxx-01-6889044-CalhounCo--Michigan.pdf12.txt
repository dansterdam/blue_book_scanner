changing handwritting: I would say that this strange light was as bright or brighter than the sun. According to my eyes and from what I was seeing, it appeared to be some type of light source or luminous craft hovering over the area. The light was self-luminous and what color is was is debate able, but it seemed to have a reddish-orange hue. I cant seem to come up with what this could be. It was a strange sight to see and to be up close with. I wonder what it could be? I will try to convey the details as best I can as I know this may be something significant that was seen. It took up a big portion of my field of vision and I'm having trouble grasping what I wit
nessed. It seemed to just be hovering there for quite some time and I kept trying to make sense of what I was seeing, I know at times my eyes can play tricks but this seemed so real and I can tell you with certainty that it was no conventional aircraft or meteor. I will try to explain further but please bear with me as I'm still quite shaken by the experience. It was quite a sight to see.
