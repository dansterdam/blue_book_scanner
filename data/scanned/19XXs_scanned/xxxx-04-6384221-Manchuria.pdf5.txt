AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DEB 21, 6006th AI SQ, APO 970
597th
FEAT 2 OF 3

ITEM: 1. Radar Plots were reportedly recorded for eight-plus, slow-moving targets in the area of 51 0320 E for several minutes starting at 14:55-11. Winds Aloft were reported to be between 350 and 360 degrees at 75-80 knots.
2. Without a definite reference point, the actual objects could not be identified. The description, however, does indicate the possibility of balloons as this could be the case. The general description does not in any way identity the objects as of aerial nature. No conclusive evidence is presented.
3. The use of a network of balloons by the enemy to accurately check radar installations and equipment may be a ruse to accurately check radar ranges and reactions. The reporting of low-value radar targets may be an attempt to overwork UN radar by sending up such false targets. The inherent danger of sighting up such false targets for UN radar would be marginal.
