The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be an excerpt of text from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO reports.

The text reads:

"Feb 16h - 1951. Very controversial accounts of speed (0 - 3 min.) that would have averaged 1200 mph. Descent around 1500 feet/sec. however, release was two hours earlier at St. Cloud. Could have been this girl balloon crossing or actually a lazy balloon to keep it at a low altitude. Not at all probable, but possibly a balloon."
