7. SUMMARY: At approximately 0220 hours, 17 April 1967, I observed five (5) large, illuminated, oval shaped objects, traveling in a close formation and at a very high rate of speed. They disappeared over the roof of the Saigon Field Office of the 524th MI Detachment, located at 205/8 Vo Tanh, Saigon. Based on the size and behaviors of the objects, I estimate their altitude was approximately 1000-2000 feet. During the period of time, the objects traveled from where I first saw them and disappeared over the roof, they seemed to be at a constant height, and when they passed behind the roof, there was no change in their speed or direction. I estimate the total observation time was approximately 15-20 seconds. The objects appeared to be very bright, almost white in color. During the period of time the objects were observed, the sky was very clear, and the objects were easily visible against the night sky. As they passed over the roof, I did not observe any trail or contrail. I also observed that, as they moved, the objects maintained a constant distance from each other, and their shape and size remained the same. This indicated to me that the objects were under some form of control. I could give no estimate as to the speed of the objects, but based on the short period of time over which they were observed traversing a considerable distance, I would estimate it to be in excess of 1000 mph. During the entire period of observation, I heard no sound emanating from the objects. I have no explanation for what I observed, and it is completely outside my experience. I can offer no conclusions as to the nature of the objects.
