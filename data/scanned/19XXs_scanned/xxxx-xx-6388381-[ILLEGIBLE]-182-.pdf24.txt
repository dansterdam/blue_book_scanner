There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a historical document, specifically a "STATEMENT OF MRS. [REDACTED]" dated 10 December 1948 from Crescent City, California.

The text of the document is as follows:

At about 1610, 17 October, 1948 while conversing with Mr. Ernest Haley on Battery Point, Crescent City, Cal., I saw a small silver colored object that reflected light as light against a mirror, this object was elliptic in shape and traveling very fast in a southerly direction, and remained in sight for about two (2) minutes, another plane was in sight at the same time heading north, the silver colored object was about 5,000 feet higher than the plane flying north.

Shortly after sighting, the plane or object made a sharp bank of about 45 to the right then resumed her course, disappearing to say, no smoke or noise was heard from the object, at all times the object gave off a brilliant flash as from the sun shining on a glass mirror.
