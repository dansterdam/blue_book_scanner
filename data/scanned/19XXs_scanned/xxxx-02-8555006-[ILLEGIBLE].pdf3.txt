Dear Sirs,

This only letter was in right publicly filed for instance. I have no any written material or any other kind of information at all, I had just one contact in place as for about 1936 about Mr. Leffinger was about something concerned about underground flying discs. I have no facts or details on this, except to say that we were amazed so much by the report that the word was put out not to discuss it or to send in a form on it as this was a very secret project and something about an atom bomb at the time. I have never since had any contact or any other kind of information on this subject at all.

Sincerely,
