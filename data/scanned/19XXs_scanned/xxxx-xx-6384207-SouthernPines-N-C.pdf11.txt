The following is an account of two 'saucer' sightings in the near Vidalia, Georgia on September 26, 1952:

At 3 P.M. on the afternoon of September 26, 1952, Mr. and Mrs. Abrams, Negroes, watched a bomber-type object traveling south. Several seconds later they saw another object trailing the first one. They estimated the speed of the objects as about 2,000 m.p.h. The objects made no sound and seemed to be traveling at a terrific rate of speed, in a straight course.

At 1:30 P.M. on the afternoon of September 26, 1952, Miss watched two disc-shaped objects flying in the same direction at the same time. The objects were silver in color and traveled very slowly. The witness said she was watching them closely when they suddenly disappeared from sight. She did not see any means of propulsion and said they did not appear to have any. They did not sound any noise and did not appear to have any form of windows or doors. She said the sighting lasted for about 2 to 3 minutes.
