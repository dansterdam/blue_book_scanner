11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted a red light south of his house. The light was observed low in the sky and seemed to travel toward the S.W. After several minutes a red light fell straight down and disappeared after a few seconds. A short time later the observer sighted a white light at the position of the original red light. After a short time this light also disappeared.
