The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

13. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS SELF-LUMINOUS AND WHAT COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHAT THIS WAS AND YOUR OPINION OF THE SPEED AT WHICH IT WAS MOVING IF YOU COULD ESTIMATE THIS.
THE PHENOMENON WAS A ROUND, LUMINOUS OBJECT THAT WAS SELF-LUMINOUS AND WHITE IN COLOR. IT WAS MOVING AT A RAPID SPEED BUT I WAS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS EXACT SPEED.
