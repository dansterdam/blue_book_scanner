12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT

THE SKY AT THE TIME. FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT APPEARED AS A POINT OF LIGHT, INDICATE COMPARISONS WITH STARS, A LIGHT OR
OTHER FAMILIAR OBJECTS IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.  

the object looked like an elongated pear shape. It was luminous and hazy, not sharply defined. It flashed at irregular intervals and then disappeared in place. There was a smaller second object which moved away from the first object. I could not determine the color. The phenomenon was quite unlike any star or other familiar aerial object.
