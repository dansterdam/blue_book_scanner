The image does not contain any photographs or visual content. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

The text in the document is as follows:

The circular object appeared without any sound, hovering straight up above the treetops. I have watched them recurve in the sky before and suddenly disappear.

None were seen on this date. Intense light was observed moving back and forth in a straight line without sound. Duration 3-5 minutes.

Thank you.
