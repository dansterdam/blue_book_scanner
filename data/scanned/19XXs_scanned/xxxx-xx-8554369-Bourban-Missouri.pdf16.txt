Truth Concerning
April 1, 1957

Congressman Ichord
Dear Sir:

We have been bothered with UFOs since February 8, 1957, to my knowledge - probably they were before but do not now deserve, I know of them since then.

They are numerous, very bright, or most. They come at times as many as 10 and stay soon, as late as 2 o'clock in the mornings. My neighbors including others nearby that I could name who would say the same if I could but I cannot secure their real names in writing when they frightfully say they are afraid to put down anything - they would think this might get back to the government in some way. They know better than I do what this is all about.

We had so many on the ground and in the sky that you just wonder now the're so many and under guard of some kind. They vary in sizes from small like a star to as big as a discus or even larger. It sure helps from the highway patrol we have here as they would call in message - they would come but seem to disappear or stop their engines only to come back on. It or they do not wish to be caught and they disappear as large as one minute and come back the next.

How can I give you more answers as I just don't know where to turn. I just don't just brush this off as it is true and I don't lie believe me.

The sheriff and his daughter were here last night, they can tell you. They found their back car window broken - it came from stones or something as there was no marks from a break in as there have no other thing.
