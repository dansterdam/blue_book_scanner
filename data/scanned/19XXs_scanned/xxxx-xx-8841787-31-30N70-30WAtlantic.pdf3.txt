UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
PHILADELPHIA 4

FLOWER AND COOK OBSERVATORIES

Executive Officer,
Public Information Division
Office of Information Service
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Last year the Executive Officer very kindly, in reply to a request from me for information about certain fireballs which appeared in 1957, showed me a confidential manual depicting atmospheric phenomena, of which bodies can be used in the solution of the aerial mystery.

During the past year or so a large number of fireballs have appeared over the eastern or southeastern states, and in the cases of the five to be mentioned, I have been able to assemble a number of observations. But I am writing to urgently request that you be good enough to send me copies of any or all reports in your hands, dealing with these bright bodies.

I may add the Hydrographic Office of the U.S.Navy has for the past 30 years effectively cooperated in such work and as a consequence it has over possible evidence of sudden important fireballs. Such cooperation from your office would be much appreciated.

The specific bodies I now request information on are:

1958 April 22/23 Southeastern States 5:26 p.m. Apr. 22
1958 July 4/5 North Carolina etc. late in the evening
1958 Nov. 30 South Carolina etc. 6:10 p.m. Nov. 30
1959 Dec. 23/24 New York, New Jersey etc. 4:15 a.m. Dec. 24
1959 Feb. 30/11 South Carolina etc. 2:00 a.m. Feb. 11

It would be a great favor to me and useful to science if you would be good enough to send me observations dealing with these fireballs.

Very sincerely yours,
Wlharbert, Pa.
