As I was coming home from work about 7:30 pm, I witnessed an unusual and beautiful looking object in the sky. It was circular in shape, reddish in color, and seemed to be moving at a steady rate. At first I thought it was a small airplane, but then I noticed that it was much brighter and larger than any aircraft I had ever seen. As I continued to watch, the object suddenly accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I have no reasonable explanation for what I saw, but I can say with certainty that it was not a conventional aircraft or anything I have ever seen before. I am a credible witness and I am unsure of the significance of this incident, but I felt it was important to report what I observed."
