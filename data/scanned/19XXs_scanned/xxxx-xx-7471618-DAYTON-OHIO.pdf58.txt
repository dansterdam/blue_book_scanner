The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which is a declassified U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) between 1947 and 1969.

The text in the document is as follows:

10. IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE PHENOMENON, HOW MANY WERE THERE?  DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED.  DID THIS ARRANGEMENT CHANGE DURING THE SIGHTING?

APPROXIMATELY 6 TO 8 LIGHTS OR OBJECTS WHICH APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY AT TIMES AND AT OTHER TIMES SEEMED TO BE MOVING OR SHIFTING TO NEW POSITIONS. MADE OVER SAME "FLIGHT PATH"

11. SKY CONDITIONS (Check appropriate boxes.)
CLEAR
MOSTLY CLOUDY

12. WEATHER 
CUMULUS CLOUDS (Some haze)
CIRRUS CLOUDS (Thin, wispy)

C. IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE STARS AND MOON?
NONE
BRIGHT MOONLIGHT 
MOON WITH HALO
STARS PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY OBSCURED

D. IF THE SIGHTING WAS IN DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN IS YOUR EYES? NO. IF "YES", WHERE WAS THE SUN AS YOU FACED THE OBJECT?

IN FRONT OF YOU OVERHEAD (Near us?)

E. PLEASE GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION, SUCH AS STREET LAMPS, ETC. FOR TERRESTRIAL ILLUMINATION, SPECIFY DIRECTION TO LIGHT SOURCE. 
NO VISIBLE SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION. THE OBJECTS/LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE SELF-LUMINOUS.

13. GIVE A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS A POINT SOURCE OF LIGHT, OR HAD DEFINITE SHAPE. IF POSSIBLE, GIVE APPROXIMATE SIZE AND ESTIMATED DISTANCE. DESCRIBE ANY UNUSUAL MOTION OR BEHAVIOR.

THE OBJECTS APPEARED AS BRIGHT STATIONARY LIGHTS AND OCCASIONALLY WOULD DIM OR BLINK OUT AND THEN REAPPEAR AT A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT POSITION - MOVED SLOWLY - NO DEFINED SHAPE - COULD NOT ESTIMATE SIZE OR DISTANCE - APPEARED TO BE FLYING AT VERY HIGH ALTITUDES.
