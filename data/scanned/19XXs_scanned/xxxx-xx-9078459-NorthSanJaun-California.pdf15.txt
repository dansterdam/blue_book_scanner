BOYS' PHOTOS OF UFO

NORTH SAN JUAN - The Air Force, which gave a group of school boys a scolding and photographing ban on an unidentified flying object, plans to present the pictures at a meeting in San Juan Capistrano next week.
The pictures show a mysterious object described as "resembling a Texas longhorn calf." Meanwhile, parents of the boys have been instructed not to discuss any information.
The supposed flying object was sighted last week and John, one of the boys, took a picture of it.
