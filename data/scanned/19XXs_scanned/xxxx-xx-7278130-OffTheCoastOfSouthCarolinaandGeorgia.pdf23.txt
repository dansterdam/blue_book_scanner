Flower and Cook Observatory 
2920 August Rd.
Dear Sirs: 
You, I assume, are not interested in having your attention called to a doubtful report of a luminous object near the Georgia coast on the night of 27 Sept. 1967. nor to the case of a huge object east of Florida on 3 Oct. 1967. 
There was a very definite report of a strange phenomenon on 27 Sept. 1967 from an observer who seems to be reliable. An investigation has been conducted through the courtesy of the F.B.I. and the Air Force, and while the details are still a bit unclear, it appears that the object sighted was real and was not an astronomical phenomenon. Do not expect me to go into details to you about the object or its behavior. I shall be glad, however, to discuss this matter with some responsible official of the Air Force, if you think it would be worth while.
The Annual Report for 1967, which is issued, F.O.R. NO. 104 has not yet been sent you. Several copies will be forwarded to you as soon as they are available. Thank you for the help your office has willingly extended on requests in the past.
Sincerely yours,
Charles P. Olivier
