4. *WE FIRST NOTICED A SINGLE OBLONG SHAPED OBJECT
HOVERING IN THE SKY ALL AT ONCE WE SAW IT MOVE
VERY SWIFTLY AND HORIZONTALLY IN A SOUTHWEST DIRECTION.
IT THEN STOPPED ABRUPTLY, WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN, AND
DESCENDED RAPIDLY AND VERTICALLY DOWN BEHIND THE HORIZON.
A FEW MINUTES LATER, ANOTHER OBJECT, IDENTICAL TO THE
FIRST, APPEARED AND DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING. ABOUT
TWO MINUTES AFTER THE SECOND ONE DISAPPEARED OVER THE
HORIZON, ONE OF THEM CAME BACK UP AND HOVERED AGAIN,
THEN MOVED SLIGHTLY TO THE WEST AND SET DOWN OUT OF
SIGHT.*
