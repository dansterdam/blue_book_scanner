Dear Mr. Weaver,

This letter is in response to your report of a UFO sighting on May 27, 1956 near North San Juan, California. After reviewing the details you provided, we have determined that the object you observed was likely a weather balloon or similar high-altitude research craft, and not an unidentified flying object.

While we appreciate you taking the time to report this incident, Project Blue Book is unable to definitively identify the nature of the object you saw. However, based on the information you provided, it does not appear to have been an extraterrestrial spacecraft or any other type of unidentified flying object. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns regarding this matter. I would be happy to discuss this further with you.

Sincerely,
