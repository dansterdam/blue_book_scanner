Dear [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your letter of August 20, 1954, in which you both gave a very interesting account of your sightings of unusual objects on July 3, 1954.

We are interested in getting more complete information from you. Just how those sightings were made would be very helpful in our evaluation of the case. If you can give us additional details of the sightings, such as the location, time, number and description of the objects, direction of flight and duration of sighting, it would be most helpful in our analysis.

Attached is a self-addressed envelope for your convenience.

Sincerely,

HESTON M. JACKS
