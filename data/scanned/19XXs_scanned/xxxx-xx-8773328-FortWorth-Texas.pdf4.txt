AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

United States 
Unidentified Flying Objects
Fort Worth, Texas
13 August 1952

Captain Clarence J. Loranz, 40 723595
The witness, who was carrying her husband, reported that on 13 August 1952, at about 10:45 PM, while she and her husband were driving on a road to their home, they observed a bright light in the sky coming towards them. The light was larger than a star, approximately the size of a 5 cent piece held at arm's length, and appeared to be about 100 feet above the ground. As it came closer, it appeared to be a round, saucer-shaped object, approximately 30 feet in diameter. The object was brightly illuminated, and no sound was evident. The object was observed to be about the size of a car. When the object was directly overhead, estimated to be about 50-75 yards, the witness stated the object began slowing down, hovered for a moment, and then accelerated rapidly upwards and disappeared.

Comments of Preparing Officer:
The witness is considered to be a credible observer, was excited but composed, and her husband was a witness to the sighting. The information is probably true.
