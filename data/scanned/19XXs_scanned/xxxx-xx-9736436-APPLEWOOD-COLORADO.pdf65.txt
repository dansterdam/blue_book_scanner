27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object
was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was
above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the curved line to show the compass direction from which
you first saw the object. Place a "D" on the curved line to show the compass direction in which you last saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object, or objects, made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and an "B" at
the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Give a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
