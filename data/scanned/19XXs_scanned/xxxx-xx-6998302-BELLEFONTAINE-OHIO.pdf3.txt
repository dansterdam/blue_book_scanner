CASE #9
1 August 1952
Description of Incident: 
At 12:12 a.m. radar track appeared 20 miles NNW of W-P AFB. The course was 270 degrees at 150 knots. Two F-86's under GCI control were then SW of that position. 
The fighters were vectored and made visual contact at 12:52. Fighters stayed with the object until 16:32.
Investigation of course, an AF major and Lieutenant, reveal the following:
1. The F-86's admitted to 48,000'; still off, and when made a second pass the object had estimated the object at 50 to 70,000'.  The object's size, excepting source's estimate of distance was 24-40' in diameter and source said his optical sight just covered the object. The film were not sufficiently clear. The object appeared as a fuzzy, small image in the upper right hand corner with discernible motion to lower left.
2. The important notes were established: Re-affirmation that the UFO moved at 400 knots and indication that the two F-86's and UFO appeared simultaneously on the ground radar scope. It is obvious that all eyes and antennae were fixed on the same object.
Comments:  
The object was not a balloon, since the speed was too fast. A rawindome was released at 12:52 and moved off to the east. The bilip size was that of a normal a/c. The object was not a known a/c because the altitude was too high. The object was not astronomical as dual radar returns eliminate this. Electronic or visual mirage of meteorological phenomena is out of the question as the radar set was on high beam, and both would not occur simultaneously in the same place. The sighting occurred "above the weather".
Conclusion: Unknown.
