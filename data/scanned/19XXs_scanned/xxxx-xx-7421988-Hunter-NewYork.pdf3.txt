Dear Mr. 

We are unable to identify positively the object you observed information.

The description you provided is consistent with rotating satellites or packages. It would be nearly impossible to determine which satellite component you might have observed since there are more than 4,000 man-made objects in space. 

The State of New York is heavily ringed by SAGE stations, but many of these stations reported unidentified flying objects. We did not receive any other UFO reports from the area.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified object, please contact the nearest Air Force installation immediately; it will be glad to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Thank you for bringing your observation to our attention.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STILES
Major USAF
Acting Chief, Civil Branch
Directorate of Information Services Division
