The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a handwritten response to a questionnaire related to a UFO sighting. Here is the text from the document:

As near as I can recall, an orange glowing ball was slowly toward the west. The light stopped, then started moving again toward the northeast.
The orange light was moving erratically, as it moved.
At times, it seemed at a distance, and at times, it seemed very close.
The light went out.
