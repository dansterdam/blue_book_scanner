The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now transcribe all the text from the document:

I received a letter from a witness and they described seeing several bright lights in the sky over Palo Alto, California on the night of April 6, 1887. The witness stated that the lights were moving in a strange manner, darting around and then hovering. After several minutes, the lights suddenly shot off at a high rate of speed. The witness said the lights were a pure white color and very bright. They estimated the lights were at an altitude of around 2,000 feet.  

The witness wondered if the lights could have been aircraft or something else unusual. They said the lights did not resemble any known aircraft they were familiar with. The witness was unable to identify the source of the lights, but they were confident the sighting was not of any conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon.  

The report notes that this incident occurred at 10:35 PM. As this was before the widespread use of aircraft, the investigator was unable to determine a conventional explanation for the witness's observation. The case is listed as "Unidentified".
