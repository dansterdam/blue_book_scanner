PHOTOGRAPHY
AF P NRS : Frames 1a, 1b, and 1c - Attachments to "UFO Report of Investigation" by 2d Lieutenant Kinderman, dated 16 June 1967
1. PURPOSE: This report is written to fulfill a request submitted by Major Quintanilla, TDEU/UP, to analyze the referenced photography to determine if possible what the unidentified object may be. If the object cannot be specifically identified it was requested that the approximate dimensions be given.
2. ANALYSIS: The imagery which appears in the attached photos appears to be genuine imagery. The object(s) cannot be identified of described, however, is still the "UFO" as annotated on the photographs. Frame 1a is behind the object as viewed from the bottom. This is evidenced by the shadow cast by the object on the ground. The light is coming from the owner's left, which suggests the object was casting a shadow onto the ground. It should also be noted that a brilliant light would have to be shining from the ground up to illuminate the bottom of the object, but no light was mentioned in the investigating officer's report.
3. It is necessary that the original negatives and the focal length of the camera be obtained before a detailed dimensional analysis can be performed.
