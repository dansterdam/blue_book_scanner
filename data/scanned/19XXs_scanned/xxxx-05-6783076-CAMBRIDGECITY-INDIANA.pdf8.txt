The image contains a sketch of an oval-shaped object with the text "a MEDIUM STAR" written below it. There appears to be no photograph in this particular page.

Here is the text that was found in the document:

WHAT TO DO IF YOU SEE A UFO: REMAIN CALM, DO NOT FIRE OR ATTEMPT TO SHOOT A UFO WHICH YOU MAY SIGHT. IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN OR IF YOU COULD, IN ANY WAY, DAMAGE THE CRAFT YOU WOULD BE PUNISHED BY OUR GOVERNMENT AS IT IS ABSOLUTELY AGAINST ORDERS TO DO SO. IF THIS HAPPENS, IMMEDIATELY REPORT IT TO YOUR NEAREST AIR FORCE BASE OR GOVERNMENT AGENCY.

A MEDIUM STAR

SO INK COMING OUT OF IT
