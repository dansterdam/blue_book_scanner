The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text describes the details of the experiment, including the release of barium vapor, the transmission of radio signals, and the appearance and movement of the resulting clouds. It also mentions the schedule for the twilight launchings and the personnel involved in conducting the experiments.

Barium vapor releases will occur as the rocket ascends at about 75, 115, and 140 statute miles, forming three distinct clouds. An RF transmitter on board the rocket will transmit radio signals down through the artificial clouds, and receivers on the ground will determine the degree of attenuation or interference caused by passage of the signals through the ionized vapor. The clouds will be photographed from several camera sites along the East Coast.

The twilight launchings are scheduled for 7:18 p.m. EDT each evening on a Nike-Tomahawk research rocket. If weather conditions are unfavorable, attempts will be made on successive nights, with slight variations in launch times.

The clouds first appear light green tinged with red, then turn purple in elongated patterns along the lines of the Earth's magnetic field. The clouds may extend across the sky for several hundred miles and be visible for 30 minutes to one hour.

The experiments are being conducted for the Air Force by the Cambridge Research Laboratories, Bedford, Mass. N. W. Rosenberg of AFCRL is the Project Scientist, and William T. Burns is the Project Engineer for Wallops Station.
