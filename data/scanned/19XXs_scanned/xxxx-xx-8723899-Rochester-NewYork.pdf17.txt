The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Reference your recent correspondence concerning the status of your photograph which was submitted to our office for analysis. I regret the delays however, at times a backlog does occur and our photographic laboratory must depend on another installation for a portion of the analysis which has been submitted to the photo analysts and we should be hearing from them in a couple of weeks. We will then return your negative with our analysis.
