13. COMMENT OF REPORTING AGENCY: SUMMARY (Continued):
Made no noise audible to me. Prior to the sighting of these objects, I had observered various conventional aircraft, both propeller and jet powered, and their manner of flight and performance was definitely different from these unidentified objects. I can't account for what I saw as I've ever seen in the sky. They were all travelling at a terrific rate of speed which I would estimate to be around five times greater than that of any jet powered aircraft I have ever seen. They were too distant and travelling too fast for me to be able to even estimate their size, but judging from the apparent speed, they must have been tremendous. I was only able to see them for a few seconds. They seemed to disappear suddenly in the distance. I have no opinion whatsoever concerning their identity, origin or purpose. However, I have never seen anything even remotely similar in all my experience as a flyer and aircraft observer. The performance of these objects was incredible and unconventional. So far as I am concerned these objects remain completely unexplained, and I am at a loss to account for what they could have been. There were several of them. I had a very clear and distinct view of them. They were bright, sharply outlined, and did not appear to be reflecting the sun. As I stated, they were definitely not any kind of conventional aircraft. I also noticed they disappeared suddenly, rather than gradually fading from sight. As I said, the performance and characteristics of these objects were unlike anything I have ever seen before or since, and they remain completely mysterious and unexplained to me.
