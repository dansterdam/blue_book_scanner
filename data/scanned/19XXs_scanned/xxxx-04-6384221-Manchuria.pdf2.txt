ATIC DOCUMENT 11720, Manchuria

On 23 Apr 53 four F-86's were on a counter air mission over North Korea. The call sign of this flight was JOHN RED. At 1500't the flight sighted what appeared to be an estimated 20 to 25 triangular shaped objects traveling at an estimated speed of between 600 and 800 knots. The objects were seen approximately 3 miles from the aircraft at the time was GAVO.

The objects were described as being large lights, although no cables or lines were observed attached to them. Approximate 10 of the objects were observed and what appeared to be trailing dark colored streamers from the bottom portion and trailing dark colored streamers from the bottom portion and trailing dark colored streamers from the bottom portion and trailings dark colored steamers.

The passing of the objects, F-86's at the time were flying at a speed of 593 Mach. It has been reliably determined from aircraft flight logs that the wind was coming from that direction at the time of the sightings.

ATIC COMMENT: Flight activity of Chinese Communists have been noted before. The use of radar reflectors carried by balloons is entirely possible, but the reason for such action cannot be determined at this time. Such equipment may be sent aloft by the enemy to accurately check radar antenna lobe patterns or check winds or other meteorological conditions.
