The image contains a photograph of 2 black and white prints and 1 negative, which are described as poor quality. The document appears to be a Project Blue Book report on an unidentified flying object sighting in Lexington, Missouri, dated March 12, 1967. The report discusses the analysis of the subject photography, which indicates a certain amount of vertical banding that is evidenced in the imagery. However, the report concludes that the photography is not genuine.

Transcription of the text in the document:

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: LEXINGTON, MISSOURI 
DATE: 12 MARCH 1967

PHOTOGRAPHY
IF ______ IR _______ QUALITY: POOR

1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 57-65 submitted by Major Quintanilla (ADEPT) requesting an analysis of subject photography to determine the identity of a "flying" object.

2. ANALYSIS: A certain amount of vertical banding is evidenced in the photography. This is common with close-in photography in poor light. The vertical banding suggests that the object was stationary and not "flying" across the sky as the source document indicates. This banding, together with the overall poor quality of the photography, leads this analyst to conclude that the object was not an "unidentified flying object" but rather some other phenomenon.

3. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the foregoing observations, it would appear that the photography is not genuine insofar as it would represent an "unidentified flying object" as the source document is concerned.
