2 August 1952

Description of Incident
On 2 August 1952, a radar track appeared 20 miles NNW of W-P AFB. The course was steady south and the radar contact gained height as it moved. The object was tracked for 12 minutes from 10,000 to 20,000 feet. The fighters were vectored and made visual contact at 10:55.

Interrogation of sources, an AF major and lieutenant, reveal the following:
1. The F-86's climbed to 12,000', fell off, and then made a second climb to 16,000' and a second dive and recovered a weak return on his radar sighting. The Lieutenant's sight was "caged" so he could not locate the object.
2. The object was estimated at 12,000-20,000' above his altitude of 16,000'. This altitude was substantiated by the range capability of the radar.
3. The object completed the maneuver in a matter of seconds. The final position of the object was at 14,000' above the F-86's altitude.
4. The film taken in the upper right hand corner of the object was not sufficiently clear. The object appeared as a very bright light in the upper right hand corner of the film.

The AF Major established two facts:
1. The UFO gained a speed of about 700 mph, and 
2. The UFO maintained such speed and altitude control that it seemed to pass the sound barrier with ease, and UFO experts believed two events have occurred:
1) The UFO was fired on and all eyes were fixed on the same object.

Comments
The object was tracked by the radar and ranged between 15000' and 20000'. The object moved against the wind. The object was not a known aircraft because she attitude was too high. The object was astronomical in its size of performance far beyond our present technology. This phenomenon is one of the questions as to the radar set was on high beam and both visual and radar detection occurred.
