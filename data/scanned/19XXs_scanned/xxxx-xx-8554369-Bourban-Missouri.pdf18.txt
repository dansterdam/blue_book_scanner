Dear Congressman Ichord:
Thank you so much for answering my letter. This to my regret would make it hard for me to vote as I believe you do serve what your constituents want. I regret that this Air Force case did not come under your attention. The Air Force did not give me all the facts and then the Air Force closed the case as though it was a hoax. The trouble here is that I don't have the evidence my husband and I should have had if they had investigated this properly. In order to file these things, we had to get a good attorney. The investigator went home when they refused their help, and then the people who had seen the UFO crossed the front of our house. No one will now tell what they saw. I see you have children too and can describe it. I hope you can do something to look into this some more. I realize only one new case believe as this had a program on Channel 11 and that Bureau found that Bourban, Missouri setting on lots of it.
When they are ground saucer back & forth & side to side, then up and down. All the time shooting out this glow and color light, it goes all the different. 
I watched it one night when I couldn't sleep until 2:30 a.m. when it was there at 4:30 and I finally got to sleep.
I have Mr. & Mrs. _ and her 3 children. Mr. & Mrs. _ of St. Louis, Mo. every time they were there then they saw this and the newer man & woman that works in there now, but works in can't see this.
