I. ASTRONOMICAL:
A. A PROBABLE METEORITIC-CAUSE: This could be explained as a meteoritic display - possibly connected with the Draconid meteor shower still going on at this time. The meteoritic particles were probably scattered and disintegrating at high altitudes, accounting for the slow speed and the diffuse appearance of the phenomena.
B. The unusual atmospheric phenomena observed. 
C. It is suggested that this phenomenon was probably no more than a display of atmospheric disturbance caused by meteoritic particles.

II. ANALYSIS:
A. BULLETIN (Information from military-technical Intelligence): The attached photos show the phenomena as observed. No adequate explanation is apparent.
