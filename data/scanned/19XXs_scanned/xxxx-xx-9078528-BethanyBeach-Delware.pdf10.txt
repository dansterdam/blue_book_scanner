There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a form with questions and blank spaces for the respondent to fill out.

As per the request, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   27 day   March   1957

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
