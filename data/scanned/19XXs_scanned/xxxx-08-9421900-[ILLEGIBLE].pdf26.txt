The image contains a photograph of a flying saucer-like object in the sky, with a caption describing it as "Many Amateurs Count Perseid Meteors." The text in the document states that this object was observed by many amateurs during the night of August 11-12, and that it appeared to remain stationary in the sky at times.

MANY AMATEURS COUNT PERSEID METEORS

H 1 itch hourly rates and movements of many meteors during the sights of maximum shower display August 11-12, 1954. Reports of numerous observers, however, indicate that there was a stationary object observed during part of the same period, which was at first mistaken for a Perseid meteor.

Perhaps the most useful find of observers' observation is to count the number of meteors to determine, for distribution, those parts of the sky which supply the most meteors. Afterwards, these counts can be adjusted to give the hourly numbers that the observer would have seen if he had kept observations for the full hour.

The present analysis makes use of the information received concerning a stationary object observed on the same nights which was mistaken for a Perseid meteor by some inexperienced observers. Reports of 52 meteor watchers contained the data needed to derive certain conclusions.
