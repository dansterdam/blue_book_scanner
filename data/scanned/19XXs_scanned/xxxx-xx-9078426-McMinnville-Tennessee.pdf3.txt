Dear Sirs:

Yesterday my Father and I witnessed a phenomenon in the sky slightly after 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 31, 1967, just outside McMinnville, Tenn. My father is a photographer and he immediately took several pictures of this object which hovered very low over a field near our farm.

The object appeared to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, disc-shaped, with a dome on top. Its color appeared to be a metallic silver. It did not have any visible means of propulsion, but was moving, swaying, and somewhat toward the south. It only remained in view for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Had it gone on it would have passed somewhat north of a planet which was visible at the time.

My Father and I returned home immediately and watched it through field glasses, though he saw some reddish color on it. I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding this sighting. Would you also let me know if there was any other sightings in this vicinity that you have on record?

Also, if possible, may I have a copy of the photographs my Father took? At approximately 11:25 p.m. (plus or minus 15 minutes) the light suddenly disappeared, as if turned off. However, my father continued taking pictures for several minutes, as he said he saw that it looked "like at least three portholes or openings in the object."

These things disappeared within approximately 10 minutes.

I would appreciate any information Project Blue Book or some other appropriate agency in the Eastern U.S. could provide regarding this sighting.

Yours truly,
