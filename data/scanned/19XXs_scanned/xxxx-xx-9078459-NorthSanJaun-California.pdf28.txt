Earth Love, Too

Hippies, Hot Dogs
Will Greet Saucer

NORTH SAN JUAN, Nevada Co.--A flying saucer expected to land here tomorrow will be greeted by hippies offering love, hot dogs and possibly a handlull of other people who also believe the tale, have refused to tell exactly when or where the saucer will land, but the fact it will land tonight again.

The "Easterners," they South, said he saw the flying saucer over the town on June 2 and was told it will land tomorrow.

"The scouts have reported some with a handful of other people who also believe the tale, have refused to tell exactly when or where the saucer will land, but the fact it will land tonight again."

One believer, Mrs. John Bernes, said she could not understand why it would not land. "After this, the very existence of some people on the area will be vindicated," she said.

"But they come and go as they wish," she added, without explaining her statement.

According to the "locals" Place," the town's only tavern with dining and plumbing. skeptics gathered and tried to discuss the matter, but the crowd refused to let them.

Occasionally, however, a skeptic weakened. "If they were really there, one asked, "why didn't they get in touch with us?"

The supervisors only meet on Tuesday and their agenda already was full, someone answered.

An unidestified district who now camp in mountains surrounding North San Juan, regard the landing as their "biggest challenge."

"Maybe I'll try to meet it myself," said one member of his hand will be on hand and "praying to offer the saucer people their best wishes."

Although no one has reported seeing a flying saucer, it is supposed to find, Nevada City or Calif. 49 is supposed to land, it will return soon. If it comes, it will return to the hydraulic diggings area.
