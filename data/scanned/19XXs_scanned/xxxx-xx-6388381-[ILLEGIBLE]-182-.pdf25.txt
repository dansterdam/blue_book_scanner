The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document with text describing an observation of an unidentified flying object at Crescent City Light Station in Oregon on October 17, 1948.

The text in the document is as follows:

At about 1810, 17 October, 1948 while at Crescent City Light Station my attention was attracted by the sound of a plane, looking up I saw a silver colored egg shaped object that had the appearance of a small plane traveling south at about 300 miles an hour. No wings or tail structure was visible, no smoke was visible or any noise heard from it. The plane that attracted my attention prior to seeing the silver colored object was a small piper cub type plane. I only glanced up at the object and did not watch to see where it went.
