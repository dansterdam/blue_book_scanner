The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that has instructions on how to draw a picture showing the shape of a UFO phenomenon. The page is mostly blank with some text at the top and bottom, and a hand-drawn arrow and circle shapes in the center of the page.

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN RELATION TO ITS MOTION AND INDICATE EXACTLY AT WHAT POINT IN TIME. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.

15. WHAT WAS IT A REGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP 5'8" - 6'2" TALL. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE AREA OF THE MATCH. HOW WIDE IS YOUR HAND AT THE LITTLE FINGER HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH? ESTIMATE WHAT THE SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON WAS IN RELATION TO THESE ITEMS.
