MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 22 Sep 69

1. On 22 Sep 69, the Aerial Phenomena Office received a telephone call from a citizen reporting a UFO observation in the sky over Cleveland, Ohio, altitude 1500-2000 feet, at a 7:50 angle. The observer saw the object for 1-1/2 minutes. The object came towards her but then turned and flew off into the east. The sky was clear; the object was a silvery-white color, and was almost circular in shape. This is a summarized version of the report.

2. The observer stated she is a frequent observer of strange flying objects. She has seen them with her at all times so she is quite certain that what she observed was an unidentified flying object. She usually reports these objects when she sees them, but she didn't report this one until now because she didn't want to be confused with a person who sees strange things all the time. Nonetheless, she felt it was her duty to report this sighting.

3. (Name redacted) stated that she saw another UFO about 2 weeks ago, but she didn't report it. She asked for the number to which she could report any future sightings, and was given the information.
