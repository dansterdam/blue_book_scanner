1. Our office has received a report of an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation from the Cedar City, Missouri area. Initial investigation indicates that this report is regarding an unusual sky phenomenon that could have been observed in the area at the time of the sighting. The witness reported a blue-white object that traveled to the northeast. Smaller vehicles dropped and took off from the larger vehicle at a great speed during the observation.

2. Any information you could provide as to a possible cause for this 17 April 1967 sighting would be appreciated. Possibly persons at the airport tower observed the same or similar UFO.
