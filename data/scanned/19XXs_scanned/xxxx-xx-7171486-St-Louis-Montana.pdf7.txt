2. WHAT DID THE PHENOMENON APPEAR TO BE? (Give best description, e.g. round, cylindrical, disc-shaped, etc.) IT CAME OUT OF THE NORTH, IT SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AS IT CAME TOWARD US, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BIG SKY ROCKET, BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR AND MOVED VERY FAST. FIRST SAW IT UP HIGH, LIKE A HIGH FLYING AIRCRAFT, MAYBE 6000 FT IT THEN SEEMED TO LOSE ALTITUDE AND SWOOP DOWN VERY FAST UNTIL IT WAS JUST ABOUT AS HIGH AS OUR HOUSE, MAYBE 200 FT. IT CAME IN FAST AND SEEMED TO CHANGE SHAPE A LITTLE WHILE IT WAS DESCENDING, WHEN IT GOT OVER OUR HOUSE IT APPEARED TO BE ROUND OR OBLONG IN SHAPE. JUST AS SUDDENLY AS IT APPEARED IT SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN AND THEN TAKE OFF AGAIN AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED TOWARD THE NORTHWEST, AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.
