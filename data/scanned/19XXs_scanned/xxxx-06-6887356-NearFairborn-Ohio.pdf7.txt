THE SUN POST ITS SPOTS

It mentions that a group of objects were observed at around sunrise on February 25, 1952, near Fairborn, Ohio. The objects were described as disc-shaped and appeared to shrink and disappear. One of the largest groups ever recorded (Fig. 10-5) appeared early in the morning and lasted until around 8 a.m. The text provides a detailed description of the observed phenomena.
