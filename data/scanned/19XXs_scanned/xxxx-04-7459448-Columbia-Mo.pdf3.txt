i. Preparing Officer: 2Lt SAJ, MARTIN, JR., Assistant Ground Training Officer, Sgt Maj, USAF. Wilkerson APB, Inc, 65-1011. He Roland has more than average knowledge and experience in photographing celestial and identifying them. After viewing the object and obtaining a photographic record, he concluded that the object could be best describe as a lenticular cloud. He has had a careful instruction for over twenty years. After viewing the object, he made a written analysis of the sighting, enclosed herein, and expressed himself in a very rational manner. He seemed to think the object could have been a synchomized satellite (report to be forwarded by SPATAS). I found him to be an intelligent and reliable person, whose observation is worthy of further investigation.
