Incident No. 122 - 15 Oct. 1948, 2205 hours, Fukoka area, Japan.

Air force radar observer at 5,251 attempted six times to intercept an object between 25,000-30,000 ft. The object traveled 220-260 mph, approached to within 12,000 ft., then quickly accelerated to an estimated 1200-1500 mph. Slowed down to about 800-900 mph for a short time, then sped up again, traveling away at a tremendous speed. The object was round, about 40-50 ft. in diameter, with "tail" shapes cut off sharply at rear.

ADC Opinions: There is no parent explanation. Gas discharge phenomenon operating and had the F-51 in sight throughout the period of sighting.
