Dear First:
On Dec 6, 1952 at 7:15 p.m. P.S.T. I saw a formation of flying objects. There seemed to be nine objects moving in a formation. They were white and glowing. The objects appeared to be coming from the San Francisco area. At the mid point of the sighting, when they were overhead, the objects were obscured and could not be seen for a short time, perhaps two and three. After turning they performed the flight in the reverse order, appeared, and then disappeared. The objects flowed white but appeared distorted. They seemed to be over two miles altitude, and moving at a tremendous speed. They vanished and reappeared. The night was clear, except for some haze around the city. The objects made no sound. I have heard that a persons mental state, according to startled but serious.
