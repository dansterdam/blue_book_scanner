MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: UFO Observation, 2 Apr 63
Mrs. called the Aerial Phenomena Office on 3 April 1963 to report her observation of 2 April.
Mrs. ___
Neville, Ohio 45156
Neville-Penn School House Road
TIME: 2 Apr 63, 2015 local
DURATION: Three (3) minutes
COURSE: Hovering, then easterly
General comments: Mrs. was in her car driving towards Neville. They live in the River Hills (near Ohio River) and the object appeared to be hovering over the Neville hill. She was approximately twelve miles from North Richmond, Ohio when she saw the object. It seemed to be approximately 15-18 inches in diameter and was red in color. It made no sound. After several minutes the object moved in an easterly direction, behind some hills for two minutes. The lights were red, blinking and she couldn't tell what the object was connected to. The center area was not shiny or any thing like that. It reminded her of the big dipper for it seemed like there were three main lights in a series. Then it had four bottom lights randomly spaced and they did not blink on and off in a series but just blinked.
Mrs. said she would complete and return an AF Form 117.
