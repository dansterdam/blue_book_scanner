This object was slightly obscured at times by clouds, but could still be seen clearly for the greatest part of the time. The color seemed to be a golden white, but hard to say as the light seemed brighter than a star. The object appeared to be moving at a terrific speed, and would appear and disappear through the clouds, and there was no sound.
