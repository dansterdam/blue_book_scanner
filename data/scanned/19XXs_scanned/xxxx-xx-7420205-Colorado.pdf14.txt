1. Reference your letter, 9 Oct 67, subject: UFO Observation, 
21 Aug 67:
    a. The size and shape of the object plus the puffy exhaust trail eliminated the possibility of normal aircraft. The object's maneuvers and control attitudes were on local transition missions and not on high flight levels.
    b. Denver ARTCC had no known flight plans of aircraft.
    c. The radar site at Greeley, Colorado, and Denver ARTCC had no unusual traffic on their scopes at the time of the sighting.
2. As stated in the above referenced message, the cause of the sighting is unknown.
