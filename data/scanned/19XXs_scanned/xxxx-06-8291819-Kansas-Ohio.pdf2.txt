35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
The object appeared suddenly from nowhere, above and ahead of my auto. My first impressions was that I was being buzzed by a private plane. On my second look at the object, it appeared to hover at high speed over a farmer's buildings, and as I pulled over to the side of the road to view it, it immediately flew away on a low-level course.
There was no sound, and it was as long as a Commercial Airliner, and had no markings. I did not see an underneath cop, or end view of the object. My body reacted as if I had just experienced a "close shave" with danger. The remainder of the day I was somewhat emotionally upset. I queried the farmer and his wife, who live very close to the place of the sighting, as to whether they had heard anything unusual that morning near their farm, and they said that they had not. I told my experience to my family a few hours after it happened.
