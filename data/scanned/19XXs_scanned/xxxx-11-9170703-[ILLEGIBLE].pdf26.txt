Dear Hector:

Pardon me for the enormous delay in responding to your letter of December 19, asking about the test of soil samples and photographs of the area in which an observation occurred near Duluth on November 15. We have arranged to do all of the testing of samples at one time - which is about now - so we haven't done anything yet on the samples. As soon as we have results, we'll send them along to you, together with copies of the photographs as you requested.

I must say that the soil samples don't look like much. In the first place, it would be totally impossible to do compaction tests, because the samples would consist of what is essentially a battle of non-adhering dust particles. The notion of compaction in that sense doesn't seem to apply at all, though we'll try to see if there seems to be any reason to press on with anything more elaborate.

Best wishes.

Sincerely yours,
