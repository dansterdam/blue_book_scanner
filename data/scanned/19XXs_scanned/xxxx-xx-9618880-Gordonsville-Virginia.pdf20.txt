The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report with handwritten text and redacted personal information.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract all the text from the document:

Since about 10 o'clock had seen the object and that on Sunday morning he decided to get up closer and get a better look at it. He said it was very strange and odd looking and that he could hardly believe his eyes, that he did not know what it was and he at once called his wife to take a look at it too, as he was just as much surprised as was she and that they both stood and looked at it for quite some time wondering what it could possibly be and whether we would be interested in knowing about it for that we call.
