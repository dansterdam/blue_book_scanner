I realized at this time that it did not look like any type aircraft I was familiar with, so I immediately contacted my Ground Control Station and asked for information regarding any aircraft flying in the area. The Ground Control Station informed me there were no other aircraft in the area. I informed them what I had seen and was in contact with them from then on.

4. The fourth target passed directly over my ship from stern to bow at a speed of roughly twice that of my aircraft, 200 mph. I caught just a fleeting glance of the aircraft; just enough to know he had passed me. The fifth and sixth targets were attempted radar interceptions, but their high rate of speed put them immediately out of our range.

5. The only aircraft I can compare our targets to is the German ME-163. It was not a ME-262 or similar jet. I base this on my combat experience against ME-262's over Germany in 1945. At that time I was a B-17 pilot, with the 303rd Bomb Group (H) Station 141th, 8th Air Force. My total flying time is 900 hours of which 350 hours is combat time.
