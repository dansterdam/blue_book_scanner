The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document is as follows:

How a "regular type" could be propelled at apparently high speed. The dot formed was thin like a thin wire and as this outline approached our locality. (This beams sighting, as minor as it leaves us, occurred on 12-26-52 and comments on persons sighted during the same week.)

Our information was not made to the news, for the reason that the publicity involved.

We think this information might be of interest to your official criticism. We have no design on publicity whatsoever, and wish to remain anonymous. What should be done about this rather fantastic sighting of a craft type in final form? If it is of formal sighting, it can be informed as believing the U.S. Air Force should be informed, so in this, our only concern.

Sincerely,
