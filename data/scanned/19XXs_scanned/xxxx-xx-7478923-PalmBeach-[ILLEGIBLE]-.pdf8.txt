UNCLASSIFIED
27 July 1952
PERMANENT FILE
Place: Palm Beach, Florida
Date: 15 July 1952
Time: 10.30 PM  
I was standing outside my home when I observed an object that was glowing or emitting a bright light. This object was traveling at a high rate of speed and appeared to be oval or round in shape. As it came closer I could make out the outline of a saucer-shaped object with a dome on the top. It traveled in a straight line and seemed to have a slight up and down motion as it traveled. The object gave off a slight glow but I could not distinguish any details or markings on it. It passed over my head and continued in a southerly direction. There were no sounds coming from the object. It disappeared from my sight shortly after passing over my house. I do not know the altitude or the size of this object but I can say that it was higher than the tallest palm trees in my neighborhood and appeared to be about the size of a medium-sized aircraft when it was passing over. After the object had passed over I could still see a slight glow in the sky in the direction it had taken.
