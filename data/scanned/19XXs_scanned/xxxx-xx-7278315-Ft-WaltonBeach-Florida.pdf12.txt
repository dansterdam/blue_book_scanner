31. 10 July 1967, Azalea, Mississippi.
See attached supplemental sheet D.

32. 11 July 1967, Macon, Georgia.
Temporarily misplaced. Check to see whether this has any relation to the sighting the previous day in Azalea, Mississippi.

33. 25 July 1967, Manchester, New Hampshire
The only Manchester, New Hampshire case I have is a different date.

34. 12 October 1967, Ocaloosa County, Florida.
Although this had four witnesses, the data are very poor. A balloon is ruled out because of wind at all levels. The night time observation, went from north to south horizon in three minutes. Anyone of the evaluations: (1) insufficient data (2) probable aircraft (3) possible.

35. 31 October 1967, Denver, Colorado.
Do not have in my files. Will do in Dayton.
