1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report concerning an observation made on 19 July 1953.

2. The observer sighted an object that had numerous orange-ish lights attached, which seemed to flicker and move about. The object was first seen in the distance and seemed to be going back and forth between a tree line. The observer stated that she heard a slight motor.

3. The description is very similar to that of an aircraft; however, we do not know of any in your area. 

4. Did you receive any reports of unusual objects for this date? If so, I would appreciate your comments as to a possible cause for this sighting.
