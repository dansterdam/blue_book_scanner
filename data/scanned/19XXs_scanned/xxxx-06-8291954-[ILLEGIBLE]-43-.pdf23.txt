Dear Sirs:
During the months following my UFO sighting of this past summer (Aug. 2, Mount Vernon Victory, ON 17:25 hrs) I have taken in the belief that the incident of UFO sighting was rather extraordinary, and seems to be true.
Enclosing a self-addressed card. Would you reveal to me the official investigation under which this report was submitted.
Many thanks,
