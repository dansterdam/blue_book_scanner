There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document, with handwritten text and a black brushstroke drawing that appears to be the respondent's attempt at depicting what they saw.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

I recall that t what I saw was not a plane or cloud or storm, and not a weather balloon.
