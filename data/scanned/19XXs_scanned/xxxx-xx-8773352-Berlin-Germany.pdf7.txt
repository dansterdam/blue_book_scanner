The image does not contain any photographs, but it does contain handwritten text. I will proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the image.

Here is the text output from the OCR:

"There is so much an amount that I, Swill, want to accept it, and if it is not, Swill not even disclose the aerial phenomena contained. I believe I should be offered the cost price of one of the U.S. air force's largest bombers but I would accept an offer for less.

While you let me hear from you as soon as possible.

Sincerely yours"
