U'ORUto ZONING BOARD FOR BELLEFONTAINE, OHIO
WITNESS: Joseph Paul
ADDRESS: Bellefontaine, Ohio
STATEMENT: I, Joseph Paul, was driving from Bellefontaine to Urbana, Ohio at approximately 8:45 PM on November 16, 1952 when I observed an unusual object in the sky. It appeared to be about 100 yards in diameter and was hovering over the road about 20 feet off the ground. It had a red light on the bottom and a blue light on top, and gave off a slight humming noise. I watched it for about 5 minutes before it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from sight at a very high rate of speed. I immediately reported what I had seen to the local police department.
