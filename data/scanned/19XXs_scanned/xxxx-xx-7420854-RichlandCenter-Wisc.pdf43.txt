The image contains a diagram with instructions for visually estimating the altitude and size of observed UFOs. The diagram includes a compass with a central point labeled "Object" and concentric circles labeled with angles to help determine the elevation of the object relative to the observer. There is also a section prompting the observer to draw a picture showing the motion and direction of the object or objects observed.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass rose to show what direction the object was traveling.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

OBJECT FOLLOWED PATH THRU 30 SECONDS WITH VARIATION

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
