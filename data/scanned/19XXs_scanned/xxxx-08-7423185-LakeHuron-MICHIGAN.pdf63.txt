The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions related to reporting unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings. The diagram appears to be part of an official U.S. Air Force document, providing instructions on how to describe the observed motion and direction of UFOs. There is also a section where the observer can draw a sketch to illustrate the sighting.

The text in the document reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object(s) appeared above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
