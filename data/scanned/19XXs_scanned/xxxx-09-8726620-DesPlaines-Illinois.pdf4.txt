I'm instincI Ively cautious and conservative so I may be underestimating the speed and distance it was othe rwise I would say it was traveling approxamitely 800 to 1000 mph and was about 3 to 4 miles away. It was a very brief sighting as I caught it out of the corner of my eye and it disappeared instantly.
