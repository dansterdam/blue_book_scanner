A peculiar incident occurred in the early part of the morning hours of April 9, 1957, when I was awakened by a brilliant light shining through my bedroom window. Upon investigation, I observed a brilliant bluish-white light hovering over a pasture in the distance, approximately a quarter to half a mile away. The light seemed to be about the size of a small automobile and was hovering silently about 30 to 40 feet above the ground. It remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly darted away at a very high rate of speed, making an abrupt 90-degree turn and disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. The following morning, I went to the area where I had seen the light and found that the grass in a circular area about 30 feet in diameter was flattened, as if something heavy had been resting there.
