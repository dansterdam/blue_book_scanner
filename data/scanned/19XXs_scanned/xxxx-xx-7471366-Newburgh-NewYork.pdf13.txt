The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document.

J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon release in the area which might reasonably account for the sighting: There was operation reports no traffic or balloon REASON or KNGON reports no traffic.

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer: John F. Brooks, Captain.

With the existing information, I cannot make a judgement on what these people saw. Their home is nearby under the final approach for Runway 27 at Stewart AFB and their descriptions sound like aircraft in a landing configuration with landing lights on. The family is convinced that they did not see an aircraft and there was no time and duration is questionable. If it is unreliable, then a landing aircraft becomes a possibility.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs: Attached is a narrative written by daughter of blank also included are her drawings.
