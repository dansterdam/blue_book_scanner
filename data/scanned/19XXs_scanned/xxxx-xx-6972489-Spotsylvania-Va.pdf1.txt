Observed an object that darted like a bird at high altitude. The object appeared to be the size of a small dog or house. The object disappeared at the top with a slight flick of motion. Several persons on the scene state that it looked similar to a bird except no wings could be seen further stating that the object was quite slow in motion and darted up and down the steps. The witness states that "I went up the steps and to the ground still watching what I thought was a new object. I thought it might be a bird under unusual conditions."
