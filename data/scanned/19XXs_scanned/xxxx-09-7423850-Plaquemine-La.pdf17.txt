P NRS One Polaroid 'Swinger' print and corresponding negative.
1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-120 submitted by Major Goldfein, requesting photo analysis on a Polaroid photograph purported to contain a unidentified flying object photographed on 3 September 1967, at Plaquemine, Louisiana.
2. ANALYSIS: Analysis of the photograph showed the unidentified image to be generally elongated in shape and positioned at the approximate center of the frame format. It was noted that the unidentified image, a portion of a building roof and foliage in the foreground, exhibited some indistinct detail as illuminated by the Polaroid camera. This condition resulted in the overexposure of the Polaroid Swinger camera. The source stated that the object had a "fast forward speed" but, if this statement is true, the photography indicates the camera, and the object recorded, were not traveling at a high enough speed to stop motion, the photography indicates the camera, and the object recorded, were not traveling at a high enough speed to stop motion.
