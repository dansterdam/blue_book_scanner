The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

UPI printed them they would then give the boys a $2000.00 check. The boys handed them over asking what would be done with them. Mr. [REDACTED] said they would be subjected to photo analysis before printing. The [REDACTED] then returned the check and took back the negatives. 

11. The extreme interest Tony has in Science and his recent interest in the subject of UFO's.

FINAL CONCLUSION
I believe that the whole story is a complete hoax. The pictures were taken at close range of an upside-down cup or bowl over an upside-down saucer. (There seems to be a shadow on the top of the "UFO" which might be the printing which appears on the bottom of cups.) The story was all thought up in an attempt to get money out of the press from the publicity. The above is my own conclusion from the investigation and should not distort any further investigations.
