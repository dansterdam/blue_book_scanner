WEEKLY SERIES MAY 19-25, 1969
This report is for the period of May 19-25, 1969. The facts presented and the views expressed herein are those of the Weather Bureau and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Department of Commerce or any other Government agency.
Major Synoptic Features:
The general circulation over the country during this period was dominated by an upper level high pressure system centered over the central Great Plains. This system, which developed early in the period, produced clear skies over most of the central and eastern regions. As the high pressure ridge spread eastward, temperatures gradually increased, reaching near normal or slightly above normal levels by the end of the period. Maximum temperatures during the last few days ranged from the 70's over the northern states to the 80's and 90's over the southern states.
Precipitation was generally light over most of the country, with only scattered showers and thunderstorms occurring, mostly in the southern states. The only significant rainfall occurred in portions of the Southeast, where totals of 1 to 2 inches were recorded.
Severe Weather: 
There were no major severe weather outbreaks reported during the period. A few thunderstorms produced locally heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and hail in some areas, but no widespread damaging storms occurred.
