"Shreveport, La.

Major H.Quintilla, 
Vice Patterson A.F.B.
Dayton,Ohio

Sir:
On the subject of "U.F.O." sightings where the object "disappeared" I believe the "U.F.O." goes into another dimension. I am 14 and sighted an object May 31 1957. The object hovered over Ridgewood Jr. High School. It appeared to go into a light brighter than sunlight and then it just disappeared over Ridgewood Jr. High School.

Sincerely yours,

[Redacted]
Shreveport, La."
