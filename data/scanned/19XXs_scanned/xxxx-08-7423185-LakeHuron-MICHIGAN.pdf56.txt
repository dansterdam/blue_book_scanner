The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a UFO photograph. The photograph is mentioned in the text, which indicates that it was analyzed by photo experts at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. However, the image is not included in this particular document page.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

DEC 2 0 1967

TDPT/UPO Maj H Quintanilla, Jr/70916/lab/19 Dec 67

UFO Photograph, 19 August 1967

Beaumont, Texas 77704

1. This replies to your letter of September 2, 1967 in which you indicated a photograph of an unidentified object. Your photograph has been analyzed by photo experts at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio with the following results:

a. Lack of image definition precludes identification of this image as a definitive object.

b. Examination of the print reveals that the upper left corner is not sharply defined while the other three corners are sharp. The pattern at this corner indicates a possible irregularity in the processing of the print in this area and could cause the "halo" image seen on this print.

2. No further analysis will be attempted since you did not observe an object. 

3. The enclosed information on the Air Force project on UFOs may be of interest to you. Your photograph with one enlargement is enclosed. Thank you for sending your photograph to the Air Force for analysis.
