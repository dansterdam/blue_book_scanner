IN REPLY
REFER TO:

December 20, 1967

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr. 
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office

Dear Sir:

Reference your letter dated December 13, 1967 regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Ardmore, Tennessee.

Ardmore is located approximately 22 miles, 345 degrees from the Huntsville Airport traffic control tower, which opened October 29, 1967. Unless an incident out of the ordinary occurred, we could not have observed this traffic.

Huntsville Airport Traffic Control towers did not observe this aircraft, nor was a similar object reported to this office.

A similar object was observed by citizens in the Huntsville and Nashville, Tennessee areas approximately five miles east of Ardmore. Although identified as a star or planet, weather conditions were poor, resulting in an unusual appearance as the object fluctuated in brightness and color, and would periodically be obscured from view.

On the dates in question, although not heavily traveled, these routes were begun October 29, 1967, and may have seen a relatively low ceiling.

In the event that it might assist your investigation, Huntsville Airport weather on November 7, 1967 at 3:54 pm CST was: Visibility more than fifteen miles, temperature 54, dew point 25, and 270 degrees at seven knots.

Sincerely,

John E. Harrison, Jr.
Chief, ACC
