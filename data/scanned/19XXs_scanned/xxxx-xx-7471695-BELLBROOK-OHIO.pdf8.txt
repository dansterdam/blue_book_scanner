Transcribed text:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Seemed bright-then faded out and disappeared quite rapidly. I could not identify as to distance or size.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes  No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound More
b. Color Bright white light

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Could not judge size or distance, varied in appearance.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. Roughly sketched, and more circular, the lights seemed to be circulating there was no protusion noted. Just a bright circular light.
