The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

Probable Appr. (MARS)

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer apparently sighted a light in the SE that was changing between red and green observed it for 45 to 55 minutes before the clouds obscured it. COMMENT: The observer was requested to complete an AF Form 117. This has not been returned as of 30 Jul 59. Witness was apparently in a rather excited state when making the report. The observer's estimate of 153 degrees at the end of the sighting. At this time of year, Mars had a telling resemblance of 1.9.
