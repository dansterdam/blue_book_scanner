Barrow-in-Furness
Finally, we read in the 'Flying Saucer Review' that on August 21 last there were in one week residents of the Barrow-in-Furness district of Cumbria, who claim to have witnessed the passage of strange sky objects at variable intervals. During some periods as many as three appeared at a time.

A Mr. R. Scott, of Barrow-in-Furness, says, that on the evening of Tuesday, August 24, he and some others of his family commune together, and separating as they flew about... from time to time they would come and tell, 'Here they are again!' These things were moving about, making one wonder. I watched them until they disappeared, as if they were homing in on some call for a purpose before they departed.
