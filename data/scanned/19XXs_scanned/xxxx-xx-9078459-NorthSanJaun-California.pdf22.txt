The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document containing text describing a UFO sighting investigation.

The text from the document is as follows:

The following is the follow-up report completing my investigation of the recent UFO sightings in N. San Juan, Calif., on 1 June 1967.

The attached newspaper articles are an example of the extensive coverage given this "sighting". By reading over the articles, you can see the many inconsistencies in the boys' story.  

I will supplement the attached articles with the developments in the local area.

June 16 was the last day of events I included in the last report. As you can see in the paper articles, the "return of the Centurians" received a lot of publicity. The news on TV covered this subject and displayed the prints over again the next day. The UFO never did return although many people did show up for the "event".

The TV continued to report that the pictures seemed to be authentic although there were many inconsistencies, E.G., distances, terrain, objects in the pictures, and where the pictures were taken.

On 17 June, I contacted the base and tried to get some information out of us. We revealed only what had been told before and also talked about the UFO Conference in Boulder, Colo. He called Dr. Saunders on the same day and asked many questions. The article resulting from this telephonic conversation appeared in the 20 June edition.

I contacted Dr. Saunders the next day and, after reading the article to him, found out that he was severely misquoted.
