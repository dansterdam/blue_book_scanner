26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. 
It seemed unusually green (op tinman) thinish triangular shaped object which had some strange light running along the outer edges and emitting a red glow from the center of the object. The object seemed to be about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile away and moving slowly from the northeast to the southwest almost directly overhead at an altitude of perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 feet. It was not an airplane, satellite, meteor or any other known object that I am familiar with. The object seemed to disappear into the distance and I lost sight of it after 2 to 3 minutes.
