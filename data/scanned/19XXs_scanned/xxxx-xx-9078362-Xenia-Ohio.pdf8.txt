There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 22 Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The red and green lights which caused the sighting were about the size of a basketball, but much brighter. They came from the east and moved down at a 45 degree angle for about 1 minute, then moved back up at the same angle and disappeared. They moved in a jerky fashion, stopping and starting and changing direction erratically.  

At the time the white steady light appeared, it seemed to be the size of a basketball and appeared to be hovering or moving slowly. The area of the object took up less than the diameter of a pencil held at arm's length. The light fluctuated in intensity several times and then disappeared.

This is the only thing which I saw. It did not throw any light down and was not connected to anything else that I could see. When it disappeared, there was no trail or flash, it just went out.  I have no idea what it was.
