I was walking in a secluded spot from Phila. to the railroad, the bushes the weeds and some trees were obscuring my vision, when about 20 miles S.E. of Chka., I saw following my eyes westward suddenly an object hovering over the trees, shiny, silver colored, shaped like a flat saucer with a dome on top. It was bright, metallic and Glistening and was something I've never seen before. Its silent hovering flight, suddenly the speed increased and it went out of sight in a second, leaving no trail behind. It was about the size of a car wheel or a little larger. I was definitely startled and could not believe what I saw. They were very significant and strange. I saw nothing else unusual in the sky or anywhere else.
