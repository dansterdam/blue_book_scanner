There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing descriptive text without any visual elements.

As an OCR system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

A bright samlight group. The direction of the sun's position is shown by the shadow as it falls in the lower foreground. The relative motion is one of the salient features of about it's own characteristics. 

10-5. The sun's position is shown by the gradual movement of the shadow as time goes on. This gives some idea as to the position of the object, etc. It became apparent that this was not the usual case of an observation of blinking lights where the object did not move in any direction. The object therefore changed its position appreciably with respect to the observer and this was continuous movement over a period of at least two weeks as the object was under observation. The final disappearance of the sun occurred in late August and became more southerly and upward in a more westerly direction each day, until finally it was lost to sight in September. The movement of the object under observation was direct upward movement toward a point in the heavens midway between Polaris and Vega.
