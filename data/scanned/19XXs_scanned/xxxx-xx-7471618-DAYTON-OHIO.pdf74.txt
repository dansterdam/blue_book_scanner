The city was relatively quiet with normal traffic flow. I had been out for a walk when I observed a round, glowing object in the sky above the city. It appeared to be stationary at first, then it suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly out of sight. There was no sound associated with the object. I was unable to determine its precise size or distance, but it seemed to be approximately 1/2 to 1 mile away. The object was round in shape and glowed with an orange-reddish color. It remained in view for only a brief period, perhaps 30 seconds, before rapidly disappearing.
