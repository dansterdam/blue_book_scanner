Transcribed text from the document:

Subjects: Unidentified Aerial Objects, over Glendale, California, California, 9 December 1952, 1500 hours.

The spheres appeared to be cruising at about 200 miles per hour, in size from 1 foot could not make a careful or precise estimate of their altitude or else it is impossible to determine that information. The objects appeared to be solid spheres. This sighting was corroborated by an aircraft inspector and another man, both of whom were on the ground at the time and reported the same sighting independently.

They did not see them again. I immediately reported the sighting to the Wright-Patterson Air Force at once. I am taking the liberty of making this full written report to your headquarters for your information and records. 

It was impossible for these spheres to have been weather balloons. I have seen weather balloons, meteors, countless numbers of aircraft, and numerous other strange meteorological phenomena, and this is not in any way comparable to any of these. There is no question but that they were intelligently controlled craft, either maneuverable, or going away, and returning again, at will, while maintaining constant temperature, judging from their lack of any temperature change or distortion as they moved.

ACTIONS: This incident is being made a matter of record and furnished your headquarters for your information.
