Dear Sir,

On August 16, 1961 at about 11:00 p.m. I was sitting in my friend's car when we noticed a strange light going across the sky. An intense green flash suddenly appeared and then two smaller flashes. The object then seemed to come to a stop. It was the size of a large plane but had no visible wings or tail fins. It made no sound. The bottom of the object was lit up with a bright light. We looked at it for about a minute and then it suddenly sped off at an incredible speed and disappeared.
