The image appears to contain a sketch and a compass rose. The sketch shows the trajectory of an observed object, with various angles and measurements labeled. The compass rose in the bottom right corner of the image provides a visual reference for the directional information.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you see the object shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the horizon (skyline) where you feel the object was in relation to it. Place a "C" on the compass at the direction you feel the object was traveling.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
