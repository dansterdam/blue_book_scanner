Dear Sir: 

I regret the delay in sending you additional information, while the sighting of the object by me was not captured. The sighting was good and clear. The object seemed to be of a metallic nature, somewhat elliptical in shape and emitting a bright glow from the right side to the left. It hovered for a few seconds and then accelerated at a rapid speed to the north.  

We are encouraged to let the project know of any sightings so that they may be properly evaluated. Your reply and assistance will be appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
