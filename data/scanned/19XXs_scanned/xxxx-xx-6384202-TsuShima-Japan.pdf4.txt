Comments of Approving Officers:
The size and the speed of the object, the azimuth of the planet "Mars" was about 255 degrees and the elevation at 1900 hours local time was about 10o. The downward movement of the object as described by observers is believed to have been due to slight refraction due to the low angle of elevation. With the sun just below the horizon, conditions would be ideal for the appearance of Mars as described.
