35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

First sighted the bright light high and above and ahead of the car. As we approached the object, it appeared stationary, then began moving low and slow east on the horizon. Then it seemed to disappear. When a fewseconds later it reappeared to the west of our moving car. It would disappear and reappear several times at intervals, and was observed rather particularly, as nothing like this had ever been seen before. They were rather frightened. Then they noticed that whenever it disappeared, it would appear to the other side and it appeared to follow them.

Eventually it disappeared.
