5. A HAND-DRAWN MAP WHERE YOU WERE STANDING WHEN FIRST SIGHTING THE OBJECT IS ATTACHED. THIS SHOULD SHOW THE DIRECTION AND ELEVATION OF THE OBJECT AS WELL AS SURROUNDING LANDMARKS. DESCRIBE THE OBJECT FULLY GIVING SIZE, SHAPE, COLOR, BRIGHTNESS, SPEED OF MOVEMENT AND DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. REMEMBER, THIS INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS INVESTIGATION.

The object was shaped like an elongated oval, about 85-95 feet wide and 18-20 feet thick at center. It was flying at about 1800-2000 feet altitude, moving in an east-west direction at an estimated speed of 350-550 mph. The color was a dull gray-silver and the object made no sound. It appeared hovering or gliding silently through the sky as we watched it go by. At one point, it suddenly stopped moving and reversed direction, then resumed its east-west course. I made a sketch showing the trajectory and dimensions.

6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN X ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW WHERE THE OBJECT FIRST CAME INTO VIEW. PLACE A B TO SHOW WHERE THE OBJECT LAST WENT OUT OF VIEW.

The sketch shows a curved line representing the trajectory of the object, with an X marking where it first came into view and a B marking where it last went out of view.
