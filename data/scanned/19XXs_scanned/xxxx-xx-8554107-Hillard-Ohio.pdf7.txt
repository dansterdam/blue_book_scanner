The image contains two sketches of unidentified flying objects. The text appears to be a handwritten narrative describing the drawings.

As an OCR system, the text transcribed from the document is:

Am in the area and have been investigating the sightings reported by the persons calling this office. The witnesses are reliable persons and their accounts are consistent.

Picture A-1. The craft was estimated to be about 60 feet in diameter. It appeared to be circular in shape, with a dome on top and lights around the perimeter. The object was observed to hover and then accelerate at a high rate of speed and disappear.

Picture A-2. This craft was estimated to be about 35 feet long. It appeared to be cigar-shaped, with a series of lights along the side. The object was observed to hover and then accelerate at a high rate of speed and disappear.

The witnesses were credible and their descriptions of the objects were consistent. I will continue to investigate this incident and any additional sightings in the area.
