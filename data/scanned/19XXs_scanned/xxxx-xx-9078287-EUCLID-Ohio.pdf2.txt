Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter to inform you of a sighting that I and 13 other people saw while in school yesterday. I'm a teacher and the people I listed on the attachment are in my class with the remaining one in a class on the floor below mine.

My name is: [REDACTED] 
Address: Shaker Heights, Ohio 44120

I was in Room 211 of Euclid Senior High School.

Euclid, Ohio 44123
At the time of the sighting, this room is in the main part of the building that faces East 222nd Street and is situated parallel (running North and South) to East 222nd Street.

The date of the sighting was May 4, 1967 at 12:13 P.M. (Daylight Savings Time). The object was motionless from the North and hovered to the South - southeast.

It was approximately 70 feet from the ground and appeared at a distance of about 250 yards from the window in my classroom. 

We viewed the object for a total time of about 23 seconds. We then proceeded to leave the room and go outside and when we returned the object-of-vision was gone.

I do not hear any sound or see any flashing lights on the object. It was about one-half a surf-board or the size of a dill pickle. It was apparently the same as a full moon in width, a skill man in height, and remained stationary in the air the full time it was seen. It did not leave any trail and it did not explore. It was misty and luminous.

Its condition of the sky was clear and a normal mid-day blue. There was no rain and it was a most clear day.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
