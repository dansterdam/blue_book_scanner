Dear XXXXX,

This will reply to your letter of October 11 in which you described your observations of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Many details necessary to positive identification of the sightings now missing, and without further information, identification would be virtually impossible. If you care to complete the attached questionnaire, and submit it with any additional information, identification can be attempted.

In the meantime, we are enclosing a copy of our latest project blue book report which may help you in identifying what you saw.

Sincerely,
DAVID L. STILES, Major, USAF
Acting Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information
