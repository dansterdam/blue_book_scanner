The image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which is a historical U.S. government program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

Transcribed text from the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME TURN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE POSITION OR DIRECTION?
FLASHING OR STEADY?
GLOW, HALO, OR FUZZY?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SOUNDS LIKE JET?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
WHY DID YOU ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

A COUPLE OF FLASHES LOOKED LIKE IT THEN WE TOOK ERUP
AND SAW IT AGAIN IT WAS REAL BRIGHTLY

HOW LONG DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

MARKED DIFFERENCE AND DISAPPEAR-ED FO MOMENT OR SO

THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
