Dear Sirs,

The object was seen for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing. Several witnesses reported that the object appeared to fade in and out and also changed direction several times. No noise was reported associated with the object. The witnesses included a number of reliable individuals including a government official and two professional people. Weather conditions at the time were clear and no unusual weather phenomena were reported.
