A group of unidentified aerial objects was sighted at 2030 hours MST on 16 Jun 52 about 1 mile south of Walker AFB, Roswell, New Mexico. The objects were of a circular hue and their size was estimated to be about 5,000 feet. The objects traveled in a zig-zag pattern at a high rate of speed. The estimated speed was between 500 and 600 miles per hour. They were observed from a point about a mile south of Walker AFB until they disappeared from sight.

This sighting is similar to those reported in the press and other publications. Although the objects were viewed for only a short period of time, the reliability to the observer is quite apparent due to the probability of the sighting.
