The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book document.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Wichita, Kansas 672100

I seen very clearly the entire matter of your letter on the film, which was submitted to the development. The description of it is correct.

I am attaching a copy of a letter I received from the Special Investigations Branch of the Air Force on this matter. This contains the additional information and have had this furnished to you with a request that it be returned to me at an earlier date of 12 September 1957 that he was also questioned to your letter that I to you and to the Air Force to make several calls to your office by telephone and the information was given to know.

As you can see from this letter, your friend's story seems to be so clear and distinct return. Perhaps he is not aware that actually the film showing the matter that was submitted and that they may have been some other interest or persons who claimed in their letter that they might do something on the person.
