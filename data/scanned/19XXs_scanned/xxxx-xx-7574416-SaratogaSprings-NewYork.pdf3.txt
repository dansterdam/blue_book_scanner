Saratoga Springs, N. Y.

Dear Sir:

I would like to report a sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object. It was sighted at approximately 9:20 P.M. EDT, on June 21, 1967.

It was a night approximately five minutes. There was a bright, clear sky with many stars and a full moon. It first appeared, at the area 15 degrees above the southern horizon, as a light brighter than the brightest stars. This object is appeared to stand still for a short time. When I first sighted it, it moved to the west and disappeared. It reappeared several moments later, several degrees higher. There was no sound and the object was a bright white in color.

I viewed this object outdoors in a residential section of Saratoga Springs. Through my 7x35 telescope, it looked somewhat like two rectangular lights joined together, the center part between them could not be distinguished before the object disappeared into the northern horizon. I saw a plane in the sky near the object.

The other people who viewed this with me were: [redacted]. I am twelve years old. My telephone number is [redacted]. Please do not misinterpret this report as a prank because of my age. Every word is in complete truthfulness.

Sincerely yours,
[redacted]
