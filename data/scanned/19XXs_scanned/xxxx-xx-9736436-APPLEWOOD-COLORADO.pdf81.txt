The image contains a diagram and instructions relating to sighting and reporting unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The diagram shows a horizon line, an angular diagram with various angle markings, and a circular compass-like diagram. There is also some text in the image, which I will extract and output below.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the radial line to show how far away the object was when you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the radial line to show how far away the object was when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the position that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Give a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
