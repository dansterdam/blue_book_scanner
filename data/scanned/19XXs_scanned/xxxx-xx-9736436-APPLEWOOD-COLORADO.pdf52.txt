The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically an "Official U.S. Air Force" questionnaire.

Text extracted from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  ___ day ___ month ___ year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Last night around 9 p.m. I saw a strange light in the sky. The light had a very fast speed of motion and was quite intensely bright. It seemed to be a solid object and was making a slight humming sound. The object maneuvered in the sky for some time, then suddenly made a sharp turn and disappeared from sight at a terrific speed. I have no explanation for what I saw, as it was not anything like an airplane, meteor, or satellite. I would appreciate any further investigation you can conduct regarding this incident. (known running lights, observed, and such a memorable report)
