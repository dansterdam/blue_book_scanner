15. SKETCH THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY APPENDAGES THAT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR TREE, AND ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW, IF YOU HAD PLACED THE MATCH AT THE SAME DISTANCE AS THE PHENOMENON, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH.

A very small fraction. This is most likely a figure except that it would be a very small amount.
