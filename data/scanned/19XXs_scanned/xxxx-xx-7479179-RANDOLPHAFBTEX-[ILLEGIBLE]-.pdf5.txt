CERTIFICATE

I, Vojo Lebb, Joseph K. A/2200500, do certify that:

On 17 July 1952, at 2320 hours, I observed in the vicinity of the constellation Ursa Major a circular object which was emitting a brilliantly luminous light. The object was in view for approximately two or three seconds and its direction was determined to be approximately northeast to southwest.

Though this object seemed to be traveling through a thin layer of stratus clouds, its luminosity and apparent size gave the impression that it was much closer than the clouds. Also, this object has been at 10,000 feet it would be estimated to be in the vicinity of some 20 feet.

Because of my anxiety to observe the correct size, manner of flight, and duration of this object, I failed to observe the correct time, manner of motion, and exact point of disappearance.
