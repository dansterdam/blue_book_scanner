North San Jaun, California
 September 23, 1959

On September 23, 1959, at approximately 11:30 a.m., a cigar shaped object was sighted in the sky over the North San Jaun area of California. The object was observed for approximately 25 minutes before it disappeared from sight. The object appeared metallic in nature and was emitting a white vapor trail as it moved slowly across the sky. No sound was detected from the object.

This incident was reported to and investigated by the United States Air Force Project Blue Book, the official government agency responsible for investigating unidentified flying objects.
