27 July 1952
Description: An unidentified aerial object was observed from the ground at Manhattan Beach, California, 27 July 1952. First sighted at 1835 PST and observed both visually and with the aid of 20/50 binoculars by a civilian observer. 
Object was elliptical or delta shaped, and appeared to the naked eye to be about the size of a dime. It was a bright silver color with gray in the rear. When first sighted, it appeared as one object, but later broke up into seven objects. There were no exhaust trails or sounds. It broke up very smoothly and the seven were grouped so as to appear as a track or going that appeared in a V formation of three objects followed by two formations of two each.The entire operation was very gracefully executed. It was overhead at Manhattan Beach and turned south bearing up and disappeared out of sight on a north northeast heading. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed at a high altitude. Weather at the time of sighting was 18,000', scattered clouds, visibility 15 miles, winds aloft from 20,000 to 50,000' were from the east varying from 15 to 25 knots. There was no known air traffic in the Los Angeles or Manhattan Beach area at the time of sighting. Observer was an ex-Navy pilot now employed as an aircraft engineer and should be a well qualified aerial observer. This report was verified by seven other persons.
COMMENTS: 
No aircraft in the area. Balloons released in the area were not in the vicinity at the time of sighting.Length of time observed and the speed eliminate the possibility of this object being astronomical in nature.
CONCLUSION:
UNSOLVED
