OBSERVE TWO STRANGE FLYING OBJECTS IN SPAIN -- Tangier, Espana, 22 August 52

Several inhabitants of Puerto REAL, 6 kilometers from San Fernando, recently saw two elongated oval objects in the sky approaching each other. When it seemed that they were about to collide, each object made a right turn, picked up speed, and then disappeared. The objects flew at a great height, seemed lead-gray in color, and appeared to be piloted.
