The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photographic image. The diagram appears to depict some form of schematic or technical drawing, possibly related to the subject matter of the Project Blue Book UFO report.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

Photograph only partially clear. Sketch shows diagram with labeled components. No other text visible on this page.
