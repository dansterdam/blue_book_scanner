The image contains a schematic diagram but no photograph. The diagram appears to be related to tracking the motion of unidentified objects.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass to show where the object was in relation to you as you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw figures to show how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
