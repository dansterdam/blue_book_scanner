The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

Incident ID: 14 - 68 The 8:45 p.m. from points above. Witnesses: Michigan - Three individuals reported to have seen a bright, oblong object, with a bright red glow, pass rapidly from east to west in the sky on the evening of 6-17-57. The object was very bright and was described as being about the size of a basketball, having no wings or tail and moving at a very rapid rate of speed. The object was seen for approximately 10 seconds and then disappeared. There was no noise associated with the object. The individuals were persons of some standing in the community and their report was considered credible. One of the witnesses was quoted as stating that the object was definitely not an airplane, missile or satellite. This explanation partially fits the description.
