The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects. The text on the page is a narrative explanation provided by an individual about a sighting of an unidentified object.

THE INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS INADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE INCIDENT.

I started out of the house to look around as there was a bright light in the sky. The light was moving in a rather curious manner, It did not seem to be a plane or a star, as it was too low, about the size of a small star, and a greenish-blue color. I observed it for about 10 minutes as it moved in an erratic manner, jumping about, and then suddenly it disappeared.

It was a clear night and I could see a number of stars. I watched the light for about 10 minutes and it maintained its brightness and color the whole time. The other lights in the sky, which were undoubtedly stars, did not behave in this manner. I have no explanation for it.

I was amazed and puzzled by this phenomenon, as I have never seen anything like it before. I am at a loss to account for it in any other way than that it was some kind of an unidentified flying object. Please consider this report.
