Submitted in accordance with AF Reg No. 200-2, dated 30 April 1952, Sub: Reporting of Unidentified Flying Objects.

As approximately 10:25 p.m. 23 July 1952, an unidentified bright light, approximately 1/2 the size of the full moon, was observed in a northwesterly direction from the reporting observers. This object was observed to make a direct approach toward the observers' location, coming in from the northeast and passing overhead at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet.

At the time of sighting, the weather was clear, visibility was excellent, and the wind was estimated at 10 knots from the north-northeast.

The object, after passing directly overhead, continued on a southwesterly course and was observed to make an abrupt turn to the south, accelerating in speed and disappearing from view in approximately 10 seconds.

Attached as enclosures are written statements of the four observers who witnessed the object, and the written statement of the pilot of an aircraft which was in the area at the time, describing his observations.
