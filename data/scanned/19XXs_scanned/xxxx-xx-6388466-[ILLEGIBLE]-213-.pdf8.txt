Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, ATIC, dated 31 March 1949, concerning unidentified flying objects.

2. The incident mentioned in paragraph 175 February 233 have been checked against weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force-Navy and meteorological bureaus. Corrections are included on this report.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects" should be clarified so that technical and scientific motions are distinguished from the psychological and social motions in connection with this problem. Also, it appears desirable to include a statement that "sightings of Unidentified flying objects" should include a statement of the type of object seen.
