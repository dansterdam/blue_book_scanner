TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

TDFR (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/mhs/6 Jun 68
UFO Observation, 14 April 1963

Greenville, Ohio 45331

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 14 April 1963. We connected the SPASE DETECTION CENTER at APL, Colorado, and they informed us that two pieces of satellite debris decayed at the time of your observation.

2. Since the exact times of the decays are not known, we can only state that it is very likely that you observed one or the fragments decaying into the earth's atmosphere. Satellite reentry appears similar to that of a fireball except that the debris is much longer than a meteor observation. Satellite decay is usually white-blueish in color and has an elongated fiery trail.

3. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
