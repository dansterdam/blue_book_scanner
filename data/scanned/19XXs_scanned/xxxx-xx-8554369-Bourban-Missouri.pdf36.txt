35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific items of this questionnaire:

Approximately 3 years ago I was driving home from work one evening and noticed a bright light above me. At first I thought it was a star or planet, but as I watched, the object began to move rapidly from side to side and up and down. It was directly overhead and at times appeared to be nearly the size of a car headlight. 

The object then seemed to descend rapidly and I became alarmed, as I felt it might crash near me. However, it stopped abruptly and hovered silently for a few minutes, then shot straight up out of sight. The whole incident lasted about 10 minutes.

I have often wondered what that object could have been. It did not resemble any known aircraft and its movements were unlike anything I had ever seen before. I have not reported this sighting to any authorities, as I felt they might not take it seriously. But I am curious to know if others have had similar experiences and if there is any reasonable explanation for what I saw that evening.
