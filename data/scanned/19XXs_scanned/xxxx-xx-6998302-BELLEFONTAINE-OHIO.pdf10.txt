DECLASSIFIED PER EXECUTIVE ORDER 12356,
SECTION 3.3 NND PROJECT NUMBER 63BB 7D80.
BY NND DATE 10/3/80.

PROJECT NO. 10073
OBJECT IDENTIFIED AS: PROBABLE BALLOON

SYNOPSIS OF CASE: 

During the night of 29 August 1952, the Bellefontaine, Ohio Airport control tower observed an unidentified flying object which appeared to be hovering over the airport. The object was described as round, about 30 feet in diameter, and luminous. It remained over the airport for approximately 15 minutes.

DETAILS OF INCIDENT:

On the night of 29 August 1952, the Bellefontaine, Ohio Municipal Airport control tower received several reports from local residents regarding a strange object hovering over the airport. The control tower personnel immediately went outside to observe the object. They stated that the object appeared to be round, about 30 feet in diameter, and luminous. The object remained stationary over the airport for approximately 15 minutes before moving off to the south at a high rate of speed. Weather conditions at the time were clear with light winds.

CONCLUSION:

Based on the physical description of the object and the fact that it remained stationary for an extended period before rapidly departing, the object was probably a high-altitude balloon. Balloons are a common misidentification for unidentified flying objects, especially when they are illuminated by the sun's reflection. The Air Force investigation concluded that this sighting was a probable balloon.
