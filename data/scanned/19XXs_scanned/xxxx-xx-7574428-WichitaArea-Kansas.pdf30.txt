Dear sir:

I am sending you a UFO report which I got on June 27, 1967 at about 11:30 PM. I thought you might be interested in it. I was out in my back yard and saw this bright light moving in the sky. It came close to me and then stopped. It hovered there for several minutes. I would think it must have been a UFO. I got so excited that I would like you to send it to you for analysis. I would appreciate it if you would return it when you have examined it. I don't have a camera and could not take a picture of it.

Yours truly,
XXXXXX, Kansas 67208
