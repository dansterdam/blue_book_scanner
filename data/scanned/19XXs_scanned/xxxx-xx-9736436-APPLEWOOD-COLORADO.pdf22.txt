AUG 14 1967
Proposed reply to letter from Jul 10, 67 (sighting March 1967)

Dear [redacted],

Reference your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object in March 1967.

We are hesitant in offering any explanation for the sighting without additional information such as detailed flight characteristics, and angular velocities.

Our responsibility does not cover the investigation of sightings outside the continental limits of the United States; therefore, we are unable to perform a comprehensive investigation. Your information will, however, be added to the present data base.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the United States Air Force.
