Dear Sir:

Ave.: I am a patient at the National Jewish Hospital, 3800 E. Colfax, 
I saw no physical features during the daylight hours of 2:30 on June 6-21. It was in the northwestern sky North of the Hosp. There may have been cars but only one was visible at a time. This tremendous bright object passed and went out of sight. I saw no planes all lighted up the after 2:30 but prevailed at it till 5:30 when it finally disappeared. The object was larger than 700 airliners for that hour. I am sure it was not any regular type. However it remained in the same area. It was not constantly disappearing and reappearing. They appeared rather close and rather low. When it left it shot straight away in an easterly direction.

This was witnessed by and our charge nurse, _____. I may add this on to you for what ever interest it may have.

Yours truly,
