The image shows a page from an old UFO report document. The left side of the page contains a sketch or drawing, possibly a diagram or topographical map. The right side of the page appears to be blank, without any visible text or additional content.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

There is no visible text in the provided image. The image appears to contain only the sketch or diagram on the left side, and the blank right side of the page.
