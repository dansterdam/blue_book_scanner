The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed text document with numbered points describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

There was no visual or call of object other than the report of what surprised the object.
The object was still as 12 dark and the sun had either set or had overruled clouds. The object appeared to be between two and one-half to three miles away from the point of observation, and in the general direction of my first thought was that I was observing the activity of some natural activity or changes in the 30 to 40 foot length, it was elongated and went through various positions. The motion was too swift and its associated changes of the visible parts as they changed form, gave the impression of some type of mechanical operation as though it were a natural outgrowth of the action.
