There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The image shows a page of handwritten text with several sections and questions.

Section A:
We were traveling west and saw the object just as we turned a corner. It got gradually larger and nearer as it passed overhead (blueish green) slightly turning as it passed over - quite fast. It vanished rather suddenly in the distance.

Section B:
1.1 - Do not drink any smokeless gas which the object appeared to be emitting, as this could possibly be dangerous to your health.
1.2 We observed on the edges of the object that it appeared to be slightly spinning or rotating, and seemed to have a metallic appearance. 
1.3 It emitted a bright light. (Can't remember if it was green or orange.)
