IT HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY CARIB FROM JTAT THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT WAS SIGHTED, BOTH VISUALLY AND BY RADAR, BY THE PILOT AND RADAR OBSERVER OF AN F-61 ON 15 OCT 52. THE OBSERVERS THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT TWO UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT WERE INVOLVED IN THE INTERCEPTION. THE SIGHTINGS OCCURRED AT NIGHT; HOWEVER, THERE WAS SUFFICIENT MOONLIGHT TO PERMIT A SILHOUETTE TO BE OBSERVED. ALTHOUGH NO DETAILS WERE OBSERVED, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE AIRCRAFT OR WHETHER IT WAS JET OR PROPELLER DRIVEN. NO TRAILS OR EXHAUST FLAMES WERE SEEN. THE SPEED OF THIS AIRCRAFT WAS REPORTED AS BEING MUCH GREATER THAN THE SPEED OF THE F-61. IT ALSO HAD A HIGH RATE OF ACCELERATION AND COULD GO ALMOST STRAIGHT UP OR DOWN OUT OF RADAR ELEVATION LIMITS. THIS AIRCRAFT SEEMED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE MANEUVERS OF THE F-61 AT ALL TIMES, WHICH MIGHT INDICATE THAT IT CARRIED RADAR EQUIPMENT. THE EXACT LOCATION OF INCIDENT WAS NOT INDICATED IN INFORMATION RECEIVED BUT WILL BE DETERMINED.
