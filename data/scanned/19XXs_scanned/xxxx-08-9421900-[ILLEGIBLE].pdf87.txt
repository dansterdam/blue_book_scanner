Shoreham Cylinder
The description and time data of a sighting, 10 August 1965, by Mr. P. Harris of Middle Road, Shoreham. 'Last Thursday evening at 9.15, I observed a large white object, circular in shape, altitude about 1000 ft. It was stationary for about 45 degrees. It was shown by four steady lights, red, green, white and amber. The object then moved off to the west at high speed and disappeared.'
