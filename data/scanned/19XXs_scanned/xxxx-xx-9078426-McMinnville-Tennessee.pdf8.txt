18. We wish to know the angular size, size of a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and how much of the object was covered by the match head.
As much as I can say about the object would be that it seemed to be encircled by the match head which is much bigger at arm's length than the object itself.

19. Draw a simple sketch (if will show the shape of the object or objects). Please indicate on the sketch any details of the object that were mentioned in your report, such as exhaust trails or vapor trails.
