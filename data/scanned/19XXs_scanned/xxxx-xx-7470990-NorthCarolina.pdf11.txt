Request for UFO Information & Sighting
DEC 11 1957
Tuscolo Park
Waynesboro, North Carolina 28786

Dear [Redacted],
Reference: your recent letter to my office. I appreciate your interest in collecting UFO data. However, I am sorry for your sake, that your parents severely punished you for your actions. It seems that your parents were very widely concerned because of their concern over what you did without their knowledge. However, I would like for you to talk it over with your parents. I would like for you to donate the photographs you took of the object which appears of interest.

The reason I want the object and the photos is to show others what has been done to those who have allegedly flying saucers. I will not reveal your name to any one except my staff.

I am including some information which you might enjoy since you like to read about the UFO phenomena.

Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR. Major, USAF
