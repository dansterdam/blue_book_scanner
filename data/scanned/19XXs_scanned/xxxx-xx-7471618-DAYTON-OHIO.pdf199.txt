The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

The text in the image is as follows:

"FIRE NOTICE ON MAP  
THE DIAGRAM ON THIS PAGE SHOWS THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDES AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME CONNECTION ONCE THE PHENOMENON. AND INDICATE EXACTLY OR UPON TRAILS.  INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HOLD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR WINDOW TO ESTIMATE THE ANGULAR SIZE. THE ANGULAR SIZE IN DEGREES WOULD BE THE MATCH HEAD FRACTION OF THE KNOWN OBJECT. WHAT FRACTION OF THE MAN PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

WHERE WE WERE STANDING"

The text appears to be instructions for the observer to provide details about the observed phenomenon, including its angular size and any other relevant details. The handwritten notes mention "FIRE" and provide a diagram or sketch of the observed object.
