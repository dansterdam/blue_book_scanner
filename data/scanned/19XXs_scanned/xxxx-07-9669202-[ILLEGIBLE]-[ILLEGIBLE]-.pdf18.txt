Incident #47 -- Fairfield-Suisun Air Base, California -- 5 Jul 1947

This incident cannot be readily explained astronomically. The object was in sight too long to be a star, and the "pulsation" and absence of any movement about trail also argue against that interpretation. It is difficult, however, to rule out the hypothesis completely, because of the lack of pertinent information and the ever-present possibility that the report was more subjective than objective.
