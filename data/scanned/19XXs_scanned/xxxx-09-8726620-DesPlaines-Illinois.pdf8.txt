The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

"I therefore report that a light, in the sense that it will help you to place a certain gas in the U.S.D.D. number.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Very truly yours,"
