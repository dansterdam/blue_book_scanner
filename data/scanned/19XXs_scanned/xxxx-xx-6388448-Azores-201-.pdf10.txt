Incident, 4351, a. b. - army air base, azores -- 31 october 1943

There appears to be no astronomical explanation for this incident.

The observed object in the general description, but not in the words of the object, appears to be given from 33 to 655 mph.
The most likely explanation on the basis of the major information offered is that the object was a balloon carrying a swinging light.
