MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 22 Jul 1959

1. On 22 Jul 59, TDHT (USAF) received a telephone call from Mr. Painesville, Ohio 44077. On 22 Jul at 2200 hrs, Mr. and his wife observed an unidentified flying object. The object looked like a hat with eyes of dull white light. Mrs. was observing the object through binoculars. She saw a brim with a cone on top with fire falling from underneath like burning charcoal. The object was traveling very slowly at treetop level. They observed the object for 3 or 4 minutes. They were looking to the south, and the object was traveling from east to west following the curvature of the earth. The observers noticed no surface winds. The object disappeared behind some trees. The object was like a small airplane only it was traveling slower and lower than an airplane.

2. We sent the observers an AF Fm 117, and we requested surface weather observations for that date and time.
