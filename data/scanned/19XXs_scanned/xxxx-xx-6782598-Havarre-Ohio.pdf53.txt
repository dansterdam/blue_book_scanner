The image appears to contain two hand-drawn sketches or diagrams on paper. The left sketch depicts what looks like a landscape or scene with some geometric shapes and markings. The right sketch shows a more abstract, wave-like or topographic pattern.

However, the image does not contain any photographs. The filename indicates this is a scanned document from Project Blue Book, but the image itself does not show any photographic evidence, only hand-drawn illustrations.
