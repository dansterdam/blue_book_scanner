The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was the U.S. Air Force's official investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text on the page appears to be a handwritten response to a questionnaire or narrative explanation of a sighting. The text discusses the witness's stepbrother and brother-in-law seeing something strange in the sky, describing the object as very fast and giving off a bright light. The witness expresses uncertainty about what they saw and notes that the event is "very strange."

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2 - Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Well, my stepbrother and brother-in-law were staying over. They saw something at about 1:15 am. It was very bright. I didn't see it myself as I was asleep at the time. But they told me about it the next day. They said it was very fast, about 15 seconds, and gave off a bright light. The next night at about 1:30 the same object or something like it came back. This time I saw it too. It was very bright and seemed to be the same object. It just kind of hovered there for a while and then went away very fast. I guess that's the object that they saw the first night. Make of it what you will. The whole thing is very strange. It's hard to admit it is, but I have to. The whole thing was just like something out of this world. I was a little scared I guess and so were they.
