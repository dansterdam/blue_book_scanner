The size of the UFO was very impressive. The aircraft was strangely flattened. They appeared to be circular. It would appear that the whole surface of the craft was metallic and smooth. There were no protrusions or windows visible. I would estimate the size of the craft to be approximately 80 to 100 feet in diameter. I watched this from beyond 100 yards and the speed at which this craft accelerated vertically was incredible. This was a high speed and very low pitch.
