AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
ATIL OFFICE, D/F., USAF IR-37-52 PAGE 1 OF 2

1. The following information was forwarded to Marine Ground Control Intercept Squadron 3 as an Addendum to Air Defense Satellite Report for 9 August 1952 from the Air Control Detachment:

A. This is a report of UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS (location: 15 miles from Doodle-bug heading 2050, Speed: 240 knots, in vicinity of K-55 airfield); 3 CIRCULAR objects have a diameter of 30 to 40 feet and were observed at an altitude of 20,000 feet. The pilots caught one, a brief glimpse, but stated this was a distinct silhouette, not a glare, and the three objects acted in a formation flying manner. All objects were very bright, almost luminous. At the time of the sighting the weather was clear and visibility was unlimited. The objects, as reported by Lt. NAGRODSKY, were first observed at Doodle-bug at 2050 local time.

1. 1st Plot 83,3453, 15 miles from Doodle-bug heading 2050. Time, 2050I.
2. 2nd Plot 83,3543, 25 miles from Doodle-bug. Time, not logged.
3. 3rd Plot 83,3643, 30 miles from Doodle-bug. Time, not logged.
4. High Plot 83,3503, 35 miles from Doodle-bug. Time, not logged.

B. Lt. NAGRODSKY reported that the first three plots looked normal, however, the fourth plot experienced a sharp break in its flight path, which seemed to be an evasive maneuver. His first estimate of the "objects" were two aircraft, but after further turning the plot, and comparing it with other known air traffic in the area, he reported that the "object's" performance was considered to be that of a jet type. Observation by the pilot was very limited due to very high speed.

C. This message was received in Devastate Able by 2nd Lt. D.E. SHAW at 2020 and relayed to Shirbuy.

D. No plots were reported to Devastate Able on the above sightings.

E. No jet aircraft were scheduled to be in the area concerned.

2. Comments on the report by the Commanding Officer of the Squadron were:

A. It is my opinion that the identities of the unidentified blips mentioned in his report were caused by a meteor is the case. (See Inclosure #1)

B. If such is the case, it is apparent that his initial effort to provide analytical information for a possible, uncorrelated observation, which at the time seemed either unconnected or beyond credibility resulted in an underestimation of the correct. SEE INCLOSURE #1 if considered as a unidentified observation.

COMMENTS BY PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The unidentified object was first sighted at 15 miles. A distance just beyond reliable radar observation, as the sets in use at the time could not be depended upon for this type of observation. Initial reports may have been due to or mistaken identity rather than a definitive sighting.
2. The report indicates attention was focused on Richard #2.
3. No unusual maneuvering was reported, and the overall description tends to minimize the significance of the incident.
