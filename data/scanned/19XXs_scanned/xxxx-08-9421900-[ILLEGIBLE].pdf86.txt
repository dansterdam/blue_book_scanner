The story spread. Pawcott pointed up. "It got bigger. It got bigger and bigger and it went up, steps, he said it moved up gradually then if flashed out of sight."

"Another Star"

"It was moving from Win - dow to window they saw it thru the windows as it kept moving. Those people saw the same thing that I saw and then they saw The same star go up and out of sight the family said that at one time a star was moving so fast it plunged down like it was try ing to hit the ground and then it flashed out of sight, right up and out, like a shooting star, perhaps?"

"Case no. 2"

Bobby Puckett, 14, of Mount Airy, N.C. the teen-ager shouted to the house that there were flying saucers darting all over the sky. Bobby kept telling his par ents about it and two neighbor boys came to the house and saw the same thing.

There were two whitish objects that appeared to be circling each other and then darted off in different directions. It was about 8:30 P. M. on July 2.

Bobby saw the objects about 30 minutes. He said they were changing shape and moving very fast, and appeared to be smaller than a basketball. Some times they seemed to disappear and then reappear in a dif ferent position.
