AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: United States

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object 

DATE OF INFORMATION: 12 September 1952

DATE OF REPORT: 12 September 1952 

EVALUATION: 

JOHN ROSS McCARTHYJr., about 21 to 25 years of age, the observer.

ON SUMMARY: (Never include in this paragraph. List conclusions and other remarks. Use additional sheets if necessary. See instructions on AF Form 14--Part II.)
According to the information received, the observer, Mr. JOHN ROSS McCARTHYJr., sighted an object which he described as a bright, white light on 12 September 1952 at approximately 8:00 P.M. while he was driving his automobile near Middletown, Pennsylvania.

The object was described as a bright, white light approximately the size of a "pinhead at arm's length". It was observed to make a sharp turn and disappear behind a tree. The speed was described as "tremendous" and "blinding". 

The light was visible for "three or four" minutes, but most of the time it approximated close to "three seconds", and gave the impression of a car traveling at high speed. 

There were no local aircraft in the air at the time. Weather was clear with twelve miles visibility. Winds calm.

This case received no further investigation or followup. The report states that although the sound was heard and the light was observed, there was insufficient evidence to determine the possibility of an aircraft.
