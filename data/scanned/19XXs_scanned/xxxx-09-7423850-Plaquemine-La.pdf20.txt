The image contains a handwritten letter describing an observation of a UFO. The letter mentions that on September 3, 1967, a glowing red object was observed traveling across the sky. The observer states that they took pictures of the object, which was about 200 feet or better in size and moved at a fast forward speed. The observer expresses interest in receiving a reply about any additional information or more questions regarding the incident.

Now, as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

To the department of us air force of defense

Dear Sir, I enclosed inside for a picture on negative of a UFO which was seen in the early evening about 5:30 pm on September 3, 1967. The UFO looked like a glowing red object traveling cross ways on a northwesterly direction. It took this picture with my 35 mm camera and I could not tell because of its direction of travel that this observation was made by myself only. I am mr. Charles M. Pierce field not shown and the picture was not too good but was traveling at a fast forward speed. I would like a reply as soon as possible about any incident or as to any questions you may have about more information.
