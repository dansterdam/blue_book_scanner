The image contains no photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, a historic United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page reads:

Incident #4 -- Rogers Dry Lake, California -- 8 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident. Is there any definite reason why the object observed could not have been a bursted weather balloon?
