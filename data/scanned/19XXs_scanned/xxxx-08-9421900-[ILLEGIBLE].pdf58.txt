BRITTON, MA

The ground area shown above has a number of people wondering! Whileod Rik 
is sheets on an unusual situation in his wheat field on the  Ashwell Road. He 
said a number of strange circular areas have been found in this field which he 
found quite a mystery. At the wheat stem has not been cut and the roots were stall
might show a definite pattern. Some were found to be 15 feet in diameter, how-
ever. the cause of them has not been determined.  

He said he has discovered about 27 similar areas in his field which he located
one week ago. The largest of these is about 15 feet in diameter. The strange situation has
discovered in a number of places and to date no one can say just what has caused them.  Some
say it could be from nightly rodent activity while others feel it may be some sort of underground 
disturbance. A few persons have come out to look at the circular areas but no one has been able
to throw any definite explanation as to what caused them. Will await further development.
