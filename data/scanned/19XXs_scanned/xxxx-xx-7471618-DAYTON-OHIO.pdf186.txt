DR. 'CY.09/3' RECORD
LOCATION	DAYTON, OHIO
15. CONCLUSION
The description is like those given for hot air balloons.
Both sightings appear to be of the same bag, not airbailoons.
16. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers sighted a large bright object that dropped. It
was a round object with very bright fire and fuzzy edges.
Things dropped from it and went out. While the
observers were on the phone talking to the Duty Officer,
they sighted another object that acted like the first one.
