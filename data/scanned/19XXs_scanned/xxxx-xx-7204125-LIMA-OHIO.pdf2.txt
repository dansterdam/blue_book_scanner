1. The aerial phenomena Crites is in receipt of, an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Lima, Ohio which occurred on 19 July 1963 from 10:55 pm to 11:00 pm.

2. The object was observed by Crites to be a bright light in the sky. Crites stated that the object had amber lights around it which seemed to be spinning. The object was first seen in the distance and passed to the east overhead and the observer stated that she heard a slight whirr.

3. An electrical monitoring system installed in the area, however, was not in operation, and your scone do you have records that would indicate any installation was operating in the area that might.

4. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.
