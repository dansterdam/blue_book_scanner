The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text on a document. The text appears to be a descriptive account or narrative of some kind of observed phenomenon, potentially related to a UFO sighting or report. 

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Viewed two of them zooming from this window. They traveled rapidly at a terrific speed in a straight line into the sky. They were disc shaped, bright white in color and appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter. There was no sound whatsoever. After they had traveled about 100 feet, they accelerated and disappeared instantaneously. I watched them for about 10 seconds before they disappeared. They gave the impression of tremendous power and speed.
