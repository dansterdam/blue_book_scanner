WITNESS STATEMENT

1. Name: 
2. Address: 
3. City, State, Zip: Havarre, Ohio
4. Date and Time of Observation: 20 August 1952, 2:15 P.M.
5. Location of Observation: Route 123, 2 miles west of Havarre, Ohio
6. Weather Conditions: Clear skies, light winds.
7. Description of Sighting:
I was driving my car westbound on Route 123 when I noticed a bright object in the sky to the south. At first I thought it was an aircraft, but as I watched, it began to move in an erratic and unusual manner. It would suddenly change direction and speed, then hover, then dart off again. The object appeared to be circular or disc-shaped and was extremely bright, reflecting the sunlight. I stopped my car to get a better look and observed the object for several minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.
8. Additional Comments:
This was a very strange and puzzling sight. I have never seen anything like it before. The object's movements were unlike any aircraft I have seen. I am certain this was not a conventional aircraft, weather balloon, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. I believe I may have witnessed some kind of unidentified flying object.
