TRUE COPY

When I got up, told him my sister was 70 miles west of St. Louis, Ky. This was a pretty nice fresh vegetable dealer in St. Louis, so I visited with her in St. Louis, and she told her that this thing was in field around 5:30 pm, so thatI got the message.

I called ISB-TV in St. Louis. This was too far from St. Louis for me to investigate. 

It doesn't seem that no one is interested at all. All they have had to do is spend all evening, and they would have seen it.

For a month I have put there most every night. They still go, but not as often as they have been.

This has been going on for a month. You would sure think someone would be interested enough to check in to it.

Sincerely,
/s/ Mr.
St. Louis, Missouri
