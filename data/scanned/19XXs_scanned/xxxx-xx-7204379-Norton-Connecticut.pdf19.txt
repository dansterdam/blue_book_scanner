ORIGIN OF BASIC CC 1 SHEET DATE SUSPENSE SUBJECT (U) UFO SIGHTING, NORTON, CONN. ASSIGNED BY ROUTE DATE TYPE SAFIS-3, ATTN: Maj. L. J. Tucker DATE 29 NOV. 1952 FROM AFOIN-4E1 COMMENTS (USE REVERSE IF NECESSARY) AFOIN-4E1/Maj. R. J. Freund/ac/69236/MAJ 823 1. The official opinion of the Air Technical Intelligence Center is that this sighting/thing cannot be positively identified from the data presented. The fact that the width was reported as being greater than the apparent size is a contributing factor to the lack of firm identification. 2. The angular velocity of 10 degrees per second reported by the observer is, in conjunction with the other reported information, a possibility. 3. Contributing factors to the non-recognition are: a. Surprise. b. Short time of observation. It is the opinion of this office that such an experience could startle a person with more training than the average observer. The initial experience for witness observing meteor through binoculars were more striking than the subsequent observations of the same object.
