Sutton monster real?
exclusive interview with one-eyed-spot investigator facts
(on september isth, 1952 - something happened in Sutton, west Virginia, that may be the answer to many disturbing questionss)

IT BEGAN......... 
when "something" flew over west Virginia, a witness reported this fact to various investigators. They thought it had landed on a hill nearby. initial investigators were sent out. They thought it had landed on a hill nearby. Some physical evidence was found on the site.

"IT WAS QUITE A SIGHT." one of the investigators. "The grass was wither and the ground was discolored. There were foot prints as if something heavy had landed there and taken off again." 

SUTTON(CONT) "IT WAS a grip- tan, fuzzy, thick - headed appeared, soe what taller, and stooped over, with slit-like eyes. Its movements were slow. It appeared to be about 7 feet tall."

(THE WITNESS APPROACHED IT TO GET a CLOSE look. But when they got to about 50 yards away from it, IT SUDDENLY ROSE up off the ground, wobbling from side to side, and took off so fast it seemed to simply disappear into the sky. WITNESSES were told to keep this under their hats and, though frightened, did so.) 

The GUARDSMAN, Gene Lemon, was seriously ill, almost in convulsions, and had to be treated and sedated, after the experience. 

HE SAID that the creature had seemed very interested in the two men and appeared to be examining them as if deciding what to do. The witness said it acted "like a beast, with slits for eyes." IT then turned and fled rapidly straight up into the air, so fast he could hardly follow it.

AFTER THE INCIDENT, the news of the alleged monster spread quietly through the close knit community. People were reluctant to discuss it, fearful of ridicule. However, scientists quietly launched a search to locate and study the elusive creature. But the creature vanished as swiftly as a phantom and all trace of it seemed to disappear. An NATURAL OBJECT OR SOME TYPE OF INTELLIGENT BEING?
