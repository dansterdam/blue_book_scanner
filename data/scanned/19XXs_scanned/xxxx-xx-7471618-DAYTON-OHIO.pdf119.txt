RADIO FOR THE RECORD
23 March 1967
Dayton, Ohio

The object was a little higher than the tree-tops and while it seemed to stand still in the air, some distance, it lit up the whole countryside. A plane took off from the field and when it got near the object, the object disappeared. When the plane passed the object, the object reappeared. It was observed at 0530. Then two stars approached and the object went up and disappeared from sight.

Action Taken:
Contact with (name redacted)'s base (operations) revealed that several people were in the area shortly after 0530. Two US-6 took off about 0530. He had received no sightings nor heard of any.
