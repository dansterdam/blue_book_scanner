The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, showing a handwritten response to a questionnaire.

The text visible in the image is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: June 1st 1947

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The sighted object remained at the watch through a green field for approximately 5 to 7 minutes. It appeared to be a flat disk-shaped object and remained stationary during the time it was under observation. The color of the object changed at times. It appeared to be a bluish-green at some angles and a silver-white at others. It was approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter and appeared to be approximately 200 yards away. It produced no sound and did not change altitude or position. It finally faded from view behind trees or other obstructions at almost ground level.
