EVALUATION (continued--Cape Ann, Mass. 8/2/67)

The object exhibited characteristics typical of other UFO sightings from all over the world. For example:

1. It hovered almost stationary over the observer's location with its bright fluorescent glow continuing.
2. The description of a string of yellow-orange/red lights.
3. The straight-line, rapid movement with its sudden changes in direction and altitude.
4. The ability to hover and dart away.
5. The ability to perform directionless reversal according the observer.
6. Complete lack-of-sound and visible means of propulsion.
7. The estimated appearance and size/brightness of the object as provided by the observer: Rafe 8/27/67.

It is therefore my conclusion that the Cape Ann, Mass. sightings represent significant sightings as of 2 August 1967, and definitely fall into the category of unidentified UFOs.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS

It is interesting to note that on-the-surface, the eyewitness corroboration and details are impressive in corroborating this report. This level of detail information suggests a genuine UFO observation of significant character. The physical details described appear to eliminate conventional explanations, and the time durations involved would seem to preclude hoax or mistaken observations. A number of types of people saw this UFO and their congruent observations lend credence to the case. Some of the observed characteristics compare favorably with other recent UFO incidents, although the specific size, altitude and other details would require further investigation to verify conclusively. The case appears genuine and of interest, although final resolution must await further diligent inquiry. One wonders about the further developments from the Ipswich, Mass. area.
