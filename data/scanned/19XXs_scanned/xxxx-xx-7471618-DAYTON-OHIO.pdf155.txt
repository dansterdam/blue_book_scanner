The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that includes a sketch and instructions for the observer.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass to show the direction from which the object came.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The text on the page appears to be instructions and prompts for the observer to document their UFO sighting, including sketching the location and motion of the object(s) and indicating the number of objects seen.
