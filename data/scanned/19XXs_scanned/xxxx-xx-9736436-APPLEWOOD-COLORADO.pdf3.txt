27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you lost sight of it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE OBJECT; THERE WERE SEVERAL OBJECTS PRESENT. THEY APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING IN AN ERRATIC MANNER, CHANGING DIRECTIONS RAPIDLY, AND SOMETIMES STOPPING AND STARTING AGAIN.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
