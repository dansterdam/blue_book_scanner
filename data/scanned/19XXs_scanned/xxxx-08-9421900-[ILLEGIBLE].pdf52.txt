Dear Richard:

Your letter of 3 August 1965 was forwarded by the Air National Guard unit at Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Consultation with the meteorologist leads me to believe that the following information is pertinent:

"Dust devils" are described by the meteorologist as short duration whirlwinds that rotate counter clockwise direction. North Dakota summers frequently have these strong small whirlwinds. This phenomena diameter evils made in the wheat fields of Veblen Township, but dry summer afternoon.

The temporarily deformation of the wheat along the rapid wind path might, condition to their reappearance after the wind subsided. The meteorologist would that is the peripheral area would be affected as well.

Thank you for your observations.

Sincerely,

/s/
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
