Dear Lieutenant Marley:

Reference your telephone conversation with Sergeant R. H. Miller, Commanding Officer of this District, 12 April 1967. He advised michland a report concerning an unidentified flying object in the area of Bourbon, Missouri. 

Since our troopers were contacted by Trooper Philips of the Troop F Commander, the air office was notified. This office was promptly notified by this office concerning the unidentified lights or aircraft flying beneath this troop aircraft.

If we can be of further assistance please let us know.

Very truly yours,
A. H. Kelly, Captain
