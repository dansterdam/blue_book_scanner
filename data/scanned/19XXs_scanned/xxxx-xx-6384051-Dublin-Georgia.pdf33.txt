The text of the document is as follows:

"SPOT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

1. Unidentified Flying Objects:
a. Observers: XXXXXXX
b. Location: Dublin, Georgia, northwest sector
c. Date and Time: 2 September 1952 at 1730 hours EST.
d. Weather: (Official Report of the Weather Station) 
1952 hours - Visibility 15 + ceiling 20,000 ft.

2. This object was first observed by XXXXXXX, age 29, a city official, at 1700 hours on 2 September 1952. XXXXX stated that he first observed the objects in the northwest sky. There were three objects, white in color, which moved across the sky in a straight line, at a high rate of speed. They were observed for about 1 minute and 15 seconds. The objects appeared to be about the size of a 25 cent piece held at arm's length. The objects moved in the direction of northwest to southeast. After about 1 minute and 15 seconds they appeared to stop, hover, and then resumed their original direction and speed. They were observed to do this twice. Approximately 35 seconds later they appeared to tilt and then disappeared from sight.

3. It is estimated that the objects appeared to be traveling fairly fast, possibly 600-700 mph, and the objects appeared to be about the size of a small fighter plane.

4. The weather was bright and clear. She detected no noise, odor, or vibration, and made no attempt to present in pictorial form the outline and position of the objects.

5. The witness has no technical training in flying and has read only what appeared in the newspapers about these cases."
