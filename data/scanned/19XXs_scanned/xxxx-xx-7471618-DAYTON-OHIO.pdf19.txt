The image contains a diagram showing the angular size of a reported object over time. The diagram does not depict any human faces.

Text extracted from the document:

1. BROW A PICTURE 3 UGO, WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE REPORTED OBJECT. INOUOE ARS CASE, GIYE EXACT DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING. 
WELL AND THIF SIZE OF 1 2I-1 -G

2. TAKE THE ANGULAR SIZE. HOLD A SHEET OF PAPER AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF YOU AS A KNOWN OBJECT. SUCH AS A DISTANT TREETOP OR BUILDING. MEASURE THE LENGTH OF THE KNOWN OBJECT IN INCHES AND ALSO THE LENGTH OF THE REPORTED PHENOMENON. THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE ANGULAR SIZE IN MILRAOIANS. EXAMPLE: IF THE KNOWN OBJECT IS 1 INCH LONG AND THE PHENOMENON IS 1/2 INCH LONG, THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON IS 1/2 MILRADIAN.
