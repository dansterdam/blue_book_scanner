AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. TR-32-92 
FROM: (LEGEND) ASTT. OFFICE, D/F TEAP
STATEMENT OF STAFF SERGEANT "A" P. MOORE CONCERNING FLYING MISSILES:
At approximately 2215/8 Sgt. KENNER and I were returning from the marshall being located down on the west end of the run way when we spotted a strange light about four (4) feet in diameter. It seemed to be hovering and coming down. It then shot back up to about 1,000 feet and then shot straight down again to about 200 feet, The object was inclined at an angle and was coming down tail first. It then straightened out and started coming down straight. As it was coming down, it shot out several large blue flashes of light. The object then went into some trees and we lost sight of it. The whole experience lasted about 30 seconds. At one time the object seemed to be about 1,000 feet from us.
Also Sergeant KENNER and I stopped the jeep we were in when we first saw it and got out to watch it. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball at the distance we observed it.
