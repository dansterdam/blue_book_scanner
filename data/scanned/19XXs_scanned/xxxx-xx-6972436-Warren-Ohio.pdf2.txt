27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
We Mr. [redacted] was viewing the eclipse of the moon on or about the 28th and while observing this eclipse we saw a strange object rapidly crossing the sky. It was about the size of a dime at arm's length and it was very similar to the description you have on your questionnaires of UFOs. It was luminous and traveled at a tremendous speed. In your description of figure #9 the drawing is very similar to what we saw. From where we were standing, it appeared to be a little concerning. From where we were standing, it was very distinct and definitely not a satellite or any known aircraft that we are aware of. I would be very interested in hearing from you on any thing at all regarding this sighting. Thank you.
