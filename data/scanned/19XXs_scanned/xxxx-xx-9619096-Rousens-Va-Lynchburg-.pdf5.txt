The image does not appear to contain a photograph, but rather sketches labeled "SKETCH B" and "SKETCH D". The sketches appear to be used to illustrate the observed features and motion of an unidentified flying object, as described in the text.

18. On the following Sketch B, label a at the apparent position of the object when first seen and b at point last seen. Those enclose the apparent path of the object between points a and b.
If possible label 1, 2, 3, etc., along the trend path to show the successive positions of the object after equal intervals of time during the sighting.
19. In Sketch C please show the observed features of the object such as: 
A. Apparent shape, (were edges pointed or rounded),
B. Apparent direction of motion (show by arrow), and
C. Other details, exhaust, trails, tails, surfaces, etc.
20. The sun and the moon as shown below as they appear in their correct relative size. In this sketch D, show the apparent size of what you saw.
