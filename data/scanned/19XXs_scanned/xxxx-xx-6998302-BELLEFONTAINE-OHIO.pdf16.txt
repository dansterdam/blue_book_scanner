AUGUST 1, 1952
INVESTIGATION OF INCIDENT

AS A STARTLING INCIDENT, AS OF LATE LAST NIGHT, 4-5 OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED BY SEVERAL WITNESSES IN THE VICINITY. THE OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED IN THE SKY AT 11:30 P.M. THEY WERE REPORTED TO BE CIRCULAR AND APPEARED TO BE 100 YARDS IN DIAMETER. TWO P-51'S UNDER GCI CONTROL WERE THEN SENT ON AN INTERCEPT COURSE. 

THE FIGHTERS WERE VECTORED AND MADE VISUAL CONTACT AT 12:22. FIGHTERS STAYED WITH OBJECT UNTIL 1:15.

THE P-51'S CLIMBED TO 40,000', FELL OFF, AND THEN CLIMBED TO 45,000'. THEY WERE UNABLE TO CLOSE WITH THE OBJECTS TO FIRE. THE OBJECT'S SIZE, ACCEPTING CONRAD'S ESTIMATE OF DISTANCE WAS 24-40' IN DIAMETER. THE PILOTS SAID THEIR OPTICAL SIGHT JUST "COVERED" THE OBJECT. THE FILMS WERE MADE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR. THE OBJECT APPEARED AS A FUZZY, SMALL IMAGE IN THE UPPER RIGHT OF THE FRAME WITH DISCERNABLE MOTION TO LOWER LEFT.

TWO IMPORTANT FACTS WERE ESTABLISHED: 1. THE P-51'S AND PILOTS COULD BE IDENTIFIED AS FAF AND UFO APPEARED SIMULTANEOUSLY. 2. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT ALL EYES AND CAMERAS WERE FIXED ON THE SAME OBJECT.

THE OBJECT WAS NOT A BALLOON, SINCE THE SPEED WAS TOO FAST. A SEARCHLIGHT WAS TURNED ON THE OBJECT, BUT IT DID NOT ALTER ITS COURSE. THE OBJECT MOVED UP AND DOWN AND SIDEWAYS V/S HORIZONTAL CONTINUOUSLY. ELECTRONIC OR VISUAL SIGNS OF METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA IS OUT OF THE QUESTION, SINCE RADAR SET WAS ON HIGH BEAM, AND BOTH WOULD NOT OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE SAME PLACE. THE SIGHTING OCCURRED "ABOVE THE WEATHER".
