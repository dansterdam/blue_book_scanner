Incident: 133
N/3
Pilot and radar observer

A cagle from FEAF reported that an unidentified aircraft was visually sighted by the pilot and radar observer of an F-51 on 13 Oct 43. The observers state it was possible that it was an F-51 but they were definitely involved in the interception. The sighting occurred at about 1830. There was a tail and horizontal stabilizer seen through the haze. The position indicated a considerably higher speed than 400 mph. bright flames were seen. The speed of this aircraft was reported to be 2,000 mph. It also had a high rate of acceleration and could go almost straight up and down under control. The object seemed to gradually increase in size until it disappeared. The object remained in view for about 10 to 15 minutes.

The F-51 interceptor aircraft was visible to ground radar only temporarily. It did a series of maneuvers and then disappeared. The only contact on ground radar was a reflection of the interceptor aircraft. The F-51 pilot who sighted the object started chasing it at 10 miles and lost it after 4-1/2 miles. Four, five and six miles all picked up at the same time at 1800 RPM. That direction was also picked up 5-10 minutes later when the F-51 was approximately 9 miles ahead, slowly closed to within 13,000 feet and disappeared from the sight of the pilot. The ground radar was able to track the F-51 when the object would suddenly disappear from view.
