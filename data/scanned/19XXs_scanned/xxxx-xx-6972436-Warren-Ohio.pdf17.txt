1764 ft. east of intersection of Rial Road and Brooks Rd. in Warren, Ohio. Didn't lighted greenish-blue in color. These objects were past describable as anything like stars, planets, aircraft, etc. They seemed to be flying in formation and in some manner connected to each other. There appeared to be about 5 or 6 individual objects, separate but somehow coordinated in their flight pattern and motion. Appeared solid, separate, silent objects.
