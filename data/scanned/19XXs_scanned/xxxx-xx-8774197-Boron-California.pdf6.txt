Text from the document:

Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

To whom it may concern:

My civil defense watch was from Midnight Aug 15th to 4:00 AM. 

At the close of the watch when calling the center advising that we were leaving the post we were requested to check a light east of Winters and near Woodland. We did see an object - two in fact - which later dispersed - two in fact.

As we did not believe any importance would be attached to this incident we did not report back to the filter center our determination. Nothing could be possibly gained by filling the attached questionnaire.

Very truly yours,

ABILE MOTOR COMPANY
