Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sir,

Recently I sent you three negatives and two prints of a U.F.O. that I observed on March 13, 1967. I am certain it is as it was well worth send me my negatives and prints if possible. The negatives just send time no prints. If I may be so bold to ask you would you make only print singles by inches, and return to me as soon as possible.
Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
Lexington, Missouri
