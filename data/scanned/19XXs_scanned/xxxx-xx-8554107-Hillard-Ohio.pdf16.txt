d. "Sore spot on observer's neck. (Claimed as a reaction burn)." The spot was on the nape of the neck at the collar line. It appeared the size and shape of a man's thumb print. As the limb or object which was believed to have caused this was not seen, it is difficult to determine if it was caused by physical contact or proximity only. No physical evidence of any sign of disturbance. No instrument produced radiation background indication.

14. Observer Statement: The observer statement and UFO (Catch #3) are attached. Old initial (Catch #2) are attached.

This report has been delayed in the hope that further proof might be obtained by the observer either to confirm or identify. No evidence has been obtained to negate his earlier statements. During several attempts to obtain further data, the observer has maintained that what he observed was of an unidentified nature, and no further data has been offered to the writer to indicate that this event was anything but as the observer originally stated.
