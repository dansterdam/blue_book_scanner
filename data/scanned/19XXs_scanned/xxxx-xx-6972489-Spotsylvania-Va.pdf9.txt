It is estimated to have lasted about 15 minutes. As it appeared low and approached toward us, I paid close attention all the while, noting the various changes that occurred. The object appeared first as a dimly lighted four or five foot ball of light about five feet above the ground, hovering motionless. It then rose slowly and silently to a height of perhaps 80 or 100 feet, where it remained stationary for a few minutes. It then dropped straight down to within about 20 feet of the ground, hovered there for a time, then shot straight up and out of sight, leaving a luminous trail behind. Throughout its maneuvers it gave off a steady, soft white light and although it appeared quite large when close, there was no outline or definite shape visible - just the uniform glow.
