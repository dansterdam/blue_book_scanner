Mystery in Sky Near Vina
By BOB KENNEDY
A large, bright object, described to be the size of a large car or small bus, was observed hovering over a field near the Wooster Bridge, near Vin
a, early this morning. Tom Kitchen, a ranch hand, reported that while he was working in a field on a tractor shortly after 4 this morning, the large unidentified objecto hovered behind him at treetop level. Tabana County Sheriff Deputies said Kitchen reported that the mysterious object was very bright, accor
ding to reports, Kitchen noticed his re-winding mechanism on his tractor was not working properly, and that the object seemed to be interfering with his tractor through a scope on his rifle. He then notified the sheriff's department, Highway Patrol and the Corning Police Department. Undersheriff Bill Gonzales said this morning that the object ws
sighted when officers arrived at the scene, and thrown high powered handsets, rocks and such, but the object appeared to tolerate these onslaughts without much change in its position and speed, much higher than a large star.
According to eyewit
nesses said Gonzales, the bright object came into the sky and it appeared to shrink, and then it grew to a bright light again, and back again to bright.
In the same general area, several area residents noticed a similar object was seen by two drivers nearby.
According to Gonzales, the deputy said that the object followed a passing train for some distance, then returned to where he was watching. What the bright mysterious object was remains a mystery today.
