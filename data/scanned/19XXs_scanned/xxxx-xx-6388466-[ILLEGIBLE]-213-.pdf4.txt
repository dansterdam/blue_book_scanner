7 December 1944
MEMORANDUM
To: Commanding General, Air Material Command
Attention: Intelligence Division (MCI)
1. At the suggestion of Major General Craigie, the following statement is respectfully submitted for evaluation:
On 12 December 1944, while driving east on Maumee (Wapakoneta) Road approaching Farmer's Ford Road, there was a light which may have been a very bright star, or more specifically, a light of intelligence. The light was in the sky directly ahead, as a midpoint which I estimate as about 200 feet away.
I recalled the sighting of my passenger. This was the opinion of a passenger, which is the basis of the following:
1. It seemed to me to be the size of a medium-sized airplane. It also gave the impression of a circular configuration, although I did not see it as clearly defined.
2. It appeared to be stationary or hovering, and then abruptly disappeared. This disappearance was as if the flame were suddenly extinguished.
The exact time of the incident was approximately 5:45 p.m. The location was approximately ten miles west of Dayton, Ohio, on the Maumee (Wapakoneta) Road. The weather conditions were clear, and dark. Distance and altitude of the object are estimated as a maximum of 200 feet away, and less than 500 feet in altitude.
