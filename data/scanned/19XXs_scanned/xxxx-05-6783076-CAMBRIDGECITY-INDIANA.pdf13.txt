Text from the document:

AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SAUCER AS REPORTED BY THE GROUNDED PILOT OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES AT THE CAMBRIDRE CITY, INDIANA BASE STATION TO HQ 5TH AIR FORCE
THE PILOT DESCRIBED THAT AS HE CAME OVER THE CREST OF THE HILL EAST OF THE CAMBRIDRE CITY BASE HE SAW A
STRANGE CRAFT-LIKE OBJECT, SHINING SILVERY, AND SOME 30 TO 40 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT WAS HOVERING ABOUT 500 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH OR NORTHWEST OF HIS POSITION. THE PILOT DESCRIBED IT AS A "WING-LESS AIRCRAFT" WITH NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION, AND IT WAS ROTATING SLOWLY COUNTER-CLOCK WISE
THE PILOT STATED THE OBJECT REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN ACCELERATED STRAIGHT UP AT A GREAT RATE OF SPEED TO AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 15,000 FEET WHERE IT SIMPLY DISAPPEARED FROM HIS VIEW
BASED ON THE PILOT'S DESCRIPTION AND THE ATTACHED SKETCH, IT SEEMS THAT WHAT HE WITNESSED WAS INDEED AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL FLYING SAUCER CRAFT OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN
