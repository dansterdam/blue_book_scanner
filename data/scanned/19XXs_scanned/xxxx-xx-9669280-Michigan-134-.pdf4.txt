HIS DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS AS FOLLOWS:
A BRIGHT, ROTATING LIGHT, APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET IN DIAMETER, ROTATING IN A COUNTER-CLOCKWISE MOTION AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING COLOR FROM WHITE TO GREEN TO RED. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING MOTIONLESS FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES, THEN SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.
