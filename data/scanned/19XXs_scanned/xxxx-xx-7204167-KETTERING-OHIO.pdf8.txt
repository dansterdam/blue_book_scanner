THIS APPEARS TO BE A DISK SHAPED OBJECT WITH SOME TYPE OF LANDING GEAR OR MECHANISM AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE SOME TYPE OF LIGHT ARRANGEMENT NEAR THE CENTER OF THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT MOVED SLOWLY AND SILENTLY IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7 MINUTES FROM 8:25 TO 8:32 P.M. ON AUGUST 7, 1950 AT KETTERING, OHIO. IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT AND THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED AGAINST A CLEAR SKY. IT MOVED SLOWLY AND AT A UNIFORM HEIGHT ABOVE THE GROUND FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF THE OBSERVATION. THIS APPEARS TO BE A LEGITIMATE OBSERVATION AND THE OBSERVER STATED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. HIS FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT IT WAS SOME TYPE OF EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT, BUT AFTER OBSERVING IT FOR SOME TIME HE WAS CONVINCED THAT IT WAS NOT OF CONVENTIONAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
