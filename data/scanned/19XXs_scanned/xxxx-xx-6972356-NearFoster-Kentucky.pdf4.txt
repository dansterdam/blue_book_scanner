DEPT (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70216/S.J.C 1 July 1968
UFO OBSERVATION, 2 April 1968
Neville, Ohio 43150
1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of 2 April 1968.
2. We feel that you probably observed an aircraft with an electrical visual advertising display. This plane was Cassens 1/2 in the Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio and Lexington, Kentucky area. This plane operates at speeds of 50 to 60 m/h. and when some of the advertising lights are not operating, it may be mistaken for a UFO.
3. Past descriptions of this plane are very similar to the description of your sighting. The attached material on electrical aerial advertising may be of interest to you.
