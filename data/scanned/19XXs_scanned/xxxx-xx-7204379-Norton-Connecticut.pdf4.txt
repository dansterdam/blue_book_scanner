The image does not contain a photograph, but rather two illustrations. The first illustration shows a curved line with an object above it, and the instructions ask the viewer to imagine that the object is a UFO and to draw how they believe the object moved based on the curved line. The second illustration shows a larger sketch of a landscape with a person standing in the middle, and instructions to refer to this larger sketch as an example of how to complete the previous illustration.

Text transcribed from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show its position when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
