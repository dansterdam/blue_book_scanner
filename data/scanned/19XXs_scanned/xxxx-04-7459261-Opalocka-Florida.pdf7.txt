THE METEORITE 

On the evening of April 7, 1952, at approximately 8:30 p.m., various residents of Opa-locka, Florida, witnessed the appearance of an unidentified flying object. The object was described as a bright light which seemed to hover over the area for a few minutes before shooting straight up into the sky and disappearing.

According to the report, the object was first spotted by a civilian named Vernon Ledford, who was outside his home at the time. Ledford immediately alerted his neighbors, and several other people in the area also observed the strange light in the sky.

The report states that the object was estimated to be about the size of a car and was emitting a bright, glowing light. It was said to have hovered motionless for a short period before rapidly ascending and vanishing from view.
