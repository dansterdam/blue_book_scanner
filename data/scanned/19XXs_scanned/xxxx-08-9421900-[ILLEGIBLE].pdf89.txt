On about August 20th, a few days before the above incident, two Coast Guardsmen in Portsmouth saw a dull, silver-colored cylinder stop by a 340-foot-high tower, used for Station WYAH-TV. The object appeared to be 50 feet long and 8 feet high. After hovering for about 30 seconds, it sped off and disappeared within a few seconds. The TV station noticed no interference with its transmission at the time of the sighting.
