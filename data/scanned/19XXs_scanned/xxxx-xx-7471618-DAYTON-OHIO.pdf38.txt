There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text visible in the document:

"THEY CAME ABOUT 15 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND SEEMED TO BE LANDED IN FIELD ABOUT 130 FEET AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER AT A POINT JUST BEHIND SOME TREES ON THE FARM. THEY WERE SORT OF ROUND AND SHAPE LIKE HALF-MOON OR SAUCER. THE COLOR OF THE CRAFT WAS DULL GRAY AND LOOKED VERY BRIGHT ON THE UNDER SURFACE. I COULD SEE NO MARKINGS OR WINDOWS ON THE CRAFT. IT APPEARED TO BE RESTING ON LEGS OR SOME KIND OF LANDING GEAR. IT SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY SILENT AND MADE NO NOISE. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO BE OCCUPIED BY 4 OCCUPANTS WHO SEEMED TO BE EXAMINING A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS RESTED ON A TRIPOD. AFTER ABOUT 5 TO 7 MINUTES, THE CRAFT TOOK OFF STRAIGHT UP AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN JUST SECONDS. THERE WAS NO FLAME OR EXHAUST OBSERVED. I DID NOT SEE ANY WINDOWS OR DOORS ON THE CRAFT WHILE IT WAS ON THE GROUND."
