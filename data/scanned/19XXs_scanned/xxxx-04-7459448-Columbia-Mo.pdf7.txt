The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a form from the Federal Aviation Agency, specifically a "ROUTE SLIP" addressed to James G. Tannett, Colonel USAF. The remarks section states that reference attached letters from April records have been destroyed, but further details are provided about the destruction of these records and their potential relevance to an unspecified incident or sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

REMARKS:
Reference attached letters, April records have been destroyed however we do have nonemmergency parachute jumping occurring daily and about 5 to 10 miles South rioting, I believe this could have been the sightings on the reference dates given. We believe helicopter calls especially when jumping is taking place South of the city reference trying XXXXXXX.
