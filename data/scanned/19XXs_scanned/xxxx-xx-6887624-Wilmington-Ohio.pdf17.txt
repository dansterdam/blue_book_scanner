15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENOM. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ON WITNESS DESCRIPTIONS, AND INDICATE CLEARLY BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

THEN OPEN AND CLOSE YOUR EYES TO SEE WHAT FRACTION OF THE KNOWN OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH. THIS WILL GIVE A ROUGH APPROXIMATION OF THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON AS VIEWED BY THE WITNESS.
