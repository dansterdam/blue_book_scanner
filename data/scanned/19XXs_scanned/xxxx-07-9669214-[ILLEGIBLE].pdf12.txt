The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text extracted from the document:

Incident, MSG -- Diringham, Alabama -- 6 July 1947

This incident has no obvious astronomical explanation.

The photograph purported to be a part of the report of the incident is not documented. There is no proof in the evidence at hand that it shows the objects described. From the word description alone, which is quite limited, the objects could be explained simply as "vertical ascent", "traveled in arc." Data is too meager for a definite conclusion.

If the photograph is authentic, it would be extremely valuable to show the manner speed at which it was taken, since from this the angular velocity could be determined.
