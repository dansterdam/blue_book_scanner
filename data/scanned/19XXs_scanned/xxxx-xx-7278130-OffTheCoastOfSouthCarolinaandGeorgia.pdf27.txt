BARIUM LAUNCHES
TO COLOR SKY
OF EAST COAST

With favorable weather conditions, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will launch barium vapor clouds into the upper atmosphere from Wallops Island, Va., at sunset no earlier than October 3 and 4.

The huge glowing green and purple clouds may be visible over much of the eastern United States, hundreds of miles from the launch site.

Objectives of the experiments are: (1) to obtain measurements of electric fields and wind motion in the upper atmosphere by photographing and tracking the movement of ionized barium clouds; and (2) measurement of attenuation on passage of radio signals through the ionized barium plasmas.
