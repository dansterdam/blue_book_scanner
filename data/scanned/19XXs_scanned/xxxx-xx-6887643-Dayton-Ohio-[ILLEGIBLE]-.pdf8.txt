4A. HOW IS MAKING YOU ANT AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE POSITION IN WHICH THIS PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH IT MOVED.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN THE MOVEMENT IS AT AN ANGLE AND NOT STRAIGHT UP OR DOWN.
