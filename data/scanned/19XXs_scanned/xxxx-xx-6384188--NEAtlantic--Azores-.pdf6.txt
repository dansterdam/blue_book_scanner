26 September 1952
Azores Islands

Description of Incident:
At approximately 0116Z (2316 local time), a C-121 enroute from Harmon AFB, Newfoundland to the Azores observed two distinct green lights 15-20 degrees off the right wing and slightly below the aircraft. The lights were observed for approximately 8 minutes and were reported to the pilot of the aircraft. The lights were described as very bright, stationary, triangular in shape, and estimated to be alternately leading each other. The lights were visible until the aircraft sighted the Azores.
All other known aircraft in the area were checked with the tower and established that they were too far away to be seen. Surface vessels were also checked but more were in the area.
The weather was CAVU.

Comments:
The only possibility considered is another light phenomenon similar to the so-called "green fireballs" that have been reported over various areas, including the Azores. In addition, all aircraft flying in that area keep their position known to the Air Force, so they can be added in an emergency. The only other possible explanation would be unfriendly and again this is doubtful.

The light phenomenon is possible since the light wing carries an man light, and the description is similar to several proposed phenomena. However, the exact nature of this proposed phenomenon has not been determined and can only be attributed to this.

Conclusion:
Unknown
