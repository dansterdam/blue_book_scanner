1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, TGXAS, dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects", concerning a report of an incident observed 22 March 1949.

2. The unidentified sightings 175 thru 233 were checked against routine weather-balloon sightings made by the Air Force. Navy and weather balloon reports from this source are included.

3. It is recommended that the "guide to investigation of unidentified aerial objects" as outlined by the following item 12, Direction of Flight of Object, should be clarified so that vertical and horizontal motion, acceleration and deceleration, could be better determined.
