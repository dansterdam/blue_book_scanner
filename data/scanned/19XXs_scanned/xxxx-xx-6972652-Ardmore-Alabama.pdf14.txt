Dear sir,

Yesterday afternoon this letter to you concerning an object I saw yesterday afternoon, the sky and clear. What appeared to be a craft was hovering over the vicinity where I was out hunting, I stopped what I thought was a plane, I noticed it was not moving as a plane, but I remained looking at it for about 30 seconds or more, It seemed to me to be very strange, as it did not make a noise or move in any normal jet pattern, but remained stationary. I was down in a field to try to get a better look at it as it was at an angle of about 45 degrees from the horizontal, then it seemed to make some kind of flip, and disappear, I was very much impressed with this object, and would like to report it, are you interested in such reports, kindly advise. Thank you.
Yours truly,
