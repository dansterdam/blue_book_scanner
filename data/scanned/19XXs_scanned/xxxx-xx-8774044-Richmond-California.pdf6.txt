The object sighted was at first dim, in the first sighting, a blus-white light that became brighter to a brilliant orange, and then dimmed again. It appeared that the object was surrounded by a glow during the sightings.

However, that could vary possibly be caused by the extreme brightness. To give some indication of the brightness, it would be about the intensity of colored auto headlights on full beam.

The color of the orange light would be comparative to a cigarette with the ash glowing. 

Each time the object would turn the bright orange, it would gain speed and the maneuvering would be startling. While the object appeared the brightest orange when viewed directly, at this time, since the jet would be travelling away from the eye in a straight direction, any motion to the object would be minimal since the maximum velocity component would be in the line of sight. But since the jet appeared the brightest orange when viewed directly, at this time, it was no comparison in brightness to the object I viewed this night.

Also, I have had the opportunity to see the aircraft (jet) at night at a distance close enough to cause the differing focus, and it was no comparison in brightness to the object I viewed this night.
