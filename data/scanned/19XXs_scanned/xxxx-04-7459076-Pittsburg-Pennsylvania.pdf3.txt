The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing an illustrated sketch and handwritten text.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the shift.

90°  |  75°

60°

45°
   | 30°
     |  15°
       |   0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
