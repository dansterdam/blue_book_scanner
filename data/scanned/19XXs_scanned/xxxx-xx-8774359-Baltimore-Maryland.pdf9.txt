Air Ponce Letter 200-5:

1. At 2230 on 11 August 1962 a pilot was proceeded from the Brandywine Airport to Washington, D.C. When the pilot wag at an altitude of approximately 11,000 feet and about 20 miles southeast of Baltimore, Maryland, he observed a bright light which appeared to be following his aircraft.

2. The light was first observed astern and slightly above the airplane's altitude. The pilot noted that the light seemed to be closing in on his aircraft and on occasion would blink out and then reappear a short distance away. It continued to follow the aircraft for approximately 20 minutes and then disappeared.

3. The weather was clear and visibility was excellent. The pilot estimated the size of the light to be about one-fifth that of the moon. The light appeared to be approximately 5 to 10 miles behind the aircraft. The pilot stated that he was unable to determine the exact nature of the light, but that it did not appear to be a star, planet, or any conventional aircraft.
