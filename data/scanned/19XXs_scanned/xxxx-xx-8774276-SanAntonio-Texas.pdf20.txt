ACTION
PRIORITY: ROUTINE
TO: COMMANDING GENERAL, AIR MATERIAL COMMAND, WRIGHT FIELD, OHIO: ATTN, OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE
FROM: COMMANDING GENERAL, AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO
CITE: SA-442
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON
1. THE FOLLOWING UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVED BY MEMBERS OF CREW IN THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A LIGHT SEEN IN THE SKY OVER SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS. A VISUAL OBSERVATION WAS MADE WITHOUT OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS.
2. THE LIGHT WAS OBSERVED TO BE IRREGULAR IN SHAPE, BRIGHT ENOUGH TO BE VISIBLE IN THE SKY AND WAS MOVING SLOWLY IN A HORIZONTAL PATH. THE LIGHT WAS OBSERVED FOR A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 5 MINUTES. NO OTHER WITNESSES WERE OBSERVED IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. 
3. THIS OFFICE HAS STUDIED REPORTS OF SIMILAR AERIAL PHENOMENA OBSERVED BY PERSONNEL OF THE ARMED FORCES AND CIVILIAN OBSERVERS. BASED ON THIS STUDY, IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE OBSERVED LIGHT COULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF A METEOR OR SIMILAR NATURAL PHENOMENON. HOWEVER, THE PROLONGED OBSERVATION AND OTHER FACTORS SUGGEST THAT A DETAILED TECHNICAL AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THE OBSERVED AERIAL PHENOMENON.
