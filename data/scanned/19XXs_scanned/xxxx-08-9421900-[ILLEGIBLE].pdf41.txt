Cigars over Littleove?

Our first reaction to this report was
that it was about a high-flying jet
with the wings of a vapour trail, but
according to the Daily Telegraph of August 18, Lieut-
Commander Reynold of Littleove and four 
residents in the area watched 
a long cigar-shaped object travelling at 
tremendous speed, followed a similar
course, and then a smaller object appeared and
travelled in the same direction.
A small black object, at the front,
apparently gave out a brilliant light.
The witness had a beam on it,
and another stopped on the ground
bottom and followed a similar
course.
Time of sighting: About 12.
