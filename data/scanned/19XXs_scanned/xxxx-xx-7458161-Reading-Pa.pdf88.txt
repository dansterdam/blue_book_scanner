I received a telephone call at 9:30 p.m. on the night of 22 April 1956. The caller, a Mrs. Boright, asked me to come to Beverly, Massachusetts immediately to investigate some "flying objects" that had been seen by a group of people. I immediately left my home in Braintree, Massachusetts and drove to Beverly, arriving there about 10:00 p.m. I met Mrs. Boright and several other witnesses at 63 Dudley Road and proceeded to interview them regarding their sightings.
