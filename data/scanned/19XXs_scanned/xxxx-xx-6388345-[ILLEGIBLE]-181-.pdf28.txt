STATEMENT
28 January 1949

1. I, OLIVER HEMPHILL JR., 1st Lt. USAF AO-784156, age 26, do hereby make the following statement:

2. Present Duty: Assistant Operations Officer and Night Fighter Pilot, with the 68th Fighter Squadron, 347th Fighter Group (AW) APO 75. 

3. On the night of 15 October 1948 my radar observer and myself were flying a routine airborne alert mission approximately 50 miles out to sea northwest of Fukuoka, Japan. At approximately 2305 I time we made our first contact with our Airborne Radar Set with a target we assumed to be a F-51. We attempted a practice interception, but the target put on a tremendous burst of speed and climbed so fast that we were unable to stay with it. At this point the intercepting aircraft was traveling at approximately 300 mph and descending at 3500 feet per minute. This was a head-on interception. When the target passed under us we executed a chandelle back to our original altitude of approximately 6,000 feet. Our second target was immediately picked up on the scope, and a stern interception was attempted, but the aircraft immediately outdistanced us. At this time we were puzzled by the tremendous bursts of speed exhibited by the supposed F-51s. The third target was spotted visually by myself. I had an excellent silhouette of the target thrown against a very reflective undercast by a full moon.
