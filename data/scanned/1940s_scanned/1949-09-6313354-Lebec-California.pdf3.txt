OSI Case #24-30

ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF INFORMATION (Cont'd)

4. Weather reports from Mather Air Force Base, California, indicate
that a pilot balloon for winds aloft testing purposes was released at Sandberg,
California, shortly prior to 1300 hours, 5 September 1949. Pilot balloons are
approximately twenty-six (26) inches in diameter, with an ascension rate of
two hundred (200) to two hundred and sixty (260) yards per minute, and the
type generally used on a clear day, such as reported on 5 September at Sandberg,
is white in color. According to the Sandberg Winds Aloft Report, at this time
the balloon would have drifted northwest towards Lebec during the first two
thousand (2,000) feet of ascension, and then veered northeast towards Mojave,
California.

Note that some text is redacted and represented by the mention "[redacted]". There are two scribbled, roughly horizontal marks on the bottom which are perhaps intended to be the sketches referred to in the document, but they are very unclear in the photocopy.
