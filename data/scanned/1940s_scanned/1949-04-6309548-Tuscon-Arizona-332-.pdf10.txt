NARRATIVE SUMMARY

At approximately 5:45 P.M. on 23 April 1949, I sighted an object in the air NE of Tucson, Arizona, just over the rim of the Catalina mountains. This object was very bright and appeared to be reflecting the sunshine. From my points of observation, this object was first sighted at approximately a 90 degree angle of elevation, and I would judge it to be at that time about 300 miles NE of Tucson. This object was first sightly approximately 12 minutes after which time it disappeared suddenly, just as calmly blinking your eye in the distance. I watched standing in a curved trajectory, but I believe this object was traveling in a straight line and from my point of observation, the illusion was curved. I would judge this object to be travelling in excess of 100 miles an hour at an altitude of from 5 to 10 miles up. It appeared to be saucer-like in shape, with no fins, wings or protuberances of any sorts. It seemed to be revolving similar to a slow roll of an airplane. It was most visible when it reached a position were it reflected the sun's rays, but it also could be seen when its face was turned away from the sun. From the time and site of the object in the air, so it's actions over this period, I would judge it to be the size of a city block. I did not hear any noise nor was there any exhaust or vapor trails.

I was in the company of Mr. [redacted] and [redacted], and the three of us were standing near the corner of [redacted] Drive while this object was in sight. There were no openings visible, windows or any other identifiable marks. The only way I can describe it is that it was saucer-like in shape, and since this was not a conventional aircraft nor to the best of my knowledge a balloon, I can give no reasonable explanation as to exactly what this object was as I saw it.
