At 2054, 20 Dec 48, we saw the object described below making a path thru the sky. It was travelling in an almost flat trajectory and its declination formed an angle with the horizon of approximately 20°. The angle of elevation from our point of observation was approximately thirty°. The object was moving at a very fast rate of speed and disappeared behind the mountain directly to the northeast of Pt. Eagle. Total time of visibility was about one and one-half seconds.

Description:

An intense blue-white light about the size of a basketball. As the object traversed the sky, there was a faint trail of light behind it, and two objects the size of a baseball separated from the main body. These objects were of the same color and intensity as the main body, and trailed behind it directly in its path at even intervals of distance equal to approximately three times the diameter of the main body. The size of the main body was approximately one quarter the size of the moon.
