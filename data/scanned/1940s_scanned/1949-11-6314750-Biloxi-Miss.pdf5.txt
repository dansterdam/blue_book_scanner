SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

The following information is taken from an article in the CHATTANOOGA TIMES, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 21 November 1949

"CITY FOLK LOOK UP, SEE THINGS IN THE SKY

Chattanoogans were looking up and seeing things again yesterday. The things were described as 'flying machines without wings—12 of them' and 'a great ball of fire.'

"Mrs. _________ of _________ Drive, said she looked up from a car parked near the intersection of Brainerd and Airport roads and saw the sunlight of yesterday afternoon reflected on a dozen round-shaped silvery things like parachutes. She said they were flying in three V's. She said she later inquired at the airport and was told no flight of that kind had communicated with the field.

"A gentleman of Lupton City said he was startled at 5 o'clock yesterday morning by a great ball of fire that flashed across the southern sky from west to east and then seemed to explode before it vanished in midair.

"A meteor was reported seen here and elsewhere in the Southeast last Wednesday midnight."
