Mr. --------------------
Executive Secretary

Peekskill, New York

Dear Mr. ---------------:

Receipt of your letter, dated 25 July 1949, is respectfully acknowledged by this Headquarters.

Your reported sighting has been made a matter of record and is being incorporated into our present study of unidentified aerial objects.

Although the information submitted does not contain sufficient detail to enable positive identification, there appears to be a marked similarity between the appearance of these objects and that of plastic research balloons in flight. Under changing light and weather conditions, these objects have been known to appear as discs and behave in the manner described in your letter.

In view of the above, it is believed the breakdown experienced by the radio station probably was due to technical difficulties and that the appearance of these objects at this time was purely coincidental.

Your action in writing this Headquarters regarding this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

W. R. CLINGMAN
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Analysis Division
Intelligence Department
