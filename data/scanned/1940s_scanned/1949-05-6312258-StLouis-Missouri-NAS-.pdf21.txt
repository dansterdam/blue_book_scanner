About 2100 LCDR [redacted] and I were leaving Ships Service walking
in an easterly direction. As we cleared the buildings so that 
we had an unobstructed view to the south we both noticed a ball
of fire in the sky moving from east to west. The ball of fire
appeared to be from fifteen to thirty degrees above the horizon.
My observation of its movement was through an angular distance
of approximately ninety degrees. There was no increase or decrease
in intensity of light during the time I was in view. It suddenly
disappeared as if moving behind some obstruction.
