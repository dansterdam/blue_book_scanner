Incident No. 62 - 8 September 1947, 2200-2300 hours, Logan, Utah.
A man and his wife, together with five other unidentified people, observed five
groups each of 35-50 small objects, yellowish-white in color, flying several
thousand feet in the air at a high rate of speed. The weather was cloudy.

ATIC Opinion: From the limited evidence submitted, it is practically
impossible to formulate a conclusion. Fast motion could be attributed to close-
ness rather than to true linear distance. In an atmosphere of darkness, any im-
pression may be erroneous. Ground lights reflected from moving, low-hanging
clouds, themselves not visible, could readily account for this report. Light
colored birds are another possibility.
