Northeast between the altitudes of 7 to 12 thousand feet above sea
level. The same chart for 1900 hours (PST) indicated that the wind
had shifted to the West and had increased to 20 miles per hour.
GRAHAM stated that there was a wedge of cold air moving Eastward
across this area and had passed the Bend, Oregon, area between 0700
and 1000 hours (PST). Mr. GRAHAM also stated that due to the lack of
weather stations within 150 miles of Bend, Oregon, and the nearness
of the Cascadia Mountain Range, only a generalization of existing con-
ditions could be made.
