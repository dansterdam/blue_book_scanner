The document contains two black and white photographs. 

The first photograph depicts what appears to be a disc-shaped object with a partially visible fuselage and cockpit to the right, situated within a dimly lit area that could suggest being indoors or under a structure.

The second photograph shows the same disc-shaped object from a different angle, with its surface and structure more visible. There appears to be debris and another piece of equipment in the background, which the text describes as a rotor plane.
