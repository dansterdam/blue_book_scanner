The image shows a blurry, grainy black and white photograph that appears to be of a cloudy or hazy sky, possibly during nighttime due to the darkness of the scene. It's difficult to discern details, but there seem to be lighter patches or possibly illuminated areas in the cloud cover. No distinct shapes or objects are clearly identifiable as UFOs or other specific phenomena. The quality of the photograph is poor, which adds to the ambiguity of the content.

As for the text above the photograph, it's very faint and not all is legible, but here's what can be made out:

To the right, there seems to be some handwriting that reads "Astro (Meteor?)" suggesting that someone might have speculated that the phenomenon might be astronomical in nature, potentially a meteor. Please note that due to the poor quality of the document, many details cannot be confidently made out, and the text provided is to the best of my ability to decipher what's visible.
