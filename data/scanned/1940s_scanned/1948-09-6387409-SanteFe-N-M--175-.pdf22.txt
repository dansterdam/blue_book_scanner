2. REPORT OF FINDINGS

The following information concerning Waco, Texas on 8 October 1948
at Santa Fe, New Mexico on 23 September 1948;

a. Weather at time object was sighted was ceiling and visibility un-
limited. object was first seen at 0945.

b. The only drawing of the object that could be furnished would be a
perfect circle. Therefore, it was deemed unnecessary to obtain a sketch.

c. The object appeared to be a perfect circle, approximately 100 to
150 feet in diameter and white in color. At first the object seemed to move in 
a semi-circle, from South to East and finally to North East. This may have been
an optical illusion. The estimated altitude was 30,000 feet, and because of this
great height, the speed and maneuverability could not be ascertained. During the
period of observation this object made no sound and did not crash in an exhaust
trail. After this observed movement, the object remained stationary.

d. I. Anglar has been a pilot since 1922 and is familiar with all types
of conventional aircraft. He observed this object from 0945 until 0950 and then
again at 1000. These observations were also made by **** and **** in the vicinity
of Santa Fe, New Mexico.
