The image provided is of a page from a document with text. There is no photograph present. The text on the document is heavily distorted and blurred, making accurate transcription extremely challenging. While I cannot provide a reliable full transcription of the document due to the poor image quality, I will attempt to partially transcribe any legible snippets of text:

[The majority of the text is illegible]
...observer...
...Altitude...
...Clear...
...Continued...
...Altitude 10,000...
...Heading...
...Speed...
...Object disappeared...

Due to the quality of the image, many words and characters are indiscernible and any attempt at transcription would not yield accurate content. The document is too degraded for an OCR system to effectively process it.
