AIR TECHNICAL SERVICE
ATTE—Camden Air Depot, Georgia 102-122-79

To exclude irrelevant factors in a systematic manner, the information
presented in Exhibit "A" is presented in the order of occurrence and significance.

(1) Incident #1

A. Object was sighted 24 July 1946 between 0140 and 0245 EST from
the ground at Robins Air Force Base, Macon, Georgia.

B. Object was again sighted flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet by
——— and ——— while flying a C-47 some 20 miles south of
Montgomery, Alabama. The time of the sighting was 24 July 1946
at approximately 0245 EST.

C. Both the ——— sighting api that of ——— and ——— describe
the object as "cigar" or "cylindrical" in shape. ———
perceived only the glow emitted by it in
All obsevers agree that the object was traveling in a general
southerly heading and that it was trailed by a flame varying
in color and that it behaved like a normal craft insofar as
disappearing from the line of sight was concerned.

NOTE: It is a known fact that atmospheric conditions such as
varying degrees of humidity and incidence of light rays—
fraction often influence the color of the light observed.
This would serve to explain why many observers conflict
in their descriptions as to color of light displayed by
the object or its trail.

D. Four witnesses to this sighting are involved; there are trained
observers. In no instance were there any indications of mis-
V3rsity or ulterior influences involved.

E. Both the ——— account and that of ——— and ———
were officially made within a period of time that would preclude
any chance of impressions being gained from radio or newspaper
reports.

(2) Incident #2

Object #2 was observed by ——— and ——— at 0250
hours 24 July 1946, while airborne, between Blackstone, Virginia,
and Greensboro, North Carolina. This sighting is considered sep-
arately since the descriptions of speed as "meteoric" or "terrific"
the manner of travel described as an arc or horizontal, and the
fact that it "faded like a meteor" seem to indicate that the object
seen was not the one observed in Incident #1.

(3) Incident #3

This object was observed between 2100 and 2300 hours 26th July 1946
at ——— and ———, Georgia, by observers ——— and ——— This object was
not thought to be a meteor in that it maneuvered. The glow was
described as "varied" in color but predominately "brilliant" and "white".
The course was described as generally "southern".
