There is an image in the upper left corner of the document. The image depicts a sketch or drawing of an elongated object with what appears to be a trail behind it. Additionally, there are two circles, one above the elongated object and another on the trail. The sketch is not detailed, and it is not a photograph but a simple line drawing.

The text on the document is not entirely clear, but I will transcribe as much as I can from the image:
