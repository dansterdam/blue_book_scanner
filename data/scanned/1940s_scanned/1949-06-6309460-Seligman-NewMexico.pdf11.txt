U.S. Officers
Report Seeing
Flying Disks

BY MARVIN MILES
WHITE SANDS PROV-
ING GROUND, N.M., Aug.
29—Flying saucers—or at
least mysterious flying "ob-
jects"—have been sighted by
several personnel at this vital
center of America's upper air
research.

I talked with three men,
senior officers and an enlisted
technician who reported seeing
strange objects in the sky during
recovery a la high Frisbee, or as
requisition for a high-altitude
invisible airc.

Men in flash, these missile had
pointed out that other officers,
and engineers at White Sands
accept the reports and put them
down to imagination, weather,
hall-o'ween, dual images in high-
powered optical equipment, or
possibly distant planes reflecting
sunlight.

Xeresienceed Observers
Yet the men who gave their
words presumably are famili-
par with such posssible as sour-

The observer in this case nto

the upper air when the object

and averted for some 10 seconds

force of turn before it undap-

propulsion.

He added he had informed his
superiors of the incident and was
told "the next morning the had seen

'Weather Balloon?
A check of one officer elicited
the response: "It was probably a
'weather balloon," but the descri-
