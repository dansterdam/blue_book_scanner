SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

Reference is made to Par 2, Summary of Information, this office,
subject same as above, dated 29 October 1949. The following additional information
is furnished in regards to the interview with Mrs. Minnie Lytle: Mrs. Lytle stated
that the objects were approximately twenty-four (24) inches in circumference; that
the position of the objects in flight was in the horizontal position with the nose
forward; that there was no evidence of propellors on either of the objects, and that
both objects appeared to be perfectly straight with no tapers or curves. Mrs. Lytle
explained that her estimate of the dimensions of the objects was based on their
appearance aloft and not their actual sizes. (E-2)

On 1 November 1949, this office was informed by an official of Security 
Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that the officials of the
Weather Station of Plant “K-25”, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, report that one (1)
thirty-two (32) inch weather balloon was released at that station every hour,
approximately on the hour from 0600 to 2400, on 27 October 1949, but that no other
meteorological instruments were released on that date. (B-2)
