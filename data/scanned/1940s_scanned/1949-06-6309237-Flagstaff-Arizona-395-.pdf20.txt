The image provided appears to be a hand-drawn illustration, not a photograph. It illustrates an urban scene with buildings and a large, circular object with details in insets. There are three insets, two circles, and one semicircle, presumably showing different perspectives or features of the circular object. The drawing is quite rough and sketchy.
