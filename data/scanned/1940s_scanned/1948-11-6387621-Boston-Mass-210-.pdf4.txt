"Dear Sirs! I was awaks last night about 5:00 A.M., sitting by the window
seeing to a sick horse when suddenly three objects came into view, flying east to west
over the Charles River. Main object was flying higher than usual airplane route.
Objects had no lights - but city lights made thems visible like three pale moths.
The two outside ones going in a straight line, the middle one veering back and
forth - although at no grea~t height. There was no sound."

Yours very truly
