There are no photographs present in this image. The document is text-based with several sections redacted. However, the quality of the scanned document is very poor, making it difficult to make out much of the text. Here's the text I can discern:

ANE NO. _______

TIME OF SIGHTING: _______ night

COLOR: _______ yellowish red

SHAPE: _______ spherical

SPEED: _______ twice man's

------------------------------------------------
Observatory AFB: Point 394
(Jan 52)

The blanks, scribbles and redactions, alongside the low quality of the scan, prevent a clear reading of the entire document.
