'LOOKED LIKE BIG DIME'

Aircraft Worker Says
He Saw a Flying Disk

A flying disk that "looked just
like a big shiny dime" was seen
shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday
by: Everett Berger, an aircraft instru-
ment workert from his
home at 213 S 23rd St., Man-
hattan Beach.

But "It was only me, I might
be ready to admit that my eyes
were playing tricks," Berger said.
"But two of my neighbors saw it
too; In fact, they had been watch-
ing it before I noticed it."

Berger said that he is on warr
ond road airplane when he see
aeroninox onployet namy years
here, and the object he saw yes-
terday in no way resembled
an airplane.

Berger estimated the disk wus
aind fur ur miles east of his place
and at an altitude of 6000 to 8000
foet when he first saw it. He said
it appeared to be about 40 feet in
diameter.

"Something blinded me so I,
was elooth my garage door," |
Berger reported. "And then I
realized it was a silvery disk in
the sky. It hung shimmering in
mid-air and thun moved westward,
gaining altitude as it seemed to
glide in reverse, just east. It
didn't revolve."

Workers in the control tower
of the Los Angeles airport, just
north of where Berger said he
saw the disk in the sky, said they
had neither such an objer hear an-
nything about it. No other authority
ceived.

"We have of Just before 8 o'clock,"
that took any explanation place.

Peak Due Wednesday

Meteor Shower Seen Here

An unusually spectacular dis-
play of meteors will be visible in
the Dayton area during the next
three nights.

They may be visible at the rate
of 40 an hour at the peak of the
annual shower, which will rea
ched peak Wednesday, according
to Dr. Carl Howel. He is asso
ciate professor of mathematics at
the Air Force Institute of Technolo
logy at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base.

Dr. Howel said meteors were 
visible Thursday night at the rate
of 20 an hour. The speading
streaks of light seem to radiate
from the northeast part of the
sky in the vicinity of the constella-
tion Perseus.

Visibility of the shower is some
what handicapped by the fullness
of the moon, Dr. Howel said. The
meteors are best seen from mid-
night to dawn.

In explaining the meteors, Dr.
Howel said the earth moves into
a stream of meteoric particles en
counter during August. The partcles
were left behind by Tuttle's comet
when it crossed the earth's path in
1878, Dr. Howel said.

The meteors appear moving at
the rate of a pin head. About the
speed of more than 1000 miles an
hour, the particles begin to glow from friction of the atmos-
phere about 50 miles above the
earth. The particles vaporize in
a few seconds.
