There is no photograph present in the image, only text and some redacted/blackened out areas.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Incident #22 -- Spokane, Washington -- 21 June 1947

This incident does not have any, obvious astronomical
explanation.

The information given is too limited to suggest any definite
interpretation. It would seem, however, that the objects might pos-
sibly have been a series of balloons.
