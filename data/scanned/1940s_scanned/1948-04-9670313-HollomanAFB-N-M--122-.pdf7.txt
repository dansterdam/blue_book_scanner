The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page of a text document with some markings. Here is the text output from the document:

silent on the desert that afternoon and that no audible noise was heard
from the object. Neither was any signal nor atmospheric noise heard on
the 100-400 meter receiver to which he was listening at the time. He further
stated that the wind at high altitude that day was very calm being only
10 to 15 miles an hour from the west at 65,000 feet.

The statements of other witnesses to this incident are contained in
reports and 122b.

All witnesses agreed that the object was very high, moved faster than
any known aircraft, possessed a rounded, indistinct form, and disappeared
suddenly rather than fading away in the distance. It was under observation
1/2 minutes or slightly less. It was definitely not a balloon, and
apparently not manned, judging from the violent maneuvers which were
performed at a high rate of speed.
