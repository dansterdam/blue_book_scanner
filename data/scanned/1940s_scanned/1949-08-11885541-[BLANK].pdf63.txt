Incident #154, 1948 -- Columbus, Ohio -- 2 August 1948

This incident is in two respects unique among all those 
investigated: 1) it is the only object that is defined solely by 
an outline, appearing vacant inside, so that the sky was visible 
through it; and 2) it is similar to an object that this investi-
gator viewed as a boy.

The writer's recollection has remained vivid throughout 
these many years. The object he saw could best be described as a 
floating ellipse, like a wire hoop travelling slowly across the 
sky. The motion was uniform, and the form or the object changed 
slowly, as though the hoop were being distorted. The object was 
observed for at least ten minutes, with several witnesses, until it 
finally disappeared in the distance. The writer had dismissed the 
object as some sort of unusual atmospheric phenomenon, perhaps a 
travelling air pocket.

Because of the similarity between this observation and 
that reported in incident #154, the latter has a special interest 
to this investigator. In the recent incident, however, no tail 
of smoke is an added feature.

There is obviously no astronomical explanation for these 
incidents -- the most plausible explanation probably lies in the 
field of meteorology.
