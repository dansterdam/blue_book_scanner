was so convinced that they saw than that he had to make a report to
Washington on the matter.

My fellow newspapermen, working on their own, found a similar 
response among the officials whom they contacted.

"All of the scientists and military observers, whether or not
they had seen any, were agreed on this point: the saucers are not man-
made."

"David Lilienthal, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, dis-
misses as 'foolish' the suggestion that they may be something related

18. Since the above editorial deals in generalities, no specific ques-
tions were asked CONOVER as to his source for the information set out therein
but he volunteered that he "sort of dreamed it up."

19. It is noted that reference report indicates Commander McLAUGHLIN's
name DOUGLAS C. McLAUGHLIN, and that CONOVER'S article gives his name as 
Commander (Tsic) McLAUGHLIN. Since CONOVER could not remember the USN Com-
mander McLaughlin's name it is possible that none in reality, the correct first
name, If it might also be mentioned here that none interviewing seemed to indi-
cate that the name [redaction] (of the General Mills Aeronautical Laboratory) had
been revealed to them, although it appeared from their releases that the
contents of the report, singed [redaction] had been discussed with them.

20. One copy of this report is being forwarded to District Office NO. 12,
Scott AFB, for their possible information in the event Captain EDWARD D.
RUPPELT of that office posseses information which Captain McLAUGHLIN's
DETACHMENT has as yet not been interviewed.

21. In connection with any further investigation which is conducted by
District Office No. 17 it is requested that extreme care be used in question-
ing any Naval personnel on information furnished in this report by CLIFF
ROBERTS, newscaster, KMTR, Hollywood, since he was very cooperative during
this investigation and attempted to be very helpful.
