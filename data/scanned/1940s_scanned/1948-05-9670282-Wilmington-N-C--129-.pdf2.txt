Investigating Team, D. C.

Gentlemen,

Speaking of flying saucers. I thought to communicate with 
you about what happened to both of us the 1st time when
and as I said to you how it came to us. The place was blazing
over to our job. before we could make a head or tail 
out of it and the object was moving at such speed I tried
to show it to my
co-worker, co-captain of the team but before I could
get him to see the crew and look their way it was all
over with. It was round and like a disc. Then it looked
to be a sheen and that isn't a thing but just like a 
cold rush that went their time had been of course
like at first it Theresa etc, but Van told me when
I asked about late summer of 1941, it was troubling
tome would you know with me or with much.
can you just talk and tell me ?
Yours Truly,

[REDACTED]
