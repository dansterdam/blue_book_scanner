UNCLASSIFIED

about Sunset or 3 Aug 47, about 25 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Moscow an experienced American newspaper reporter saw an unidentfied [sic] object at very high altitude. It was long and narrow and proceeding at a high, but not excessive speed in a generally southwest-northeast direction. It shone very brightly probably from reflected sunlight. No wings could be seen and no sound was heard. It looked like a rigid airship and was so identified by a Russian acquaintance who saw it at the same time. However, the reporter, in spite of the appearance of the object was of the opinion that it was not a rigid airship due principally to its high speed. He had no theory to offer.

NA COMMENT: This object might have been anything. Its speed seems insufficient for a guided missile, but it could have been either a jet or conventional airplane at unusual left combinations and fore-shortening frequently give aircraft a freakish appearance. The possibility that it was a dirigible should not be excluded. Inference "A" should not be excluded.

REFERENCE "A": The upper winds in Russia are not published but it was noted that on the following morning there were high surface winds with storm predictions.
