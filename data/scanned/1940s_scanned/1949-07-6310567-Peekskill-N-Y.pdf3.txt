Dear Sir:

On Friday evening, July 22nd at about 8:45 p.m., my wife and thirteen year old daughter, in company with a young man, were walking on a country road immediately in the rear of our home on the outskirts of Peekskill, New York. They saw two flying discs. I did not see them myself, but have been watching with my camera in hand, hoping to might appear again. I called each one individually into a room and asked tim to describe what they saw. Each one seemed to have seen exactly the same thing.

They were whirling, or spinning, in the same direction in which they were traveling, and at a terrific speed as if being rolled across the sky. The discs being snow white stood out against a very blue sky. The outer-rounnded edge seemed solid but not sharp, due to the whirling motion. The first disc seerwed to have a bluish shadow in the center or was transparent, but the second one was solid white. They sped across the sky and disappeared behind a white cloud. The folks waited to see them come out of the cloud bank but they did not reappear. Either they dissolved in the cloud, or turned in such a direction that they were obscured by the cloud. They had a rather eerie and awesome effect on the three who witnessed the spectacle.

The young man `******` is the son of our Minister, Reverend Ernest `************` of Portchester, New York and is a concert pianist of considerable reputation. When you know him, you would not doubt his veracity. He was the first to see them and he attracted the attention of my wife and daughter. Most certainly, my wife and thirteen year old daughter would have no reason to prevaricate. All three were out walking a new dog which we recently purchased for our daughter. These three are
