Note: Some words were uncertain due to the quality of the text in the image, such as "MPIS" which might be "MPH" (miles per hour), "ICAF" which could refer to a military or civil air command (often it's USAF for United States Air Force), "PPI" referring possibly to Plan Position Indicator, and "Rawin" likely referring to a type of upper-atmosphere weather observation method or equipment.
