"San Simeon, Calif 4/12/49
To Gen Mark Clark

Dear Mr Clark,

Am writing you in re-guard to what I witnessed one night in late September, possibly the 7th, which no other person has ever seen. Have writted to AF at Los Angeles, they did not know who to write to, so am trying in S.F. Someone last night, which I encloss some On about 333 Vessels on duty at fishing castle, at all, at 5 o'clock was racing my rounds. Saw a light going between the two mts, stopped to look at it. In about two minutes another. Of course I began to wonder, stood there & counted 15 all pass between the two peaks. had of course read of flying discs. All on the third then in. Went coming in two minute intervals until eleven o'clock they we're traveling at very high speed. This is mountainous country here. Top wondered where they could have come from, were apparently flat From where I stood, seemed to be about 20 in, in diameter.

Will give you a little of my background so you will not think I have been seeing things. Have been with Ir. Hearst for 21 years when the war come along I volunteered at age of 52 years in coast guard, severed 3 years until Sep 1945, came back to ranch, spent most of my time in San Francisco, guard on the Embarcadero on ships and docks. Hoping this will be of some service to you.

I am, Yours Very truly,

P.S. these discs emerged from behind 2nd rock and assend out of sight behind Pat Garrity."
