Incident No. 122 - 5 April 1949, Holloman Air Force Base, New
Mexico.
Three balloon observers saw an object very high in the sky, moving
faster than any known aircraft and possessing a rounded distinct form,
which disappeared suddenly. It was seen less than thirty seconds and
was apparently not manned, judging by its violent maneuvers. For an-
alogous size they stated if the moon were the size of an orange, the ob-
ject would approximate the size of a discus.

ATIC Opinion: No explanation. However, the above comparison of
size is to be noted. A disc held at arms length would shield the moon
from the eye even if the moon appeared several times larger that it
does. To reduce the proportion then, this object must have appeared as
an infinitesimal point. From trained observers, this is certainly a
major discrepancy.
