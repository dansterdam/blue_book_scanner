The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a poorly scanned document with very faint text and some markings. Due to the quality of the scan and the faintness of the text, it is not possible to accurately transcribe the contents of the document as it is illegible. The only discernible text is the date marked in the top right corner, "20 July 47." If there is a better quality image or more context provided, I could attempt to provide further assistance.
