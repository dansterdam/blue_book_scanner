Fast Flying Disks
Reported In West
Shiny Object Said to Spurt
At 1,200 M. P. H.

New unidentifed term

Coin lecture multiplied yesterday
as incredulously started airman reported 
a new high speed disks careening
invisible through the sky- but
skepticism remained.

Following the report Wednesday at
Pendleton-Ore., to Kenneth Arnold
of Boise, Idaho, that he
had seen nine saucer-shaped, shiny 
objects climbing and skimming
through the sky between Mt.
Rainier and Mr. Adams in Washing-
ton State at an estimated 1200
miles an hour, came three observa-
tions yesterday.

Byron Savage, Oklahoma City
business man pilot, said that three
saucer-like objects hurtled through
the Arkansas air above him and dis-
appeared at a tremendous speed.

A Yakima, Criter, Wash.
recovery contractor, said that
on Wednesday before word spread
of possible objects, two were going
south in the hazy afternoon sky 
black and shiny.

He said they were "round at first"
in the cloud, but were quicker than
jet shape, however, he reported
engine sound and vapor trails.

Determined as Capt. Emil Smith
and crew, over Cascade
Mountains to Idaho, where Mr. Arnold
said he had seen "flying saucers".

The last two days had three sepa
rate plane flights there that find noth
spicular—though surely nothing could 
stand up to a mark 2 times sound itself.

At Eugene, Ore., E. L. Sprinkle
said he heartily saw yesterday air- 
termine of the week to vindicate or pill
a jibe. He took his 10-50 camera
to local bank, to withdraw special
deject in the northwest regional
compound iltlike that—but before
the proof of the same matter they
were openly put out of school.
