3. On 1 October 1949 Corporal -------------------------------------------- ASU,
Camp Holabird, Baltimore 19, Maryland, was interviewed, and stated in
substance:

While on duty as a Military Policeman on the Main Gate, Camp
Holabird, between 1517 and 1519 hours, 30 September 1949, he observed
two (2) unidentifiable aerial objects near the smoke stack of the
Chevrolet Assembly Plant which is adjacent to Camp Holabird. These  
objects appeared to hover between the smoke stack and a large tree,  
a relatively short distance away. --------------------------- described the objects as disc  
shape, much like an enlarged silver dollar, very shiny, but at such  
a distance as to prohibit actual observance of any specific color.  
A comparative measure as to the actual size of the objects was estimated  
as being approximately one half the diameter of the Chevrolet Assembly
Plant's smoke stack. Appropriate angle of elevation during the period  
of observation was estimated as about 15 degrees. The objects seemed to  
be proceeding in no apparent direction, but because of the uncertainity  
concerning the distance of the objects from the observer, it could be difficult  
to estimate any definite speed. -------------------- heard no sound that he would attribute  
to the objects and saw no flame or exhaust. The objects appeared to be  
without fins, canopies, or antenna. ------------------------- conditioner at the time of  
observation were evaluated as relatively clear; no clouds were present,  
although a slight ground haze is thought to be no existed. Position of the  
sun at time of observation was estimated as having 15 degrees in azimuth  
south of the objects, and an undetermined angular distance above. It was  
impossible to establish the manner of disappearance of objects inasmuch  
as the objects left ------------------- field of vision during an interruption caused  
by persons passing through the gate.

4. On 1 October 1949 Corporal ---------------------------------------------- 2111
ASU, Camp Holabird, was interviewed, and stated in substance:

At approximately 1530 hours, 30 September 1949, upon approaching
the Main Gate, Camp Holabird, his attention was called to an unidentifiable
object in the vicinity of the smoke stack of the Chevrolet Assembly Plant  
by Corporal ---------------- a guard on duty at the Main Gate. The objects appeared  
disc-like in structure, the center of which was raised much as though a  
segment of a smaller sphere had been place upon the disc, giving it somewhat  
of an inverted type saucer appearance. Apparent size was established as
