The image presented appears to be a scanned document page. The lower section of the document contains hand-drawn sketches that are related to the context of the UFO report. Each sketch represents a simplistic oval or circular shape, presumed to be the reported UFOs. Next to a few of the shapes, there are arrows indicating direction, with one cluster of arrows and text suggesting movement from "WEST TO EAST".
