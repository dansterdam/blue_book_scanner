The image provided is a black and white map showing topographical features. There are no photographs in this image; it is a graphical representation of a geographical area.

As per your request, I am providing the text available in the document:

- At the top left, there is a label that reads, "MT HOLMES 10331 FT."
- Nearby, there is another label stating, "MT HAYDEN 10334 FT."
- Just below the MT HOLMES label, the text reads "YELLOWSTONE 8560 (AIRPORT)" with arrows pointing towards the center of the map where it says "YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK."
- To the right side of the center, there is "North Fork" printed across some lines possibly indicating a river or a geological feature.
- There are various labels for mountains, such as "Eagle PK 10806," "Saddle MT 10368," "HOADLEY PK 10679," "BONNYVILLE PK 9929," and "NEEDLY 12130."
- The name "Buffalo Bill Res" can be seen to the right part of the map.
- There are several scattered elevations given across the map, such as "10334," "9919 (AIRPORT)," "10767," "10200," "10300," and so on.
- On the bottom left corner, there are numbers "253" and "733" and what appears to be a scale indication.
- On the right edge, part of a word "â€¦E CORB" can be seen, but it's not fully visible.
- There are additional details that might not be legible due to the size and quality of the image.

It is difficult to accurately transcribe all the details without more legibility in those areas of the map that are less clear.
