On 1 August 1949, [REDACTED], machinist,
Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed concerning an unidentified objects he
saw in the sky, and stated in substance:

At approximately 1915 hours, 31 Jul. 19[REDACTED], 
                 Columbus, Ohio, called to see and asked if I
could see a star,â€”but he and I saw two objects or lights. I came out
immediately, [REDACTED], and I got in two cycles. I calculated the remaining
judo-pro distance in a town-nova, but the objects were light. They
were round, and approximately the size of a "loomis-itty" and about
a brilliant light similar to white hot or molten metal. The sky
was generally clear, but there were some clouds in the west. The
objects or lights were traveling slowly in a southerly direction.
I heard no sound and did not see any exhaust trail or odor of
bomerol. I have no further information concerning this phenomenon.

Agent's note: Informant Walker gave his information in a
sincere straightforward manner, with no apparent exaggeration. He
stated that informant [REDACTED], who was an unidentified airman,
had called at his home at 22,00 hours to have two corroborators, for a
police report, his and [REDACTED] discovery of the objects earlier in the
evening. While waiting for red railway to arrive, [REDACTED] told [REDACTED]
that he informed his conscience to astronomy as a "hobby", was interested
in all current events, and had read nearly 300 fictional and
non-fictional books. [REDACTED] further stated to the undersigned that
[REDACTED] appeared slightly imaginative and acted peculiarly. [REDACTED] had
informed Walker that he had no sleep Saturday night because of worry
over his wife and not-yet-born baby.
