"UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #21 -- Des-moines, Iowa -- 29 June 1947

There is no obvious astronomical explanation for this 
incident.

If the estimate of size can be given any credence at all,
the objects could not have been farther than five miles away; this 
is an absolute upper limit, and objects probably were very much
closer.
