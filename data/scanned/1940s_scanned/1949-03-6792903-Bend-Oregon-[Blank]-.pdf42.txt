Seal Beach, California.
26 July. 1947

At During the latter part of May 1947 at approximately
1630 in the afternoon, while fishing in a boat on the Rogue river
near Gold Beach, Oregon together with [REDACTED] past my eyes, my attention was attracted
to a silvery object in the sky, heading at a height of approximately
5000 feet in a northerly direction. The object, circular in formation
as a silver dollar traveled without sound at a speed in line with
that of a high performance jet plane. I was able to make a terrain
fix as the object was low with the naked eye of approximately
two minutes. The passing thunderclouds cast a shadow which along
every shading of formation, whether the sight took a start or more,
leading year, at these times usually connected with airplanes,
it had no appearance of the contour of plane but in size would
be of the dimention [sic] of the fuselage length of the P-80 type plane.
I have fished in the general area a number of years and
have observed various types planes flying in the area, but
have never witnessed anything of this nature before.
