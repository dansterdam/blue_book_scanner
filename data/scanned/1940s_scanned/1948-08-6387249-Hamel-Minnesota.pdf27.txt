Informants stated that on 11 Aug 48 between 1200 and 1215 hours, CST,
____ and _______ were playing in the back yard and noticed an object 
in descent approximately twelve feet from the ground which was ascending
from the spot of that.  It settled to the ground when ____ hit a
balloon. Upon hitting the ground the object spun crazily, made a sort of 
whistling noise, described by the two boys as resembling a steam whistle,
and then shot straight up into the air approximately 20 feet, halted 
and again made a whistling noise.  The object then shot upward to a height
of about 30 feet, and, in this ascent, maneuvered around two branches
and telephone wires. Upon reaching a height of approximately 30 feet
two objects shot off in a northeasterly direction.  The object approached
from the northwest.

The boys described the object as "approximately one foot thick, two feet
wide and round."  The object had no windows, wires, or any visible 
appurtenances.  It was a dull gray in color and when it hit the ground,
it made a slight clanking noise, much as metal hitting against metal.

____ and Mrs. ______ stated the boys were visibly frightened when they
ran into the house and were afraid to tell what they had seen.  Upon
close questioning, the boys related the above story to them.

Mr. _____ advised that he then had notified Mr. R. R. Sheridan, Postmaster
at Hamel, Minnesota (who subsequently notified the proper authorities)

AGENT'S NOTES:
Agent noted that the spot where the alleged 'Flying saucer* 
had landed was approximately 2 feet in diameter and appeared as though 
some heavy object had landed there or had been set down - as the ground 
was dented and protruding rocks had been leveled.  The spot was covered by
a wildtumb.

 _______ Mr. R. R. Sheridan, Postmaster, advised that he had no 
reason to doubt the story of the boys or of Mr. and Mrs. _______ and
for this reason had reported the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
St. Paul, Minn.
