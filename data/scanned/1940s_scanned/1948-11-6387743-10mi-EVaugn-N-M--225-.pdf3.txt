Incident #225 – near Vaughn, New Mexico – latter part of 1947
3 or 4 November 1948
23 November 1948

it is difficult to ascertain vhothor the objects described
in this incident belong to the gonoral group of "Now Mexico green
flashes," or not. The description here is sufficiently different
from the majority to indicate that thoy do not: the characteris-
tic groen color is not mentioned.

It is improbable, however, that the three separate sightings,
all occurring at approximately 2200 hours and in the same locality,
can be explained as astronomical phenomena. Furthermore, the stated
altitude and distances are entirely out of keeping; this fact might
be discounted as an illusion, common in the observation of Fireballs,
if the instances were isolated. The weight of the evidence, however,
inclines to the conclusion that the objects were man-made devices
and part of some scientific experiments, so common in that section
of the country.
