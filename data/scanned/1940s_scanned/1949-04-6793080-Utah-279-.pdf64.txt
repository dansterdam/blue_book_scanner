The image provided is a scanned document page that is heavily faded and has a significant amount of noise, making it difficult to read. It does not contain a photograph. The text appears to be weather data or observations taken at different locations, likely related to an investigation of a UFO sighting. However, due to the poor quality of the scan, extracting the exact text with high confidence is not possible. What I can discern from the visible text is as follows, although it is fragmented and incomplete:

```
UNCLASSIFIED PAGE NO0018 TO NO00(12 or 13) 12 JAN through 15th APRIL 194(9?) 

POCATELLO (09:00 - 12:00)

[fragmented text including temperatures and possibly wind directions and speeds]

SALT LAKE (05:00 to 20:00 and 15:30 to 17:00)
 
[fragmented text including temperatures and possibly wind directions and speeds]

LUCIN (09:30)
[...] 

BURLEY (09:30 [...] 15:30, [...] 14:50)
[...] 

STREVELL (09:30, 11:45, 14:50, 15:30, and 12:00)
[...] 
```

The document seems to contain time stamps and possibly weather information like temperatures or wind measurements. Due to the poor quality and fragmented nature of the visible text, I cannot provide a complete and accurate transcription. If the information is vital, I recommend consulting a better-quality copy or the original source for a precise transcription.
