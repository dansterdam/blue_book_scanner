UNCLASSIFIED

5. Mr. M*****g exhibited a series of four photographs taken of a meteorite dust cloud or "train" taken on 20 May 1944 by Cpl. A. L. *****s, ASN 37307171, c/o Photo Section, PAAF, Pampa, Texas. The present address of the corporal is unknown, but his photographs are copyrighted. Acquisition of these and other photographs of similar nature would be valuable for Project "Stork" for comparative purposes. Mr. M*****g requested that if the copyright owner of these photographs is located, he be informed so that he may obtain additional copies.

6. Mr. M*****g quoted the book, "The Book of the Damned" by Charles Fort as an interesting collection of unexplained aerial phenomena. He said that the incidents are authentic, but Mr. Fort's conclusions and interpretations are fantastic.

7. Mr. M*****g said that he will keep this office informed of his opinions on any future sightings of aerial phenomena that come to his knowledge.
