Incident #17 -- page 2

must have been erroneous;

-------------- that the objects seemed about 20 times as long
as wide. Let us assume that the thickness was just discernible, which
means that the object was just at the limit of resolution of the eye.

Now, the eye cannot resolve objects that subtend an angle of appreciably
less than 3 minutes of arc, and, in general, for any detail to be seen
at all, the angle subtended must be much greater. Even if we assume
the limiting resolution of 3 minutes, then, if the distance was 25 miles,
elementary calculations show that each object must have been at least
100 feet thick, and if, as ------------ drawing indicate, the object was
some 20 times longer than wide, it must have been about 2000 feet long.

Looking at the matter in another way and assuming that ------------
estimate of distances as 20 to 25 miles (12,000-13,000 feet) and his estimate
of length as 4 to 5 feet are both correct, then it will be shown that
the object will subtend an angle of only about 30 seconds of arc, which
is definitely below the limit of resolution of the eye.

If ------------ actually saw the objects, and if his estimating of
distance is correct, that of size cannot be, and vice versa. It
seems most logical to assume that his estimate of distance is far too
great. In fact, assuming a reasonable limiting size to the objects of
400 feet, in order to show the detail that ------------ drawings indicate,
the distance must have been not over roughly six miles. At this dis-
tance the objects would have travelled 11 miles rather than 47 miles
in 102 seconds, or at a rate of approximately 400 m.p.h.
