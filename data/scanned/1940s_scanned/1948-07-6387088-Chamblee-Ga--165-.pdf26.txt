AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: "FLYING SAUCERS"

Date: 1 of 5 pages

1. Apparently it is not of domestic origin since a thorough check of US flight schedules, both commercial and governmental, revealed that in only one instance did the reported flight path cross. (See chart enclosed in Exhibit "1"). This alleged exception was the flight in a northwesterly direction of a C-47 aircraft Robins AF Base to Olmsted Field, Pa. It was at departure would have enabled it to have appeared over the approximate area in the vicinity of Ft. Knox, Ky., +1600, 7 July. Weather, surface factors of speed, direction of flight, weather equipment, configuration, lights and other factors all but this one possibility.

2. Objects similar in configuration have been reported as follows:

a. Rocket-like objects capable of immense speed were seen during the past winter in broad daylight in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.

b. A "wingless aircraft" was observed moving at high speed at Ornolfsveit, Alamein, The Hague, Holland. The object was seen intermittently through clouds and was reported to have no wings.

3. Flying Challenges (Torpedo or Cigar-Shaped Body)

a. While the cigar or torpedo shaped body represents an efficient form for the fuselage of an airplane or the body of a guided missile, in neither case has it been used as a primary lift producing surface. However, an extension of the Prandtl theory of "lift" indicates that free layers of the dimensions reported by the latest Amarillo sight of approximately 12,000 pounds at an arbitrary incident stall speed of 150 miles per hour, conservatively estimated. This probably theory only could support a weight of approximately 12,000 pounds at an arbitrary incident stall speed of 150 miles per hour, conservatively estimated. This probably theory only could grow to conservative values of induced lift for bodies of this shape. If a lift coefficient above a 7% rent were chosen a value has been given by a German scientist (Patent number of air wind tunnel researchers in Germany). A gross weight of 24,000 pounds could be supported at the assumed stalling speed.

b. Although the craft sighted by Stevens and Arnold was reported to be without wings of fins, it is possible that could have been equipped with aerostatic means of take-off and landing contained within the fuselage. If such a case (a lift gas for nearly 30% net would be possible. If an aspect ratio of 5 were used (15 x the span aerodynamic chord), and if the wing design incorporated slits and flaps, the wing would support 115,000 pounds at a stall speed of 150 m.p.h., it is possible that the induce- of the could also contribute lift with this arrangement, depending upon the incidence of the wing. This type of aircraft could also be partially supported in the take-off and landing condition by the vertical component of the jet thrust, if the landing or take-off took place with the fuselage axis, or the jet stream direction in a vertical or nearly vertical attitude. The "feathering" possibility that an extensible fin or cones located within the fuselage, could have been used, would provide another method for handling and tabs of the would allow the vessel to float after gas had spent. Such a design could result in a relatively large duration of flight and corresponding range.

c. While no stabilizing fins were apparent on the "Flying Saucers" reported by various could have, it is possible that these within the jet, operated by a servomechanism would have provided static stability, longitudinally, directionally and laterally. The same means could also have been used for accomplishing static balance or trim, as well as on on four extremities. A square-celled honey of the type reported with the saucers and can provide sufficiently for downward development. A strongocular 7.5-inch probably 11 times as possibly McClinton that he's in services military not a produced by a ridiculous use of the contrast laws located elsewhere along the fuselage.
