Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
On 25 April 1949, Mr. [REDACTED], Control Tower Operator, Cleveland
Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, a stated [sic] substance that at about 2255
hours on 5 April 1949, he saw a red light which spanned like a rod bail [sic] about
due north of the control tower, roughly about 10 to 15 miles away at about 25
to 30 degrees from the ground. Occasionally, lights aircraft comes over the
field without radio and he thought that it might be one of these. He
tried to establish radio contact and also green light contact with negative
results. Thinking perhaps it could be a reflection, contact opened the window
and from the tower, the object appeared to be approximately one foot in dia-
meter and not moving either laterally or horizontally. Finally, at 2303 hours,
it just disappeared very gradually, like turning over a page. It appeared to
be from 10 to 15,000 feet high, with no sound or trail, no jets or other
clouds, and remained a bright red light on an azimuth, however, there was
no movement to this light. [REDACTED] stated that he later checked Flight Service,
Satellite Field, Mitchel, and inquired about this phenomenon but they told him
that he would have to go through proper channels. [REDACTED] didn't belive [sic]
could have been a helicopter or balloon because the light stayed at the same
level all the time that it was visible. It seemed more like the nose lights
of a Constellation aircraft, however, a light of this type would have to be
coming straight toward a person to have the appearance of not moving and in 4
or 5 minutes it would have passed out of sight completely. [REDACTED] does not
wear glasses.

Note: Redactions were present in the original text, and I have indicated these with [REDACTED]. There may have been errors in the document such as "stated substance" and "rod bail," which perhaps should read "stated in substance" and "rod ball." Similarly "belive" appears to be a typographical error for "believe."
