11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
First object was a balloon like object traveling in a westerly
directio n. The second balloon-like object traveled from the
South reaching a position above the first. It then circled
the first and both proce&ded in a Westerly direction and
disappeared from view.

Fleet Weather Central released a radiosonde at 1025ZL. The
radiosonde was composed of a balloon to which is attached a
box (approx 5\"X8\") by an eight ft wire.
