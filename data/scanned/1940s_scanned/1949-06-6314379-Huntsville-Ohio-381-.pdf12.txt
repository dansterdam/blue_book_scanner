(22) There were a few white clouds in the west sky but none in line of travel of this object.

(23) The air was moving from a south west direction just enough air moving to be noticeable.

(24) Weather conditions were fair and the sun was very bright at this time,

Lima O,

I am employed by The Standard Oil Co of Ohio in the Fuel Oil Dept, Lima Division, at Lima, Ohio. This object is very hard to describe because of the short length of time to see it and also its speed. Its coming so close to the earth and being so close to it is why I reported its state Highway patrol officer . However my wife and I saw a similar object about 3 weeks before, but at a great distance

UNCENSIFIED

Sincerely yours,

(Note: The text "UNCENSIFIED" at the bottom of the document might be a redacted form of "UNCLASSIFIED", potentially due to a typo or error in the original document. The signature and any other personally identifiable information have been redacted to comply with privacy guidelines.)

(Note: It appears that there may be an error in the text "state Highway patrol officer" where it might be missing the word 'to' as in "reported it to state Highway patrol officer". There may be other small errors in the text as well given the nature of handwritten documents which the OCR system could have missed or misinterpreted.)
