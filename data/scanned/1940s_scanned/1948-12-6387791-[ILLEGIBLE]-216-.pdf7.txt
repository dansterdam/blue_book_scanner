STATEMENT

UNCLASSIFIED 9 December 1948

I, ________ ________ Sergeant, USAF, am a weather
Observer assigned to the 16th Weather Squadron, Chanute Air Force
Base, Chanute Field, Illinois, and do hereby make the following
statement to Capt. Rush T. Kelroy, Assistant Base Weather Officer,
Chanute AFB:

On 8 December 1948 at approximately 1045 hours, I was talking
with Sgt. ________ ________ also of the 16th Weather Squadron, towards
the Base Weather Station when I noticed what appeared to be a very
rotor, or meteor. This object was heading upwards at about a 15 degree
angle moving from the north-east to the south-south-west. The
object was within in color, very bright and moved about two to three
tenths of the sky and then disappeared.

This object did not appear to me to be a falling star.

I immediately went to the Duty Forecaster at the Base Weather
Station and reported seeing this.
