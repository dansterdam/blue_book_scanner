FUGATE further related that about four months ago, approximately

The article was based on a letter by a Mr. _________ of Phoenix,
Arizona. The article stated that Mr. ___________ had been interviewed
by two Federal agents. That he had turned over two pictures of "Flying

Mr. ________ desired information as to how he could sue the Federal Government

this investigation.
