The image you provided appears to be a scanned document page, but it does not contain any photograph. The text on the page is faded and very difficult to discern due to the quality of the scan. The legibility is poor, making it almost impossible to provide an accurate transcription of the text. However, I can make out a few words and fragments; here is my attempt to transcribe what can be faintly observed:

```
at (unclear) park
(unclear) Lyons
new (unclear)
```

Unfortunately, the rest of the text is illegible in the provided image. If you require a full transcription, you may need to find a higher quality image or an alternative source for the information contained in this document.
