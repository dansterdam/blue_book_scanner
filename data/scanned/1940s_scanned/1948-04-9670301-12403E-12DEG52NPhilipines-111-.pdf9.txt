UNCLASSIFIED

B-2, AC 45.21, Subject: "Report of Sighting of Unidentified
Aircraft and/or Flying Object."

Time of the sighting visibility was unlimited, scattered
cumulus, base 3000 feet, tops 6000 feet.

a. Because of the distance from which the sighting
was made, no distinguishing features i.e. power units, landing
gear, armament or cockpit were observed.

b. The interview with Lt. Meyers indicated that he
is a reliable, non-sensational individual and appeared quite
positive in his statements. It must be taken into con-
sideration however that he was the only witness to this in-
cident, as he was unable to call the object to the attention
of his three wing-men because of their maneuvering in the
turn, plus the fact that his radio was out.

3. Above incident reported your headquarters, 2 April 48,
in radio, cite K2423H.
