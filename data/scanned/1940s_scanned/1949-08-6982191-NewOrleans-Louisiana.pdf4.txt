The photograph shows an object resembling a piece of metal or possibly a fragment of some larger item. It's standing upright against a plain background. Below the object, there is a ruler for scale, marked in inches, indicating the size of the object, which appears to be just under 7 inches in height. The object has a blackened surface, with some areas looking charred or burned.
