4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

(2) *** *** *****, md., has reviewed and stated in substance:

On 10 August 1948, ***** *****, Columbus, Oho., was interviewed and stated in substance:
    
Cir 2 August 1948, at 7:50 p.m., I observed an unusual object in the
sky, the attention was directed toward it because the children in the
neighborhood had stopped playing and were looking toward the skies. The
so called UFO meant one of the kids immediately who came out of the
apartment to look. The weather was unusually favorable for observation.
The sky was cloudless, and the light was more than sufficient without
interferences from the rays of the sun which were hidden by the buildings
of the city. I observed one object which at first was oblong in shape
traveling from North to South at a slow and regular speed. I observed
this object at least ten minutes during which time it traveled
approximately seven miles at a height of a half mile. Although its
direction of travel did not change, the object presented different
appearances from time to time, from oblong to round or from oblong to
egg or nut. I thought the object closer to the earth, than it i.e. cloud.
The object, however, to this change from different parts, presented a clear
transparency. The outline of the object was very dark in contrast with the
transparency of the center, Only at the time I observed the circular
shape was I aware of the center being a void. The object seemed to
hesitate momentarily soon after I first noticed its. From its rear, I
saw a tail of smoke, and the object continued in a southerly direction.
I observed this tail of smoke but once, making into consideration the
height and distance of the object from where I stood, I would estimate
the object to be as large as a small airplane. It made no sound, although
at one time I thought I detected one; however, I dismissed it from my mind
as a part of traffic in another part of the city. At approximately 8:00
p.m., I lost sight of the object just as it appeared to be changing
direction from South to Southwest.
