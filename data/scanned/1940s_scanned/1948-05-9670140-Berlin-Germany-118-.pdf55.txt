The image does not contain a photograph; it is a scanned page of a document that appears to be heavily redacted with black bars obscuring much of the text. Given the poor quality and redactions, extracting the text accurately is challenging, but I will do my best to transcribe what is legible:

```

Franklin, Kentucky

-----

[Redacted] do hereby state that none of my buildings or
property was damaged by any air crash or accident as evidenced by
Concrete Thomas Monuments Co., Franklin, Kentucky Air National Guard

farm.

WITNESS 2

Please note that the redactions and quality of the scan limit the ability to transcribe the document accurately, and some portions of the text cannot be discerned due to these issues.
