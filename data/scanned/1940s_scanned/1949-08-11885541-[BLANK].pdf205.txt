Incident #30, et. al. - Godman Field, Fort Knox, Kentucky -- 7 January 1948
a discussion of all incidents reported for this date

Incidents #30, 32, 33, and #3 all occurred on 7 January 1948,
with #33 involving the death of Lieutenant Mantell. National attention
has therefore been given to various astronomical body or phenomenon
which might serve to identify the object or objects observed. The four
incidents are considered together here.

Although the several reports differ considerably in regard to
the bearing and motion of the object (assuming for the moment that the
afternoon and evening sightings refer to the same phenomenon), they are
generally consistent concerning its time, manner, and place of its dis-
appearance over the horizon. Four and six-tenths are given as 1503 CST,
about 210 ̊, by observers at Godman Field; 1655 EST, west southwest, by
those at Lockbourne Air Base; and 1655-2000 EST, south about 210 ̊, by those
at Clinton County Air Base, (there are, as is to be expected, slight
differences in individual reports). Using this for the focal point of
attack, one notes immediately that all these times and bearings tie up
closely with the time and place of the setting of Venus. Furthermore,
all accounts except one agree that the object was low in the southwest
before the time of disappearance. Reports vary as to details of its
motion, but the overall motion was southwest and then over the horizon.

These facts taken together preclude any question of coincidence. Fur-
thermore, simultaneous observation from scattered locations proves that
the object had negligible parallax, or, in short, that it was a very
great distance away. All other statements concerning the object must,
