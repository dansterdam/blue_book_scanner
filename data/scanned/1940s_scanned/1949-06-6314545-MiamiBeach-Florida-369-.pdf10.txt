The document does not contain any photographs, but there is a logo at the top left that depicts a fish and the phrase "A FISHERMANS PARADISE." There's also a graphic of a sailfish on the top right, labeled with "UNCLESSED" and "OPENLY YEAR." The rest of the image is text, which I will transcribe for you:

Gentlemen,

Several weeks ago I read in the
Sunday Miami Post that a staff had been
sent up at Wright Field to investigate the
"Flying Disc" reports. No doubt you have been
flooded with letters such as this and I
feel a bit foolish adding to the pile.

I take behind for the past couple
of years that the people reporting "Flying
Discs" were crackpots or suffering from desilu-
sions but now I'm not quite so sure.

Last Sunday evening, June 12, my wife,
my children and I were lying on the
beach on Miami Beach. It was a clear
night, stars visible, with scattered small clouds.
Very little wind, no moon, and practically no
waves. It was 8:15 P.M. and very quiet.
Glenn was directly overhead, just a bit
southward of overhead. I noticed what I
thought was a falling star. It had the
same tail and was falling to the west
