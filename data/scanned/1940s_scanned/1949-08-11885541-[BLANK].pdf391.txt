Air Material Command Aero-Medical Laboratory (Dr. Paul M. Fitts -
212 Incidents considered)

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the reports of unidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanations for reports not otherwise explainable. These errors in identifying real stimuli result chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, and size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in this report. These incidents form no pattern in regard to area of sightings, type of object, or manner of performance. There are indications, however, that some sightings were influenced by earlier reports, and probably would not have been considered unusual or reported had there been no publicity.
