Analysis

Preliminary analysis of the negative and prints leads me to doubt the story told by Mr. ████████████.

Judging from the dimensions, the negative was exposed in a simple camera of the box type, which usually has a fixed focus (about 10 feet), fixed shutter speed (about 1/25 of a second) and a simple lens of the Meniscus type. Because of the above mentioned facts, it is unreasonable to assume that sharp outlines such as appears on the negative, could be secured from an object at 2,000 feet, traveling 400 to 600 mph.

Furthermore, according to the story the object (flying craft) was painted gray to blend in with the clouds. But, even if the object would be painted jet black, under the circumstances described, to obtain a contrast such as appears on the negative is also very doubtful.

On all of the prints, excepting the print marked "exhibit A", judging from the outlines, the object has a rotating motion (revolves around its center) instead of a forwarded motion, considering the version stated by Mr. ██████████.
