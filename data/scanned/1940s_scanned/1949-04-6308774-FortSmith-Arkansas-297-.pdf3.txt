There is no photograph in the image provided. It is a scanned page with text, some of which has been redacted with black bars. I'll now transcribe the remaining visible text:

```plaintext
INCOMING MESSAGE

DOWN GRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS.

The text is not very clear due to the quality of the scan and redactions, and the relevant context is missing because other parts of the text are obscured.
