[circled] ATTN: Mr. Deyarmond

1. Re Sighting of 7 Jan 1948.: Reference is made to your conversation with Capt Scheimer on 19 October 1948 concerning your desire for a check on the position and visibility of Venus on 7 Jan 1948 between the hours of 1330 and 1530 as compared to the position of an unidentified aerial object.

2. A verbal report was rendered you at 1100 hours, the date of your request, to the effect that Venus was not visible at the date and time mentioned. Extracted versions of pertinent information follow:

A. Statement by Lt Paul I. Orner, 0-685766, Airways and Air Communications Service AACS, Detachment T-355, Air Force Base Unit (1057th AACS Sq) confirms the fact that the weather station theodolite viewed and tracked the object; that the object was first seen at about 240° azimuth 9° elevation at 1100 hours, and that it disappeared from his view at about 250° at 1615 hrs.

B. A statement by Col. Guy F. Hix, Commanding Officer, Godman Field, Godman Air Force Base Unit (1559 The) Godman Field, First Kentucky Air Defense Headquarters, 315th Air Force at Godman Field has the object was first seen, and tracked, at 1300 hrs, at 240° azimuth and was last seen at 1900 hrs, by Azimuth Reading of 275° and that, while in color plainly seen with the naked eye, was about 1/4 the size of a full moon, white in color and apparently stationary for 1-1/2 hours.
