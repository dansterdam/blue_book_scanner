The image provided does not contain any photographs; it appears to be a page with handwritten text which is difficult to discern due to the low resolution and quality of the provided image. Nevertheless, I will attempt to perform an OCR function and transcribe what I can make out:

-2-

the sun reflection in a (unreadable)...

the window & had our usual (unreadable)...

-(The rest of the text is unreadable.)-

Due to the poor state of the image, I am unable to accurately transcribe the entire content. The text is mostly illegible in this resolution. For a precise transcription, a clearer image or the original document would be necessary.
