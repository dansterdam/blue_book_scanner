Subject: Report of Anomalous Sounds Observed by AESS personnel at Los Alamos
           on 1948, December 30

1. On 1949, January 5, Major C. L. Phillips, USAF, and the undersigned
under the guidance of Lt. Earl D. Highmower, AESS, visited three of the four
stations at which anomalous sounds were heard during the night of 1948,
December 30. In the present preliminary report, a summary of the pertinent
facts is given and, on the basis of azimuth and elevation readings taken at
the three stations where sounds were heard simultaneously, an approximate
determination is made of the location of the sound source in space.

2. At Station 340 statements were obtained from AESS Inspectors
and according to them both heard what they at first thought was a truck laboring up
the highway to blow their station. The sound was so definite that they arose
from their beds to go to the door to make the customary inspection, only to find the
roadway was empty. The sound terminated within a second or two after they open
ed the door and stopped outside. The next sound of their operations and observation
room, which was within a few yards upon what was occurring. The sound approximated
about 10 minutes later, at approximately 2020, the same incident occurred
Again, both men raising from their chairs, opening the door, and stepping
outside only to discover that the roadway was again empty. A stopwatch
determination for this case gave a duration for the count of 35 seconds.
This sound repetition of the unusual sound made a considerable impression
on the inspectors involved and the matter was under discussion during the
half hour that elapsed before a bogey alarm came in over communication at
approximately 2050. By this time, men had left Station 340 and the third
observation was made by and. According to these inspectors,
the noise heard at approximately 2050 was definitely an aerial noise in
contrast to the noises heard at 2010 and 2020. Neither man was willing to
identify the noise as ordinarily originating from an airplane, although both
agreed that the sound of a plane motor probably came closest to representing
what they heard. A slow whoosh terminating in a loud a diaphragm of 90-95 lbs
pressure for the aerial noise. Because the inspectors felt that their minds
were secure to determinations of compassing for the second and third incidents
run for the first, azimuth and elevation readings were taken only for the
occurrences at 2020 and 2050. Indications of position, therefore, are exact or present
as exact as 2020 was 40-37 and 79 elevation, 2020 location; 2050 location.
