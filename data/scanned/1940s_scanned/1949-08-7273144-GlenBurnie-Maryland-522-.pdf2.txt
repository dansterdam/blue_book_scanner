The image appears to show three photographs attached to a page with paper clips. Each photograph is partially covered with white paper strips, likely to obscure certain details. Here's a description of each visible part of the photographs based on what can be observed:

1. The topmost photograph shows what appears to be a portion of a tail assembly and a section of a circular object that could be interpreted as part of a disc.
2. The middle photograph partially shows what might be a fuselage with a visible cockpit and another section of the circular disc-like object.
3. The bottom photograph seems to display a disc-like object mounted on a tripod or stand with what looks like a brake drum or similar mechanical part nearby.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and output all the text found on the document:
