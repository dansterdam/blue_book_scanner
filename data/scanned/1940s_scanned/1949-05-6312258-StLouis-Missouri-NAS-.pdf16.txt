UNCLASSIFIED
19 May 1949

[REDACTED] and I were leaving ships service walking in an
easterly direction. As we cleared the buildings so that we had an un-
obstructed view to the south we both noticed a ball of fire in the sky
moving from east to west. This ball of fire appeared to be from fifteen
to twenty degrees above the horizon. By observation its' movement was through
an angular distance of approximately ninety degrees. There was no increase or
decrease in intensity of light during the time I saw it. It suddenly disappeared
as if moving behind some obstruction.
