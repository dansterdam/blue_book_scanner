NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Object appeared rectangular then convex. When first sighted, it was rectangular
in shape in a vertical position. Object changed position several times, starting
first to the right and then to the left. Object maintained the same color throughout
this entire period of observation. Eventually, the object became horizontal, and
lost altitude, and then started to elongate, taking the appearance of a vapor trail
until it disappeared. There were no rockets fired at White Sands Proving Ground on
this date.
