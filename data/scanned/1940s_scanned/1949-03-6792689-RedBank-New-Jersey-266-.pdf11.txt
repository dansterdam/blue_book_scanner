4 March 1949

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On 4 March 1949 at approximately 1421 o'clock, I, along with *******, all employees of 351st Electronics Station, Watson Laboratories, AEC, Red Bank, N.J., were about to enter Mr. *******'s car which was parked in the west side of the main parking area, to ride out to Camp Wood in line of duty.

Mr. ******* suddenly drew our attention to something unusual in the sky. I didn't see anything at first, but a B-29 approaching from a general northerly direction, but after putting on my glasses, I soon saw what appeared to be a metallic like disk of a non-luminous white or light aluminum color, well in back and to the east of the plane. Within a few seconds after I saw the object it made a half loop-like turn and headed north west at a jet-like rate of speed. Due to its shape it did not resemble anything that I had ever seen before in the sky, nor was there any apparent propulsion vapor or heat waves.

When seen, the object was so far away that it would be impossible to estimate its size and then again it was only in sight for about a minute before it disappeared in the haze of the horizon.
