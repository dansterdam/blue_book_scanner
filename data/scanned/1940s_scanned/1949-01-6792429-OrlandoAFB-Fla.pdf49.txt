Concerns of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of
Observer was formerly an investigator with Base Provost Marshall
regarded as reliable by superiors and fellow M.P.s

On 31 Jan 49, ******, with 2533rd Provost Marshall
Base Service Sqdn. Orlando AFB, Orlando, Florida, was interviewed, He stated
that on the morning of 31 Jan 49 he was on duty with the Base Guard as an Enlisted
Investigator. At 0150 hours while standing on the ground just North of Bldg. T-2704,
Orlando AFB, Orlando, Florida, ****** remarked that there was a falling star.
****** motioned a blue-green, saucer-shaped object approximately the size of a fist
at arm's length, which appeared to be over a point about 600 feet from him, and
approximately 40° above the horizon. This object was first sighted at a position approx.
315° from observer travelling in a South to Southwest direction and was viewed from for
approximately 20 seconds. ****** estimated the speed of the object as equiv-
alent to the speed of an aircraft approaching to land at Orlando Air Field. This ob-
ject had no sound, odor, trail or projections and looked like a luminous dot in the
sky, The object appeared to be without substance and while in sight seemed to be
going on and off and at one time apparently went behind another object.
It finally disappeared like a light switched off. There was no moon or clouds, the
stars were out and the weather clear with good visibility. There was no air traffic
in the sky at that time. ****** did not wear glasses and viewed the object from
outdoors.
