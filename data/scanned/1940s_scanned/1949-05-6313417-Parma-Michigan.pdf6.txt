6. It might be mentioned here that the "flying saucer" of [REDACTED] was pictured in about three scenes in flight and appeared to be all lighted up by electricity and to be circular or disk shaped about three feet in diameter. The "saucer" whirled during flight. However, when Dr. LAISON's "saucer" was viewed later by TV it appeared to be ellipsoid shaped and was about twelve feet in length, ten feet across and four feet deep. It was apparently constructed of aluminum or some other shiny metal and was slightly raised in the center with two exhaust (Jets) on each side of the raised portion. This version flew on a direct line, rather than a whirling motion.

7. The CONRAD apologized for the story and said he was sorry that he had misled the USAF, and admitted that the article was purely for enhancing interest in his coming picture. He requested that the USAF not furnish any newspaper correspondent or other persons making inquiries with the fact that the saucer is a hoax.
