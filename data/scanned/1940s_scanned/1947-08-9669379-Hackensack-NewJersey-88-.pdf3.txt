This image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it is a scanned page with cursive handwritten text. The handwriting quality and the scan resolution are fairly low, which makes it difficult to interpret some portions of the text accurately. However, I will do my best to transcribe the visible text:

---

the object was + + + flying very fast 
straight east – It appeared as a bright
white object of metal-like appearance -

it could be clearly seen – it was
very clear day, + + + + + 

not a speck of cloud in the sky
moon + dirctly west of the object
there were a few light cirrus clouds

if these were any + + + 

+ + also left coast about noon, but
the object in question vanished
upwards + + not + + descended + + 

I regret that I + + + called + + + 

A seeing that was sufficient + + + + + 

+ + until it vanished from view –

held down from + + – + + across
on near fasthtv +/- a hand breath or +
from left – no adverse effects on
the objective apparent + + + +

headed down + + +

+ + + + a view of Colonel + + + +

The arc width of the object seemed

to be + + [E] to ½ diameter

+ + + + the view + + + + 

+ + + +

Unfortunately, due to the poor clarity of the handwriting and the scan, several words and phrases are omitted, marked by "+ + +",  as they are not discernible. The original document may offer additional context that would help in understanding the fragmented transcription provided.
