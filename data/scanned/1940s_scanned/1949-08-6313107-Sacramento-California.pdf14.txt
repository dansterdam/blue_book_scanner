STATEMENT

My name is _______________, assigned to the _______________________, Mather Air Force Base, Mather Field, California. My duty assignment is ____________________.

My residence is at ____________ located approximately five (5) miles due south from the center of Sacramento, California. On 31 August 1949 about 2200 hours I called Captain__________ for assistance in identifying certain navigational stars.

The night was very clear, visibility unlimited. The moon was at a 3/4 phase with a bright area around it probably due to some haze in that area.

While looking at the star Polaris, I noticed a plane flying on an easterly heading approximately two (2) or three (3) miles south of Sacramento. The navigational lights of this airplane were clearly visible and the noise from the engines was very audible.

Watching the aircraft I suddenly touched___________ and said "Look" and pointed toward the sky just above the roof tops. Captain __________ saw it just about the time I pointed to it.

When I first spotted this object, it was just coming over the horizon. It made no noise; there was no visible motion of its very short, stubby wings. No noise or sound was heard as it came toward us and passed almost overhead. I lost sight of it just as it started into the moonlight.

This object came from a northerly direction, or from a direction of Polaris, the North Star. Its path of flight was straight and level and on an approximate heading of 230Â°. Its speed was estimated to be about 700 miles per hour. It was visible to me approximately five seconds. This was a very fast, very large missiles object.

This object was very visible as a dark object against the glow and reflection of the lights of Sacramento. It seemed to have a dull grey or silver finish which blended into the moonlight after it passed overhead.

The possibility of this being a shadow can be discounted because it did black out the stars above. I estimated its altitude to be about 15,000 feet. As a comparison the size of this object was larger than that of a B-36 at about 5,000 feet.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
