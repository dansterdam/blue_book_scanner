SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects 11 May 1949

TO : Commanding General
     Air Materiel Comand
     Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
     Dayton, Ohio
     ATTN: MCIAO-XO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, AC/IAS,
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Forces, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Disposition
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that action in
contact, not alone just horizontal action with the object appears to worry
"Relative to Radar plotting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
