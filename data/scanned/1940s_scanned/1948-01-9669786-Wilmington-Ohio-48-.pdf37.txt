Object seemed to be some sort of flare. Witness thought it was some
aircraft in trouble. Requested the tower to take a look and it too
described it where the flare. It appeared with the naked eye, to be
a very bright light the color of ordinary fire with lookout ends, remained 
altitude in the manner of a parachute flare riding on thermals. The 
intensity of the light varied. This was attributed to clouds passing 
infreast below; however, the light was readily discernible thru the 
clouds. The sky was clear to scattered. When the object was compared 
to the flare there was a decided difference. Stars were of the usual
white; this object was yellow or flame color. When first seen it appeared 
to be about 4,000 ft but disappearing over the horizon would make it much 
higher. The movement was very slow in appearance and it left no trails 
or tails like a meteor or comet. Place of disappearance was approximately 
due west from position of observer.
