Summary of Information:
Investigation of Flying Discs 

Informants Further stated that the object disappeared behind 
a water tower, which was an obstruction to their view, and was near 
the ground. Both informants watched for an explosion, thinking 
that it would explode upon reaching the ground, but nothing unusual 
was noted.

A-2 COMMENT:

Although there is no evidence to substantiate the following, it 
is the opinion of this headquarters that this activity could be
attributed to meteor flares. Any further developments, or evidence 
obtained, will be forwarded this headquarters from the Sheriff's 
Office, Bakersfield, California.
