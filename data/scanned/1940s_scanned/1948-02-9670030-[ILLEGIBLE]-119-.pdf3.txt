PARAGUAY

Flying Saucers over Asuncion . . . A conservative Paraguayan newspaper
of Asuncion recently published the results of interviews with several people
who reported having seen flying saucers in that area. Some of the persons
interviewed described the object as a meteor while others thought it was a
machine. Ballerians of orders were witnesses to a bright light. The
general opinion was that it was an oval-shaped object, bigger in front than in
the rear, and tapering down to a thin tail about .5 m long. The interior
portion of the object gave off green, yellow, and orange colors and a highly
varied colored wake, or exhaust.

Comment: The reporting officer suggests that a meteor may have been
seen, but is not technically qualified to say that this is so.
