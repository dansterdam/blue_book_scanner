S/7, Office of the AC of S; G-2, Headquarters Fourth Army, Fort Sam Houston, Texas,
16 March 1949, subj, "Unusual lights"

without the fence. The Security Officer of Site Baker is investigating. He stated
the light was not carried by any of the AFSWP personnel.

Investigation continues in an effort to determine cause of the "lights." Last
information is that 32 trip flares have been put into the general area by the
2nd Armored Division so that some men have been set off by wild animals. Subse-
quent summary will be rendered when more exact evidence on flares is obtained. It
is presently known, however, that these flares explode on the ground and do not
shoot into the air.

No conclusion is drawn from the data on attached overlay other than to note
that the "lights" form a rough circle about the "H" Area. Copy of surface weather
observations for Camp Hood on the 6,7, and 8 March 1949 ale attached as a possible
aid in analysis. This report covers only days hours since the USAF weather service
at Camp Hood closes at 1700 hours and opens at 0730 hours.
