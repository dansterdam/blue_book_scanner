Encl: (1) ltr cyy of reference (b) w/encls

1. At the request of reference (a) an effort has been made to discover
additional information concerning recurrences of the type reported by this
Office in November 1949, reference (b). Dr. Thomas of the Navy
Electronics Laboratory, reports that no further incidents were observed
although the equipment was operated at Palomar until about a year ago.

2. Enclosure (1) is forwarded for the convenience of LCDR E. L. Thomas.
It is believed to be a full account containing all that was known at the
time. Subsequently, the only development known to this office came in
January 1950 when, in response to further reports of erratic equipment
behavior, the apparatus was returned to NEL for a detailed check. A
faulty fuse clip was found. According to referee (c), very slight
jarring of this clip produced a visible arc together with a spurious
signal indicated on the aural alarm and an aberration of the recorder pen.

3. If further details are required this office will endeavor to supply
them.

                                                        S/T. H. TEMPLETON
