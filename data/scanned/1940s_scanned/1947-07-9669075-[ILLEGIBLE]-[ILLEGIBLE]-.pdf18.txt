The image displayed does not contain any discernible photographs. It appears to be a heavily obscured or degraded document, and much of the text is illegible due to the poor quality of the scan.

Due to the nature of the image, performing OCR to produce an output of all the text found in the document is not possible as the text is not clear enough to be accurately transcribed.
