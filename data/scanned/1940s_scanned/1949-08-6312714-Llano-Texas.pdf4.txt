       About ten (10) to fifteen (15) degrees.

       250 feet above ground.

(7) Time in sight.

       Two and one-half (2Â½) hours.

(8) Appearance of object

(a) Color

       Copper colored, like setting sun. Looked like bright red
       fire.

(b) Shape

       Semi-rectangular, with corners rounded to resemble partial
       ovate. This object resembled a large box kite with two (2)
       quarter moons on top and two (2) quarter moons on bottom.
       There were about seven (7) or eight (8) quarter moons between
       top and bottom. It appeared as if there were two (2)
       quarter moons side by side on each side of what should have 
       been a center shaft, but the observer could see nothing in
       this area. Each quarter moon was about six (6) inches across,
       but they did not appear to be connected in any way.

(c) Apparent construction.

       Observer had no information of material substances of ap-
       parent construction of objects.

(d) Object approximately fifteen (15) feet high and three (3)
       or four (4) feet wide.

(9) Direction of flight.
       
       Object rose straight up to an altitude of about 250 feet, and then 
       moved in a straight line South for a distance of approximately 1500
       feet.
