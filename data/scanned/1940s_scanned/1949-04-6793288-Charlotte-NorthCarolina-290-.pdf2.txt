1. REPORT OF FINDINGS

(17)      On 23 May 1949, Dr. -------, Morehead Planet-
arium, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N. C. was interviewed in re-
gards to any unusual occurrences that might have taken place in the skies on or
about 7 Apr 1949. He stated that he had neither seen or heard of anything that
might be construed as even slightly unusual either before, on, or after the time
in question. Likewise, none of his associates have reported to him anything of
an unusual nature. He was equally positive that if anything out of the ordinary
had occurred, he would have been one of the first to know about it. (B-2)

ADDED NOTE: Dr. ------- gives the appearance of an intelligent man who knows
whereof he speaks. On parting, he said he would report to this office, immedi-
ately, anything of an unusual nature that might occur. He is more than will-
ing to cooperate in any manner what-so-ever.
