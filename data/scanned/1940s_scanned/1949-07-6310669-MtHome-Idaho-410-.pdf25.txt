The document appears to show a typed report with no photographs or images present, aside from a scribbled-out section at the bottom right corner of the page which does not seem to be a photograph. I will now perform optical character recognition on the text:

DETAILS (Cont'd)

were a light color except for a circle of dark color of approximately 12
feet in diameter which was placed midway between the tips of the object, and
which extended to the trailing edge of the object (see sketch). [Redacted] said
that he could not describe the colors--they were white and black, except that
they were shades of white and black that he had never seen before. [Redacted]
said that the top of the object was perfectly flat, and that the bottom of
the object was flat except for a shallow dome-like protrusion of approximately 
10-12 feet in diameter, with a depth of approximately 2-5 feet. [Redacted] stated
that he saw no propellor arcs and saw no jet exhaust or smoke. So far
as he could tell there were no air intakes or jetty and rockets openings. [Redacted]
stated that the objects flew with unusual stability and appeared to be under
absolute control at all times, but that on trailing edges were square, as
though came to a Nevada flat surface, the thickness of the object, as
trailing edge of, [illegible] a stand that when first sighted by him, he noticed an
oscillation of part of the outer panels of the object. [Redacted] said this
oscillation decreased as the objects approached, to the point that it was
a smooth oscillation, not a flutter. [Redacted] re-emphasized the fact that when
the objects turned they did so without a bank or a skid. He also said that it
appeared that the objects had used his aircraft as a turning point, maintaining
a standard turn about his aircraft at approximately 1/4 mile distance. [Redacted]
stated that when the objects disappeared from sight, they disappeared all of a
sudden. There was no gradual fading from view, [Redacted] first
estimated the speed of the objects as something between 550 and 650 miles per
hour; then stated that maybe they were traveling not quite that fast. Also
from time to time, the circle in the center of the object changed color slightly
from [Redacted] stated that the oscillation or movement of the outer panels was
down to about 30 degrees, then to a flush position. [Redacted] stated that he had
a good view from all angles except below and to the left.

[Redacted] stated that as he passed the flight path of the objects he
expected a great amount of turbulence, and that he was surprised when he felt
nothing. As soon as he had passed the objects' flight path, however, he
noticed that his engine began running rough. [Redacted] aircraft and engine
are brand new. His engine is a Lycomnig, 115 horsepower. Soon after [Redacted] had he and one of his mechanics inspect the engine, and
it was found that all of his spark plugs had been shorted and burned out.

a. These plugs, except for one that could not be located were
forwarded directly from Mt Home AFB to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton,
Ohio, on 28 July 1949, for analysis, in accordance with their instructions.
Only seven of the original eight plugs were forwarded because [Redacted] had
discarded all eight prior to the arrival of the writer and the subsequent
search. After them revealed only seven.

12. 7. Soon after [Redacted] had lost sight of the objects, at approximately
anm hours, MST, he callg Boise Radio, Gowen Field,, Boise, Idaho, and told
them that it was an emergency transmission and that asked them to check for
any aircraft in his vicinity. He was later notified by Boise Radio that
