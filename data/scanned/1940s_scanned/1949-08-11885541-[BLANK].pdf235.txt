The primary purpose here, however, is to segregate inci-
dents which have a reasonable degree of certainty of astronomical
origin. Therefore, in a second, more detailed breakdown, incidents
are placed in one of three classes, according to the most probable
interpretation seen in the evidence offered (with a minimum of
allowance for subjective observation). Class 1 includes the astro-
nomical incidents (with degree of probability indicated). The non-
astronomical incidents are divided into two classes, because it
appeared as the work progressed that they fell naturally thus: in
some, the evidence at hand suggested a simple explanation; in others,
it did not. Listings under class 2 are not to be considered in any
way decisive (with the exception of a few which, according to sub-
ject reports, have been definitely identified); they are offered
as suggestions.

A summary of the results of this breakdown is shown in
the table on the following page.
