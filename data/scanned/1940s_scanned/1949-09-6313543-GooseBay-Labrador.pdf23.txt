This image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it features a schematic or hand-drawn map with annotations. The visible text and markings on the document include:

- The title at the top, which seems to be partially cut off, reads "SCOTIA BL[...] ATHBONA & MONT MONT".
- There are dashed and solid lines seemingly representing an object's flight path, and there is some text along these lines, although parts of it are difficult to decipher due to the quality of the image.
- Near the center, there is a text label that reads "Flight Path", with an arrow indicating direction.
- To the right, there is a label "object" with a dashed line pointing to a small "X".
- Near the bottom left, there is a shape that represents an "observer", and this is connected to the object path by a solid line.
- The distance annotation reads "(Approx 20 mi.)" placed along the dashed line suggesting distance from the observer to the object.
- There is also some text at the bottom of the image that reads "Dec 24-48", which could indicate a date, December 24, 1948.
