The image shows a page from a document with several photographs/pictures of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) at the top of the page. There are six images in total, arranged in two rows with three images each. Starting from the top-left and moving to the right:

1. The first photograph depicts an object that appears to be disc-shaped with a slight dome on top.

2. The second photograph shows an elongated object, somewhat cylindrical, with both ends slightly tapered.

3. The third photograph is less clear, but it appears to show another disc-shaped object with a possible dome, though it is blurrier than the first.

4. The fourth image is similar to the first, displaying a disc-like shape but with a less pronounced dome.

5. The fifth image shows a blurry object that could be oval or disc-shaped.

6. The sixth photograph shows an object that is difficult to discern but may be oval or cylindrical.

incident #33, a.- - Godman Field, Fort Knox, Kentucky -- 7 January 1948
& discussion of all incidents reported for this date

Incidents #30, 22, 33, and 48 all occurred on 7 January 1948, 
with #33 involving the death of Lieutenant Mantell. Detailed attention 
has therefore been given to any possible astronomical body or phenomenon 
which might seem to identify the object or objects concerned. The four 
incidents are considered together here.

Although the several reports differ considerably in regard to 
the bearing and motion of the object (assuming for the moment that the 
afternoon and evening sightings referred to the same phenomenon), they are 
generally consistent concerning the time, manner, and place of its dis- 
appearance over the horizon. Hour and azimuth are given as 1506 CST, 
about 250, by observers at Godman Field; 1955 EST, almost southwest, by 
those at Lockbourne Air Base; and 1955-2209 EST, about 210, by those 
at Clinton County Air Base; (there, are, as is to be expected, slight 
differences in individual reports). Using this for the focal point of 
attack, one notes immediately that all these times and bearings agree 
closely with the time and place of the setting of Venus. Furthermore, 
all accounts except one agree that the object was low in the southwest 
before the time of disappearance. Reports vary as to details of its 
motion, but the overall motion was southwest and then over the horizon. 
These facts taken together preclude any question of coincidence. Fur- 
thermore, simultaneous observation from scattered locations proves that 
the object had negligible parallax, or, in short, that it was a very 
great distance away. All other statements concerning the object must,
