The image appears to contain two elongated dark objects against a lighter background in the upper section. The object on the left is horizontal and the object on the right is set at a diagonal angle. Below the object on the right, the word "WHITE" is visible. These objects resemble the typical "UFO" representations but their true nature cannot be determined from this image alone. Given the context of a UFO report document, these could potentially be illustrations or representations of witnessed unidentified flying objects.

The text below the objects is not very clear due to the quality of the image. However, I'll transcribe what is discernible:

```
