NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
On 24 July 1949 at approximately 2030 hours, my wife called to my attention
a flight of several objects flying almost directly over our heads at a phenomenal
rate of speed. They were approximately seven in number and were emitting a
bluish-white light. I watched their flight from South to North until they dis-
appeared.

/s/ [REDACTED] Captain, USAF

On 24 July 1949 at approximately 2030 hours, I saw what appeared to be
seven duly lighted objects in a type "V" formation slightly to the west moving
very rapidly from South to North. The distance between lights apparently did
not change during the time they were visible, which indicated that they might
have all been on a single object. This formation of lights was visible for only
four or five seconds and finally faded away into the Northern sky.

/s/ [REDACTED] Major, USAF
