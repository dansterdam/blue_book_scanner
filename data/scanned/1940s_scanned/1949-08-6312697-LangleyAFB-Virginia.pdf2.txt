SUBJECT: Report of unidentified Airborne object:

TO: Commanding General
Ninth Air Force
Langley Air Force Base, Va.

1. On Friday night, 19 August 1949, Sgt. Donald R. Berger, RA
6718060, a member of this organization was operating a standard Army
General Electric antiaircraft searchlight on a volunteer basis for a
local group who were using the light for publicity purposes. Between
the hours of 2000 and 2300 he picked up an object in the light beam
in the sky which presented an unusual appearance and was not readily
identifiable.

2. This subject appeared to change color in the light beam from
a sort of phosphorescent appearance to a bluish color if held in the
light and when the beam was removed the object remained visible with
what has been described as a luminous appearance.

3. The object was North but slightly East of Cincinnati at an
elevation of 1585 mils or approximately directly overhead. Judging
from the atmospheric conditions and the range of the light, the object
appeared to be at an altitude of 3 to 5 miles and at about the same
range. It did not seem to move but remained as far as could be deter-
mined approximately stationary for the entire period of the three and
one-half hours Sgt. Berger observed it.

4. This phenomenon, whatever it was, was seen by several hundred
people in this city, a number of whom called it to the attention of Sgt.
Berger while he was operating the searchlight. A notice of this incident
although not released by military personnel appeared in at least one
daily newspaper of this city.
