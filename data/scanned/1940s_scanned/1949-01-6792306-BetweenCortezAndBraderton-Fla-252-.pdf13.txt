The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch, not a photograph. It depicts a landscape scene with a series of trees on the right side, possibly five trees with a flat horizon line. Above the trees, there are lines that seem to represent light rays or perhaps trails converging at a point out of the image to the left. On the bottom right, there is a handwritten text that reads: "Infrared Photo, 2-objects, 10:00 P.M."

As for the text reproduction, there isn't any typewritten or printed text to transcribe, just the handwritten note described above.
