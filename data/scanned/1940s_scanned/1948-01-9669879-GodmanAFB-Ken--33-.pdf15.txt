Please note that due to the quality of the text and potential transcription errors arising from the OCR process, the exact text may contain slight inaccuracies. Some of the characters may be misread or incorrectly transcribed, such as "OB" which could be a typographic error in the original document or a misreading of "8/10". Additionally, the date may be consistently incorrect, as the beginning of each line starts with "48" which likely stands for the year 1948, not the day "1 JAN 48". It's possible that there are typos or OCR errors related to this as well.
