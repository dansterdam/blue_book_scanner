Incident No. 76 -- 13 August 1947, Salmon Dam, Idaho.

Two men reported simultaneously hearing a roar, and looking up observed
two objects of undetermined size, several miles distant at a great
height which they thought might have been 4000-6000 feet. The objects
were "circular," "reflected lights," and were traveling at "great speed."
Although occurring on the same day as Incident No. 75, the descriptions
vary widely.

ATIC Opinion: There is no information contained in this report to
refute the assumption that these men saw two ordinary aircraft at too
great a distance to discern details.
