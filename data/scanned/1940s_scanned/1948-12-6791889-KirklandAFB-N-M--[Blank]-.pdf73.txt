Subject: Report of Anomalous Sounds Observed by AFSB personnel at Los Alamos
on 1948, December 30

1. On 1949, January 5, Major E. L. Phillips, USAF, and the undersigned
under the guidance of Lt. Earl R. Rigthower, AUSA, visited three of the four
stations at which anomalous sounds were heard during the night of 1948,
December 30. In the prints preliminary report, a similar one of Sergeant
Booth is given and, on the basis of azimuth and elevation readings between the
three stations where sounds were heard simultaneously, an approximate
determination is made of the location of the sound sources in space.

2. At Station 340 statements were obtained from AFSB Inspectors *******
and ****** according to ****** told ****** that is was approximately 2010 on
the night of 1948 when he told "Boy First Class" to take their airforce car
and went to the door to make the customary inspection, only to find that the
roadway was empty. The sound terminated within a second of two after they opened
the door and stepped outside. Repetition of their motions and seven seconds
timed with a stopwatch show that the sound endured approximately 7 seconds.
About 10 minutes later, at approximately 2020, this same incident occurred
again, both men raising from their chairs, opening the door, and stepping
outside only to discover that the roadway was again empty. A stop-watch
determination for this case gave a duration for the sound of 5.5 seconds.
The second repetition of the unusual sound gave a considerably longer duration
on the inspectors involved and the matter was under discussion during the
half hour that elapsed before a bogey alarm came in over communications at
approximately 2050. By this time, ****** and ****** station 340 and the third
observation was made by ****** and ******. According to these inspectors,
the noise lasted approximately 2010 - 2020 ****** a small milling in
this respect to ****** has at 2010 and 2020, neither man was willing to
identify the noise as characteristically engine airplane, while both
suggested that this sound or plane motor probably came closest to representing
what they heard. A stopwatch determination indicated a duration of 10-15
seconds for the aerial noise. Persons to Inspectors felt that they made
noise assuring determinations or scaling the sound and find clear to them
****** in which and of anomalous color, where turn blue and for which
the azimuth, and ****** and therefore no true bearings, examined
direction at 2020 was 310 37' and had elevation +30 50', according to...
