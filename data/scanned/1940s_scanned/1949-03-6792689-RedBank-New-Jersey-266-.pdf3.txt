NARRATIVE continued:

At approximately 2:20 PM, Mr. [REDACTED] excitedly said, "Look up there". I raised my head to where he was pointing, and I saw a B-29 flying toward us. After scanning the sky in the general direction pointed out I also saw an object travelling very rapidly across the sky. I do not have any idea of the physical size of the object, or at what rate of speed it was travelling. I kept the object in sight for about one minute, until it disappeared out of sight.
