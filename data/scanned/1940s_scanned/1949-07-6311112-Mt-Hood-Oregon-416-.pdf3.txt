"At 2100 hours on 30 July 1949, between Stevenson, Washington, and Troutdale, Oregon, a group of unidentified lights were sighted by Northwest Airlines pilot********** near Portland, Oregon, while on a routine flight from Yakima to Portland. Thrush stated the object could have been two or three planes flying in very close formation, however, the red lights were on the wrong side for airborne aircraft. When Thrush circled the field to await instructions for landing, the object changed course about 50Â° and left the vicinity.

The co-pilot of the plane,********** also of Portland, sighted the lights but was not available for interview. **********, CAA traffic controller on duty in the control tower of the airport also observed the object. Basford reportedly observed the incident."
