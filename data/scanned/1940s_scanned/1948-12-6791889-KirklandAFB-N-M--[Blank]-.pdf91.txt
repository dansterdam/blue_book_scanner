-2- December 30, 1948

It is found that the fireball doubly observed by Messrs. [redacted] and [redacted] appeared at a height of at least 1o miles and descended at an angle of about 15° to the vertical (according to [redacted] estimate) to a point C at an elevation of only 2.3 miles above the horizontal plane through the point from which [redacted] and [redacted] observed. As the fireball approached the point C, its path levelled off and from C to its point of disappearance, B, the fireball followed a nearly horizontal path approximately 7.5 miles long moving with a velocity of between 3.75 and 7.5 miles per second, depending on the duration estimate adopted. The coordinates of the projection of C on the earth are 35° 51' N, 106° 30' 24" W, and those of the projection of B are 35° 57' N, 106° 23' E. The forward extension of the fireball's trace on the earth, as determined by the above projections, passes some six miles to the north of the town of Los Alamos.

It should be noted that the descending branch of the path of the fireball was observed by Inspector Threets alone, but he was absolutely certain the his observation of this portion of the path was correct. It should also be noted that no sound was heard, although the distance from the observers to the fireball at the nearest distance to the earth could have been only a few miles at most. I have no hesitancy in testifying that an object possessing the real path and history of the fireball observed by Messrs. [redacted] and [redacted] was not a falling meteorite.
