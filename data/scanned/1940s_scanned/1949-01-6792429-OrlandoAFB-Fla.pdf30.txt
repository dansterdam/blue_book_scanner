alant to the speed of an aircraft approaching to land at Orlando Air Field. This ob-

sky. The object appeared to be without substance and while in sight seemed to be
going on and off and at one time apparently went behind another object.

stars were out and the weather clear with good visibility. There was no air traffic
in the sky at that time. ______________ did not wear glasses and viewed the object from
