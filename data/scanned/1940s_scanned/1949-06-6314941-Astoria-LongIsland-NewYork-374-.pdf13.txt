Mrs. [REDACTED], Astoria, Lorg Island, was interviewed at 0930 hours, 23 July 1949.

People present: Mr. [REDACTED], Mrs. [REDACTED], and the writer.

A previous check with Mrs. [REDACTED]'s employers indicate that she has held her present position with Corn Products refining Compy for 30 years and is considered a stable type of person, not prone to exaggeration or verbosity. No further check of her character or background was performed.

Report of Interview: Mrs. [REDACTED] reports that on the evening of 21, June 1949 she returned from work at 1830 hours and immediately started to prepare supper. She turned on the radio at the same time so as to "hear Lowell Thomas." The reported objects appeared, according to Mrs. [REDACTED], prior to the advent of the Lowell Thomas program, which would place her time of observation between 1830 and 1845 hours DS.T. on said date.

The objects were described by Mrs. [REDACTED] as being round and between 1 1/2 and 2 feet in diameter, gray in color, surrounded by a halo of light and travelling in the direction of west to east, disappearing into a "cloud bank."

The objects appeared to be travelling in a horizontal direction for the first two seconds and then appeared to describe an upward arc just prior to disappearance. An interpretation of Mrs. Scalfo's description of the position of the objects would place them approximately 100 to 150 feet in the air. It must be borne in mind, however, that determination of altitude without adequate reference marks is practically impossible for the average lay person.

Within a minute (estimated) of the time that the objects were sighted, a single engine "fighter type" airplane appeared from the south and was observed by Mrs. Scalfo to circle the area and then disappear in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 1,000 feet.

Attached herewith is a slip of paper, signed by Mrs. Scalfo which was written by her within two hours following the time of her observation of the phenomenon reported.

Comments of preparing officer: The observation was made through an open window, and it is my belief that Mrs. [REDACTED] had a clear unobstructed view of the area. There are definite points of landscape which afford an easy method of orientation. The house is so situated that there is a clear unobstructed view to a clump of trees approximately 150 yards distant followed by another grove of trees which are approximately an additional 150 feet away.

A visit was made to the weather station at La Guardia Field, Station WBA$. The following official observations were noted by Air. E. Morin, observer on duty at 1100 hours, for the time of 1723 to 1800 E.S.T. on the date of 24 June:

1723 E.S.T.: Clear, 10 mile visibility, temperature 84, dew point 61, SSE 18 miles an hour, light gusts, humidity 46%.

1745 E.S.T.: Clear, 10 mile visibility, wnd SSE 18, few cirrus.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER TWENTY YEARS
