UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #150 -- Dravosburg, Pennsylvania -- 4 July 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.

The date of occurrence, July 4, suggests that the object
seen might have been a part of some celebration -- for instance,
a lighted balloon, or even a "county fair" type of balloon.

Or there may be a much simpler explanation for the inci-
dent: the observer was very close to the Allegheny County airport.
Logs the airport have record of other pilot, balloon or small air-
craft in the air at the time of the sighting. Change when the ob-
ject seemed to stop it also changed direction, the stopping may
have been merely the effect of perspective.

This incident does not appear to have any relation to in-
cident #61.
