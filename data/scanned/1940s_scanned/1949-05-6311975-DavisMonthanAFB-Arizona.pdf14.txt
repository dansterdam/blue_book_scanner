The map depicts what appears to be a layout of roads, mountain ranges, and other geographic and infrastructural features around the Tucson area, including the names of roads, mountain ranges, and other landmarks. The two "UNCLASSIFIED" stamps indicate the classification status of the document. It also features annotations such as "Path of Flight" and "MTS" which could relate to the tracks of observed unidentified flying objects, given the context of Project Blue Book, which was a UFO research initiative by the United States Air Force. 

The bottom of the map also has an "EXHIBIT "A"" label which suggests that this map was part of a collection or series of evidential items for a report or investigation.
