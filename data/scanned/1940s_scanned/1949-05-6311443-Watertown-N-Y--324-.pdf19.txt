SILVER-TIPPED OBJECT IS OBSERVED MOVING IN SKY

A silver-tipped object trailing smoke moved slowly across the northeast section of the sky Wednesday afternoon between 4:15 and 4:25 and then slowly disappeared, seeming to dissolve from the tail forward, according to Mrs. R. D. 2, Watertown.
"We were looking to the northeast and this meteorlike thing rose in the east and went slowly across the horizon, disappearing in the north," Mrs. ****** said. "It hung like a silver ball right in the north and then dissolved."
Two others who were riding with Mrs. ******, saw this phenomenon, her small son, who was fascinated by the sight, and her mother, Mrs. ******.
