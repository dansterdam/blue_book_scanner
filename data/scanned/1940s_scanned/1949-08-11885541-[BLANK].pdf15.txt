Incident #61, Cla -- Logan, Utah -- 8 September 1947

This incident, and incident #62, which clearly refer to the same objects (witnesses were together at the time of observation) do not have an astronomical explanation.

Since it was dark, any judgment of distance can be greatly misleading, and extremely fast rotation might go ascribed to closeness rather than to true linear distance.
