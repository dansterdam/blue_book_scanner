Report of Trip to Holloman Air Force Base, 5 - 6 May 1948

1. The primary purpose of this trip was to interview Dr. [redacted], representing the Watson Laboratories, who was temporarily on loan to Holloman Air Force Base. Upon arrival, it was learned that Dr. [redacted] had returned to the Watson Laboratories at Red Bank, N.J. A biologist from Holloman Air Force Base stating that Dr. [redacted] would not be available for interview did not reach Eg, A/C in sufficient time to postpone this visit. However, it was learned that Dr. [redacted] would be at Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Ala. on or about 11 May 1948 for an indefinite period of time.

2. A civilian, Mr. [redacted] who works in the same laboratory with Dr. [redacted] had also seen the unidentified flying object while in the presence of Dr. [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] was interviewed with the following stated results:

a. The object definitely was not a balloon.

b. The object appeared round and tower[TEXT OBSCURED BY REDACTION] at a high rate of speed.

3. Mr. [redacted] promised to send in a detailed report through channels, together with the report of another civilian who also witnessed the phenomenon.

4. It was also learned that a Lt. [redacted] who works in the Radar Laboratory at Holloman AF Base Hqs, on several occasions in the past, witnessed high scope unidentified flying objects at high altitude moving at a very high rate of speed. Lt [redacted] was not available for interview; however, a request for a detailed report of these observations was forwarded to the Commanding Officer, Holloman Air Force Base.

5. Lt. Colonel James C. Jensen and Mr. Alfred C. Loedding proceeded to Fronter, Ariz. to interview Dr. [redacted] and follow up on the reports and photographs made on 24 April 1948 near the Atomic Energy Commission's Gila Laboratory. Dr. [redacted] who admitted his primary interest is in a small quiet fieldâ€”paleo[TEXT OBSCURED BY REDACTION] his business card, this laboratory is called [redaction]. According to Mr. [redacted] appeared to be particularly sincere and apparently is quite interested in scientific explorations. Mr. [redacted] stated he was an aircraft recognition instructor during the last war, and that in his opinion, the object sighted definitely was not a wind-blown object. He reiterated that the object was not less than 2000 ft. away and that it was much more than 2000 ft. away when it had greatly increased its speed, the crackling electrical effect having also started when he took the photographs of the flying object and it landed. The smooth paths of approach and departure on the radar scope indicated an exceptionally steep angle of ascent and descent. Mr. [redacted] promised the object turned directly away from him, not as an aircraft turning on a line of flight, but almost as if the object were indicating "war maneuvers" by some another more detailed report is being made concerning this observation.
