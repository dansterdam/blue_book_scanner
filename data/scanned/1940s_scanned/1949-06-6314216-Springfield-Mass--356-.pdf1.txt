11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object flew directly overhead at what appeared to be a very high altitude. Object appeared to be white, round in shape, apparently of metallic construction. When first sighted object was flying horizontally, then it took an abrupt vertical ascent and later descended to its former position. Information indicates weather balloon from Bedford AFB, Mass. could have been in that area during the time of the sighting. Observer was evidently off on his estimate of the duration of the sighting since it could not have gone through the motions he described in 5 seconds.
