rte at the end of 1947, approximately December 23, when I
served in a section of Dukla in Eastern Slovakia in the CSSR, where
at the end of the border guard watch, which I performed with a representa-
tive of Gneu, that at approximately 0130 hours when we were skiing
toward the border to the FS barracks, about 800 m from the border
the barrels of our rifles began to burn us with all the force at
their command, and the rest of the metal parts along with them also
began to burn.

First, the rifle barrels burned from a few seconds to a minute,

Since we were concerned with an unusual phenomenon, we put the
rifles down (from the back of the weapon), and when the FS Gneu represen-

flame only fluctuating with the wind direction like an electric arc
weld, he fired the gun with the barrel down into the snow, and when
the breech began to burn him he threw the rifle into the snow. I
also stuck my rifle into the snow with the barrel down so that it if
fired it would not hurt anybody. At this point my gun's barrel
was extinguished, but the stock, the fittings and the breech of the
gun also burned me, even the metallic lips on the casing burned with the
same kind of small blue flames.

As we stood in semi partial surprise we took such measures at
which I ascertained that this must come from the wind, i.e., such as
a charged wave, for as we manipulated the rifles the moment they were
extinguished, and when we put them on our shoulders with the slings,
the barrels began to burn again, i.e., they from parts of them. When
