Object first seen 15Â° above horizon in the West-Southwest of Lockbourne
entering a ruddy red light which changed to an amber-yellow or alternatively
not exceeding 10-15 seconds. No noise could be detected without the reflection 
that of any star - a good comparison of the size and magnitude would be a 
runway light at full intensity viewed from a distance of 500 ft. Shape 
circular with the exception of a thin wisp of tail extending towards the 
horizon, the tail being 5 times the diameter of the object in length. For 
approximately 10 minutes it remained motionless, then begun a descendant 
to the horizon in about it, however on the horizon in 3", then ascended to 
its original position. About 5", the course being elliptical, counter clock-
wise. It then veered and moved toward the horizon disappearing at 1955-
No sound was heard from the object at any time.

Note: Object appeared about 5 miles from Lockbourne, however info received 
from Godman Fld and Clinton County Tower plus a relayed report from a 
pilot over Columbus, O., indicated that they all had observed a 
similar phenomenon in the same general direction and position at the 
same time.
