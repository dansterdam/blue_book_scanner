The image is a scanned document page that is blurry and tilted, making it difficult to read the text with absolute certainty. However, there does not appear to be a photograph on this page.

Due to the poor quality of the image, the text is not entirely clear, but I will transcribe as much as possible:

```
(DOCUMENT CONTROL DATA - R&D)
(Security classification of title, body of abstract and indexing annotation must be entered when the overall report is classified)

1. ORIGINATOR'S REPORT NUMBER                  FTD-TT-54-967

2. TITLE (And Subtitle) 

3. AUTHOR(S) 

...

8. SPONSORING AGENCY 

9. ABSTRACT

10. DESCRIPTIVE NOTES (Type of report and inclusive dates)

...

14. AUTHOR(S) (First name, middle initial, last name)

...

20. ABSTRACT (A brief factual summary of the report or document. An abstract must be able to stand alone as a very brief document. There is neither 
page limitation nor a requirement to write on abstract page.)

...

29. DECCLASS/DECL IN ACCORDANCE WITH ADDENDUM HERETO
```

Due to the quality of the image, not all sections are legible. The blurry text and tilted perspective also make it challenging to transcribe with high accuracy, which could result in missing or incorrect text. If the document is vital, I recommend finding a clearer, more legibly scanned version for a complete and accurate transcription.
