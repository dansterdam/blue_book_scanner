Incident #124, b, L -- Uniontown, Pennsylvania -- 29 June 1943

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.
its occurrence at the time of a thunderstorm suggests
that the report might be referred to an expert on ball lightning,
to see whether this might be a possible explanation.

Another possibility is that the observers saw a beacon
searchlight projected against clouds, although if this were the
case, it should have continued visible at regular intervals.
