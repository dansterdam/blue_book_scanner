UNCLASSIFIED

In another interview with Mr. J. E. CALDWELL had by
Mr. Malone on April 6, 1936, Caldwell stated that 51% of
the capital stock of the GRAY GOOSE AIRWAYS, INC. had been
voted to him in consideration of two mechanical patents,
for which patent applications were granted in 1928 and 1930.
Since that time he has been engaged in the sale of corporate
stock and has sold approximately 2,000,000 shares.

This stock is of the par value of 10Â¢ and the Corporation
is capitalized for 10,000,000 shares. The entire proceeds
of the sales go to the corporation and are used to pay
expenses in the development of an air-plane. Although
he has been working on this air-plane for the past six or
seven years, he has not met with much success and up the
present time has only succeeded in getting the rear wheel
a few inches off the ground.

Mr. Caldwell's wife, OLIVE E. CALDWELL, is President
and receives $1,000. per year. Mr. J. E. Caldwell is
Secretary and Treasurer, and receives $1,200. per year. He
says he makes the following representations to prospective
purchasers -

That the stock is based on an invention, which in-
vention is used in the development of an air-plane designed
to fly on the Byrd principle of flight, and that the stock
is worth nothing or from $10. to $1,000. per share, depending 
upon his success in developing the air-plane.

Caldwell's technical experience and schooling consists
of a high-school education and two years study in the School
of Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State College, Corvallis,
Oregon.
