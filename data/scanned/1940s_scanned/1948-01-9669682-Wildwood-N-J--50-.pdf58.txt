1. In an interview, [REDACTED], service station operator, said
that he found the object, referred to in previous reports as "an unidentified
aerial object", about 2 years ago. The object was found behind
[REDACTED] Tavern in Warren. The "machine" was obviously made from various
objects, such an old washing machine, parts of a radio, a silo chute,
sieves, and a spark plug, welded together. At the time there
was great excitement nationwide on "flying saucers" or objects and as a joke the
object was talked of by his customers throughout the country and as a joke the
object was taken everywhere on a slightly varicies [sic] parallel schedule which was to
be kept local "sightings" places, intended to give the object its found to
the newspaper for display along with other lines of junk. Before the
source took it to the local [REDACTED] who had charge lived in Warren, so he
did so however, [REDACTED] taking several [REDACTED] took photos-
object and apparently believed it had some [REDACTED] then believed the object
was of this object with [REDACTED] holding it. [REDACTED] the object
actually had been made by [REDACTED] Local, initially.

2. [REDACTED], Warren, Minnesota, stated in an interview
that he had not made the "aerial object" himself but had only "triggered"
the "mail plot" of our conversation with a writing both, at the request of
[REDACTED], manager of the local Gambles to head hardware store. This was
done to where it appear that hot gases had been discharged from the pipes.

3. [REDACTED] was out of town on the day [REDACTED] visited Warren, but in
an interview [REDACTED clerk at the Court by Clouds store, and
[REDACTED], a radio repairman, and himself, had made to
the object as a joke about 2 years ago. In addition to she parts listed in
the first paragraph, the makers also utilized part of a jukebox speaker
store and miscellaneous scraps.

ACTIONS NOTE: In view of the above [REDACTED], no attempt was made
to locate this "aerial object". According to [REDACTED]
it would be almost impossible to do so in view of the
large number of old items in the city dump, which also is
periodically covered over with earth by a bulldozer.
