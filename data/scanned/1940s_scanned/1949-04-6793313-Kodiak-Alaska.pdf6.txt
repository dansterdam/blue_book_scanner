The image you've provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scan of a hand-drawn map or chart, possibly related to a UFO sighting, with various annotations and a label indicating that it is "UNCLASSIFIED."

The text is rather faint and partially obscured, but here is what can be deciphered:

```

UNCLASSIFIED

PHOTOSTATIC COPY OF A PLOTTING BOARD

Please note that due to the quality of the scan and the state of the original document, much of the text is not readable. The text I provided is my best effort to transcribe it, but there may be inaccuracies due to the obscured and faint nature of the source material.
