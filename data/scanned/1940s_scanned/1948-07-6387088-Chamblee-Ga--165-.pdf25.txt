AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(3) Incident #3 (Continued)

Although the data seems to indicate that this sighting could not be
the same as that described in Incident 1, yet the major portion of
this testimony refers to a "silver white light". Observations in the
first instance describe a "blue glow" running the entire length of
the fuselage. When viewed from the ground it is logical to assume
that the blue glow would be not visible.

NOTE: In this connection, Dr. Josef Allen Hynek, astro-physicist,
CSMRU, who is presently to serve as a consultant on this project,
has advised that it is possible for a celestial body to appear
to travel in a straight line and slant downwards. (It is
extremely improbable, al though aerodynamically possible, for
some object to ascend on a flight of 175 thousand theodolites
perpendicular to the earth's its tor above the atmosphere. It is
his further opinion that is is impossible for any celestial body
to maneuver violently and make sharp turns. It is extremely
unlikely for heavenly bodies to appear to move slowly when
passing through the lower layers of the atmosphere, but from
greater distances, it is possible to observe far-distant bodies
for extended periods of time. Objective size is contingent upon
(1) distance of the heavenly body from the earth and (2) its
size. The manner of disappearance of a meteor is like a
light suddenly blinking off.

(4) Incident #4

Object #3 was observed by men and in the country
The description of this
object seems to indicate that it was a meteor. Five of the six
observers said that the object was 'football shaped'; that it appeared
to be a green light with a silvery trail and that it observed level
flight. The last observer stated that the speed was "10,000
m.p.h." and that "It appeared to be 1/4 the size of a full moon",
and that "it was a tail-colored, brilliant light trailing burning
fragments". His entire speed together with the description of a
tail-colored light trailing burning fragments seems to establish
this object as a meteor.

D. COMMENTS:

1. The only incident which possesses absolute intelligence significance is
Incident #1. It is obvious that this object was not a meteor. There has been no
evidence to support any findings of unreliability, nor have there been any ma-
jor discrepancies on the part of the witnesses.

2. Weather reports establish areas of visibility as stated in the observers'
reports.

3. Available information from failed to reveal any evidence of testing ices to
which this incident could be attributed.
