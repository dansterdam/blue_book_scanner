Dear Captain Wotter

On August 11, 1948, this office received a
letter from Mr. E. W. Sheridan, Postmaster, Hamel, Minnesota,
which reads as follows:

"A farmer, who lives a short distance from this vil-
lage, reported to this office that his two sons, aged 8
& 10, had been playing near their dad's job, which
looked like two plates inverted piled to the ground
about eight feet from one of the boys. When it hit the
ground it pounded very rapidly and disappeared.

"This object came in from the northwest & disappeared to
the northeast. It was a silver colored object. Evident-
ly this farmer believes what his sons saw some object and
I have no reason to doubt his word. For your information."

This matter is being referred to you for what-
ever action you deem advisable. No investigation is being conducted
by this office.

Very truly yours,

/s/ M. B. Rhodes
