Capt Ryherd saw two unidentified aerial objects at approximately 8,000 to
10,000 ft traveling above a P-80. He thought they were approximately 15 to
25 feet in diameter. In shape they were circular like a ball on the bottom
but not completely round. The first flew straight and level but the second
flying close behind the first at the same altitude seemed to be going from
left to right and right to left - more like a guard in an aircraft formation.
Due to the noise of the P-80, no sound could be heard from them. They did not
leave any vapor smoke or visible trail. The weather was clear and Captain
Ryherd and Lt Ward Stewart watched them until they disappeared in flight
presumably over Oakland headed toward the ocean.

NOTE: Capt Ryherd showed extreme sincerity throughout the interview
