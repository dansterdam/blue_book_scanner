CONFIDENTIAL UNCLASSIFIED
HEADQUARTERS 2D ARMOIRED DIVISION
Camp Hood, Texas

16 August 1949

SUBJECT: Aerial Phenomena

TO : Commanding General
      Fourth Army
      Fort Sam Houston, Texas
      ATTN: AC of S, G-2

1. Enclosed is a consolidated report of unidentified aerial objects
observed by members of the Field Force between the hours of 2000 - 11 August
and 0100 - 12 August.

2. While the reports obtained from interviewing various members of
the Field Force, which differed in some details, there was general agreement
on the following:

      a. The unusual lights were initially observed in the north and
      moved in a southerly direction.
      
      b. Color of objects and trails was white.
      
      c. Distance from observer to light was unestimable.
      
      d. Period of observation from 3 to 5 seconds.
      
      e. Straight level flight of object.
      
      f. Moving light went out in a fraction of a second.
      
3. It is the considered opinion of the interviewer that the six (6)
reports of 10 August and the attached report of 11 August can be explained
as the natural phenomena of a shower of meteors from the vicinity of the
star Perseids which reaches its maximum display at this time.
      
      These reports of natural phenomena by army personnel who assume
they see unidentified aerial objects bears out the necessity, as previously
recommended, for assignment of qualified technical personnel with special
equipment to carry out the mission of observing and recording unidentified
aerial phenomena.
