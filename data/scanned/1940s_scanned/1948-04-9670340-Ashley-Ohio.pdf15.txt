UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IN SKY. 13 April 1949.

(6) continuedâ€”

Delaware Gazette about this strange object after I read where people in Delaware, Ohio had seen it. I do not have any idea what it was.

(7) On 12 April 1949, Miss [redacted], assistant bank cashier, and Mrs. [redacted], housekeeper, both of [redacted] Ashley, Ohio were interviewed and stated in substance:

On 8 April 1949, at approximately 2:00 to 2:30 PM, we heard a plane fly over the house. It sounded as if it was flying low and seemed to make an unusual amount of noise. A few minutes later Mrs. [redacted] called on the telephone and told us there was a strange object in the sky. We went outside and the plane was gone but we saw the object in the sky. It was an oblong shape, long and narrow, and looked like a silver streak. It was clearly outlined and was moving slowly in a southwesterly direction. It was parallel to the ground and was moving steadily on its way without changing direction. It did not maneuver and I could not see any exhaust trails or hear any sound from it. The weather was clear and there were no clouds in the sky near the object. The wind was blowing from the west and the object was moving into the wind. We could not estimate the altitude nor the size of the object as it was quite a distance from us and there was nothing to compare it with. We do not know what it was.
