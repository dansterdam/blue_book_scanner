There are handwritten marks on the bottom-left of the page, but due to the quality of the scan and the hand-written nature, they are not clearly legible. There do appear to be two separate instances that include sequences like "V-1000" and "R-227" where the numbers could be reference numbers, times, or some other form of notation.
