solely to indicate the possible astronomical content of the reports
at hand, in the primary analysis all evidence was accepted at face
value, with no attempt to evaluate psychological factors. Fre-
quently, however, when fairly liberal limits of tolerance were al-
lowed, the report made sense physically, whereas the literal
statement did not. (Whenever allowance was made for possible errors
arising from subjective reporting, the fact was noted.) Further-
more, while some of the reports verge on the ludicrous, the atti-
tude deliberately adopted was to assume honesty and sincerity on
the part of the reporter. Among the general public, two attitudes
toward "flying saucers" seem to be prevalent: one, that all are
obviously illusions, hallucinations, or hoaxes; the other, that
"there must be something to it." From the outset, this investigator
has attempted to regard each report, insofar as is logically possible,
as an honest statement by the observer, and to adhere to neither of
the two schools of thought.

One further comment should be made: Almost all of the data
dealt with in this investigation are extremely tenuous. Many of the
observers' reports are incomplete and inexact, and some are distinctly
contradictory. Therefore, it has obviously been impossible to reach
definite, scientific conclusions. Most explanations are offered in
terms of probability, the degree of which is discussed in the indivi-
dual reports, but can be indicated only generally in the statistics
which follow.
