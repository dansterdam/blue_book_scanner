Incident 143 -- Groveport, Ohio -- 1 August 1948

...with two essential items missing, (speed with which the
trail was formed and length of time involved in the formation).
It is difficult to come to a definite conclusion concerning the
origin of the object observed, but it is certainly possible that
it was parts of the smoke trail of a fireball. Fireball trails
have been known to act in the manner described. The witness states
that the streak was not like an aircraff shell burst or a
vapor trail from a plane; he implies that the motion of the object
forming the trail was very rapid, and that the distance was con-
siderable. At least, nothing is said which is contrary to the
meteoric hypothesis.
