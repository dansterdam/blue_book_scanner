The image does not contain a photograph but seems to consist of text with some parts obliterated by heavy redaction marks.

Here is the text visible in the document:

"Observed from a bedroom window as a blob of light crossing at very high
speed estimated by observer at approx 1350 MPH. In color, the object
had the appearance of a reflected white light, a cool bright white light with
no red in it. like the moon on a clear night."
