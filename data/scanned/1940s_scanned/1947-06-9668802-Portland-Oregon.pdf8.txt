with only two incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation. 
It would be futile to argue with those who dismiss most of the evidence 
cited as unreliable and untrustworthy. When psychological and emotional
factors leading to sincere but unfounded suspicions and genuine 
instances of honest mistakes are considered, most of these thirty-four
cases of historical interest lose much of their luster.

Dr. Hynek (CivianAero-Medical Institute) has also
made the comments(Edited)

"These are undoubtedly psychological explanations for the
unidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanations for
periods not otherwise explainable. Most errors in identifying real
stimuli results chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, and
size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in this
report. while the incidents form no pattern in regard to area of sighting,
type of object, or manner of performance. There are indications, but
this type of sighting was influenced by earlier reports for
usually would not have been considered unusual or reported, or
been so publicly.

A Summary of
Project Grudge Conclusion

X. Summary of the Evaluation of Remaining Episodes

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix III) reinforce
for certain characteristics. Two of thirty-six statements of the project 
would not have been used if the witnesses not needed of if the cases had
been (Clarification No. 1). Facts were distributed without pattern
throughout the United States. A few were outside the U.S. No two
descriptions of appearance or performance were exactly alike. The non-
static explanation occurred at various times of day and year.

In the following section of this report, each remaining unexplained 
incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to generally discuss
the character of observers, but each case has undesirable elements, and its
sanity has been questioned. The numerical designation is merely the catalog 
order of the incidents in the project files.
