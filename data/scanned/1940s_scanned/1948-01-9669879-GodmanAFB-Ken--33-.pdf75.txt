Here is the text from the document:

```
At approx 1407, 7 Jan 48, Capt Carter was called by Lt Orner, AACS 
Detachment Conmander, to come to Tower to witness an unidentified aerial
object. 

Object appeared round and white (whiter than the clouds that passed
in front of it) and could be seen thru cirrus clouds.

After observing it thru Field glasses for some 3 - 4 minutes, he called 
Col Hix's office. Col Hix, Lt Col Wood & Cept Duesler came to the tower 
shortly thereafter.

Capt Carter then suggested that a group of P-51 aircraft in the vicinity 
be contacted to pursue the object. T/Sgt Blackwell, Tower Operator, 
contacted the flight leade to take a look. Three planes proceeded 
on a heading of apporx 210Â°. One of the planes (Mantell's) scotted 
it at 12000 o'clock position, 'Another plane relayed "this is it,50,000 ft, 
let's level out" First speed as relayed by Mantell (180 MPS) later, 
"object going up and forward as fast as I am" -or "360 MPS. Mantell 
then stated he was going to 20,000 ft and if no closer would abandon chase.
Last radio contact heard by ACQ Carter.

NOTES: Apparently, Mantell blacked out at 20,000 ft or proceeded 
on since the object apparently appeared closer(if such were 
the case) and then crashed thru lack of oxygen.

Does not seem to tally with report that the phenomena 
was "Venus or a comet"
