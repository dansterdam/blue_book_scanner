Charlotte Observer - 31 December 1949.

Cigar-Shaped ‘Thing’ Over City Identified As B-36 Vapor Trail

A ghostly silver tube suspended in cloudless skies brought new visions of air-borne cigars to mystified Charlottians yesterday.

But the strange, oblong object that has been reported streaking over the Carolina since Wednesday had been shorn of its mystery last night.

The control tower at Municipal airport identified "the thing" conclusively as the vapor trail of an Air Force B-36 flying high and fast 40,000 feet over the city.

The tubular-like object, visible over Charlotte for 15 minutes in midafternoon yesterday, was nothing more than a mass of ice crystals formed when the plane's hot engines came into contact with frigid air nearly eight miles up, airport observers said.

Earlier this week, the Carolinas became the center of excited talk all over the country when the mysterious object, described as resembling a neon tube standing on end, was reported seen in Hamlet, Fayetteville, and Greenwood, S.C.

The tubular white mass that appeared over Charlotte at 3:45 p.m. yesterday fitted the same description. There was some speculation that this explanation might also "lay away the mystery from the flying cigars" that were popping up north as New York.

While Charlottians excitedly telephoned the newspapers and the airport for explanations, a silvery streak appeared to hang suspended for a few minutes before drifting slowly out of sight.
