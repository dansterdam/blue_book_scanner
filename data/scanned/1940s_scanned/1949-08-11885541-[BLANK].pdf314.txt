Incident No. 21 - 29 June 1947, 1645, Des Moines, Iowa.
The observer, a bus driver, reported observing thirteen objects at 1200 ft
altitude, traveling in a straight line in file at 300 mph. The objects were
elliptical in form "inverted saucer," in traffic terms 2-3 ft in diameter,
dirty white, and made a sound like an electric motor or dynamo. There was
no further information supplied except that the observer stated they looked
like dots in the sky.

AMC Opinion: These objects were seen just outside Des Moines, and were
flying towards Des Moines. If they were not ordinary objects mistaken for some-
thing else by the observer, but were really unusual aircraft, it seems almost
certain that someone else would have also reported them. There is insufficient
information for a proper analysis.
