I was flying co-pilot in an SNB
over the southwest part of St. Louis
at an altitude of 3,500 ft. and
approximately 2,100 ft. I and the
pilot said to look my around I
saw a dark object traveling over
the city at 3,500 ft which was
shooting out wind or sparks. I [obscured]
object for approximately 10 seconds and then
the sparks disappeared and with-
the same object. I continued around
the same area for about another
ten minute but nothing else was 
seen.
