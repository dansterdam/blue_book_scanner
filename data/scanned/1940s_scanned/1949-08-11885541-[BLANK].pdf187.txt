Incident #5 -- Portland, Oregon -- 4 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this, incident, nor for numerous others (6, 7, 9, 9, 12, 15, 14, 16) which occurred in and near Portland on the Fourth of July, 1947.

Besides being observed in the same vicinity and most of time at the same time, the objects seen have in common a round shape, "ter- rific" speed, abrupt tactics, and quick disappearance. abrupt tactics certainly suggest that the objects were of a very light weight.

This investigator can offer no definite hypothesis, but in passing would like to note that these incidents occurred on the Fourth of July, and that if relatively small pieces of aluminum foil had been dropped from a plane over that area, then any one object would become visible at a relatively short distance. Even moderate wind velocities could give the illusion that fluttering, gyrating discs had come by at great velocities. Various observers would now, of course, in this case have seen the same objects.

The above is not to be regarded as a very likely explanation but only as a possibility! The occurrence of these incidents on July 4 may have been more than a coincidence. Some prankster might have tossed such objects out of an airplane as part of an Independence Day celebration.

If those were aircraft of either known or unknown type,
