STATEMENT BY OBSERVER: At 0228, as I was rounding corner (----) of the
foundry, the light was observed to be just above horizon, ie, the light
was under observation for only a second's duration, at its lowest point
approximately. However, just as the light seemed to pointed zero,
4m Fixltt, it wavered as though it had either been affected by a reduction
in speed or had hit something on the ground. To all appearances, this
object did NOT disappear behind the horizon but behind a hill.
