Incident #53 -- near Lake Meade, Nevada -- 28 June 1947

There appears to be nothing astronomical about this incident. According to the observer, the objects had a speed of 285 
mii and were moving on a course of 120°. Now, since the plane was moving at 295 mi/i on a course of 300°, it is possible that the ob-
served motion of the objects was only apparent (since 180° plus 120° 
equals 300°), and we can conjecture that a cluster of balloons (cosmic 
ray apparatus perhaps) was observed, the motion of which was merely 
a reflection of the motion of the plane.
