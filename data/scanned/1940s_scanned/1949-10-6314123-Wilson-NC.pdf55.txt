ANNUAL METEOR SHOWERS

For the information of the casual observer the following
data concerning the principal annual meteor showers are given.
For leap years the dates should be one day earlier than those
listed here. All dates are those of the evening on which the
maximum is due, even though the shower appears after midnight
and therefore on the next calendar date. For the average year

the Perseids are the richest stream, followed in order by the
Geminids and Orionids. The American Meteor Society is
always glad to receive accurate hourly counts of meteors
made by one person on any of the nights when annual streams
are active, or, for that matter, on any clear night whatever.
