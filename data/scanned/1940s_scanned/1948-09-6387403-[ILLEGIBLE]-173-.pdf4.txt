No. 1735. Rawinonde released from Barksdale AFB at 1500 CST.
Showreports ufo under influence of very tight 107Â° of a local nature which extended through the 500 mb, level. In all probability, rawinonde balloon path was circular following isobar curvature around Shreveport, hence balloon was seen approximately two hours later in the same area. Assuming a balloon leak, not altogether uncommon, the rawinsode could have remained low enough to be seen. Winds reported as high as 70K account for speed. Conclusion: Rawinonde balloon.
