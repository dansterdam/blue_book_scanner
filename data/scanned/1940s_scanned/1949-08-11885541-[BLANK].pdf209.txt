it is impossible to establish t, at it was or was not. (It is un-
fortunate that theodolite measures of the afternoon observations were
evidently not made.)

It has been unofficially reported that the object was a
navy cosmic ray balloon. If this can be established, it is to be
preferred as an explanation. However, it one accepts the assumption
that reports from various other locations in the state refer to the
same object, any such device must have been a good many miles if --
2 to 50 -- in order to have been seen clearly, almost simultaneously,
from places 175 miles apart.

It is entirely possible, of course, that the first sightings
were o some sort of balloon or aircraft, b.t that when those reports
came to Jodman Field, a careful scrutiny of the sky revealed Venus,
and it could be that Lieutenant Mantell did actually 'give chase to the
planet, even though whatever object had been in the course of the exite-
ment elsewhere had disappeared. At the altitudes that the pilot
reached, Venus would have been very much more easily observed than
from the ground, and it might even be that he did not actually pick
it up until he was at a considerable altitude. The one piece of
evidence that leads this investigator to believe that at the time of
Lieutenant Mantell's death he was actually trying to reach Venus is
