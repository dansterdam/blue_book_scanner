Then evidently is true only under the assumption that the evidence is
accepted as reliable and genuine. When psychological and physiological
explanations are taken into consideration, all of these incidents
stand as no exception. As pointed out by Ober Commando der Luft-

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the rest of the
unidentified flying objects to provide plausable explanation for
reports not obviously due to physical phenomenon. It is felt, nev-
ertheless, results chiefly from inability to obtain a good, disarming, ob-

All of the remaining 34 incidednts are treated in detail in subs-

istics of objects, of things so-called "flying saucers" are in gen-

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix III) continued
to resemble each other in all but two of thirty by statement of the reports
did not give the time of the sightings nor read of the M. In these
Cases (Tabulation No. 27).
Most were distributed without pattern
throughout the United States. A few resemble the B. S. Two in two
descriptions or appearance or performances were exactly alike. This non-

APPENDIX

In the following section of this report, each remaining unclassified
incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to summarily or
refute, but to provide psychological diagnosis undisclosable elements, the
cause of the actual. The bulk an interpretation is merely the conjecture
of the address in this project files.
