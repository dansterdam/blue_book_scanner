tact correlation evidence to make the reported events creditable. These
are considered as one only under the assumption that the evidence is
judged as reliable and accurate. When physical, electronic and physio-
logical factors are taken into consideration, then of course the

212 Incidents considered)

Those without sufficient psychological explanations for the respective
individual flying objects to be provided therefore supposedly
provide not otherwise explainable. This category explanations for
the astronomical enigma's presence or errors in identifying usual
objects result chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance,

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in this
report. These incidents come to pattern in regard to area of the
type of object observed, time of observation. There are likewise
several 'chains' of involving more than one observer report-
edly; very few have been considered of unusual or reported
to be fantastic.

PROJECT GROUP A

Summary of ATIC Evaluation of Remaining Reports

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix III) contain a
number of characteristic cases. A few of them, statements of the air-
craft could have been in the land witnesses but none of the...
hold no investigation 17). Most were distributed without pattern
throughout the United States. A few were outside the U. S. The two
categories of appearance or performance were exactly alike. Some reported slighting occurred at various times of day and night.

In the following section of this report, each remaining unexplained
incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to generaize
the character of observants, but each case has undesirable elements, and thus
cannot be disregarded. The numerical designation is merely the sequential
order of the incident in the project files.
