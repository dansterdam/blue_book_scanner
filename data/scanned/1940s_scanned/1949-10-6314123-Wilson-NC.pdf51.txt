It appears to be a hand-drawn map with various geographical and man-made features labeled, such as Tortolita Mountains, Santa Catalina Mountains, Sahuaro Park, municipal airport, city of Tucson, Citrus Groves, etc. It also includes the notation "UNCLASSIFIED" at the bottom of the map and "Encl # 2" at the bottom left corner, indicating that this is likely an enclosure or appendix number 2 of a report.
