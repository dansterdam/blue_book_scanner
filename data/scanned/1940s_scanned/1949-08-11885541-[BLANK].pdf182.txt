Incidents No. 168 -- 20 July 1948, 1330 Hours, Arnhem, The
Hague.
One observer saw an object intermittently through clouds four times.
The object had two decks and no wings, was said to be very high, with
speed comparable to V-2.

AMC Opinion: Insufficient information. It may be well to point
out that the V-2 is not visible in flight, therefore, it follows that
this object would not have been visible as described if travelling at
that speed.
