Arnold Case: Arnold made drawings of objects showing definite shape,
and stated that objects seemed about 20 times as long as wide, estimating them as
20-25 feet long.

He also estimated the distance as 20-25 miles and clocked them as
going 47 miles in 102 seconds. (1700 MPH)

These statements are mutually contradictory:
If the distance were correct, then in order for details to be seen, objects
must have been of the order of 100 X 2000 feet in size.

If, we adopt a reasonable size - [REDACTED] own estimate, in fact, of 50 feet
long, hence about 3 feet wide, the objects must have been closer than a mile , obviously
contrary to his statement.

If we adopt a reasonable limiting size to the objects of 20 X 400 feet,
objects must have been closer than six miles to have shown the detail indicated by 

[REDACTED]. At this distance, angular speed observed corresponds to a maximum speed
of 400 MPH.

In all probability, therefore, objects were much closer than thought, and
moving at definitely "sub-sonic" speeds.

Note: Observational data taken from original [REDACTED] files.
