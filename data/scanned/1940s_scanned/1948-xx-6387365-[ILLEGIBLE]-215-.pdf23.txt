Incident #218 -- Fairfield Suisan AFB, California -- 3 November 21.48

If the observations were exactly as stated by witnesses, 
this "ball of light" could not have been a fireball.  Moreover, 
astronomers receive several thousand reports of fireballs and 
they are prepared for almost any kind of a story.

Even trained observers are sometimes greatly fooled by
the illusion of closeness; cases are on record of fireballs which 
were reported to have fallen in adjacent fields, are usually seen
to span sigma 200 miles away.

A fireball would not come into view at 1000' and rise to
20,000'. If this observation is correct, an astronomical interpretation for the incident can be ruled out. Under unusual conditions 
a fireball might, however, appear to rise somewhat, as a result of 
perspective as it starts into the earth's atmosphere.

Absence of trail and sound definitely does not favor the 
meteoric hypothesis, but, as in many other cases, does not rule it
out with finality.

It does not seem likely that any known meteorological or 
auroral phenomenon would have been as bright as this object was 
reported to be.

In the almost hopeless sargasso of day-or-night-miracle, era- 
plasmoids(?), and other less respectable of the object's origin,
have to note, even though the description does not fit very well,
