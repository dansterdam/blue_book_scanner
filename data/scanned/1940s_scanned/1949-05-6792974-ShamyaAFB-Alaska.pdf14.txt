NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Statement: "On March 29, 1949 at approximately 2330 hours ESK I was
standing outside of hangar number 2 watching for one of our aircraft
which was coming in for a landing.

I saw something go across at approximately 5000 feet at a speed
of approximately 300 mph. I didn't give it much thought at this time as I
thought it was our plane with an engine torching. When the crew got
down I ask them if they had an engine torching and they said no, but
they saw the same object. I would say the object was going about due
north at the time I saw it."
