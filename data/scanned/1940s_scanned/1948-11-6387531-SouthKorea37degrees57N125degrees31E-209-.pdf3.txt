SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO     Commanding General
       Air Materiel Command
       Headquarters Air Force Base
       Wright-Patterson
       Attn: MCIAXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAAS,
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and First
Indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents numbers 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are enclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 12, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Settings" should include a statement of the type of 
radar set used.

                  FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
