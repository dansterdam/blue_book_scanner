11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers did not see the object that made thecontrails. One 
observer stated that he saw a small black dot at the head of
the contrail. Object traveled straight except for a slight
change of course.

Two F-51's left the base at approximately 1135 hours on a head-
ing of 360 degrees making good a course of 350 degrees for appro-
ximately 120 miles. At this time they were given a heading 
back to the base. It was the opinion of the investigating officer
that these aircraft made th&sk contrail and that it was delqyd
in_foming.
