Subject: Pilot's report of "Flying Saucer" vicinity UB.

Dear Sir:

I though you would be interested in the attached report, even
though it probably has no meteorological significance.

Mr. [REDACTED] related the following additional details in a conver-
sation immediately after the reported flight. He and the co-
pilot first sighted the "saucer" ahead of them and at about
the same altitude at which they were flying. It was in sil-
houette against a brilliant evening sky and they, being unable
to determine at first in which direction it was moving, pulled
up to about 1200 ft. to avoid possible collision. In this new
position they could determine that the object was moving away
from them and at a very rapid rate. It appeared to be as large
or larger, in mass, as a C-54 and black in color. It maneu-
vered in the same altitude but soon disappeared from sight because
of its superior speed, which the pilots estimated roughly to
be three times theirs.

I know Mr. [REDACTED] well and he is not the imaginative type.

Respectfully,

/s/ R. Allen Showalter
