[INDISTINCT]

Spherical object (O) brilliantly silver was sighted approximately 1705 p local daylight time. It was approx. 40-50° of the horizon due north of the point of observation as observed as travelling south. The horizon visibility was of 50 miles in that az and the object proceeded out of visual range in that time. at approx 610 pm the object was seen to decrease in velocity at about 50° off the horizon a line due south and in a matter of seconds it disappeared straight upward.

NOTE: Due to the shape of the object no accurate estimate of the altitude or speed could be determined. It was determined in relation to existing cumulus clouds that the object was at least 10,000 to 12,000 ft. above the surface of the ocean. (Rough estimated altitude 30,000 or higher).
