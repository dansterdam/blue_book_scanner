Incident #1, lo, ld, 1n - Muroc, California - 8 July 1947

No astronomical explanation for this incident is possible.

It is tempting to explain the objects as ordinary aircraft observed under unusual light conditions, but the evidence of the "tight circle" maneuvers, if maintained, is strongly contradictory.

This incident must be judged with reference to other similar incidents, which probably have a common explanation.
