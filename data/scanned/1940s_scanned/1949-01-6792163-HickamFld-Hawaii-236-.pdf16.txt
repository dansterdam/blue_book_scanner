The image contains a photograph at the top portion that appears to depict a classic flying saucer or disc-shaped object with a dark dome on top, against a clear sky.

Here is the text present in the document:

Incident No. 235 - 4 Jan. 1949, 1100 hours, Hickam Field, Terr-
itory of Hawaii.
An Air Force pilot saw an object which appeared to be a large round
piece of flat cardboard the size of a T-6. It was white underneath and
dark on top. It approached from 25 mile distance at 3000 ft and circled
the area at 65. The object seemed to "wink" a "bluish-white reflection"
regularly. It departed climbing at 250 angle.

ATIC Opinion: The evidence does not lead to an explanation. It
should be noted; however, that if the object were actually the size of
a T-6 at 3000 feet a greater amount of detail should have been observed.
