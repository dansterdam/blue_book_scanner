It's a Kite? It's a Blimp?—What Is It??? Herald

Odd Phenomenon Seen In Sky

People are seeing odd things in Florida
skies again.

It's nothing so monotonous as flying
saucers or blazing meteors, though. This time
it’s a "burning planet" at South Bay, six!
“meteor” that looks like a "great, big kite"
at Riviera Beach.

Several persons at South Bay described
a Monday night sight that looked as if “one
of the larger planets was on fire with the
light blazing up and dying down.”

“Observed through field glasses, the phe-
nomenon was beautifully colored in reds, blues
and yellows," one witness said.

Several "enterprising spectators" then
looked at the thing through binoculars “They
reported it looked like a circle or halo or
surrounding a blazing star .

At Riviera Beach, several persons, in-
cluding a fireman and a special deputy, hap-
pened to be looking out over the ocean about
dusk Tuesday.

“We saw a strange flying object," they
reported. “It was alive color with a big
white spot on it. It was very rapid—making
was a long way off, but it looked to be about
20 feet across.

"It looked like a great, big kite,” they said.

It wouldn’t be a blimp, they decided. The
way it dodged, slid and speeded up was very
unblimplike.

The Miami Weather Bureau didn’t know
anything about it, and the Navy stated em-
phatically that it was not to blame for either
of the incidents.
