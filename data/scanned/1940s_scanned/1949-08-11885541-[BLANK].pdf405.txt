Incident #44 – near Milwaukee, Wisconsin – 25 June 1947

Information given here is insufficient to indicate what was
seen. If this were a totally independent observation and not one that
was presumably incited by current radio reports of flying saucers, more
weight could be given to it. As it is, with flying saucer talk rampant,
almost anything from meteors to balloons or aircraft would be reported
as saucers by an uncritical observer. It is unlikely, however, that
there was anything astronomical about this incident.
