The image appears to show a diagram rather than a photograph. It depicts two geometric shapes, one above the other. The top shape is a large circle, and below it, there is a rounded rectangle labeled "PROFILE". Beneath these shapes is some text which is somewhat difficult to read due to the quality of the scan. I will attempt to reproduce what is legible:

---
OVERHEAD VIEW

PROFILE

DOT.2.

The rest of the text is not clear enough to decipher. Please note that some details may be incorrect due to the quality of the image.
