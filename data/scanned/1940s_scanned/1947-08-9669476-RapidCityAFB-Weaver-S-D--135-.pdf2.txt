With 701 incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation. This statement is true only under the assumption that the evidence is accepted as reliable and accurate. Then psychological and physiological reactions are taken into consideration all of these incidents can be explained historically as motivated by blind or emotional "beliefs" and historically, unsound reasoning, i.e. hysteria (see ref "N").

212 Incidents considered

Where were sufficient psychological explanations for the sightings unidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanations for reports not otherwise explainable. These errors in identifying new stimuli result chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in the reports. All of the incidents pertain to objects in the air of a certain type of object, or manner of performance. Thus the indications were, the best sightings were influenced by earlier sightings, probably would not have been considered unusual or reported even as "reality".

It is not the intent to analyze the character of observers, but each case has undesirable elements, the amount is disregarded. The method of elimination is mainly the estimation of the simplicity in the projectile Mace.
