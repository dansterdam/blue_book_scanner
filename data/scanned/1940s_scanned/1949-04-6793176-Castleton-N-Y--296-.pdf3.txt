The image provided displays a page that seems to be a guide or legend for aeronautical symbols, specifically for aerodromes, air navigation lights, and radio facilities, though the photograph itself does not appear to depict any UFOs or related phenomena. The text is partially obscured by a vertical black streak on the right side of the page. Here is the text that is visible and legible:

Unfortunately, the vertical black streak and the right edge of the page obscure substantial portions of the text, preventing a complete transcription of the visible document.
