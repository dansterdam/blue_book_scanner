DETAILS

1. This investigation was requested by letter from District Office 
#5, Wright Patterson AFB, dated 17 December 1948, predicated upon a post 
card received at their office.  Information on post card is extracted below:

"Dear Sirs; I was awake last night about 5:00 A.M. - sitting by my window
gazing up at the stars when suddenly there came into view, flying east to 
west over the Charles River Basin, three fast-flying single-engine planes.
The planes had no lights - but city lights made them visible like three pale 
moths.  The two outside ones going in a straight line, the middle one veer-
ing back and forth - although at so great height.  There was no sound."

                                              Yours very truly

                                              _________________
AT BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS

2. This invesstigation was conducted by Captain PRESTON E. BAILEY.

3. Investigation was initiated by this writer 6 January 1949 and it 
was found that the correct name of informant is Mr. ________________,
resides at _____________, Boston 8, Mass.  Mr. ______________ was intervie-
ed with reference to his sighting unidentified aerial objects.  Very little 
Information of any value was obtained, one factor being Mr. _________
