To Whom It May CONCERN.

On the night of 29 June 1947
at eleven P.M., I was sitting on
my front porch when suddenly I
noticed a very peculiar sight.
At around 5,000 feet I saw a
luminous oval shaped object flying
Through the air. IT WAS TRAVELLING
very fast and seemed to just 
disappear within TEN seconds—
I called Mrs. 
attention to it we saw three of 
the same objects at approximately 
Five minute intervals. AFTER seeing
the second one we called to—
Police Sergeant 
they saw the third one.
It was a very spectacular sight
As the second one flew across the
sky a flash of lightining could be
seen through the object IT SEEMED TO
be transparent.
