It appears that there is a small, simplistic sketch or drawing of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the top right corner of the document page. The UFO resembles a classic "flying saucer" design, with a tapered rear end and what could be interpreted as flames or propulsion coming out from the back.

Here is the text from the document:
