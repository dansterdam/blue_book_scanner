NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 4 March 1949, at approx. 1421 o'clock, I, along with [Redacted] of 313lst ASTRONOMICS Station, Watson Labors, all employes Red Bank, New Jersey, was about to enter Mr. Sliver's station's car which was parked in the west side of the main parking area, to ride out to Camp Woods in line of duty. Mr. [Redacted] suddenly drew our attention to something unusual in the sky. I didn't see anything at first, but a B-29 approaching from a general northerly direction, but after putting on my glasses, I soon saw what appeared to be metallic like disc or a non-luminous white or light aluminum color, well in back and to the west of the plane. Within a few seconds after I saw the object it made a half loop-like turn and headed North-west at a jet like rate of speed. Due to its shape it did not resemble anything that I had ever seen before in the sky, nor was there any apparent propulsion vapor or heat waves.

When seen, this object was so far away that it would be impossible to estimate its size and then again it was in sight for about a minute before it disappeared in the haze of the horizon.
