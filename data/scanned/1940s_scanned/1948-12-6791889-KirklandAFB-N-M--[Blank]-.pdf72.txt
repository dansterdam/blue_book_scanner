SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

UNCONVENTIAL AIRCRAFT
(NEAR KIRTLAND AFB-ALBUQUERQUE)

(Unconventional aircraft reported in a supplement to report titled "Experimental Activity, date 3 January 1949.)

1. Personnel of this office, in checking on incident of unidentified aircraft appearing southwest of zone B at 1248 hours on 7 DEC 48 noted that:

a. At 1236 CST, 7 Dec 48, a MWO, Kirtland Field, noted a strange flying object heading SE. This object seen for approximately 2 or 3 minutes by MWO and others in tower. No photograph made.

b. This object was odd in shape, (estimated 20' from tip to tip), no sound or exhaust fumes from it. Disappeared in a cloudless sky. Rate of climb and speed unknown.

c. Safety of this aircraft definitely determined as not being a Navy drone (report attached). Checking with CAA and AF bases as well as aeronautical schools revealed none knew of the object--that it was anomalous in aeronautical characteristics.

d. Another flying object flying 1700 hours, 7 Dec, sighted and chased by a pilot near same place. His description of object and actions parallel those of the MWO, above. See TWX that follows. No details available from very wild claims appearing in newspaper misapprehensions.

2. Gen. TAYLOR, conclusively, at this time directed, on account of need for security, that all engineers who have sighted this flying unknown to be given a re-direct their complaint into this office. It will be his decision as to use of this information after considering the possibility of the necessity to check the stability of their mental health and other pertinent data concerning the character of informant himself.

DETERMINED AT 12 YEAR INTERVALS. NOT AUTOMATICALLY DECLASSIFIED ON BASIS UNCLASSIFIED
