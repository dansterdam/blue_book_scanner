TO     : Commanding General
         Air Material Command
         Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
         Dayton, Ohio
         Attn: AC/XO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, ETIAKS,
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," area first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 235 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Forces, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation Of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
of flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to radar Settings" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.
