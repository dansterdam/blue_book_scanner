Mr. █████ who was driving the car noticed the object first. He called it to the attention of the other occupants. Mr. █████ thereupon opened the window nearest him and observed the object moving at an unknown rapid velocity, at an unknown altitude (which he estimated at 10,000 ft) and in a north by northwest path between 3,000 and 10,000 feet. 
When first sighted the object was to their right and forward of the automobile at an unstated elevation and apparently moving horizontally in a northerly direction such as to cross the highway from right to left. The object was seen by all the occupants of the machine. Mr. █████ could observe no details other than the shape was uniform with no protuberence such as the wings of a plane. It was too distant to enable stereoscopic visualization. There was some solar specular reflection which seemed to change in intensity as the object receded until lost from sight (after an estimated 30 seconds from the time first noticed). Mr. █████ could not explain how it disappeared except that he thought the reflection angle could have changed abruptly. The sun was to the rear of the automobile. Mr. █████ thought at one time he saw vapor trails.
