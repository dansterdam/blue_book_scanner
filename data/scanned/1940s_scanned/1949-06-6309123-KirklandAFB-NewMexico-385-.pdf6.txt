The image does not contain a photograph, but rather it appears to be a diagram or chart of some kind with various symbols and lines. The symbols are mostly asterisks of various sizes, scattered across the page, with a bold line curving upwards from the lower left to the upper right and intersecting with a horizontal line. The word "START" is positioned at the beginning of the curved line, and there is text along the line that appears to be annotations, though it's not clear without more context.

Here is the text as if I'm acting as an OCR system:

---
START

MILKY WAY

END
