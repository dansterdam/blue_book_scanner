TO : Commanding General
Air Materiel Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: MCIMXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIMX,
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and a first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents' summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation Of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 15, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Sighting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.
