14. A suggestion was made that persons might possibly be observits
a split beam used for advertising by Universal Motors, Inc., 29th and
Kenning Streets, Salisbury, Maryland. On 9 July 1949, Universal Motors
was contacted telephonically and it was ascertained that the beacon had
not been operating during this period of time.

15. On 10 July 1949, Mr. [REDACTED] 522 Illinois Court, was
again interviewed and the following additional information obtained:

Mr [REDACTED] relieved in the U. S. Air Force on 10 January 1942 and
was discharged from the Fort Dix, New Jersey, Separation Center on
5 October 1945. He was born 13 October 1922.

The possibility of the objects seen by Mr. [REDACTED] being flashes of
light on the bottom of the cloud was discussed. Mr. [REDACTED] again flatly de-
nounced any such theory and insisted that he had seen objects as described
in his previous interview.

Accident Ward of John Hopkins Hospital, Monument & Eution Streets, Ballti-
more, Maryland, concerning the report made by [REDACTED] However, the
doctors on duty in the Accident Ward were hastily interviewed between
patients, and no information concerning this investigation was resolved.
It was suggested that this investigation be cleared through the office of
the Director, John Hopkins Hospital, and the same information might be
obtained through that office as to doctors on the third floor on 25 June
1949 between the hours of 1630 and 2030.

18. On 12 July 1949, this Agent interviewed Mr. [REDACTED] 
Catonsville, Maryland, who stated, in substance, that he was flying a
Steerman, N-1379V, towing a 180-foot banner on a 3500-foot rope behind
the plane. Each letter in this sign is 7' by 4'. He did not know what
area he was flying, as he was in radio contact with a silver aerocoupe
owned by the Atlantic Aircraft Division of the Municipal Airport. He saw
no strange objects while in the sky and had heard nothing concerning this
matter.
