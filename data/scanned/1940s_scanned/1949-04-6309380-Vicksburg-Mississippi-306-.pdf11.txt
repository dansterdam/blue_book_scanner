The image appears to contain no photographs but instead shows handwritten notes and drawings, possibly calculations or observations related to the UFO report. However, due to the quality of the image and the handwriting, transcribing the exact text is challenging. Here is my attempt at transcription, but please note it might contain inaccuracies due to the quality:

```

10° ?

Please be aware that the parts followed by asterisks (*) and question marks (?) indicate sections where the original text is unclear, and I'm unable to provide an accurate transcription. The document also has "UNCLASSIFIED" stamped in two places.
