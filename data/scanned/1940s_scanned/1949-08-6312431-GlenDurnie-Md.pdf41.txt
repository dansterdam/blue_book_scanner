Mr. John W. Loebner, Atty. at Law.
509 Calvert Building,
Baltimore, Maryland.

Dear Mr. Loebner:

With further reference to the whereabouts of Gray Goose Airways, I have uncovered the following information.

From a stockholder in Aberdeen, Maryland, I learned that Caldwells are now operating under the name "Rotor Planes, Inc." The new set-up is supposed to be incorporated under the laws of Maryland, and is supposed to be taking over the assets of Gray Goose Airways, Inc. Stockholders in the latter are being asked to forward money to have their stock transferred into the new company. The details of this transition are set forth in a 3-page circular letter, accompanied by an artist's conception of Mr. Caldwell's most revolutionary flying machine, and a paper to be signed and returned with money if the victim wishes his stock registered in the new company. It would seem that Caldwells are carefully selecting the stockholders whom they wish to know of the change; I am a stockholder but have not received any such notice.

"Rotor Planes, Inc." have taken box 98 at the Post Office at Glen Burnie, Maryland. I made extensive investigations at Glen Burnie this date and find that Caldwells have taken a farm house and barn for their headquarters, about three miles south of Glen Burnie on the old Annapolis Road, State Route #2.

I trust this information will enable you to proceed.

Very truly yours,

(signed) Willard A. Driggers.
