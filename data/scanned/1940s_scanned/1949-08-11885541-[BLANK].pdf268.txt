COLLATERAL STUDIES

In relation to the investigation, besides the individual
analyses of separate incidents, two brief studies were conducted.

Certain breakdowns of the subject reports were made, for
the purpose of determining whether they include any prevalent
characteristics; for example, incidents were grouped according to
the date of occurrence, the hour, the presence or lack of noise,
presence or lack of trail or exhaust, number of observers, general
qualifications of observers (whether with appropriate training for
accurate observation of aerial phenomena -- aviators, weather ob-
servers, etc., or laymen). Although these classifications were
helpful in spotting identical or similar incidents, they revealed
no pertinent trends.

As a matter of general interest, the highly dubious works
of Charles Fort (which, as has been stated in a previous report,
are entirely reprehensible in viewpoint, but which do contain ac-
counts of unusual aerial sightings over a period of many years)
were examined, to check whether any of the reasonably authenticated
incidents are similar to those recent reports. It was found, how-
ever, that Mr. Fort's accounts do not include sufficient specific
evidence to reveal positive similarities, and the most that can be
said of the works is that they indicate that strange objects in the
sky have been reported long before this post-World War II flurry.
