SUMMARY: (Under each numbered report. Give significant facts in sequence paragraph. List enclosures at lower left. Build this report of AF Form 112—Part III)

At 2000 hours on 8 Aug 49, at Biloxi, Mississippi, an unidentified object was
sighted in the sky by 1st Lt [name redacted] of Keesler AFB, Miss. The object
sighted appeared to be in the shape of a large beach ball about two (2) feet in di-
ameter. The object was a bright yellow in color with a faint glow around it as though
seen through a mist, as the moon appears when seen through a thin fog. It was trav-
eling at a speed estimated at from 600 to 800 mph. The object was at an altitude of
approximately 1,000 feet and was below the clouds and in the clear (VFR). The obser-
ver could distinguish no definite sounds coming from the object because of the sounds
of local traffic and aircraft flying local in from Keesler AFB (Four B-25s and one C-47).
The object disappeared after being in sight for only about twenty (20) seconds, 
it just seemed to blink out and was gone. There was no exhaust visible. No distin-
guishing features were noted.

The sighting of this object took place only seventeen (17) hours after a similar
object was reported being seen hurtling across New Orleans, Louisiana.
