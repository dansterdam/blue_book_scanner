INCIDENT #747 -- Springfield, Ohio -- 27 July 1948

The description of this incident, although rea...rs, is in
agreement with the hypothesis that the object observed was a fire-
ball. Thus, "bright red tail of fire," "traveling in straight line," 
"great height," and the short time in sight all increase the probab-
ility that it was a bright meteor. The fact that it was traveling 
north, at this time of night, implies that the meteor was crossing 
the orbit of the earth on its way toward the sun which the collision 
occurred.
