BIO COM[...]

Mrs. [redacted] appeared to be a person of average intelligence and reliability. A neighborhood check revealed that Mrs. [redacted] is well liked in that neighborhood and is considered to be an average person and not very likely to exaggerate or imagine things. The description of the flying object by Mrs. [redacted] is very similar to that made by Mrs. [redacted]
dated 26 May 1949, subject, "Unidentified Flying Object." Mrs. [redacted] stated that she had told no one of her observation until a newspaper article appeared about a week later naming a "flying disc." Mrs. [redacted] then called Mrs. [redacted], and told her
that she had seen a "flying disc." The close similarity of the two descriptions, with the exception of the dates sighted, may have been partly caused by the two informants talking their observations over on the telephone prior to being interviewed.
