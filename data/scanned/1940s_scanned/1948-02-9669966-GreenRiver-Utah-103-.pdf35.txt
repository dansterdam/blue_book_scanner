I submit there is a likelihood that on June 21, 1947, something like a space-ship came here from the moon and upon February 21, 1948, returned to the moon.

This is of course speculation.

But has anyone yet explained the "flying discs" in terms of all the pretty-well proven facts in connection with them?

Has anyone yet devised a fuel powerful enough to kick a rocket from earth to the moon?

There have been hundreds of reports, during the past century, of observations which imply this world is visited from outside space. A string of contacts by these portentous visitors ending suddenly indicates chilling fear beyond ours, to the point where it would be in expedient for their numbers to have to do with us en-masse.

These reports have not been seriously considered by science, which in general ignores them.

However, according to Dr. Roes of Chamberlin Observatory, Denver, there is nothing in astronomy to explain the thing which exploded over Morehouse, Dr. Linkingâ€™s idea that the thing was a meteor flatly disregards Dr. Root's opinion, which may have been based on the Denver Post's statement that a Denver man saw the associate object twenty minutes before the explosion occurred.

I submit that the army needs men who are capable of recognizing the anomalies bodforementioned when they occur, even if only to aid in speculation regarding them.

The undersigned offers his services to that end, if the Army may wish to avail itself of them.
