out from a nozzle in the year which he thought he perceived. The flame
extended some 30 to 50 feet behind the object and became deeper in in-
tensity (rudder) and increased in length as the object pulled up into a
cloud. No disturbance was felt from air waves, nor was there any wash
or mechanical disturbance when the object passed. No sound was heard.

Co-pilot ******* attention was drawn to the object by *******
remarks. His description of the object and its maneuvers was very similar
to that of ******* except that he did not observe a cockpit in front
nor did he see any radar "blipout". His drawing and description also indi-
cated windows or openings on the side. He estimated the object passed
at greater distance than did Capt. ******* He saw the "exhaust" as a
parallel wide flame which appeared to come from the entire rear of the
object rather than from a nozzle never growing any wider than the width
of the object itself, although he noticed the increased length of the
flame as the object "pulled up".

The night was clear with a bright moon and broken cloud coverage of
4/10 at 6,000 ft. Both estimated the object to be in sight approximately
10 to 15 seconds, considered sufficient time for experienced pilots to
determine whether the "ship" was a reflection, caused by some rare meteor-
ological or astronomical phenomenon -- or was a material object.

After extensive investigation and analysis; and after consideration
of all possibilities, approaches and pertinent data to suggest at least
one valid hypothesis or explanation to the sighting were exhausted, the
incident was appropriately classified as a true "Unknown".
