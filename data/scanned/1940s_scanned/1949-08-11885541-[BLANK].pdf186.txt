Incident No. 193 -- 24 Oct. 1948, between 1100 and 1130 G.I.T.,
Koblenz, Germany.
An Air Force officer heard a sound like an F-47 at high altitude,
looked up and saw a dark object shaped like a coin at undetermined al-
titude, 90Â° elevation flying southwest at fast undetermined speed in
level flight.

AFC Opinion: There is nothing to controvert the conclusion that 
this object was a conventional aircraft at a range outside the limit
of visual resolution.
