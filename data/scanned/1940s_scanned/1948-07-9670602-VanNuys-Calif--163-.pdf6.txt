Gentlemen:

REPORT OF STRANGE OBJECT IN FLIGHT

On the evening of 22 July 1947, my wife and I were having dinner in the 
patio of an open air market in Van Nuys, California. We arrived there
about an hour before dark. Our attention was attracted by other patrons
to a strange object in the sky almost directly overheard.

Description. It appeared to be round and probably spherical. At first
it appeared to be a weather balloon at about 20,000 feet but there was none
of the characteristic bobbing. The wind was blowing on the ground in
rather strong and gusty. The object was quite steady, hence we watching
it a while I concluded that whatever it was it was at a great height but not
a star. It had a bluish haze or luminance like a fluorescent lamp and as the
sun set the color gradually changed to an orange color at dusk and finally
snapped off like a lamp when you throw the switch (at which moment I was
looking right at it). In about an hour that I had been observing it, the
object had travelled through a vertical arc of about 5 degrees or more.
The outline of the object was clear and sharp and symmetrical (no fuzziness
or blurring); the air was very clear with visibility unlimited; ground
temperature about 70-75 degrees dropping to about 60 degrees an hour after
dark (two hour time lapse); direction of travel was from East directly
toward the sun.

Very truly yours,

Capt. Ord-----
