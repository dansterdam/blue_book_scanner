[REDACTED]
Page 2 Incident: ____
Name and Addre.e of Observer:

Description and method:

Source of Information: Airfield-Suisun AFB, Calif
                       Control Tower Operator
                       FFC, USAF
Reliability of Source: Considered fully reliable and a competent airman. Sighting
also witnessed by [REDACTED] Sgt AF [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] OIC
considers them high type individuals fully qualified both mentally and
physically for control tower duty. Considered competent, reliable observers
psychologically stable.

OBJECT IN SIGHT:

Object first got into view about 2 miles north of the Control Tower
flying at low altitude between 500 & 4000 ft, climbing on a low trajectory
with a speed estimated in excess of 1000 MPH. Immediately after sighting 
[REDACTED] remained to east side of tower. By this time object was estimated
to be not more than 1500 feet altitude and its speed had slowed for several
seconds to perhaps 200 MPH. At this state object had a very slight undulating
or bouncing motion. When in position oriented with the Line between the
tower and the air freight terminal, but a slight distance east of the terminal,
the object took off almost vertical rise or climb and leveled off again
at an estimated 3000 ft. At this point [REDACTED]
watching as PFC [REDACTED] attempted to summon the AACS operations Officer.
Sgt [REDACTED] reported the object almost immediately afterward started a
fast climb toward the south-southeast and reached about 20,000 ft at which
point he lost sight of it. PVT [REDACTED] never saw the object again after
leaving to phone.

Object was viewed thru 8-power binoculars, All that could be seen was a
circular light one to 2 feet in diameter. It had the intensity of a Ramp
floodlight and was so bright that it blanked out any silhouette (if any)
when sighted in binoculars. In size it was comparable to one of Fairfield-
Suisun AFB's high-intensity runway lights. No sound was herd nor was
any exhaust trail observed. The light was clearly seen with the naked eye
It was brilliant but by no means blinding. Observer (PVC [REDACTED]), was
convinced it was not an aircraft's navigation light. The night was clear,
and the wind indicated southwest at 10 MPH on tower instruments. A weather
balloon had been released 45 to 35 minutes previous to sighting but was
lost ten minutes after release.
