Dear Dr. Hynek:

Confirming our phone conversation, here is my impression
of the meteors seen on the night of June 27.

I am not sure of the time, but it was around 12:30. The
meteors looked unusually large and unusually bright - at
least as bright as the full moon. I saw it in the western sky -
perhaps a little south of the west. There were times at intervals,
its horizontal direction was not from sight to left but from
northwest to northeast.

I saw it through trees and can not tell the length of
its visible travel. It was visible to me for perhaps a second
to a half.

Physically it was large primarily, while with a rather
short thick tail that had distinct blue color. A sort of
parallel tail, thinner, was definitely red and yellow.

I would say that its angle with the horizon was about 15Â°.

I would be interested in hearing if it landed and has been
discovered.

                              Sincerely,
