1949 was a year of few "flying saucer" photographs, but two
of them were among the best yet. On May 14, 3 discs were photograph-
ed by the Air Force over the Stephenville, Newfoundland Air Base.
They were flying in formation. That same year, on February 23, 
Commander ----------- of the Chilean Navy Antarctic
Expedition photographed hundreds of feet of movies of "Things"
circling above their ships.
