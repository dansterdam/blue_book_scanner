'SAUCER' VIEWED NEAR TILLAMOOK

TILLAMOOK, Jan. 24 (Special - The flying saucers are back.

Mr. and Mrs. Burt Leedington, driving south on hiway 101 at 11:05
a.m. Sunday, saw a silvery object in the sky above them at an
elevation of about 2000 feet, they reported.

Mrs. Leedington first discovered the object, about one quarter mile
southeast of Pleasant Valley. She called her husband's attention to
it and they watched it as they drove slowly to the store at Pleasant
Valley.

There the store operator, Allen Hughes, went with Leedington to ob-
serve it, but by that time it had disappeared. A check of the airport
here indicated that a yellow plane was the only one in the air at the
time.

Mrs. Leedington described the object as round and silvery. She said she
could not tell whether it was moving.
