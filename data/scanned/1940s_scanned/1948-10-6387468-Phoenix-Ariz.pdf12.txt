Phoenix, Ariz.
November 3rd

Dear Dr. Hynak:

On October 24th I noticed a very strange star or fireball in the Eastern sky. It was green and my first impression was that it was a plane. It moved very slowly south and slightly north as it wasn't certain of which way to go. It slowly changed its course to west.

Being very curious about this star, I watched it very closely, without taking my eyes away once.

It took at least 75 minutes to cross over Phoenix. The star seemed to be drawn to other stars, and when it came close to them, it would become very bright.

Everytime this star would light up and leave the other stars, it would be dimmer. Finally, we could hardly see it, when I thought it had completely disappeared, it suddenly became very bright and fell apart.

From here in Phoenix, I can point out just where the fireball traveled, but it is rather difficult on paper but it did start in the east, and end up west.

If there is anything else I can tell you that you would like to know concerning this fireball, I will be very happy to tell you.

Yours truly,
