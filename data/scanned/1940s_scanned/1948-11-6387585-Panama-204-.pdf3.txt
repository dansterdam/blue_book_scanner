The document provided has a total of three photographs presented in a collage format, with each photograph accompanied by caption text.

1. Top left photograph: This is an unclear image with a light-toned background that transitions from lighter at the top to darker at the bottom. Within this background, there is a small light dot or smudge, but details are hard to discern due to the image's poor quality or the reproduction of the photograph.

2. Top right photograph: This photograph shows what seems to be a long, vertical streak of light against a dark background, with the streak being thicker at the bottom and tapering off toward the top. The bottom of the streak has a bright, rounded section, giving the appearance of a comet or a similar celestial body.

3. Bottom left photograph: This image shows a wide, panoramic view that is bright along the bottom edge and transitions into darkness towards the top. The bright area has irregular textures that could be indicative of a terrain or surface, while the dark area above seems to represent the sky or space.

AT DAWN—The comet's broad tail gleams with millions of stars. Comet's head looms on the left in an earlier photo, and comet's bright nucleus (lower left) pushes out new jets of gas against solar wind's sweeping action. [Incomprehensible]

AWESOME HALLEY'S COMET LAST APPEARED IN 1910

BRIGHT NEW COMET
It has a tail extending for 15 million miles

Why the far-flung fluffs of dust are flying, & from the tail will arise a spectacular sight in the sky. Our knowledge, Dr. Bartlett said, comes from a 1955 paper on Comet Arend-Roland by the French astronomer Audouin Dollfus. Mr. Whipple caught up on the phenomenon in 1950, and the Frenchman learned, he said, with the software money power that had for had captured one of the brightest and spectacular comets that had filled history's firmament.

The new comet is so spectacular—so much brighter and swifter-paced than the last two in the skies—that thousands will see the naked eye. Dr. Whipple said. A thousand times as powerful as a normal snowball, the comet is an old fact. A fiery meteorite hurled at least 1,670 miles from Earth. Whipple has pointed out that less than a quarter of the comet's total mass, less than one-tenth of the length of a football stadium, is suffused into the blackness in the night when before, and then new tails grow on the side and pads like an infant's pushed in front of the head by the sped of a tic that has kept gaining headway. It is sufficient to take—and widen the head — and increase push in the height and as big as the Washington Monolith and weight less than an ounce.

NEW COMET 15 million miles long and growing new parts
Not yet named, the object tail is powered by sunlight, its body by a nuclear winter. Above it tracks at a good rate across the Northern Hemisphere.
