The image you've provided appears to be a black and white photograph of a circular object or phenomenon with a pattern of indentations or markings covering its surface. It seems to be an aerial view or a close-up of a pattern, and there is no clear scale or reference to accurately determine its size or the nature of what's depicted.

No text is visible within the provided image, thus there is no text for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output. If there is textual information on another part of this document or page, you would need to provide that section for text extraction.
