It is apparent, from the data given above, that the object sighted at Godman Air
Force Base on 7 January 1948 was not the planet Venus. Therefore, this sighting must be 
considered as unexplained.

1. It is doubtful that Venus could be observed by the unaided eye from the
ground or that 15,000 feet as it would probably be hidden by the high degree of sky brightness
due to its proximity to the sun.

2. Jupiter is the only other planet within 400 of the sun during this period and
its magnitude of brightness is only -1.4 as compared with -3,1 of Venus, making it im-
possible to observe with the unaided eye. However, the following figures on the Moon
are exhibited for your information:
