CONCLUSIONS

No definite and conclusive evidence is yet availabl;, that
would prove or disprove the existence of these unidentified objects
as real aircraft of unknown and unconventional configuration.
It is unlikely that positive proof of their existence will be ob-
tained without examination of the remains of crashed objects.
Proof of non-existence is equally impossible to obtain unless
a reasonable and convincing explanation is determined for each
incident.

Many sightings by qualified and apparently reliable witnesses
have been reported. However, each incident has unsatisfactory
features, such as shortness of time under observation, distance
from observer, vagueness of description or photographs, incon-
sistencies between individual observers, and lack of descriptions
data, that prevents definite conclusions being drawn. Explanations,
of some of the incidents revealed the existance of simple and
easily understandable causes, so that there is the possibility
that enough incidents can be solved to eliminate or greatly reduce
the mystery associated with these occurrences.

Evaluation of reports of unidentified objects is a necessary
activity of military intelligence agenies esp. Such sightings are
inevitable, and under wartime conditions rapid and convincing solu-
tions of such occurrences are necessary to maintain morale of
military and civilian personnel. In this respect, it is considered
that the establishment of procedures and training of personnel is
in itsalf worth the effort expende on this project.
