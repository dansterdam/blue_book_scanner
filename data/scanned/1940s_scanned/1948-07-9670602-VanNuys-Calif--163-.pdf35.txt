SUBJECT: Analysis of Project "Grudge" Reported Incidents

TO: Commanding General
Air Materiel Command 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: MCIAKO

1. Reference is made to the letters from your Headquarters to 
this station of 22 November 1948, 6 December 1948, and 14 January 1949, 
Subj "Project SIGN", requesting that reported incidents 1 
through 172 be analyzed to determine whether or not these might have 
been caused by balloons launched by these laboratories.

2. A listing has been compiled of all balloons launched by these 
laboratories and the first contractor's field at atmospheric research, 
Paso, from the first such launching to No. 101 on 17 November 1948. 
Each of these launchings has been compared with the reported incidents 
1 through 172. Factors of comparison were data of launching and data 
of recovery with respect to date of reported incident; place of launch-
ing and place of recovery with respect to the place of reported in-
cidents, and possible deviations from the known flight path with respect 
to the place of reported incidents. So that your office may make an 
independent analysis, three copies of the launching lists are inclosed.

a. Incidents No.5 through No. 16 reported on 4 July 1947
throughout Oregon, Idaho and Washington gave, in general, descriptions 
of clusters or groups of objects. The 5 July 1947 balloon launching
No. 34 at Alamogordo was a cluster of balloons and was not recovered, 
and so might be suspected of being the cause of these reports. However, 
this is not the case. The only flight was terminated in the Navajo 
Navajo Valley only 43 miles northwest of Alamogordo, that is the 
balloon was downed when determined both by airplane spotting and by 
radio direction finding upon the balloon manufacturing instruments, 
The course of the balloons and instruments was presribed by the un-
passability of the terrain. 

b. Balloon release No. 107 7 July 1947 could compar-
with reports for date within incidents No. 1 through No. 5, and again 
with incident No, 10, This balloon flight was again a cluster,
