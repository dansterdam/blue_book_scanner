The image provided appears to be a heavily redacted and poor-quality photocopy or scan of a document page. It is very difficult to make out most of the text due to the quality of the image and the numerous redactions. There does not seem to be any distinct photograph or graphic image other than shapes that are likely the result of redactions or marks made for classification purposes. 

I cannot accurately perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on this image due to the low resolution, heavy redactions, and artifacts. However, I can attempt to reproduce some of the text fragments that are slightly legible:

-----
2. Jan 1950

[Redacted] 1090

[Redacted] 50 [Redacted]

2031 [Redacted]

[Various redactions and illegible text]
