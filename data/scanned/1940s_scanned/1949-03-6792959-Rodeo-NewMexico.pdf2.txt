On Sunday night, April 3rd, 1949, Mr. ------------, patrolman
of the Border Patrol, U.S. Immigration Service, came to my home to
report the following:

On Thursday, March 31st, 1949, Mr. ---------- reported to Mr. -----------
that a Mr. --------- and he were very near an explosion and saw an overhead
and missing. He first heard a very heavy explosion and thought that
a plane had crashed. The time of day or night is not fixed in this
second hand report.
The following day, Mr. ------------ and Mr. ------------ rode on horse-
back to the site of the explosion and described a swath in the brush
and timber culminating in a huge crater. Mr. ------------ described a piece
of metal about 12 inches in diameter and pointed. He felt it was some 
kind of a "rear head" for a guided missile. Nothing resembling a plane
was found.
The site of the explosion is described as wild mountainous country,
about ten miles east of Rodeo, New Mexico and about five miles from the
ranches of Mr. ------------ and his nearest neighbor. The nearest landing
field by plane is said to be at Rodeo. The site is about seventy-five
miles by automobile from Douglas.
Anyone desiring to reach Mr. ------------ of the Border Patrol, phone Douglas 126 can guide
one to the ranch of Mr. ------------ or his nearest neighbor and from there, either
of these persons can guide a party to the explosion site.
It is suggested that Davis Monthan Air Force Base, conduct further
investigation.
