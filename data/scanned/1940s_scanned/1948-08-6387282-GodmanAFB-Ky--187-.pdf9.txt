SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO : Commanding General
     Air Material Command
     Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
     Dayton, Ohio
     ATTN: AC/INCO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, AC/INCO, 
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 3 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau, Comments based on this review are enclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
of Flight of Objects," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished. Also, radial tracks and non-
track sightings (the direction toward which the object appears to move,
"Relative to Radar Settings") should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.
