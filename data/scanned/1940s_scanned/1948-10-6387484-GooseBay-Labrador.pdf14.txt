196
M/Sgt Francis H. Mills, AF 16134800
1932 AACS Sq. Goose Bay Labrador, APO 677. N. Y.
CCA Operator

Eyes(s): Good ability to determine color and speed of moving objects and good ability to determine size at distance. Reliability good. Character & intelligence: excellent

Target picked up on GCA scope at 2151Z 1 Nov at 
3-3/4 miles from station on a bearing of 212° from station. Object travelled on a heading of approximately 212° and disappeared at 7-1/2 miles on a bearing of 182° from the station. Blip travelled the 4 miles in 4 minutes and 7 seconds timed with a stop watch. (A speed of approximately 60 mph) Operators stated blip was too small at 7-1/2 miles to be an aircraft and too large to be a bird. Wind was from 270° to 300° and at 5 to 10 mph. Target witnessed by 2 CAA Operators.

Discrepancy reported: 2d Ind dated 24 Jan 1949 from ?/Hq 1272d Air Base Gp, Newfoundland Base Command, MAPS, para 3a & 3b states that 

"By plotting a point 3 and 3/4 miles from the station on a bearing of 212° and following a flight path on a heading of 212° for a distance of 7-1/2 miles where the object disappeared would not put the object's disappearing point 182° from the station.

This same message stated that the object travelled the distance of 4 miles in 4 minutes and 7 seconds timed by a stop watch. If this were true, the object could not have disappeared from view and off the mil scope on which it was sighted; neither could it have disappeared at one hundred and eighty-two degrees from the station assuming that it did travel on a bearing of 212° as stated."
