Incident #153 -- Georgia -- 5 August 1948

The limited description which is offered here is consistent with that of a daytime/bright fireball, in spite of the observer's statement that the object was not a "shooting" or falling star. Actually, fireballs bear little resemblance to the ordinary, frequently-seen meteors. The trail of sparks at the end is sometimes associated with a fireball.
