The image provided is a scanned document that is largely faded and difficult to read due to the quality of the scan. It appears to be from the Project Blue Book investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). There is no photograph present in this document. However, due to the faded text, accurately replicating all the details as an OCR system would be challenging and likely result in several inaccuracies. I will do my best to transcribe what is legible:
