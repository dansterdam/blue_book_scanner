AN INCIDENT REPORTED ON CRASHED FLYING SAUCERS

SUMMARY

The investigation of this incident was predicated upon a
letter, dated 26 November 1949, to the OSI from the FBI. It 
was pointed out that Bruce Cabot, a motion picture actor, had
reported of hearing a fantastic story told by a Mr. Newton 
concerning a crash of two flying saucers. 

Cabot said that according to Newton, the disks contained 
men and he had in his possession bits of clothing worn by these 
men. 

The OSI expended considerable efforts attempting to con-
tact the various people concerned to get all possible details. 
Mr. Newton turned out to be most uncooperative and the case was 
finally closed concluding that the whole matter was a hoax.
