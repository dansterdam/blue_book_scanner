CDID 333.5 (1 Mar 49)
SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Object

3. The object observed, is believed by the Base Intelligence Officer 
to be the star Sirius. This star will appear in the southern horizon during 
the time indicated and is usually bright due to it's extreme heat and closeness to the earth. Sirius is relatively dull and will appear to change co-
lor as most stars do when at an altitude of less than ten (10) degrees above the horizon. Observing a star through binoculars will increase the color effect. 
The fact that the object disappeared instantly can be accounted for when at such a low elevation.

4. Only one theodolite reading was taken as shown in Exhibit "H".
