Flaming Object At Vandercook
Warning Flare

"That was no meteor—that was a fuse!"

The mysterious flaming object which burned a hole in the pavement Monday night in front of the house of Mrs. Lewis Westcott, 309 Merritt Drive, Vandercook Lake, probably was an emergency road flare. That is the report of the Clark Equipment Co. laboratory which analyzed a sample of the object.

The anility of the railroad to see and the sample are identical, the laboratory reported. The laboratory was a truck flare, used by highway employees the same purpose as an emergency signal on the railroad.

The object, which smelled faintly of phosphorus, was retrieved by Mrs. Don Fane.
