Incident: 206

Sgt █████ stated he was watching some cloud formations in the North-
east portion of the sky when he observed a white stick materialize and
lengthen out. At first he thought it was sky-writing but as it con-
tinued to advance he thought it appeared as a whole unit. Object 
pursued a northwestern direction and entered a very large cloud formation.
As the object emerged on the northwest by north side the object appeared
larger and he was able to get a clearer view. The object appeared snow-
white. At one time Sgt █████ was able to obtain a side-view impression.
It seemed as if the side surface was broken by windows. The nose, too,
was short in comparison to the length. There was definitely a wing
formation - low wing and very short in comparison to the length of the
fuselage. Sgt █████ perceived the object six times thru the cloud
formation in various attitudes - see attached drawings. Sgt █████
in his drawing estimates the length of the fuselage to be 300 feet.
However, he stated that it would be impossible for him to estimate
the length of the object if the craft was using a rear type propulsion
and utilizing a fuel that left a white exhaust. Fuselage apparently
had no tail assembly. It appeared as a straight body tapering off from
directly above the wings to a very small point.

Evaluation: D-5 - Sgt █████ maintained a very cool point.
