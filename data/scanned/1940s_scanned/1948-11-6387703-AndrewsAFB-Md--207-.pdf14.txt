The document image appears to contain two photographs. The first photograph, situated towards the upper portion of the document, seems to depict an aerial object that is small and distant, thus its details are not clear. The second image, towards the bottom of the document, looks like a blurred, elongated smudge or smear, which is difficult to identify or describe due to its indistinct nature.
