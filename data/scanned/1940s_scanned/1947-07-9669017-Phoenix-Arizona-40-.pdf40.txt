Incident #40 -- Phoenix, Arizona -- 7 July 1947

No astronomical explanation seems possible for the unusual 
object cited in this incident.

This case is especially important because of the photographic 
evidence and because of the similarity of these photographs to the 
drawings by [Redacted] (incident #17). The two incidents are sepa-
rated by slightly more than two weeks, and, of course, they occurred 
in different localities. It is, however, perhaps more than coincidence 
that these two best-attested, entirely independent cases should agree 
so closely concerning the shape of the object and its maneuverability.

The present investigator would like to suggest that this in-
cident #40, being one of the most crucial in the history of these 
objects, be reopened for investigation. The actual camera used by Mr.
[Redacted] should be examined, and the original negatives preserved. Since, 
from the size of the image on the photograph, we can have an accurate 
estimate of the angle subtended by the object, this in connection with 
what appears to be a fairly reliable estimate of the distance, can give 
us an estimate of the forces and accelerations involved in the tra-
jectory described by Mr. [Redacted] (It is unfortunate that a competent 
investigator was not dispatched at once to "reconstruct the crime" with 
Mr. [Redacted] and to obtain sketches of the trajectory, etc., before de-
tails faded from his memory). It would be important to know what
