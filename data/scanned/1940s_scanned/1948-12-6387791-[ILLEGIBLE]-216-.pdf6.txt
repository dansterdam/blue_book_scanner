UNCLASSIFIED 9 December 1948

I, [REDACTED] Sergeant, USAF, [REDACTED] Weather Observer,
16th Weather Squadron, Chanute Air Force Base, Chanute Field, Illinois
do hereby make the following statement to Captain Rush T. Kelley,
Assistant Base Weather Officer.

On 8 December 1948 at approximately 1816 hours, I was walking
towards the Base Weather Station when I
happened to look up at the sky and notice what appeared to be either
a sky rocket or meteor. It tapped Sgt. [REDACTED] on the arm and called
his attention to it.

The object did not appear to be a star because it was three or
four times as large as a star and it seemed to be closer to us than
a star would be. It was heading from the north east toward the
south south west and was moving upwards at about 15 or 20 degree angle.
As it moved it seemed to get larger, and it was leaving a trail. In
about two or three seconds it disappeared. The object was round, white
and moved very fast.

We went into the Weather Station and reported this to the Duty
Forecaster whose name is M Sgt. Robert W. Fillman.
