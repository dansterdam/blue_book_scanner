SUBJECT: Reported Observation of Unidentified Light or Flare Moving Across
                the Sky on 6 January 1949

1. On 7 January 1949, the writer interviewed Pfc. Meredith J.
Everitt, ASN 38552954, Headquarters, 450th AFB Group, concerning
the unidentified light or flare which he had reportedly seen moving
across the sky.

2.  Pfc. Everitt advised that on 6 January 1949 he was guarding
a C-97 airplane at the landing strip located adjacent to the
Ordnance area, when at approximately 1750 hours he noticed a bright
object travelling across the sky, from the Southeast towards the
Northwest. He related that the object was diamond shaped, approxi-
mately two feet long, and appeared to have a bright star in its center
than at the edges. The estimated that the object was approximately
1500 to 2000 feet in the air and travelled approximately 500 feet,
horizontal to the earth's surface, before he lost sight of it. Pfc.
Everitt was unable to estimate the speed of the object, but stated
that he has seen low flying jet planes, and that this object travelled
much faster than the jets that he has observed. There was no smoke
or other vaporous material visible to Pfc. Everitt around. or follow-
ing the object.

3. At the time Pfc, Everitt witnessed the object, he stated
that the sky was clear, furnishing a light blue background, and that
the object appeared to be a bright white light, with no other appar-
ent visable color.

4.  Standing guard with Pfc. Everitt were Sgt. Richard Woolsey
and Cpl. Wilson, and according to Pfc, Everitt, neither of the other
men saw the object. Everitt explained that he called to Sgt. Wooley-
sedge, who was standing at the other end of the plane, and told him
to look at the object in the sky, but by that time it had disappeared.

5. Pfc. Everitt stated that he attended Flight School, under the
G.I. Bill of Rights in Houston, Texas, during the year 1947, and that
he has had some experience in observing aircraft.
