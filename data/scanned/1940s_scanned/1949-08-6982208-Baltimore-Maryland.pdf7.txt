There are two photographs present on this page, both appear to depict sections of an aircraft fuselage resting in a natural environment against a background that looks like a shed or a barn. The aircraft pieces are surrounded by vegetation. The top photograph shows a larger portion of the fuselage with what seems to be wing attachments or support structures. The bottom photograph is taken from a slightly different angle and shows the fuselage more from the side, revealing a wing-like structure extending from the fuselage.
