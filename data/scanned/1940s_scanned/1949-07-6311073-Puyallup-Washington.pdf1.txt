11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object appeared as a long streak across the sky traveling
parallel to the horizon. The streak appeared in a line of
vision running from East to West for a few seconds, appeared
to explode or accelerate, then narrowed out again, having the
appearance somewhat like a pip levelling out on a radar scope.
