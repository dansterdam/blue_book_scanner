The following information has been received from the Fourth Army Intelligence Liaison Officer, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dated 6 December 1948.

"Colonel ******, Inf., Executive, New Mexico Military District reports as follows:

“On 3 or 4 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I observed a ball of light, reddish white in color, 1 foot in diameter, falling vertically. The ball burst 100-200 feet from the ground in a spray of reddish color which extinguished before reaching the ground. This occurred about 100 yards north of the road on which I was driving. The location was approximately 10 miles east of Vaughn, New Mexico, on Highway 60. (B-2)

“On 23 November 1948, at approximately 2130 hours, I was driving west on Highway 60, about 10 miles west of Vaughn, New Mexico. I observed a ball of light, descending vertically, which burst 100-200 feet from the ground. The conditions and appearance were the same as occurred on 3 - 4 November. (B-2)

"Colonel ****** stated that this did not appear to be meteorological. They might have been connected with some Air Force exercises. He further stated his high opinion of my sincerity in reporting this incident, which is understandable as he was travelling in a closed automobile. Weather conditions were clear." (B-2)

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS. (DOD DIR 5200.10)
