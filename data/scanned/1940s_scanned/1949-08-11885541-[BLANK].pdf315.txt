Incident No. 29 - 14 June 1947, 1200 and 1215, Murocfield, Calif.
The observer, an experienced pilot, reported sighting ten and later seven
objects at 2500 ft altitude, traveling 370 MPH in a loose "V" formation.
Although the objects were apparently at a considerable distance, the reporter
described them as being similar to the XSOU "Flying Flapjack." He stated
that he attached no particular importance to this sighting until the rad of
the Cascade Mountain sightings (Incident No. 17). He then recalled this incident.

AIC Opinion: There is no information contained in this report to contro
the assumption that these objects were ordinary aircraft beyond the range of
identification. The fact that no one else in Murocfield reported observing
anything unusual, tends to substantiate this conclusion.
