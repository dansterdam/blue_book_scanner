CLASSIFIED
On 23 May 1949, this reporting agent and s/A [REDACTED] of the 
Fourth Army CIC interviewed MRS [REDACTED], housewife, 
[REDACTED], New Orleans, La. MRS [REDACTED] was contact-
ed after this agent ascertained from MRS [REDACTED] that MRS 
[REDACTED] had called MRS [REDACTED] husband on Saturday, 21 May 19:9, 
to report that she, too, had seen the flying disk. However, 
MRS [REDACTED] sighted the disk on the day previous to MRS [REDACTED]. 
The following information was obtained from MRS [REDACTED] relative 
to the sighted object:

a. Date of sighting: Wednesday, 18 May 19:9.

b. Time of sighting: 1630 to 16:45 hours.

c. Where sighted: The observer was at her home at [REDACTED]
[REDACTED], New Orleans, La., at the time of sighting.
The object appeared to be on the outskirts of the city in the 
vicinity of Lake Pontchartrain, which is approximately two (2)
miles from MRS [REDACTED] home in a western direction. At the 
time of sighting, MRS [REDACTED] was watering her lawn and working 
in the garden.

d. Number of objects: MRS [REDACTED] sighted only one (1)
object. No other craft of any type were in the sky within her 
line of vision.

e. Distance of object from observer: The object appeared 
to be approximately one and one-half (1Â½) miles to two (2)
miles from the observer at an angle of elevation of approximately 
450 from the horizon. MRS [REDACTED] was unable to judge the 
altitude, but stated that it was relatively high.

f. Time in sight: The object remained within MRS [REDACTED]
view for approximately ten (10) minutes.

g. Appearance of object: The object was silver in color 
and luminous and had the shape of a disk and was likened to a 
dinner plate. The size was indicated as being approximately 
eight to twelve inches (8" to 12") in diameter when viewed at 
the stated distance. The informant compared this to the 
relative size of a small training type aircraft when viewed at 
the stated distance.

h. Direction of flight: The object appeared to be travel-
ling from the east to a north, northwestern direction.

i. Tactics or maneuvers: The object appeared to be ascend-

its direct upward line of flight. No tactics or maneuvers 
other than those were evident. The object was turning in an 
end-over-end fashion.
