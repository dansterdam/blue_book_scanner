The image contains two photographs, both positioned vertically on the page. The top photo features an unfocused, elongated dark object against a light sky, which might be interpreted as something flying or suspended, while the bottom photo also shows an unfocused dark object, but this one is more rounded and centered in the sky background. It's important to understand that visual quality is poor, and the objects are not clearly defined.

Due to the quality of the image provided, it is difficult to accurately transcribe the text as an OCR system would. The text is blurry, not aligned properly, and seems to be reversed as if mirrored, further complicating accurate transcription. Nevertheless, I will attempt to transcribe what's legible or inferable:

```
UNDISTRIBUTED
FILE COPY (S)
...

UNCLASSIFIED

DOO-WH-4
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY
...

PROJECT "GRUDGE"
...

THE OBSERVER NOTED THAT OBJECTS WERE DARK ...
THE LARGER ONE WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF MY THUMB NAIL HELD ...
THE OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED ...
AFF CONFIDENTIAL
...
```

If accuracy is critical, I advise referring directly to a legible version of the document or a source that provides an accurate transcription.
