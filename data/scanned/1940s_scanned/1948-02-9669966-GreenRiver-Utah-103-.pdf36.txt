Excerpt of a letter dated April 11, 1949 from Dr. [Redacted], Director, Institute of Meteoritics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, to the Deputy Executive Director, Committee on Unorthodoxical [sic] Sciences, Research and Development Board:

Thank you for the surprising document sent me under date of March 20. As you remark, certain aspects of [Redacted] letters are fantastic (For example (1) the fireball procession of 1913, February 9, was certainly meteoric, although a rare type of chain fall; (2) no astronomer could take seriously [Redacted] "invasion by beings from Venus or the incon-' throaty" (3) he appears to lend best belief to the Air Force, upon untrustworthy evidence, of weapons of fission, fusion, high explosives attributed to the U. S. OSS [Redacted word to be researched] - nevertheless [Redacted] is justified in calling attention to certain instances of these phenomena (e.g. [Redacted] this field, himself (in the Green River instance, for example, his and [Redacted] evaluations of facts reported by observers on the ground, ground positions (not his balloon (in trouble)

As regards the Kansan, Kansas [Redacted] phenomenon, I remain convinced, also the Pow-Besse incident, it was a genuine meteoric fall, with one or exceptional things (again like the Pow-Besse fall). However, there are many curious aspects of both these falls, some of an objecting [sic] nature, like the familiar fact that in spite of intensive searches (admittedly under bad terrain and weather conditions), not a trace of meteoritic material has so far been [Redacted] nor in spite of intensive searches (ad-static voluble testimony given by Mr. [Redacted] Mrs. [Redacted], and the managers of the two cable lines, both to members of the staff of the University (Correllation of Kansas and to Institute of Meteoritics field survey parties. (See exhibits A, B and C enclosed).

Some comment on their testimony as appears in [Redacted] and C would seem desirable.

1. [Redacted] first reported the battery case as red hot. When I pointed out that the par on it was not charred, his account was changed to "too hot to handle". The Institute of Meteoritics party found only two men, not four, who saw the battery case fall. The battery case has been examined by Dr. [Redacted], Department of Physics, University of New Mexico, who states that it appears to be identical with the small batteries used in portable radios.
