Dr. Harlow Shapley, Director
Harvard Observatory
Cambridge, Massachusetts

Dear Dr. Shapley:

While I was an undergraduates at Harvard I had the pleasure of
cooperating with your observatory in making meteoritic counts on several occasions,
and attending any things of the mind at the observatory. There is a signed guest on
time I am reporting the matter to you, with photographs. It is not something I saw, and which
from a recordingly unknown to me. I did observe something seemed to me to be unusual.
and was too recordingly interesting. I might omit this: That I am a news commentator who
was strange to me.

At 10:15 P.M., at Olney, Maryland, I glanced at the sky and
noticed a fairly vivid streak or ribbon of luminosity, perhaps 5 degrees in width,
which seemed to be passing close approximately as I watched. I focused
my 7 x 50 binoculars on this light, and saw that it was formed as a long cloud of
luminosity, with no sharply defined lights or any sort forming that the center of
portion was notably luminous or intensified to any, the light ran out in misty
or thinned to alorst ifst degrees of the southern horizon. This mist was faint,
gradually ended across the invisible band, the entire of a streak seemed to form a
one to parallel lines of light, marking the edges of the ribbon, that became
increasingly bright.

The whole was in motion, for in about five minutes the streak
the path, and the bright portion bunched up, with a distinct swirl of light rising
from it, while the darker the edge, and part of the ribbon broke into two arms,
one upward to the zenith, the other downward to the south. Finally, about two minutes
later, the bright-endinium, moving fairly rapidly eastward, but still about a constant
altitude, had collapsed to form a broad, bluntly pointed head (somewhat like a large
comet), with two rather tails curving outward for perhaps three minutes more, the
whole had faded, but did not entirely die out for perhaps nine minutes more.

I am sufficiently familiar with astronomical occurrences to be
sure this was not a meteoritic phenomenon nor a similar thing of abnormal
it certainly was not a comet. It may well be a highly unusual occurrence, and
and seeing. I would appreciate your kindness in having one of the staff of the
observatory suggest to me what it may have been.

Yours sincerely

F.W.
P.S. On the other side I have sketched in separation of the above light.
