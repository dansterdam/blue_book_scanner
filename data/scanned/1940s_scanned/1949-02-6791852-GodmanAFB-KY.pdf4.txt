NARRATIVE SUMMARY (Cont'd)

- Rogers Statement - (Cont'd)

A few minutes after I arrived in the tower, Pfc Peterman also came up. The
four of us saw this object which was just above the horizon to the southwest.
The object seemed to be rotating red, green and yellow color. At approximately
0200C, I went out to the theodolite and managed to locate the object in it
and took readings on it. The object did not seem to move from its original spot
where it was first sighted. While we were watching it, it suddenly disappeared.
The object vanished at 0210C. Sgt Ledbetter notified Lt Clay who was the Officer
of the Day and entered the event in the log.
