SYNOPSIS

This investigation was requested by the Chief,

This investigation concerns the alleged observa-
tion of "flying saucers" in the vicinity of
Castleton, New York, on 6 April 1949. Investi-
gation reveals one witness who stated that he
saw certain objects, which he assumed to be fly-
ing saucers on 6 April 1949, in the vicinity of
Castleton, New York. Attempts to contact other
witnesses of the alleged incident in the vicinity
and the surrounding vicinity of Castleton, New
York, proved to be futile.
