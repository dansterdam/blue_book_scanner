NARRATIVE SUMMARY;

Number of objects and sketch or description or grouping

a.  First group - eleven in this group. This group went directly over-
   head - heading due West. A noise which sounded like a group of ducks
   coming in to land on water or an air hose, drew the attention of the 
   Informant to the group passing over. However, this noise which they
   heard did not come from this group.

b.  Second group - nine in this group. Passed overhead about 2 to 3 
   minutes after the first group. This group approached from the East
   and was heard several times when they were directly overhead. This called
   off to the left side of the formation at a light angle and proceeded on
   Southwest. The other eight objects in the formation continued on
   due West. This group was in sight from five to ten seconds.

c.  After they had gotten into the boat and proceeded out into the lake,
   3 or more groups passed directly overhead. There were two or
   objects in each group, and they approached from the west headed the
   East.

d.  The last group passed slightly to the east of them, and were heading
   due South. They approached from the North. There were five objects
   in the group, and they were in line (one behind the other).
