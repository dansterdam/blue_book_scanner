SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

Following is an interim summary predicated on request of the Fourth Army 
Liaison Officer at Sandia Base for this headquarters to investigate and report on
"Fireball" phenomenon reported to the Commanding General, Sandia Base, by AFSWP 
installations at Camp Hood, Texas. Reports dated that several sightings of unusual
"light" phenomena in the atmosphere above Site Baker (Area) had been made by 
security personnel there during the period 6 - 13 March 1949.

At Camp Hood, it was determined that this type of phenomena, hitherto unreported
from this Hood Area, has a straight statistical correlation to the test shots of the 9mm
observed during the past several months at Sandia Base. Lists of the observers were
different locations and some were not certain as to time, it is possible that the 
observation reported within the same hour on the same date are duplications. It
should be noted that none of the observers had been instructed to look for or 
report any sort of atmospheric phenomena. All stated without equivocations that
they had never before seen anything resembling the reported phenomena. All claimed
to have seen "Falling Stars" nearly every night on the Camp Hood Reservation, but
all were emphatic in stating that this phenomena was quite different, all men were
interrogated separately and had no advance notice that they would be questioned.
After the interrogation they were taken to the spot where the observations had been
made. These points were numbered and then plotted on map, Camp Hood and vicinity,
1/50, 500 top. Overlay to be seen and a copy is hereto attached. The 
observer was then told to aim his surveying instrument, brought along for the purpose,
at the celestial points of origin and termination of the phenomena. Vertical 
angles and magnetic azimuth of each point was then recorded. In most cases, the
observer was able to fix azimuths by some terrain features. Vertical angles were
of approximated except where elevations of observations coincided with ridge
or tree lines.

Observations on 6 March 1949:

1. From observation point #5 (see attached overlay)

    a. Location of point: 909.7 - 857.5; Time: 2100 hours.

    b. Weather: Overcast (see attached weather report).
