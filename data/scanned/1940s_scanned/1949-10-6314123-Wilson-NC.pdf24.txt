Here's the text from the document:

```
At Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.                         12 October 1949.

I was standing out on the Ramp at Aircraft 103. The thing
I saw seemed to be traveling pretty fast. I thought at first it
was a balloon. Then I saw it was traveling too fast for that.
It was a round looking thing and was white or made out of aluminum.

To the best of my knowledge it looked to be anywhere from
8,000 to 10,000 feet altitude, and about 75 to 80 degree above the
horizon. It was headed North-East. It was flying straight all the
time I saw it; and I watched it until it went out of sight. I
haven't seen a jet go as fast as it was at that altitude. It was
about 8 to 10 miles at it closest place to me. It did not have
any wings or tail.
