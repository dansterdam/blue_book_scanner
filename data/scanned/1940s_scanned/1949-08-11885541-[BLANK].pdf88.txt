Incident #103 – near Hanover, W.Germany – 24 October 1948

It is very unlikely that this incident has any astro-
nomical explanation. No trail nor luminescence was observed, and
the object flew a straight and level course. Time in sight (two
minutes) also effectively rules out any possible astronomical hypo-
thesis.

Could the object reported here have been a conventional

aircraft viewed in foreshortened aspect?
