Dear Sirs!

A few weeks ago I wrote you about an aerial phenomenon
that I observed at Unity Village. You sent me a questionnaire
for further data, which I filled out and returned to you.
As I could not then recall the exact date, I wrote to the
Harvard Observatory, and requested that they send back to me the
original letter I wrote to them about it. They have done so, and
I enclose it herewith.

I regret that I cannot locate the carbons of my previous
correspondence with you, and hence have had to guess at the proper
address for this latter. I trust it reaches you in due course.

If there is any further information that I can give you,
please let me know. I believe, however, that I have told you
everything I know about it.

Yours sincerely
