GOD 333.5 (1 Mar 49)
SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Object

3. The object observed, is believed by the Base Intelligence Officer
to be the star Sirius. This star will appear in the southern horizon during
the time indicated and is usually bright due to its extreme heat and close-
ness to the earth. Sirius is relatively small and will appear to change color
as most stars do when at an altitude of less than ten (10) degrees above the
horizon. Observing a star through binoculars will increase the color effect.
The fact that the object disappeared instantly can be accounted for when at
such a low elevation.

4. Only one theodolite reading was taken as shown in Exhibit "E".
