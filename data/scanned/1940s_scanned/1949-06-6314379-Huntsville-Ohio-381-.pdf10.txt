The image contains a handwritten document. There is a diagram drawn in the lower half of the page of what appears to be the flight path of an object. The path seems to include straight lines with changes in direction indicated by arrows.

Here is the text from the document:

Lima, Ohio                                        July 18, 1949

Dear Sir:-

(12) I was about a mile south of Huntsville
Ohio. This object was the distance of two
city blocks ahead of me, about two hundred
feet from the earth.

(13) Direction of flight, (Diagram)
          about 12 o'clock    sun time
          1 o'clock

(15) Object traveled so fast I had no way of
checking time. not sure two minutes for
the whole flight as diagrammed. I thought at
first it would hit my car. I stopped my truck
and jumped out just as object started it
horiz(ontal flight. It was only a few seconds
in horizontal and upward flight out of my
sight.

Please note that some of the diagram notations are unclear due to the nature of the drawing, and there's a redaction near the top of the page.
