The photograph shows a landscape with low horizon detail due to the document's quality. There is a distinct X mark in the center, presumably placed to indicate a location of interest related to the report. There are large areas with poor contrast which makes it hard to discern specific features, and two horizontal lines appear at the top, seemingly unrelated to the landscape.
