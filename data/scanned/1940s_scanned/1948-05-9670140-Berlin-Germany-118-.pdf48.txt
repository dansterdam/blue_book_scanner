There are no photographs present in the image you've provided.

The text in the document is largely faded and hard to read due to the quality of the scanned image. Here is my best attempt at transcribing the visible portions of the document:

It's important to note that the text is not entirely clear, and there are omitted or illegible sections due to the condition of the document.
