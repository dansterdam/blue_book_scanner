direction. A few minutes later, same saw a second object travelling on a parallel 
course to the first object, at an altitude of approximately nine (9) to ten (10) 
thousand feet AGL and going in a southeasterly direction. Lt. ____ called the atten-
tion of W/O [Warrant Officer] _______ the first object and in so doing, it is

airplane attracted his attention. When _____ located the airplane, he said it was an 
F-51, travelling in a southeasterly direction, approximately eight (8) miles away and 
about ten (10) thousand feet AGL, flying. The object _____ saw was a little below the 
airplane and behind it, travelling possibly forty (40) MPH faster because

be three hundred (300) MPH. _____ then turned to his companion, _____ 
(PICTURES and ____ were standing a short distance away.), and called his atten-
tion to the object. _____ did not see either the first object or the airplane, but did 
see a second object, similar in shape, travelling in a southeasterly direction, 
further east than the airplane turned north and he then kept watching the second object 
which he said was travelling a parallel course to the first object, but south of it, and 
lower at a speed of about three hundred (300) MPH. By this time, the first object was 
out of sight. _____ described the first object to be circular and of the first, a dull 
silver color and reflecting the sunlight. ____ described the second object to be 
circular, dark blue on one side and silver on the other, reflecting the sunlight.

Base, Hill Field, Utah, was interviewed and stated that while he was working in the

airplane quite high and looked upward to see it while doing so, his attention was 
attracted to a circular object emitting cast of south at approximately fourteen 
thousand (14,000) feet AGL, travelling about the same speed a circular fore-
ward travelled. _____ watched the object for about fifteen (15) seconds, then lost sight 
of it momentarily. The second view of it lasted for possibly ten (10) seconds, 
further stated that this was not the first object which _____ saw. The time was estab-
lished as 1107 MST for the second object, which was globular in shape, dark blue and 
flashing sunlight. (See signed statement of _____ attached as Inclosure #3).
