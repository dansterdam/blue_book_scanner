Incident #32 -- over Columbus, Ohio -- 7 January 1948

The evidence given in this Incident fits the hypothesis 
that the object observed was the planet Venus, and, considered 
with Incidents #30, 33, and 49, it is incredible that it could 
have been anything else.

See report on #33 for detailed discussion of sightings 
of 7 January 1948.
