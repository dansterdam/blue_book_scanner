NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

[Redacted], [redacted address], both employed as [redacted] at [redacted], Lane, Oregon, was interviewed at their place of em-
ployment and stated in substance as follows: The objects were first sighted at
1105 hours on 22 Mar through the barber shop window. At the time of sighting,
[redacted] remarked to [name] "Let's step outside and see how many people we can get
to look up". The weather was clear with good visibility. The objects were two in
number, of no specific shape, but were much smaller than planes. The first object
(one nearest observer, in clear color(?)) appeared to be a dull silver object (oval), 
had a size not of a slightly dull object all on the other. The second object, nearer
stormed by an object, it appeared to be of a dull silver color on both sides. Neither
number of arms or span(?), and they seemed to a light in a [obscured] direction
to change in any speed it remained longer to its size. The objects were considerably
nearer than a dime held at arm's length, and both men believed them to be
the size of a large commercial cigarette carton in the sky. Object #1 appeared to be
coming, or turning over constantly, but Object #2 seemed to float lazily and
no vapor, there was no clear not exhaust trail associated with either object, as can
be expressed to be about 10,000 feet above the terrain. Both objects were sighted at
approximately the same time at a position 30° above the horizon at what would be a
position of one o'clock clockwise from North from the observers' position. The
objects drifted to a 90° position above the horizon, or a straight overhead position,
and continued past the vertical, receding toward the southern horizon.
[Redacted] lost interest at this point, and did not see the objects disappear. The
duration of the sighting from the objects to vanish out of sight was 10-15
and am estimated that the objects were moving at [obscured] Rate. [redacted]
Comment: [redacted] asked what the weather man had to say if the objects did 
[redacted]. He said he believed that, while not believing in the old, many are of the so-called
fantasy "objects", but believes this to be substantial, nothing more or less than the 
garbage and/or flack by two twixt. Both stated that it is not uncommon at this season 
to see the disposal thereof. To determine this answer to a leading question and 
is (?) that there(?) to wait, he has(?) in the occurance of this(?) of the
the(?) sessions was(?) to answer the(?) with more than the(?) post(?) longitude.
