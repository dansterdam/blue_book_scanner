On the 15th day of April, 1948, at approximately
1615 hours, I, with Lt. -----, was standing in front
of our squadron orderly room. As we were talking, I
heard the sound of fighter aircraft flying and I looked
in the sky in this direction of the sound. Whereupon, I
noticed one (1) white balloon object on a Northwest
heading. I then noticed that there were two (2) objects,

These objects were at an estimated 15,000 to
20,000 feet and seemed to be stationary; then these
two (2) objects seemed to accelerate very rapidly in a 
northerly direction and at the same time, seemed to be
climbing until they were lost to sight. It is estimated
that these objects were visible for not more than three 
(3) minutes.

------ and myself discussed the possibility
that the objects were weather balloons. I, personally,
checked the weather office to determine if weather
balloons had been released and it was informed that no
balloons had been sent aloft.

                                   1st Lt., USAF
