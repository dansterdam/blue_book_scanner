Incident No. 37 -- 14 October 1947, 1200 hours, eleven miles North,
N. E. of Cave Creek, Arizona.

Two mine operators observed one object at 5000 to 10,000 ft altitude, travel-
ing 150Â° TPI S.E. in a straight line for a period of 15-60 seconds. The object
was red against the sky, and black against a cloud. It appeared between
7 to 3 inches in diameter through pit of observers; on. This CRT tar of investi three states
that one observer thought it was a buzzard, but decided later that it was not;
the other observer said it resembled a flying wing, but was not a flying wing.
No reasons are given for these apparently superfluous and conflicting remarks.
As in many other instances, these observers cite their flying experience as
qualification for their ability to observe and report details.

AIG Opinion: From the limited data furnished in this report, it is
difficult to arrive at any conclusion. If the object was actually 10,000 ft
distant, and 7" to 3" appeared three feet in diam to the obs nary, it would of necessity
been huge. This sole point of contention tends to discredit the report.
