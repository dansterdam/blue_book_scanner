It could not have been an aluminum barn roof or a lake, and, in
my opinion, it was the approximate size, or perhaps a little
smaller, than the Graf Zeppelin, sha ped in the same general
shape as the Graf Zeppelin, which I saw some years back from
approximately the same distance in South Bend, Indiana when it
passed over or just south of Niles, Michigan on its (I believe)
around the world flight.

Referring back to point "B" on the chert, this is only approximate
due to the fact that I saw it cross McCordsville, Castleton, Nora,
continuing that line and estimating the degree heading that it
disappeared into the sunlight of the near-setting sun; and where
the two lines intersected I marked the point "B" as shown on the
chart. There was sunlight glinting on the entire length of it,
and it showed roundness and a seemingly bright finish, such as
polished aluminum.

There is no further information that I have on it. I would ap-
preciate no publicity or mention of my name in connection with
this. At the time in the plane, I made notes on the back of
an envelope, exact time and all the figures: which I have either
mislaid or has gotten thrown away. All that above is accurate
as I remember it. I have the original chart, which I remarked
at the time of the incident.

If I may be of further service to you in this matter, please
advise.

                                  Yours very truly,

                                  [Redacted]
