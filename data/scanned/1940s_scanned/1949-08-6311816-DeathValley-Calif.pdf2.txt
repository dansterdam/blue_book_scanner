Dear Sir:

The following information concerning a reported "flying disc" is being forwarded to you for your information.

On August 8, 1949, Mr. ----------, who identified himself as an announcer for radio station ---------- Long Beach, California, advised that he had received a telephone call from ----------, who stated that he and another individual, identified only as ----------, were prospecting in Death Valley approximately two or three weeks ago when they noted a large circular object crash to the ground a short distance from them. Immediately following the crash two "small men," heavily clothed, ran from the crash and disappeared over a ridge. The large circular object was inspected by ---------- and ---------- and according to them was approximately twenty-four feet in diameter and seven feet thick.

---------- stated that ---------- had a scientific background, and after examining a portion of the object, declared it to be principally calcium, iridescent and radio active. The material reportedly had small green wires running throughout. ---------- stated to ---------- that he had a small portion of the material in his possession.

---------- was unable to furnish ----------'s address but stated that if ---------- recontacts him he will endeavor to obtain same.

No action is being taken by this office and the above is for any disposition deemed appropriate by you.

Very truly yours,

[Signature]

R. B. HOOD,
Special Agent in Charge
