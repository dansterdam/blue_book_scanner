Incident #158 -- Provoport, Ohio -- 1 August 19[blacked out]
with two cessn[sic?]tations missing, (speed with which the
trail was:created and length of time involved in the formation.)
It is difficult to come to a definitive conclusion concern-the
origin of the object observed, but it is equally possible that
it was parts of some photo trail of a fireball. Fireball trails
have been known to act in the manner described. The witness states
that this spray was not like an anti-aircraft shell burst or a
vapor trail from a plane. He implies that the motion of the object
form[blacked out] the trail was very rapid, and that the distance was con-siderable, at least, nothing is said which is contrary to the
meteoric hypothesis.
