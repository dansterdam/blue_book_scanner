The image you have provided does not contain a photograph; it is a page of text. Here is the text output from the document:

Object appeared round and probably spherical. At first looked 
similar to weather balloon at about 2000 ft but there was no 
characteristic bobbing. The wind was blowing the ground with 
fair strength and gusty yet the object was quite steady. In the 
time it was under observation (about an hour) it traveled thru a 
vertical arc of about 25Â° or more. After watching the object for 
a while the observer concluded that whatever it was the thing was 
at great height but not a star, It had a bluish luminescence like 
a fluorescent lamp and as the sun set the color gradually changed to an 
orange color at dusk and finally snapped off like a lamp when the 
switch is thrown. The outline was clear and sharp and symmetrical (no 
fuzziness or blurring), the air clear with visibility unlimited. 
Direction of travel from East directly toward the sun.
