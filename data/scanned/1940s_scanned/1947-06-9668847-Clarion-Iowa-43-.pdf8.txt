With 204 incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirteen which contain some evidence but have no apparent sound explanation.
The evidence is not only on the basis of the assertion that the objects observed are reliable and accurate, these typically occur and physical traces or more often at an angle where optical or acoustic effects of the atmosphere, etc, are non-effective. It is in this instance that pilots of TWA witnessed a large unconventional aircraft (see App A)*

- that a sufficient psychological explanation for the unidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanation for events not otherwise explainable. These errors in identifying will include results chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in this report, these incidents from no pattern in regard to area or static types of objects, or manner of performance. There are indicators, however, that a growing have been influenced by earlier reports, probably no two have been described unusual, or reported as been no publicity.

VIII. Summary of A.F.C Evaluation of Remaining Reported

The term ‘unexplained incidents’ (see Appendix II) refers to not common characteristics. No one time, or statements of the group which had not been made, has the witnesses not read of what occurred (Translator to l7). Tests were complicated without pattern throughout the United States, a few were outside the U.S. No two descriptions or appearance or performance were exactly alike. The reports of sightings occurred at various times of day and year.

APPENDIX X

In the following section of this report, each remaining unexplained incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to generalize as to the behavior of observers, but each case has undesirable elements, and hence is considered. Individual consideration is rarely the category of the incident in the project’s files.
