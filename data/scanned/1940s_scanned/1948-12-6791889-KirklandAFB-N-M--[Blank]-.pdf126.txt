these quantities were 390 40' and -90. According to Figero, true azimuth of 
the sound heard at 2000 was 990 40' and the elevation 490 30'; according to *******
these quantities were 1010 46' and 4140 30'.

3. At Station 390 a statement was obtained from Army Inspector *********
Myers (his companion on the night of December 30, Inspector *********, also 
heard the ominous sounds, but Inspector********* was not available for inter-
rogation on January 5). According to Inspector ********* none of the sounds ob-
served at Station 340 as 2010, 2020, and 2100 were heard at Station 350, but 
some 10 to 15 minutes after the bogey warning at 2050, both he and ********
heard what first sounded like the rumbling of heavy trucks on a roadway and 
what later sounded like a whistling noise made by great airplanes were in 
flight. A duration of the sounds as determined by a stopwatch measurement 
of larynx agitations in, or as it adjusted from, thirty to one-hundred, with 
oneL-egret not quite feeling, was 45 seconds. ************ reported that he 
tled band to the sound probably for a minute or more after he went outdoors 
the second time. According to Myers, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2100- 
2105 was 420 00' and the elevation 450 15'.

4. At Station 350 statements were obtained from Inspectors ********* and
*********, both of whom were guarding *********. According to Inspector *******, approximately 2010 he saw a series of lights in the sky which he at first
took to be the motion of a nearby B-29, but a minute later these lights were 
observed to be motionless and at 14,000 ft. Ourd. The duration of his first observation 
of the noise heard at 2100 at this station was about 20 to 26 seconds 
long; an F-80 was in the area, but during that time being only above 2-3 
minutes. (So definite was the impression that the observed noised originated 
in an airplane flying over the studio field exit to complete the blockade was 
executed both during the first observation and the second in the hope that 
the lights on the silo would be observable. However, no visual contact 
whatever was established with the source of the noise.) At approximately 
2050 a third observation of the same noise was made and decreasing was by 
comparison that an airplane was going into the air once his coming to the 
warning was transmitted to all stations. It is by understanding, or both 
reported, and accept this information related to them to headquarters who was 
responsible for issuance of the bogey warning. The duration of the third 
sound was estimated to have been approximately 2-3 minutes. Inspector ********
confirmed all of the statements made by Inspector ********* with this qual-
ification: That his first interpretation of the noise reported at 2010 was that
it came from a high tank cruising on the hi-road into Station 350
the same place. The noise grew stronger in a crescendo fashion at 350 
(225 s.f.), more of a bank and the light (7E-1.PM-14-1.PM), more of 
Club type planes had been the subject of discussions between Inspectors ********
and ******* until they had projected the issuing by note, but even the isa 
motor club would be laboring heavily in the high altitude where the 
noises of December 20 & 21 were believed to have been made. According to 
Inspector ******** the azimuth of the sound heard at 2010 was 300 20' 
Equator variations at this latitude is quite possible. The motion at 350 was 
between 390 00' and the elevation 550 30'. Inspector ********* who had 
no telescope in use as of a transit, it is believed that ***** and *******
accurate azimuth determinations. Since it would be more possible to 
have set up the transit in the local position required by Transport Carib- 
****** had heard the sounds on December 30, no azimuth-elevation readings 
were therefore registered.
