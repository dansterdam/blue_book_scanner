No. 215. Very high winds 60-70 M.P.H. from SW at all levels,
definitely would have prohibited any balloon from making any southerly
motion. Also, last scheduled released time was three hours prior to
sighting at 1,000 feet. No time in sight given so cannot compute rate
of climb to 20,000 feet. Fairly conclusive, not a balloon of any kind.
