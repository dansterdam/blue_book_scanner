"On the 30th of January 1949 at approximately 1300 hours, while in the company of [redacted], of Boeing Aircraft, I observed an object that appeared to be travelling diagonally across in front of me, at an angle of 35° to 40° above my line of sight. Its distance seemed very close and appeared to be travelling very slowly. This object was in my sight for approximately three or four seconds. The actions of said objects during this time were as follows:

Gentle downward glide; bright burning (Green and yellowish lights) a dazzling cut and then a bright, spinning, and then appeared to die out. (This could have been the effects of its passing beyond my vision).

My direction of travel was nearly due East, thus the object’s direction was East-Southeast or Southeast. The weather at that time was clear and cold, no ground wind and no indications of upper winds. Location was West of Tularosa, New Mexico, beyond the railheads of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
