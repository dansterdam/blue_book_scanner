Incident #156 -- near Grays Harbor, Washington -- 30 October 1948

From the major information given by Lieutenant xxxxman, presumably a responsible and well-trained observer, positive identification of the object is impossible, but it appears likely that it was a bursting fireball.

Two bits of evidence that tend toward this interpretation are the following: one object bursting into ten or twenty pieces, color white and yellow, and the short time in sight. Number of appearances, simply fading; from view "like flares from an airplane," is also similar to that of a disintegrating fireball. In bright daylight the otherwise bright, flare-like quality is sometimes not observed.

Against this interpretation are the following: no lights or outstanding reflection, and no trail. The former might be the result of bright daylight; obviously the objects were observed, and if they were yellow and white, they must have had some luminosity. Lack of trail is, however, unusual.

Unfortunately, without more detailed information, little more can be said.
