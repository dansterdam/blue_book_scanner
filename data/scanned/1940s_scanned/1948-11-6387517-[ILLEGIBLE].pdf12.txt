Incident: 225

Colonel ████ first observed an unusual aerial phenomena during the
latter part of 1947. This occurred in the vicinity of Vaughn, N. M.
The phenomena appeared approximately 400-500 ft above the ground
when first observed and was descending slowly and steadily in a vertical
manner toward the earth. It appeared slightly larger than a basketball,
bright white in color like a miniature sun. At a point approximately
200 feet above the surface of the earth, the object appeared to explode
although no noise was apparent. By this time the Colonel had stopped
his automobile and had gotten out to watch the object. The explosion
or disintegration appeared to be taking place some 100 to 60 yards
distant and still no noise was noticed. At this time the fragments
distributed a fiery red color and descended toward the earth like numerous
sparks being extinguished before touching the ground. At the time
Col Hayes was on Highway 60, near a railroad and separated from the
vicinity where the fragments were landing by a fence. He did not cross
the fence or investigate further.

On 3 or 4 Nov 181 at approximately 2130 hours he observed a ball of  
light, reddish white in color, 1 foot in diameter, falling vertically.
The ball burst 100-200 feet from the ground in a spray of red color
which extinguished before reaching the ground - this occurred about 400
yards north of the road on which he was driving - 10 miles east of
Vaughn, N. M. - Highway 60.

On 23 Nov 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, Col ████ who was driving west
on Highway 60 - approximately 10 miles west of Vaughn, N. M. He again
observed a ball of light descending vertically. It burst 100-200 feet
from the ground - Conditions and appearance were the same as on 3 and
14th Nov.

Col ████
On the last 2 sightings/saw no aircraft and heard no sound which is
understandable since he was traveling in a closed automobile. Weather
conditions were clear.

EVALUATION B-2.
