INTRODUCTION

This report is written to present the status of work being
accomplished on Project "Sign", to summarize the data collected
on sightings of unidentified aerial objects, to review the methods
and reasoning applied in the evaluation of the data, and to pre-
sent the results so far obtained from the study of data available.

It is not expected that this report can present a final es-
timate of the situation regarding all the incidents reported.
The data is still being studied by specialists in the fields of
astrophysics and psychology, and further information is being col
lected to enable personnel evaluating project "Sign" incidents
to determine possible explanations of some of the sightings. How-
ever, the report will furnish information on the present state of
the investigation and to staff personnel in this headquarters and in
higher echelons, and to others who are required to assess the
possibility of a threat to national security presented by the 
sighting of such large numbers of unidentified flying objects.
