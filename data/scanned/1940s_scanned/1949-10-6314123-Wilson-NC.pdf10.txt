Basic ltr fr SD-OSI (ref: SD 2q.2^r?) to CG AMC, dtd 19 Dec 50, subj:
PROJECT GRUDGE Sighting of Unidenti^pied Objects on 23 Oct 49 at Cin-
cinnati, Ohio, by Mr. ******* "Special Inquiry"

6. It would be interesting to determine whether Mr. ******** has
taken other pictures of this nature and what the results of such photo-
graphy has been. The negative of the picture in question would also be
of interest.

7. However, in view of the time and efforts already expended on
the observations of Mr. ******** with no apparent results, it is rec-
ommended that this particular case be considered closed at this time.
This recommendation is also based upon the possibility that contacting
him may result in additional press articles on a subject which will
again require this command to expend additional man-hours. In the
event this man again contacts the Air Force for a detailed answer to
his letter, AWC will prepare a reply.
