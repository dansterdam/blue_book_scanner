The image shows no photographs; it is a map with topographic and geographic details.

The labels such as "44A" and "DUNDAS RADIO" seem to be references to locations, coordinates, radio stations, or identifiers used within the context of the map. The numeric values represented with the letters "N" or "PM" might be times, dates, or other forms of numerical designations, possibly relating to the map's function or the subject matter being mapped (which could be related to an investigation such as Project Blue Book). Unfortunately, the context required to provide a precise description is lacking.
