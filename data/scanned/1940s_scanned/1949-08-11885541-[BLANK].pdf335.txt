The image does not contain a photograph. It is a scan of a textual document, which appears to be a page from a report. Here is the transcribed text from the document:

Incident #4 – Rogers Dry Lake, California – 8 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.

Is there any definite reason why the object observed

could not have been a bursted weather balloon?
