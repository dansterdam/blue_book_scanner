[Redacted Name], age 14, a ninth grade student at North Junior High,
Newburgh, N. Y., reported that on the night of 29 November 1948 
at precisely 9:00 while standing with two young friends on the
corner of Concord & 1st Street, that she observed a ball of fire
with a long tail in the north of the sky. Course of the object
was from east to west. It was visible for two seconds and then
went below the horizon. She stated that while she had seen many
shooting stars that she had never seen anything like this. She
also described the astral phenomenon as being a "large red ball speeding
through the heavens." She was convinced that she had seen a blue-tailed
comet.
