EXTRACTS
FROM
Letter Directed to Dr. E. E. Landsberg
from

Dr Lincoln LaPaz, Director 
Institute of Meteoritics
University of New Mexico
- January 12, 1949

In my opinion, ******* observation (which, as the first
paragraph of his letter indicates, reached me only through his
chance reading of my article in Science Illustrated) is of the
utmost significance. What he observed was certainly not a
"bouncing meteorite," as much more reasonable interpretation
of his one mention is that he saw a luminous object following a
wave-like path (somewhat analogous to the real path of the Los
Alamos fireball of 1944, December 20 GN 54-5[?]), the point from
which move-observed being situated very nearly in the plane of
the trajectory of the luminous object and the direction of motion
of this object being almost directly away from ****** so that the
observed singular altitude of the first crest on the w-lke path
was quite large (at least 13°) while the observed angular altitude
for the second, more distant, crest was only about 1°.

In view of the fact that ******* important observation came to
attention only by accident, it seems to me that it merits steps
should be taken to interrogate all former and present AAF pilots
(especially all pilots now flying in Germany or elsewhere in
Europe) in order to determine whether similar observations
similar to that made by ******* have been made. Would it not be
possible to require all pilots and co-pilots to report in detail.
on any fire-balls they may observe which they have any reason to
believe are definitely or possibly non-meteoritic?
