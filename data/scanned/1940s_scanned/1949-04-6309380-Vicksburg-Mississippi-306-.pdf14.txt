00.32 1st Ind ERRENT/JAF/re

3160 Electronics Station, GFS, 230 Albany Street, Cambridge 39, Massachusetts, 18 May 1949.

TO: Commanding General, Air Material Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, 9 Dayton, Ohio, ATTN: AMC IIXO

1. Additional information requested in basic letter is as follows:

a. Reference 3a. The balloons used by the 3205 Directorate for Geophysical Research do not carry lights or luminescent materials, nor is it anticipated that such equipment will be carried on future flights.

b. Reference 3b. An up-to-date list of balloon flights will be prepared and sent in near future. Project plans call for launching of 20 ft. diameter plastic balloons at the following bases during the coming summer:

Clouds, New Mexico
Enid, Oklahoma
Phoenix, Arizona
Las Vegas, Nevada

The total number of launchings from all of these sites will not average more than three per week. It is also planned to launch eight 20 ft. diameter balloons from Omaha, Nebraska, between July 15 and August 15, 1949. The dates of other flights are indefinite at this time.

c. Reference 3c. Photographs and detailed descriptions of equipment would serve no useful purpose, because of the number of different projects being conducted. The most conspicuous gear included on the balloon flight unit is a brightly colored flag of approximately 6' x 4', and one or two standard meteorological parachutes. At times, antenna wires as long as 150 ft. are flown. The scientific equipment is generally rather compact and is less than 1 cu. ft. in volume. As a general rule, a reward notice is attached to each balloon identifying the agency launching it.

d. Reference 3d. The 20 ft. plastic balloons fly at constant level between 40,000 to 60,000 ft. depending upon the load and other conditions. A few 70 ft. plastic balloons have been flown which reached altitudes of 80,000 to 100,000 feet. Occasionally, rubber meteorological balloons are flown using clusters of not more than three balloons.
