NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
AT CORNISH, UTAH

On 5 April 1949, [REDACTED] farmer of Cornish, Utah was interviewed and stated that he was just returning from his barn to his home when he observed a bright silvery object coming almost straight down out of the skies to the south of his home. The object, according to [REDACTED], left a trail of smoke or vapor both above and below a very thin layer of clouds which were present at the time. He described the optical phenomena as being either a very bright reflection or light such as is made by a powerful arc light. [REDACTED] said that he had had a phobia about falling stars since childhood and for that reason was quite excited by what he had witnessed. [REDACTED], [REDACTED] brother, substantiated the fact that [REDACTED] had run over to his, [REDACTED] house and told him what he had seen, pointing out the smoke or vapor left by the object. [REDACTED] reported the incident to the Sheriff's Office at Logan, Utah. The smoke and vapor, according to the two [REDACTED] brothers, was visible for about fifteen minutes. Neither of the brothers heard any sound of an explosion.
