NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

[redacted] stated that at approximately 1110 hours 17 June 19[redacted], while
standing in her backyard, she saw a large (about the size of a Douglas DC-4 aircraft)
round object in the air approximately four miles southeast of her home in the direc-
tion of San Diego, Calif. Mrs. Selby judged it was about four thousand feet in the
air, and moving rapidly away from her. Mrs. Selby stated: "It was definitely not a
jet aircraft although it's speed was more in keeping with a jet than the more con-
ventional aircraft." The description was, according to Mrs. [redacted] "a chromium plated
pie tin." "It was much brighter than the ordinary aircraft." Mrs. Selby further stated
there was definitely no protrusions (such as wings or verticle stabilizers) as the
object turned in a wide arc away from her. When queried regarding smoke or vapor
trails Mrs. Selby stated she did not notice any. The object was visible for approximately
30 seconds.
