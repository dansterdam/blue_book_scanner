The ball of fire seemed to be traveling in a southerly direction, ████████████ believed the object to be an elevation of about 15° but declined to make an estimate of his distance from the object. ████████████ advised that the tail was visible for approximately 10 seconds ████████████ stated that there was no apparent exhaust to the object, nor were there any clouds in the sky. ████████████ stated that the object seemed to die out of its own accord and did not explode.
