10 Comments of interrogator re intelligence and character
    of person interrogated:

Believe Mr. [redacted] to be of average intelligence and
character, but on the other hand believe him to be a type
of person who could very easily be mistaken in an obser-
vation such as this. As it was not possible to determine
the date of sighting, it is not known whether any aircraft
of the type supposedly observed were airborne in the vicin-
ity of Boston, Massachusetts.
