5. Construction, size, shape, etc.
[REDACTED] and I viewed
the object through a six-inch telescope on the mountain top about
ten minutes after it was first sighted belov at the -observatory.
At the observatory it was viewed through a portable three-inch
telescope. Dr. [REDACTED] sometime
were observing at the six-inch. [REDACTED], and
I were the only ones who examined the object through the six-inch.

The nature of the object was inmediately apparent through the
six-inch, which enabled us to see it as if only a few yards away.
it consistad of a thin translucent outer envelope enclosing a
sphere at the top, the whole having the shape of a pear. Beneath
this pear-shaped assembly a square yellow disk was attached by
cords, I am sure of these facts.

I believe also that the thin outer envelope had a diamond
shaped pattern as if criss-crossed by a network of cords. Also
that the cords attached to the yellow disk extended beyond it.

As the object was unfamiliar to us and there was nothing nearby
with which to compare it, we could not make an accurate estimate
of its size. After thinking it over, however, I think we can
get a good idea of its size as follows: I would estimate that
the object spanned about 1/5 the diameter of the full moon or
subtended an angle of 8Â°. Today (September 22) I called Mr.
[REDACTED] and asked him how he thought the object was,
[REDACTED] from me is made an estimate of 1/3 the full
moon, which is in good agreement.
