On 25, 26 July 1949, Mr. *******, Palo Alto, California, stated that the object sighted by him mentioned in his letter to Mount Wilson Observatory could by no manner or means have been anything but a celestial body. Mr. ******* was very emphatic that it could not have been an aircraft in any form and that he so stated in his letter. Mr. ******* stated his reason for writing the letter was the unusual size of the celestial body which he took to be a meteor but which might have been a comet. Mr. ******* stated that the object definitely could not have been man made.
