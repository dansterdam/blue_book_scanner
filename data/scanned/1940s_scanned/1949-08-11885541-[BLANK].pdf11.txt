[Partially obscured word]SSIFIED

Incident #68 -- NW of Bethel, Alaska -- 4 August 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.
The time in sight (four minutes) and rate of speed (1200 MPH) seem
to preclude any such possibilities.

The similarity of this incident to #10, in which several
objects were seen silhouetted against a sunset, is striking.
