IMPORTANT INCOMING AND OUTGOING TELEPHONE MESSAGES

TO:          Captain E. J Behemhendy

Time         9:05          Date       31 Aug. 49

FROM         Mr. Cowan - Herald Post, El Paso, Texas

MESSAGE

Mr. Cowan: What is this the radios are putting out about you people at 
            the White Sands seeing flying saucers -- or flying discs 
            up there?

Capt D:     I just heard about it from some people who came out from 
            El Paso-- is it a story put out by a Mr. Roberts?

Mr. Cowan:  Yes-- A Mr. Roberts and a Mr. Miles, from Los Angeles, I believe.

Capt D:     These men were here last week as guests of the Navy, and if 
            they have any information of this type, I imagine they got it 
            from the Navy-- shall I switch you to the Navy and let you talk 
            with them?

Mr. Cowan:  Do you have a Navy PIO?

Capt D:     I'll switch you to Cdr McLaughlin, who will be able to 
            clear you up on where the stories came from. We have had no 
            such information here, and have made no releases at all on such 
            subjects.

###########

Note:       I believe Mr. Roberts recieved this information on which he based 
            his release from the Navy. Cdr. McLaughlin released verbal 
            information of a similar nature to Dr. Schiander, Public Information representative 
            National Military Establishment, Washington, D.C. when he was here at this post 
            some weeks ago-- in my presence
