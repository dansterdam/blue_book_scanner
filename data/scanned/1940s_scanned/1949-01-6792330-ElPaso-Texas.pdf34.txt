WHAT IS YOUR STORY?

"On the 30th of January 1949 at approximately 1500 hours, while in the company of Mr. [REDACTED] Boeing Aircraft, I observed an object that appeared to be traveling diagonally across in front of me, at an angle of 35° to 40° degrees above my line of sight. Its distance seemed very close and appeared to be traveling very slowly. The object was in my sight for approximately three or four seconds. The actions of said object during this time were as follows:

Gentle downward glide; bright burning (green and yellowish light) a fizzling, and then a bright burning, and then appeared to die out. This could have been the effects of its passing beyond my view).

My direction of travel was nearly due East, thus the object's direction was East-Southeast or Southeast. The weather at that time was clear and cold, no ground wind and no indications of upper winds. My location was west of Tularosa, New Mexico, beyond the railyards of the Southern Pacific Railroad."
