SUMMARY: (Brief concise summary of report. Give significance in bold and primer paragraphs. List enclosures at lower left. Begin text of report at A on Form 113—Part II)

Following is copy of letter received at this headquarters with copy of newspaper clipping attached:

"SUBJECT: Observation of aerial object                                    3 June 1949

TO: 
 Intelligence Section
 Fourth Air Force
 Hamilton Air Force Base
 California

I'm a regular Air Force officer stationed at the University of California. 

I wish to collaborate in part the attached report which has been clipped from the 3 June issue of the Oakland Tribune.

I observed at 0350 on 1 June 1949 an object traveling from East to West at approximately 1500 feet over my residence at 6119 Fresno Avenue, Richmond Annex.

A strong light issued from this object. It traveled at what I guessed to be approximately 400 miles per hour. I saw no shape - only light, since my view was mainly at a headon angle. It disappeared from my view over the house and was not visible when I arrived at a west window. 

I would also add that I received the impression that it was small, that is smaller than a conventional fighter - that it was manmade - that there was no sound.

This is a true recording of my impression of the object.
