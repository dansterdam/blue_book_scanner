E. CONCLUSIONS

Detailed conclusions will be submitted in the final report. It is 
too early to state specific conclusions, except for a few incidents, 
but it seems likely at this stage of the work that more than one 
quarter of the incidents may be explainable as astronomical phenomena.

Positive identification of incidents 94 through 97 has been established. 

A Fireball, reported in Popular Astronomy (October, 1948), observed to 
travel over southern Oregon and seen also in parts of California and 
Nevada, coincides exactly with the information reported in these 
incidents.

There can be no question but that these "flying saucers", at least, 
were a bona fide fireball. Since the description in these reports 
is similar to those in several others, the inference that the latter 
also were fireballs is strengthened.
