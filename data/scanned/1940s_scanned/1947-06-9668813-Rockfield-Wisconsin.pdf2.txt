Incident #44 - near Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- 23 June 1947

Information given here is insufficient to indicate what was seen. If this were a totally independent observation and not one that was presumably initiated by current radio reports of Flying saucers, more weight could be given to it. As it is, with flying saucer talk rampant, almost anything from meteors to balloons or aircraft would be reported as saucers by an uncritical observer. It is unlikely, however, that there was anything astronomical about this incident.
