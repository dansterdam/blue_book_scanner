Free Press

HOLLAND, Mich.â€”WILLIAM SAACKETT and WILLIAM OLSON, employees of the Post Milk
Co., reported they sighted six flying discs over Saugatuck about
9:15 a.m. Thursday.

They said they pursued them in an automobile for about five
miles on M-89 before they lost sight of the low flying objects.

The men said the discs appeared to be about 10 inches in dia-
meter, moving in wide circles, following a course which closely
paralleled the highway.
