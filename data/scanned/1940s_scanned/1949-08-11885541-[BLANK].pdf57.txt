UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #135 -- Waverly, South Dakota -- between 16-20 August 1947

For the description of this incident as given, there is 
no astronomical explanation.

The statements of an apparently well-trained observer
can scarcely be doubted, but no interpretation, either astrono-
mical or otherwise, other than possible extended auroral streamers,
suggests itself. The moon at the time was new and the night ap-
parently very dark, the most favorable conditions for the observa-
tion of auroral phenomena.
