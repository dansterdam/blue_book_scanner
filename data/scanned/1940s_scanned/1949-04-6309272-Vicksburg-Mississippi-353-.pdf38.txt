MEMO

25 Aug 49

1. The attached information regarding unidentified aerial objects has been 
reviewed.

2. This Laboratory does not feel justified in saying definitely what the nature 
of this unidentified object may be.

3. It is believed that significance should be attached to the fact that the 
observer could not get a hard focus on the object and therefore obviously did not 
make an exact determination of idea distance. One of the points emphasized by 
Dr. Paul M. Pitts in his recent review of similar findings was that observers usually 
were unable to determine the distance of the object. Unless distance is determined, 
all estimates of the size of the object and of its linear speed are unreliable. It is 
believed possible that, had the observers been able to bring the object into clear focus 
in his theodolite, he might have been able to identify it.
