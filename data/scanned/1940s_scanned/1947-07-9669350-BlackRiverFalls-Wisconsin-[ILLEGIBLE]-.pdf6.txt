5. According to Mr. _____, the Finder, the "Flying Disc" was reported down in Flim Gorge near Black River Falls at the morning of July 1947. That afternoon, Mrs. _____, while walking on the location given by _____, found what is believed to be a "Flying Disc" laying high in some brush and off the terrain.
