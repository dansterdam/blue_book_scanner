Incident No. 75 -- 13 August 1947, 1300 hours, Snake River Canyon, Idaho.
A farmer together with his two sons, ten and eight years of age, witnessed an object move down a canyon. It was in view only momentarily at a distance of 300 feet, and approximately 75 feet above the ground. The object made a swishing sound, and was sky-blue in color. The farmer doubted the possibility of its visibility if viewed against the sky. The children told of smokeless turbine or exhaust flames shooting from the device through which could be seen daylight. The object passed over some trees, which in the words of the farmer, "spun around on top as if they were in a vacuum."

ATC Opinion: It seems logical to concur with Dr. Hynek's deduction, that this object was simply a rapidly moving atmospheric eddy.
