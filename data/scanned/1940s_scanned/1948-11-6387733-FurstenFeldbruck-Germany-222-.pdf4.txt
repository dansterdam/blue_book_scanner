TO: Commanding General

ATTN: AMC/IXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, AMC/IXO,
dated 19 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and a first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents' summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Conclusions based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows : Item 13, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction toward which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Nettings" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.
