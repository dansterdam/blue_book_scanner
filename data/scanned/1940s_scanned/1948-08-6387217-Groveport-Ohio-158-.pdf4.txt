The document contains three hand-drawn sketches near the bottom of the page. These sketches appear to illustrate the motion and behavior of an unidentified object as described in the text above them. The first sketch shows a curved, snake-like streak. The second sketch depicts a streak with both curved and straight sections. The third sketch appears to be an oval or circular shape with a smaller circle inside it, possibly representing the object's last observed position. The drawings are annotated with descriptions of the object's motion, including "Streak twisted and turned - suddenly disappeared" and a note about the last position, with an additional measurement stating "Width same - length estimated at 1 to 2 miles."

The text of the document is as follows:

"Observer noticed what appeared to be a small black cloud between two white ones. Seemed peculiar because the weather was clear and there were a few white clouds in the sky - but no other dark clouds or formations of any kind. The black cloud did not have any definite shape but looked like an anti-aircraft shell a few seconds after it explodes. Suddenly it stretched out into a wide streak with smaller vertical streaks, then frantically turned and twisted, moving into a different direction and disappearing. In lapse of four seconds, smoke burst appeared again spontaneously, approximately 270 yards, 900' circles moving ENE direction. Smoke pillar, or column, drew into a size of 7 feet in width narrowing again into a snake-like streak a mile or so in length which appeared to twist from a wide to a narrow streak and then back again changing direction as it twisted. Moving in westerly direction against light wind. Plainly visible also far away and very high, no sound heard. Seemed like a streak that would be made if a Flying Wing with several engines **** banking and turning and leaving contrail trails.

(Sanitized) was in the war and had seen a lot of anti-aircraft shells burst and many vapor trails from planes but had never observed anything like this. He states, 'It was so spontaneous like a rubber band which is round, then suddenly is stretched at length and twisted, and then disappears without a trace.'

Agent's Note: (Sanitized) drew the sketches below"
