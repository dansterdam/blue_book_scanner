HEADQUARTERS
AIR MATERIAL COMMAND
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
ICJAXO-3/4B/3/rm
Jan 5 1949

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
     Andrews Air Force Base,
     Washington 25, D. C.
     ATTN: DSS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investi-
gation and interpretation of data relative to sighting of unidentified
flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files
of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendation as to
which of the incidents may be weather balloons. This is also on routine
synoptic ascensions by the Air Material Service, the Navy Aereological
Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached
may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that
has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except
that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball
lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are
conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force or
endorsed by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks
are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, ICJAXO-3. These
checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by
weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department
of Commerce. (U.S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed inci-
dents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This
list does not eliminate the possibility that any of the remaining
incidents are balloons.
