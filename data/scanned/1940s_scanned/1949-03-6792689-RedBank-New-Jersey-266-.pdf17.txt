NOTE: Evans Signal Laboratory (U. S. Signal Corps) located at Belmar, New Jersey, approximately 11 miles South and to the West of Watson Laboratories, reported that on 4 Mar 49, the Metereological Division made a test balloon flight which lasted from 1352 to 1432 at 54,000 feet.  At the time, the prevailing wind was in a general Westerly direction.  This flight would be ll - 12 miles South of Watson Laboratories and the direction of the test balloon would be to the East.  The unidentified phenomena mentioned in this report was first seen coming from a NNE direction and disappearing in a NNW and was many miles North of this point of observation and it is remote that this phenomena was identified with the balloon flight mentioned above.
