There is an image at the top of the document which appears to be a photograph of a slender, elongated object with fins or wings. The image quality is poor and details are not clear. Below the photograph, there is text, which I will transcribe:

Incident #XX - Clark AF Base, Philippine Islands - 12 November 1948

Two things enter heavily into any possible interpretation 
of this incident: the reported maneuverability of the object, and
the character evaluation of the witness.

If the facts add up as stated, and there is no astronomical
explanation for the object observed. A few points favor its having
been a daylight meteor: the snow-white color, speed faster than
that of a jet plane, roaring noise, similarity to "skywriting," and
the brightness of the observation. No contrails, however, if really
performed, expose it strenuously.

The question is, did this object actually maneuver in and
out of a cloud bank...? Also, did it make turns or 180Â° or more? It
is possible that such impressions were merely illusions. The witness
saw the object intermittently through clouds. It is not clear whether
he ever saw it against a cloud background or only in the sky gaps
between clouds, a fact which is highly important. If he saw it only
in breaks between clouds, this fact, coupled with its great speed,
makes it clear that only momentary impressions could be obtained.

Such observations, by an untrained observer, might form a des-
cription that is extremely unlike the facts.

The impression of a fuselage with windows could even more 
easily have been a figment of the imagination.

Unless more specific information surfaces, a final conclu-
sion is unavailable, the present Investigator cannot say whether any
astronomical explanation is possible, or not.
