Sections of the document are illegible or redacted. The text seems to be related to some form of military or air force communication, with references to aircraft ("A/C") movements or reports, which might be linked to reporting unidentified flying objects, as the document is associated with Project Blue Book. The text includes strings of numbers that could represent times, dates, coordinates, bearings, or some other form of coded information.

The signature and title at the bottom middle of the page indicate that the author of this certification was a Captain in the United States Air Force and served as a forecaster, however, the name is not clearly legible. The classification status of the document is indicated as "UNCLASSIFIED" with a note suggesting declassification policies following a period of 12 years as per Department of Defense Directive 5200.10.
