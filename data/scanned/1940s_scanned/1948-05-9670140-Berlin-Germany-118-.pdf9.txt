The image presents a page with handwritten text, which is likely from a report document of Project Blue Book regarding the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). There isn't a photograph present within this image, but there are three hand-drawn triangular shapes (possibly representing the UFO in question) at the bottom of the page.

The handwritten text is a bit difficult to read due to its cursive style and quality of the image; however, I will attempt to transcribe as much of the text as possible:

```
Descript of Object - Gorman Observers
H. E. Johnson - circular, resembled full moon red glowing
Pfc. Steele - Te Cone shapped
               Sgt. Blackwell

Lt. Ovens - Round and white

There are additional notes and marks, including arrows and partial words or phrases that I have not been able to decipher from the image provided. Keep in mind this transcription might not be entirely accurate due to the quality of the image and the handwriting legibility.
