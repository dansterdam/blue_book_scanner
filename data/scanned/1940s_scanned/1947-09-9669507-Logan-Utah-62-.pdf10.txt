The image provided is a page from an old document with poor legibility due to its quality. There are no photographs visible on this particular page; instead, there appear to be two hand-drawn wave-like lines or sketches.

Despite the poor quality, Iâ€™ll attempt to extract the text from the document as follows:

The document is a structured report form with listed criteria for reporting a UFO sighting. The answers provided are incomplete and illegible in parts, making it difficult to extract accurate or meaningful information. This is typical for historical documents that have sustained wear over time or have been poorly preserved or reproduced.
