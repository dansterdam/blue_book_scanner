Here is the text from the document:

```
I said we ought to try to see if the entire barrel would burn, and
I put my gun over my head, holding it by the stock, and then every-
thing iron on it began to burn normally with a small blue flame
about 1 cm or 1/2 cm blowing off in the direction of the wind and
it was driven up a little along the iron in the wind direction.

At this point my companion said we should go to the FS barracks
so nothings would happen to us. I do say that at that time there was
a strong northwest wind, and after 4 minutes it stopped, or we went
down a slope, and the wind passed us, turning upward to an adjacent slope.

We have not written anything about this entire matter so that no one
would think we were seeing ghosts or something similar.
I'm glad for one thing about this true 1000% experience, that is
will not be considered as a joke or sensationalism.

With greetings only for peace!
