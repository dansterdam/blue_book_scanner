Incident #111 -- Philippine Islands -- 1 April 1948

There appears to be nothing astronomical in this incident. 

At a distance of 3 miles an object 20 feet long would subtend an angle of slightly more than 4 minutes of arc, and hence would be very near to the limit of the resolution of the eye. The object must have been very much larger, if the distance is correct, for the observer to discern its shape and its turtle back.

Since the object was seen by only one person, and since the description is contradictory, it seems to this investigator that not much weight can be given to the incident.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
