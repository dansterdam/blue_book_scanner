"FLYING DISCS APPEAR AGAIN IN BOISE AREA"

World War II Pilot Sees Mystery Objects in Tight Formation

A World War II bomber pilot said today he saw six flying discs, five of 
them in V-shaped formation circling about 10 miles west of Shafer butte,
and, he said, he wasn't "kidding".

________, Boise, a former B-24 pilot, said 
he saw the six objects at approximately 11:05 a.m. at an altitude he would 
estimate to be 13,000 feet.

He said he was driving from Caldwell to Boise when he saw the objects.

The objects, he said, were black on the bottom and silver on top, and 
their size at the distance from which he saw them indicated that they 
would be approximately the size of a four-engined airplane.

He said he saw a single object first, then five more flying in tight forma-
tion. He said they spiraled down three or four thousand feet, then climbed 
abruptly at great speed and disappeared.

'They acted as if they were intelligently controlled,' he said. 'When they 
turned toward me they were silver, because they were in a turn and I could 
see the sun flash from their tops. When they banked away it appeared the 
bottom side was colored black.'

He said he had no way of judging their speed in spiral flight, but he said 
it would compare to that of an F-51 Fighter.

The CAA radio communications station here said there were no Air Force planes 
in the area, and the 190th Fighter squadron of the Idaho National Guard said 
it had a single F-51 up during the morning.
