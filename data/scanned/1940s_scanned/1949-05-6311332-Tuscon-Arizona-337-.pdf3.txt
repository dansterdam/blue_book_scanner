NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 9 May 1949 at approximately 1130 hours, while reclining on the front lawn of my residence at __________, Tucson, Arizona, I had occasion to notice two objects in the air overhead, these objects during its very formation obviously direction traveling northeast. When approximately directly overhead, the objects banked to the left and went in an approximately a northwesterly direction, continuing in this direction for approximately one mile, and then banking abruptly to the right and headed northeast towards the Catalina mountains. They continued in this northeast direction, gradually fading from view until they finally disappeared from my sight.

The size of those objects, to my estimation, was approximately 25 feet in diameter with a thickness of approximately one foot and their size in relation to a known object as they appeared to me in the air was approximately the size of a wash tub. I would place their altitude at approximately 10,000 feet. There was no discernible variation in this altitude during the time they remained in my sight. The distance between those two objects which did not vary considerably was approximately 50 feet. When I first saw them, they were directly overhead and appeared perfectly round. When they banked to the left, and then to the right I was able to see both sides of them.

There was no apparent means of motivation, no vapor trail, exhaust and absolutely no sound. The surface appeared to be smooth and symmetrical. They did not appear to vary in thickness from time to consider from the other edge. The color appeared silvery and they shiny when reflecting the sun. This particular day was a very clear sunshine day. The objects seemed to be traveling between 750 and 1,000 miles an hour.

I have been associated with aircraft the major portion of my life, having spent the last eight years in actual duties connected with aircraft and recently on a flight engineer on flying status. I have observed all conventional types of aircraft, and Jet Fighter aircraft in the sky, and this object seemed to be considerably faster than I have ever seen any aircraft travel. My home is located in the residential section of Tucson on the NE portion of the city approximately distance from my home to the Catalina Mountains in a northeast direction is six miles. From the direction I first sighted the objects come from, they would have come over a more densely populated portion of the city of Tucson, but not necessarily over the business center. Upon initially sighting these objects in the air, I called to my wife to come out of the house, but she did not get
