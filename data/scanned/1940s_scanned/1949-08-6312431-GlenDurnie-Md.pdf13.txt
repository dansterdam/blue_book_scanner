The photograph in the document depicts two individuals inspecting an object, which appears to be the mysterious aircraft mentioned in the article. The image is rather grainy, but one can make out the rough shape of the object they're examining, along with some other unidentifiable pieces of equipment or debris scattered around it. The two individuals are focused on the object, with one squatting down beside it and the other leaning over it.

Here's the text from the document:

Not a Ghost Rider of the Sky

State police inspect a mysterious aircraft found in an abandoned tobacco shed at Marley Park, Md. At first, an Air Force spokesman said the big gadget, made of tubular steel and fabric and named the Gray Goose, was “a definite prototype” of the flying saucer. Later, however, the Air Force announced that the Maryland craft had no connection with the saucer.

Rusting Skeletons
No Flying Saucers

Air Force Rejects
Find in Maryland

By United Press.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 20.—After hushing it over for a day, the Air Force decided today the two strange old crafts found in a Maryland barn have absolutely no connection with the purported phenomena of flying saucers.

Several official spokesmen for the Air Force had hemmed and hawed about the discovery since the experimental craft were found. One had said they were definite prototypes (ancestors) of the flying saucer. Another later toned that down considerably.

The Air Force after noon today rather shortly released this bare statement:

"The Air Force states that the two experimental craft, found near Elkridge, Md., yesterday bear absolutely no connection with the reported phenomenon of flying saucers."

Thus the Air Force again stated its skeptical attitude as to whether there really ever had been any such things.

The eccentric inventor of the rotting, rusting abandoned experimental aircraft discovered yesterday was Jonathan E. Caldwell. He disappeared from Maryland nine years ago. No one has been able to discover where he went.
