Incident #33,-a,- -- pa.o 3

interval of more tbai^half^ an hour, would be incredible.

Incident #33 is t^e only one of the four that includes
the daytime observation of presumably, the same object. The im-
portance of the incident is, hov/ever, para^ount, for it was in
tracking down the mysterious object that Lieutenant Mantell lost

his life. Again it is possible that th,e object observed was the
planet Venus, althouii t.ie evidence is by no means so definite
as that for the sighting made later that day. First, the hearings
of the object as reported by various witnesses differ considerably;
where one says southwest, another says south, for i;.e eao ^.istak 
ing Venus, differ;ntiat-; all th^ evidence, one i^^ a Jnin struck with tne 
coincidences of: th.e object's position with that of Venus. The fol-
lowing short table of sighting vs tim position of Venus shows tne 
general ap^roximat; of the tivo.in azimuth:

Object Venus
1533 (Pvt Oliver) S in cr^ field Almost due S 1.4°
1456 (Sgt. Blackv/ell) south of field 1.3°
(Pvt Oliver)
after 1400 (Lt. Vunar) Si from due S 130°, at
140°, moving westward
1445 (Capt. Mantell) 2100 
(Col. Hix) 215°

A more pertineat question is that of whether it would have
been possible to see Venus in the daytime on that day. All that can
be said here is that it  was not impossible to see the planet under
those conditions. It is well known that when Venus is at its greatest
brilliancy, it is possible to see it durin.; the dayti:^ whoa one knows
exactly where to look, but on kthutary 7, 1948 Venus was less than half
