"A yellow-orange object which had the appearance of a flare was observed some six
miles from Smyrna AAF between the west and northwest just above the horizon
and moving directly to the base. The speed was such as to cover the
six miles in approximately four to five minutes. It gradually faded away
disappearing into the horizon. No exhaust trail was seen and no sound was heard."
