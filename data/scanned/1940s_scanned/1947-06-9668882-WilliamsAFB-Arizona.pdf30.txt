DECIDES TO TELL

EX-RANCHER SAYS HE SAW
FLYING SAUCERS 4 TIMES

   An ex-Lake County turkey
rancher said here today that he
saw "flying saucers" four times
in a period of four years.
   Now living at 564 55th Street,
Cleet H. Ballard, former Oakland
building contractor, said he de-
cided to tell about them after
hearing a news broadcast Satur-
day that the Air Force, which
once discounted the saucer 
stories, is interested.
    Ballard had a turkey ranch on 
Spruce Grove Rd., east of
Lower Lake, until four months
ago.
OBJECT FLUTTERS DOWN
    In 1947, he said, he saw a
circular object fluttering down 
from the sky. It landed in a field
and he picked it up, he said. It
was about 12 inches in diameter
and had lines radiating from the
center. Between the lines were
printed strange characters, simi-
lar to Oriental writing, which he
could not read.
    Ballard said he kept the disc,
which was made of heavy paper,
for several days, then burned it.
    Now he believes that it might
be a chart from one of the mys-
terious flying objects he saw
later.

The first "saucer" he saw was
in June or July, 1947, Ballard
said.
    (It was in June, 1947, that
Kenneth Arnold, Boise, Ida., fly-
ing businessman, reported seeing
nine mysterious objects over
western Washington and started
the "saucer" stories.)
SPILLED TO TURKEYS
    Ballard said his attention was
drawn to the flying object by his
his turkey herd. All the turkeys,
which he said notice everything
that flies, were looking up as it
whizzed by heading due north-
East wife, Juanita, also saw the
object. It made no sound and left
no trail of any kind, Ballard said.
    Twice more he saw similar
objects, appearing to be round,
fly over his ranch. The fourth
time was last October, when one
of them came plummeting out
of the sky from great altitude,
then stopped in mid-air for about
a minute and shot upwards again.
    A neighboring Lake County
rancher, Fred Topsey, also saw
it, Ballard said.
    The Air Force at Hamilton
Air Force base said it would send
an intelligence officer to inter-
view Ballard.
