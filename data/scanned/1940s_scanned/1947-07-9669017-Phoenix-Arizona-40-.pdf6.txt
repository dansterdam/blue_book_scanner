DETAILS

This investigation is predicated upon a Routing & Record Sheet, sub-
ject "Investigation of Flying Discs," dated 2 May 1949, signed by W. E.
CLINGEMAN, Colonel, USAF, Chief, Domestic Intelligence Division, Intelli-
gence Department, Wright-Patterson AFB.

Colonel CLINGEMAN indicates that he is in receipt of a Memorandum
written by GEORGE FUGATE, JR., Special Agent, CID-ADC-4AF, in which Mr.
Fugate who is from Phoenix, Arizona, hereinafter referred to
as SUBJECT, was interviewed as an observer of a "flying disc." SUBJECT con-
tended that he took a picture of this disc, and two positive prints of these
photos were turned over to the CIC agents. Photo experts are somewhat ago-
as to whether the photographs mentioned in SA FUGATE's report could have been
taken under the conditions he described. The experts do agree that the techni-
cal in development and printing of the pictures is extremely crude.

Colonel CLINGEMAN requests inquiry to investigate the standing of
the thus described to know the type and amount of business conducted by the or-
ganization on end with whom and the social and professional status of SUBJECT.

Colonel CLINGEMAN states that later correspondence from the SUBJECT
implies that he is connected with the Administrator and Observa-
tory in Phoenix, Arizona and refers to himself variously as Chief of Staff
and President of that organization. He also uses the title "Doctor." Accord-
ing to his letterhead, one of the specialties of 

AT DAYTON, OHIO

2. On 16 May 1949 at the Headquarters 5th District OSI (IG), the Writer
interviewed Special Agent GEORGE FUGATE, JR., previously mentioned in this re-
port, formerly a member of the Counter Intelligence Corps, Air Defense Command,
4th Air Force.

Mr. FUGATE said that the interviewer resulting in the Memorandum pre-
viously mentioned was a bit hazy in his mind. FUGATE said that he had been
instructed to interview SUBJECT in the company of Special Agent BROWER of
the OSI Office, Phoenix, Arizona.

Mr. FUGATE states that the thing he remembers most is the fact he
saw a large quantity of expensive looking radio equipment in SUBJECT's home.
This did not seem to be in keeping with SUBJECT's station in life.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
