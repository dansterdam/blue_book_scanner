The text itself suggests that the document relates to military correspondence regarding an unidentified flying light phenomena, which is probably related to reports on UFO sightings and was being investigated at that time as part of Project Blue Book or a similar investigation. The document also shows it has been unclassified and once had regulations concerning its classification status.
