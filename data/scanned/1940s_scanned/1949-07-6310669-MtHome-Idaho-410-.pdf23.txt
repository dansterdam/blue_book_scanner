2. This investigation conducted by the writer.

3. At approximately 1600 hours, 25 July 1949, this agent arrived at the office of Mr. ------ Owner and Manager of a Flying Service, Nampa, Idaho, where ------ was contacted. ------ completed a form supplied by Headquarters, Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, entitled "Essential Elements of Information (Re Sightings of Unidentified Aerial Objects) PROJECT STIGN". See Inclosure No. 2.

------ 's verbal account of his sighting was as follows: On 24 July 1949, ------ was flying his Piper Clipper aircraft (N5622H), from Ogden, Utah en route to Nampa, Idaho, ------ at about 1203 hours (MST), was flying at 10,000 feet MSL altitude, with a heading of 270 degrees, ten (10) miles from Mt Home, Idaho, when he sighted seven (7) flying objects about 7 o'clock, (nose of his plane used as 12 o'clock for this reference,) flying a parallel course, but about 500 feet lower. For an instance, ------ said he believed the objects to be F-51's or A-26's, on second glance, ------ said he knew that they were nothing that he had ever seen before. The objects overtook his aircraft, passing on his left (south side) at about 1500 feet distance, at approximately 500 feet lower, or 9500 feet MSL altitude. The objects were flying perfect formation, two rows of three (line abreast) and the seventh slightly to the rear and maybe slightly above the rest. The objects span the formation was very tight, being about one-third of the object's stated that the formation tip of one object to tip of the other (approximately 15 feet). The same distance was maintained from trailing edge of lead objectâ€™s to nose of objects in second line. When the objects had passed approximately 150 feet away, they made a turn to the right, passing about 1500 feet in front of, and 50% feet below a turn in the objects again turned to the right, and passed on the right (north) side of doing neither banked or skidded. ------ stated that when the objects first turned, he thought they meant to ram him. As soon as the objects passed to his right, ------ turned his aircraft so that he might keep the objects in view. He stated that the objects remained in view for approximately 1 or 2 minutes in all, and that their speed was estimated between 450 and 550 miles an hour. ------ said that he watched the objects suddenly disappear at approximately ten (10) miles distance from him.

5. In describing the objects, ------ said they were delta shaped flying wings. He estimated their span as being between that of an F-51 and an A-26 aircraft (35 to 55 feet), their length (nose to trailing edge) at about 20 to 30 feet, and their thickness at from 2 to 5 feet. ------ said that the objects
