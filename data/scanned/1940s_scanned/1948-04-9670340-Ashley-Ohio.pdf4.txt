The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a blurry and faded photocopy of a document page from Project Blue Book with some text and various forms of markings, handling, and possibly water damage. However, due to the quality of the image, the text is mostly illegible.

From the visible content, I'll transcribe as much as possible:
