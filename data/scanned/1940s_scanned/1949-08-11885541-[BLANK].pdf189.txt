Incident #20 -- Xenia, Ohio -- 20 October 1947

The information given here is insufficient to determine
any possible astronomical origin of the object observed.

As in Incident #18, while it is impossible to rule out
the meteoric explanation (e.g., straight course, fast speed), the
lack of information about trail, length of time in sight, manner of
disappearance, and distance from observer, make any attempt at a
definite interpretation rather futile.

Again, in short, it is not impossible that the object seen
was a daylight, slow-moving bolide, but it is highly improbable,
judging from the limited information offered.
