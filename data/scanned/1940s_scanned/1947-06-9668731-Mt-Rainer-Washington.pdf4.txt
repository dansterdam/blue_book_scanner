With 434 incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain some evidence that there is no apparent ready explanation
and therefore do serve only under the assumption that the evidence is
true and that the actual facts observed are as stated.

It must be noted that none of these unexplained cases has
been explained satisfactorily as positive mj's by Item C Corporations
or any of the various German laboratories in Germany (see a
the RPT).

Appendix I Cont'd Area-Wide Incidents................ (see 101)
(are continued).

There is sufficient psychological explanation for the
misidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanations
for points not otherwise explicable. Flare's errors in identification, visual
details result chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, time.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in th
report. These incidents form no pattern in regard to area, of
witness, or object, or number of objects perceived. This indicates
that theses sightings were influenced by earlier reports,
probably did not have been considered unusual or reported
been no publicity.

Survey of Case Evaluation of Remaining Reports.

The Appendix C of AAF Evaluation of Satellite Evidence:

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix I) constitute a
collection of coincidences. Two of these, by statements of the
eyewitnesses do not become less the eyewitnesses not read of a few
and most cannot be.

(Incident No. 17). Cases were distributed without pattern
throughout the United States. A few were outside the U. S. No two
sightings of the appearance or performance were exactly alike. The
recorded sightings occurred at various times of the day and year.

APPENDIX II

In the following section of this report, each remaining unexplained
incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to comment on each.
The cases are divided, basically, each 33 into its identifiable category and then
number be tabulated. The numerical designation is merely the sequential
order of the incident in the project files.
