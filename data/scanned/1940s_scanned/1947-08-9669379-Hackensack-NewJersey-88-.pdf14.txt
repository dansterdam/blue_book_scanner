The document contains two photographic images near the top of the page and one at the bottom of the page. The images appear to be black-and-white reproductions of some sort, likely depicting unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The upper images feature two long, blurry markings that could be interpreted as rod-shaped objects captured in motion, with one darker than the other. The bottom image shows two objects or possibly parts of the same object with a dark area above them; it's more ambiguous and doesn't exhibit clear detail.

Incident #33 -- Hackensack, New Jersey -- 3 August 1947

It seems clear that no astronomical interpretation can 
be given to this incident.

Information is so meager that little else can be said.

If the object observed was only 200 yards away, it would seem
that witnesses could have furnished much more detailed informa-
tion.
