atmosphere when stable currents of air flow over cascades or
hills or mountains. An up-and-down wave motion may be impressed
upon the air, provided that temperature and wind conditions are
suitable. As the air describes its wave-like path, it alternately warms
and cools, the warming taking place as it sinks into the wave
trough and the cooling as it ascends to the wave crest. If the air
is very dry, the undulating current will not be visible to the eye,
although the updrafts and downdrafts will readily be felt by air-
craft that chance to pass through them. On the other hand, if the
air before entering the wave is moist enough, the cooling in the
wave crest will cause water droplets to condense and a cloud to
appear.

In the vicinity of an isolated peak the cloud may assume the
form of a cap covering the summit, or it may be displaced slightly
downwind and resemble a lens or disk. Not infrequently a series
of lenticular clouds will appear, trailing downwind at regular in-
tervals of a few miles. Although these wave clouds are usually
stationary, they sometimes move at great speed, especially when
the air temperature is changing rapidly.

From a study of a remarkable photograph made in 1956, R. J.
Reed of the University of Washington has offered striking evidence
that the disks ******* saw were actually wave clouds in rapid
motion.

On the afternoon of December 29, 1956, a photographer for the
Seattle Times was on top of Piggtail Peak near White Pass, Washing-
ton (not far from the area where Arnold's nine disks had appeared),
taking ski pictures for the rotogravure section of the Sunday Times.
The weather was beautiful. Down in the pass temperatures hovered
near freezing, but the slopes were warmed by sunlight that filtered
down through thin cirrus clouds and raised the temperature to a
balmy fifty degrees. Just as sunset a strange object suddenly ap-
peared off toward the northeast horizon. Several skiers urged the
photographer to take a picture of the "flying saucer," but since it
was still far away and indistinct, he waited. The first object, now
followed by a second one, moved rapidly toward Mount Rainier,
began to sharpen in outline, and both were soon so clearly visible
that he was able to snap his unusual picture. The photograph shows
two apparently solid, disklike objects, flattened, brilliantly white but
dark at the bottom, apparently linked together by white streamers,
skimming toward the mountain peak.

Recognizing the close resemblance between the objects in the
photograph and those ******* described, Reed made a full analysis
of the weather conditions prevailing at the time the picture was
taken. From radiosonde data provided by the Seattle-Tacoma Air-
port, he obtained measurements of the size of the clouds, their
height above the mountains, wind directions, and temperature and
humidity at mountain height and cloud height. Obviously the pat-
tern of weather conditions that prevailed that day was suitable for
the formation of sailable clouds.

To test the hypothesis that ******* also had seen such clouds,
he then obtained records of the weather data for June 24, 1947,
to determine whether atmospheric conditions on the two dates were
similar enough. The two synoptic, serial charts **** **** ** ****
