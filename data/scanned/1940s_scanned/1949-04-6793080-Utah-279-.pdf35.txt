NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 5 April 1949, Patrolman [Redacted], Utah State Highway Patrol, Mantua, Utah was interviewed and stated that he happened to glance up into the sky and saw two trails of vapor or smoke approximately twelve feet long to the southwest of Mantua. He stated that the smoke or vapor trails were parallel, one above the other, bluish-white in color and approximately 11,000 or 12,000 feet MSL. About one minute after looking up and seeing this phenomena, [Redacted] said, "I heard and felt a rather strong explosion," blasting indicates that he thought at the time the explosion was from blastings in the area but later associated this "blast" noise and blastings in that region as the time. [Redacted] estimated the time of his observation of the smoke trails as 1000 hours MST.
