and also to search the Hanford area for other evidences of the Fly-
ing Saucers. The search continued, with spotty radar coverage, with
no results. The Hanford operator again cleared the F-82 into the 
prohibited area and indicated that he, himself, was taking off in an 
airplane to search. He stated further that a weapons carrier had been 
dispatched to the pamphlet (paper) drop area and no papers had been 
found. The fighter was vectored to the Columbia river gorge to lessen 
the time to be flown in the prohibited area. At approximately 1525 
a call was received from the Hanford operator that the papers dropped 
were advertisements for a Rodeo at Richland. The Rodeo is an Air 
Rodeo. The Hanford operator indicated that the pamphlets did fall 
into the prohibited area and were dropped by one of the aircraft 
participating in the Air Rodeo. The aircraft that was dropping the 
pamphlets was a PT-19 flown by Don Wise of the Atomic Speedway in 
Pasco, Washington. This pilot holds a commercial ticket. The air-
craft NC number is (NC 42853). At 1426 the F-82 was cleared to Moses 
Lake tower and landed at 1435.

2. It is believed that two separate and district alert conditions
existed on the afternoon of 21 May 1949. The first was caused by the 
sightings of Flying Saucers (noted) by Hanford using a telescope and 
the operations crew of the 637th AC&W. The second was caused by the 
dropping of leaflets by an aircraft into the Hanford area. It is be-
lieved that there is no coonection between the two events.

3. Teletype sequence of local weather and winds aloft reported 
at time of observation: 5000 feet scattered, visibility 20 miles, 
sea level pressure 15.6, temperature 69, dew point 29, wind SSW 10

240 degrees at 15 knots, 6000 feet, 220 degrees at 15 knots, 9000 feet, 
280 degrees at 20 knots, 10,000 feet 255 degrees at 15 knots, 12,000 
feet 200 degrees at 10 knots, 14,000 feet 222 degrees at 15 knots, 
20,000 feet 190 degrees at 15 knots, 25,000 feet 17 degrees at 20 
knots, 30,000 feet 160 degrees at 30 knots, 35,000 feet 150 degrees 
at 40 knots.

4. Observer states that the altitude (estimated) was between 
17,000 and 20,000 feet. The witnesses name is Max Segoinns, 504
