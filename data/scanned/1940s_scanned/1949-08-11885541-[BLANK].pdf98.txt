Incident #281, a, b - ARMY air base, Azores - 31 October 1943

There appears to be no astronomical explanation for this incident.

The observers agree in the general description, but not in the speed of the object; speeds are given from 30 to 800 MPH.

The most likely explanation on the basis of the meager information offered is that the object was a balloon carrying a swinging light.
