SOVIET ROCKET
Found In U. S. Zone.

Army Makes Little Of Incident,
Saying Nothing Unusual Is
Found In Construction

      Berline, Feb. 12--(AP)--A Russian
rocket, fired into a sparsely inhabited
part in the American Zone of Germany
sometime ago, but caused no dam-
age or casualties, U.S.' authorities
disclosed today.

  The incident was kept secret until
now, and details will remain secret
and the incident would be explained
the officials said. They expressed be-
lief they felt no purpose would have
been served by an earlier annouce-
ment.

  A high army official said there
was nothing unusual in construc-
tion of the rocket. It carried a lot
similar-than-usual charge of ex-
plosive, as customary in maneu-
vers. It dug a crater about a foot
deep in an isolated area near the
boundary of the Soviet Zone.

  The Soviet Army engaged in ma-
neuvers last fall, and possibly the
rocket was fired then. An airlift
pilot said in November he had seen
Russian tanks firing guns that
seemed of an unusual type, and
which he thought were anti-aircraft
weapons,.

  This is the only known instance
of a Russian rocket falling into the
American zone, German reports of
other instances never have been
substantiated.

The text is an article discussing a Soviet rocket found in the U.S. occupation zone of Germany after World War II. The details are incomplete as parts of the text are cut off from the view. The date at the top suggests the article is from February 15, 1949. The word "Dubonnet" can also be seen at the bottom. It appears to be an advertisement unrelated to the article above.
