Incident #96 -- Roseadale, California -- 30 December 1947

The description given here refers to an authenticated
Fireball. See report on incident #94 for details.

It is likely that the fire observed on the ground by
viewers of this incident had no connection with the fireball,

but it is not out of the question that a fragment of the bolide
did land and cause a brush fire.
