Incident #30, 48 - a - Lockbourne AAB, Columbus, Ohio - 7 January 1948

Considering this incident with #32, 33 and 48, one is
forced to conclude that the object observed from Lockbourne Army
Air Base on the evening of 7 January 1948 was the planet Venus.

One report of the incident gives the location of the
object as 210-220, or approximately opposite from that stated by
other observers and that of Venus. Obviously, since the time
of observation was the same, this means that one witness either was
looking a different object or had his directions mixed. Since
the description otherwise agrees generally with the rest, and since
it is assumed throughout the reports that all observers were viewing
the same object, the latter interpretation seems preferrable.

Witnesses state that the object "couldn't have been a
star" (of course, it wasn't), because to eye was completely over-
cast. However, reports from the Columbus Weather Bureau indicate
that, although the afternoon was cloudy, the sky was clear by 1900
hours. (This does not mean, of course, that there were no clouds near
the western horizon.)

For possible explanations of "Jet trails" reported by
observers of this object, and further discussion of the incidents,
see report on #33.
