11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
    Objects were flying in formation. Objects appeared to be cir-
    cular-shaped discs, about 10 ft in diameter. They were black
    on top and silver-colored on the bottom. No smoke, trails,
    exhaust, or sound was observed. The objects continued in
    flight after making a 90 deg turn until they disappeared from
    view.

    Four B-29s were known to be in or around that area at the
    time of the sighting.
