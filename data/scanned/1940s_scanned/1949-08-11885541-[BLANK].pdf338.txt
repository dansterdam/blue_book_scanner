Incident No. 152 -- 31 July 1948, 0025 Hours, Indianapolis, Indiana.
A man and his wife saw an object shaped like a cymbal, lusterless white in color, at an altitude of 2000 ft. The object moved across the sky to the east at approximately 1000 MPH, on a level course and shimmering in the sun, giving the appearance of spinning. It was twenty foot in diameter and six to eight foot high in the center. There was no sound or exhaust.

ATIC Opinion: This object could conceivably be the same or different objects as that seen in Incident 151, although all the remaining evidence is widely divergent. No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.
