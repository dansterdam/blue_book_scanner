NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

______________, Bend, Oregon, was interviewed at his place of employment, _____ ____________, Bend, Oregon, and stated in substance as follows: His attention was directed to the object by an associate, who called to him from the ramp of the Terminal Bldg., while he was on the loading platform in the rear of the shop. The time was approximately 1145 hours, the weather was clear with patches of cumulus clouds at great heights. The only object sighted (believed to be a jet job) was, due to its metallic sheen, but a shape comparable to an oval and quite broad in its width for normal size jet length. It appeared to be light cream in color, becoming brighter or darker as its hovering caused refraction of light from the sun. Its movement was very slow, heading in a Southwesterly direction with a slight fluttering action. He maintained a steady altitude estimated at 10,000 feet above the terrain. There was no audible sound nor visible exhaust fume. It was first viewed at a position of eleven o'clock clockwise from North, and stayed in view until the eight o'clock position was reached, at which time his view of the object was cut off by some tall trees in the immediate vicinity. The object maintained a steady light at approximately 70° above the horizon. The geographical coordinates in regard to his position at the time of sighting are 44° 03' 55" North latitude and 121° 19' 10" West longitude.
