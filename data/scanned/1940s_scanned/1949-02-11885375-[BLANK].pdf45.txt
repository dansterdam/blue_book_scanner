ABSTRACT UNCLASSIFIED

A descriptive and analytical study of the unidentified aerial objects, that have been reported both in the United States and from foreign countries, is presented. Individual cases are described in brief form, as an appendix. The analytical treatment of the subject is largely of a qualitative and generalized nature. However, detailed analyses and detailed results are presented, where this procedure is possible and will assist in establishing the validity or tenability of an overall hypothesis.

Project "Sign" is still largely characterized by the collection of data, without sufficient information to permit definite, specific conclusions to be made. No definite evidence is yet available to confirm or disprove the actual existence of unidentified flying objects as new and unknown types of aircraft. A limited number of the incidents have been identified as known objects.
