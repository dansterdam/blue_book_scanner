      ATTN: AC/INLO-X
      
  1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAAIS,
  dated 19 March 1949, subject “Unidentified Flying Objects,” and files
  indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.
  
  2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
  against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
  and Weather Bureau, and based on this review are inclosed.
  
  3. It is recommended that the “Guide to Investigation Of Un-
  identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item Do, “Direction
  of Flight of Object,” should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
  zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
  specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
  “Relative to Radar Sighting” should include a statement of the type of
  radar set used.
