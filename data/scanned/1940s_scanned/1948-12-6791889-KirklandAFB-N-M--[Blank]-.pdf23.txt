dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 333 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau, Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation Of Unl-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 18, "Disposition
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Sighting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.
