The image appears to be a heavily pixelated and unclear black-and-white photograph that resembles a radar screen or some form of topographic representation. There are a lot of black dots clustered towards the centre-right of the image, and a clearer area toward the bottom left that might represent a ground or surface. A cross symbol is visible on the upper right side of the cluster of dots. Due to the poor quality and high pixelation, it's difficult to identify any specific details.
