CALDWELL, et al - 24-93

Goose Floaticopter immediately. When this plane was nearing flight tests, it was discovered that Patent No. 2103839, owned by Mr. EDWARD B. TILFORD, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, covered the circular disk type helicopter. CALDWELL made a trip to Philadelphia and took the matter up with WILFORD. WILFORD granted permission for CALDWELL to continue building the plane. CALDWELL owns U. S. Patent Nos.
1,640,645 and 1,747,535, dealing with construction of this airplane.
Mr. DRIGGERS stated that CALDWELL had no engineering or mechanical ability, but possessed an inventive genius for thinking up new ideas, and it was only after a great deal of persuasion on the part of
DRIGGERS that CALDWELL engaged the help of Professor LEWIS CROOKS, Engineering Department of Aeronautics, Catholic University, Washington, D.C.
Dr. CROOKS tested the circular airfoil for the Gray Goose Corporation and reported that the airfoil possessed an exceptionally large lift coefficient. Mr. DRIGGERS further stated that he was the pilot that tested this airplane on 8 March 1939 on the old Benning Race Track.
The test resulted in damage to one of the landing gears after a flight of about one minute, during which time the plane rose to a height of approximately forty (40) ft. above the ground. The test report of DRIGGERS is attached as an exhibit hereto. DRIGGERS further stated that immediately after the first test, CALDWELL's interest in the disk rotor cooled considerably. He allowed the rent to lapse on the warehouse where the plane was being built and failed to pay him (DRIGGERS) for contracted wages. On 12 May 1939, U. S. Marshal JOHN D. COTTS has sold the entire contents of CALDWELL's shop at public auction.
Mr. H. C. WALKER, owner of the warehouse, purchased the equipment, which included the disk rotor model. Mr. DRIGGERS further stated that CALDWELL owed WALKER approximately $1,000.00 back rent. Several months later, CALDWELL purchased the plane model and all of his tools from WALKER for $500.00. It was necessary for DRIGGERS to institute suit against CALDWELL in order to collect his wages. In the meantime, CALDWELL had moved to Glen Burnie, Maryland, and resumed his activities. About this time, the Gray Goose Company was declared bankrupt and stocks was re-issued in the name of Rotor-Plane, Inc. Mr. DRIGGERS made available to the agents of the 4th OSI District all data and written material which he possessed. Photostats of pertinent data will be forwarded with a later report.

On 23 August 1949, the records of the University of Maryland were checked by Special Agent EDWARD S. LEONARD, and revealed that CARL DAVIS CALDWELL attended the University of Maryland from 20 September 1937 to 28 January 1938. Reason for voluntary withdrawal was stated as ill health and financial trouble. The birth date of CARL CALDWELL was listed as 17 July 1917, Lewiston, Montana. CALDWELL previously attended Roosevelt High School, Washington, D.C., and graduated from that institution in January 1937. Address at time of matriculation from tho College of Engineering, University of Maryland, was
