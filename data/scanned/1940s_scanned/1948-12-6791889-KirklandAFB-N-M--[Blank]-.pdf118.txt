Subject: Report of Anomalous Sounds Observed by AESS personnel at Los Alamos
on 1948, December 30

1. On 1948, January 5, Major C. L. Phillips, USAF, and the undersigned
under the guidance of Lt. Karl D. Hightower, AESS, visited three of the four
stations at which anomalous sounds were heard during the night of 1948,
December 30. In the present preliminary report, a summary of the pertinents
facts is given and, on the basis of azimuth and elevation readings taken at 
the three stations where sounds were heard simultaneously, an approximate
determination is made of the location of the sound sources in space.

2. At Station 800 statements were obtained from AESS inspectors
and the in accordance to OSPINTO----s, at approximately 2010 on
December 30 they both heard what they first thought was a truck laboring up
the hill nearby below their station. A and S then got to think that they were 
and went to the door to make the customary inspection, only to find that the 
roadway was empty. The sound continued. T then went out of S after they open-
ed the door and stepped outside. Repetition of their motions and on cessation
timed with a stop-watch showed that the sound occurred approximately 7 seconds.
About 10 minutes later, at approximately 2020, the same incident occurred
again, only men rising from their chairs opening the door, a stop-watch
outside motion from scratchâ€”the formality was the answer, the gearing
determination for this case gave a duration for the sound of 8.5 seconds.
This second repetition of the unusual sound made a considerable impression 
on the inspectors involved and the matter was under discussion during the 
half hour that elapsed before a bogey alarm came in over communications at
approximately 2050. By this time, had left Station 800 and the third
observation was made by and . According to these inspectors,
this noise heard at approximately 2010 was definitely an aerial noise in
contrast to the noises heard at 2010 and 2020, in their normal noise 
in this was not a aerial noise standing . In their names; although both
agreed that the sound of a plane motor probably came closest to representing
what they heard. A stop-watch determination indicated a duration on 10-15
seconds for the aerial noise. Because the inspectors felt that they made
more accurate determinations of position for the second and third incidents
than for the first, azimuth and elevation readings were taken only for the
occurrences at 2020 and 2050. According to , the azimuth of the sound
heard is 02000 *** JD 471 *** *** The elevation *** ***. According to ***
