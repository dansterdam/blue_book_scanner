1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAAX,
dated 29 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents' summaries 173 through 233 was been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are enclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 15, "Discussion
of Flight or Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion in a
specified area direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Planting to said Agency," should include a statement of the type of 
radar set used.
