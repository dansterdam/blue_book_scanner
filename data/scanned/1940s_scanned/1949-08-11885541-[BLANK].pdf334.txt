ABSTRACT

A Technical Intelligence Report covering the method of investigation of unidentified flying objects and results obtained to date is presented.

The report discusses in full the history of the project, the problems encountered, and the procedures followed in the investigation and evaluation of reports of unidentified flying objects. Since the project is continuous in nature, this report comprehensively treats reports of sightings only up to January 1949. Work is continuing on later reports.
