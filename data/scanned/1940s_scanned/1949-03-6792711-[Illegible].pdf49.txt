SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

    Eight moving "lights" appeared in the atmosphere over or in the vicinity
    of the "Q" area, ASTP, Camp Hood, Texas, on the evening of 17 March 1949.
    At the time of these sightings, the alert guard of the 2nd Armored Division
    under the Assistant AC of S, G-2 at Camp Hood, was in the area concerned and
    prepared to fire at these and record subsequent readings of elevation and azimuth.
    The purpose was to check the powers of observation and dispatch observation and
    previously-reported unknown phenomena observed on 6-7-8 March 1949 and heretofore
    reported in Summary of Information, this headquarters, dated 17 March 1949.
    Upon the reappearance of the "lights" observed on 6-7-8 March 1949, the
    series of 6 unusual "lights" appeared.

    Coordinates of lights and time of sighting follows:
                              
    Coordinates                                       Time
    1. 910.40 ─ 855.14                                1952
    2. 910.39 ─ 860.13                                1958
    3. 910.42 ─ 860.14                                1958
    4. 910.38 ─ 860.15                                2000
    5. 910.32 ─ 855.17                                2000
    6. 910.30 ─ 855.20                                2005
    7. 910.36 ─ 855.06                                2012
    8. 910.37 ─ 855.35                                2152

    Coordinates were based on dual sightings of each lights by sights on tanks
    of observers. Time was clocked at instant of sighting. Captain McCullough,
    the Assistant G-2, personally observed three of the lights. Physical character-
    istics of these "lights" were reported as "quite different" from those reported
    on 6-7-8 March 1949. One burst into a green cluster. One was reddish, another
    white. One observer described some of them as similar to "very pistol" flares.
    While this phenomena was occurring, a security detachment from the "Q" area
    arrived in the vicinity of the alert crew from the 2nd Armored Division.

                                                                                DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
                                                                                DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
                                                                                DOD DIR 5200.10
