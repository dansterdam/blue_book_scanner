-now Sir:
      
      I am, for c [REDACTED] is a true life experience which [REDACTED] et, and any
cop [REDACTED] during a tornado, with bright lightning occurring, in the middle
of June 23, and 26, 1949.

      This is not a nightmare or a dreamland skit. It is a true fact because it followed usually the cycles of nature, proof of life cycle, man has
such smarts and scopes, it reached the very empirical substance, sort of
analytic situation.

      On June 24, [REDACTED], from 12:15 P.M. to 12:45 P.M. commenced a wild forces
storm as follows: - it created a dazzling of a light phase, as my view
chances to pal [REDACTED] during a noontime storm which appeared as the
color very azure blue, till 12:30 - the very seen object was a blizzard of a
circle. I am believing that is [REDACTED] something it is a point to
consider as a verified action plan, not an imaginative story or a myth. The
color at 12:45, was pinkish violet - was observed other while till
June 26.

      I am transmitting this report through the hands of my good
neighbor, Mr. Charles H. Le Fleck.
