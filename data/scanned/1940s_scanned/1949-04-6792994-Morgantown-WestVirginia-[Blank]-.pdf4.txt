CSAF ITEM 8/RESTRIC(  
_ATTENTION PROJECT "GRUDGE"  
THE FOLLOWING IS QUOTED FROM LETTER  
ADDRESSED TO USAF BY ****  
MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA, DATED 11 APR 49, FOR  
INFORMATION AND SUCH ACTION AS NECESSARY: "PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT RECENTLY  
I HAVE SEEN TWO OF THE SO CALLED FLYING  
SAUCERS. THE LAST ONE A WEEK AGO  
WAS MUCH SLOWER AND NEARER THE  
EARTH THAN THE FIRST ONE. BOTH  
WERE GOING SOUTHWEST, VERY, VERY FAST.  
THE GENERAL OUTLINE WOULD RESEMBLE  
A FLATTENED FUNNEL. I HAVE NOT  
SPOKEN TO ANYONE ABOUT THE INCIDENTS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO  
SEE THEM TO BELIVE THEY EXIST.  
REASON FOR REPORTING: I HAVE NOT  
HEARD OF ANY IN THIS AREA AND  
ASSUME THAT THESE MIGHT BE SOME  
OF THE FIRST AND IN THIS CASE YOU  
COULD USE THE INFORMATION."  

END CSAF ITEM 8/RESTRICED/
