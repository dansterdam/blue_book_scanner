UNCLASSIFIET
1901ST AACS SQUADRON
Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base
California

18 July 1949

360.32

SUBJECT: Information Pertaining to Flying Disc

TO: S-2, 1901st AACS Squadron

Between approximately 0800 and 0900 on the morning of 13 July 1949 I was called to the door (Bldg T-516) by Pvt who exclaimed, "Hey, you guys, come and see these 'flying saucers'!" He sounded rather serious about the matter, so I went to the door and he pointed "it" out to me. I saw an object which appeared to be moving at a great rate of speed in an easterly direction. It was visible only for four or five seconds and seemed to disappear. A C-82 was flying by at the time and the object appeared to be beyond the C-82 and at an altitude of approximately 5,000 to 8,000 feet. It seemed to pass on by the C-82 very fast.

Its shape was more or less round and not particularly flashy in a white color. No exhaust trails, weather very clear, no audible combustion sound.
