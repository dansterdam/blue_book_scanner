Incident No. 76 â€“ 13 August 1947, Salmon Dam, Idaho.

Two men reported simultaneously hearing a roar, and looking up observed two objects of undetermined size several miles distant. The objects were "circular, thought to have been 1000-2000 feet at greatest height which they reflected light", and were travelling at "great speed". Although occurring on the same day as Incident No. 75, the descriptions vary widely.

AEC Opinion: There is no information contained in this report to refute the assumption that these men saw two ordinary aircraft at too great a distance to discern details.
