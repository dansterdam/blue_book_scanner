DETAILS (cont'd)

3. (cont'd)

Color was silvery, and objects apparently were of solid construction. Approximate size, as they appeared from my view, was "half dollar" and approximate size was 20 feet in diameter. The objects were going ENE and made no tactics or maneuvers. There was no evidence of exhaust, no effect on clouds, no visible lights, and nothing of the shape or objects, there was no means of aero dynamic support. There was no sound; no fins or stabilizers were visible and nothing was seen of any means of propulsion. No slots or duct openings were noticed and the speed of objects was slower than jet aircraft. Objects faded from view."
