THE LEADER, WILDWOOD, N. J., APRIL 7, 1949

Coast Guards - Police
Probing Flare Source

Coast Guards and Wildwood police on Thursday began an investiga-
tion to learn the source of a flare which fell on the roof of a fish dock at Otten's Harbor.

Carl Ostrom, who is associated with Estex Brothers' Association, reported to the coast guards the roof of the flare which struck the pier.

Coast Guards from the Cape May base, in their preliminary study ex-
pressed the belief the flare was fired from a gun at close range. They
seemed to think boats from Otten Harbor carry flares of the same de-
scription.
