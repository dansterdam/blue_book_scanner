No. 221; Described exactly as that in No. 223, only at an altitude
of 13,500 foot Mean Sea Level, 7,000 feet above the earth. Seen 2 1/2
hours after scheduled balloon release time. Wind at levels from 10,000
to 15,000 was WNW while flare was reported as travelling at very high
speed in a WSW direction. Very accurate observation made by two F.B.I.
agents. Definitely not a weather balloon.
