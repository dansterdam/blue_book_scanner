Incident #17 -- Mt. Rainier, Washington -- 24 June 1947

There appears to be no astronomical explanation for this
classic incident, which is the prototype of many of the later flying
saucer stories.

It is impossible to explain this incident away as sheer
nonsense, if only credence at all is given to Mr. ******* integrity.
However, certain inconsistencies can be pointed out in the facts as
reported.

Mr. ******* attention was first drawn to the objects by a
bright flash on his plane, which was followed by numerous other similar
flashes. If these were scattering like the flash one gets from a dis-
tant mirror, it means that the reflection was specular, or direct.
For a direct reflection, the angle between the observer, sun,
and object must be "just right," and at such distances as 20 or 25 miles,
the chance of a series of direct reflections is extremely small. If
the object was a diffuse reflector -- that is, scattering the sunlight
falling on it, much as the moon or a balloon does -- then at such a
distance it seems quite unlikely that Mr. ******* would have been
startled, or that our attention would have been called to it, unless
the objects reflecting were extremely large.

The supersonic speeds called for in the estimated distance
is correct also throw suspicion on the original calculations; by
computation (see below) it can be seen that, considering the detail
which Arnold observed in the objects, at least one of his estimates
