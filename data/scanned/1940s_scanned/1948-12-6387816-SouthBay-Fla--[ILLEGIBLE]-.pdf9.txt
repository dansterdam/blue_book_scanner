Incldt.#229 -- South Bay, Florida -- 15 December 1948
#250 -- Riviera Beach, Florida -- 11 December 1948

There seem to be two separate observations reported in this incident, and the information given for each is entirely insufficient for adequate analysis.

In #229, the location of the object in the sky
given for its color of observation, the moon and Jupiter
visible in the early evening, its non quite high and western
setting, in the west. One might hazard a guess at Jupiter or
through a variable mist or high, thin clouds; someone is
blazed up and died out. The large planets often become momentarily 
conspicuous when they are very near the horizon and the weather 
conditions are right.

#250 occurred at dusk, with the observer's looking out
over the ocean. The Moon-Full moon was fairly high in the 
southern sky at this time; there might possibly by some 
confusion between it and the object observed, if weather conditions
were unusual.
