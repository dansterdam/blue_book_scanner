9 November 1948

At 1850 hours, 8 November 1948, I was standing just outside hangar 
#7 at Newark Air Force Base, on the south side of the hangar. It was a
perfectly clear night. I looked up toward the moon and noticed a pale
luminous object race across the sky. It was about 1/3 the brightness of
the moon, round like a disc, with little or no depth (thickness) to it.
It appeared to be about the same relative diameter as the moon. It
traveled from the north northwest in an arc toward the south southeast.
In about one second or less, passing out of sight over another hangar.
I heard no sound from the object. I estimate the speed of the object at
800 miles per hour, and its altitude at five to six thousand feet. I
have seen jet aircraft make tactical approaches at this field at approx-
imately 600 miles per hour, and judging from them, the speed of the
object I sighted was at least 200 miles an hour faster. From where I
stood, I could see approximately 75% of the path of the object. The
peak of its arc was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon to the
west southwest of my position.
