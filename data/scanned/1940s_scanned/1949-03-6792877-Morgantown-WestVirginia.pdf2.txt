DETAILS:

AT MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA

1. On 3 May 1949, ****** ****** Morgantown, W.Va., was interviewed and stated in substances that at approximately 2100 to 2130 hours on 15 March 1949, he was in his back yard looking at the sky checking weather conditions as was his nightly habit. He was standing approximately half way between his garage and the rear door of his house looking toward the north, when he observed a single round flat object resembling the cover of a gabled can, or a barrel top, moving south of Morgantown moving in trees on his sky toward Greenmont, Va., at a terrific speed. The object appeared to be approximately 18 inches in diameter at an estimated distance of about 20 miles and an angle of 15Â° above the horizon. It was yellowish in color, comparable to the color of the moon. The object travelled from Northeast to Southwest and was in sight for two or three seconds before it disappeared into the distance. The object sounded like a sky rocket reaching the peak of a climb and expending its power. There was no odor discernible. It left a yellowish, tapering trail estimated to be 20 to 30 feet long or about the length of a telephone pole. This trail was comparable to the flame of a poorly constructed gas.

The object travelled on this visible trail which was brightly filled with the yellowish flame. There were no projections and the object maintained straight and level flight with its flat surface on a horizontal plane. There were no clouds and the sky was clear with the stars and moon discernible.

2. Mr. ****** stated that on 28 March 1949 at approximately 2100 to 2115 hours he was again in his back yard making his usual weather observations when he sighted another object in the same vicinity and angle from the horizon as the one previously sighted on 15 March 1949. This object was shaped like a flattened funnel, with a reddish gold tint and appeared to be about 5 feet across at altitude. The tunnel estimated the object would cover an area of two city blocks on the ground. Following approximately the same route, was observed approximately the same length of time, and gave off the same sound as the object previously sighted. There was no odor. It left a persistent dark red trail similar to that previously sighted. There were no projections. The object maintained straight and level flight and disappeared into the distance. There was no effect on the clouds motioned. The weather was clear, average conditions prevailed. ****** could not compare sizes with any object at arms' length but insisted on his own estimates as to size and altitude.

3. ****** stated he was born 12 November 1902 at Mooresville, W. Va. He is the owner of a real estate business and from 1917 to 1947 was Disbursing Auditor for home, and belongs to several business men's clubs. He enjoys outdoor sports such as golf, riding and shooting and collects firearms as a hobby. Mr. ****** further stated that he often flies by commercial aircraft and has used this means of transportation practically all over the United States. He reads and studies considerably about astronomy and is satisfied that neither of the objects were an astronomical phenomenon. ****** stated that because he feared he might be ridiculed he did not report the sighting for a week and has not even yet told his wife.
