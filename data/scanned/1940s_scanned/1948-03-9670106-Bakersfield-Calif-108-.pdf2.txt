Incident #1088 - Bakersfield, California -- 8 March 1948

It is extremely unlikely that this object was of 
astronomical origin. See report on incident #106.

Although the hour of observation is not stated in 
the witness's report of incident #107, it is possible, judging
by the information which is given, that #107 and #108 refer to
the same object or objects.
