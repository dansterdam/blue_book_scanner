11. In accordance with instructions from Dr. La Paz on 5 Febru-
ary 1949, in Lemessa, Texas, a trip was made to Amherst, Texas, for the
purpose of interviewing Master *****, the ten (10) year old son of
Mr. W. DUFFY, President of the First National Bank, Amherst, Texas. At
interview with this family confirmed the fact that young DUFFY had wit-
nessed the aerial phenomena, with the added information that he had
heard a rumbling noise emanating from it. The best description expressed
by this ten year old boy was its similarity to a shot roll of thunder.
No other member of this family had seen or heard anything out of the or-
dinary prior to explosion and when the shot was heard by various citizens
within this locality. Information made that the boy was playing outdoors
on the day of this day during the observation, to assume position when he
observed this light was facing South. A highway running North and
South is located about a mile and a half to the West of his home. An
railroad was observed South of his home. Approximately thirty (30)
other persons questioned in this small town had not seen or heard any-
thing with the exception of MR. ***** Clark, First National
Bank, Amherst, Texas. MR. ***** stated that she was in a car heading
South about twenty (20) miles north of Amherst at this time when she
observed this light and judging its direction it was ENE to SSW South
of her. An interrogation of MR. ***** elicited information identical
to the description of the phenomenon. and ***** corroborated report-
er's of ***** who was in the car and also witnessed this light. No
sound was heard by these persons.
