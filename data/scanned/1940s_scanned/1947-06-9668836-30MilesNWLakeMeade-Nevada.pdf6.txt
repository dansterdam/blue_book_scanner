The image shows a page of typewritten text and what appears to be a sketch or representation of a landscape with a curving line, possibly meant to depict the horizon with some hills or mountains. It's difficult to discern any clear details due to the quality of the image.

I will now provide the text as an OCR output:

On 28 June 47 ******* in a P-51 bound for Portland, Oregon, by way of
Medford, Oregon, at approx 1515 CST (course of 300°) and ground speed of
285 MPH, altitude 10,000 ft, approximately 30 miles NW of Lake Meade, Nevada,
Lt ******* sighted 5 or 6 white, circular objects at 10,000 ******* altitude
approximately 6,000 ft, on a course of 120° and flying at an estimated speed
of 285 MPH. The objects were flying very smoothly and in a close formation.
The estimated size of the white objects was approximately 36" in diameter.
Lt ********* was sure the white objects were not birds since the rate of
closure was very fast. He was certain too that the white objects were not
jets or conventional aircraft since he has flown both.

AGENT'S NOTES:

Lt ********* was very sincere in the explanation and was not the exaggerating
type. He merely stated what he saw and drew no conclusions.
