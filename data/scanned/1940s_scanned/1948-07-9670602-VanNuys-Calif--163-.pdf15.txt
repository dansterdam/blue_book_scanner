STATEMENT

Statement made by Mr. ******, Former Consultant, Department of
Water and Power, Van Nuys, California; Home Address: **** **** **, *****
Concord San Francisco, 1230 hours, 27 June 52, concerning objects
sighted in the sky, 22 July 1947, in the vicinity of San Fernando Valley,
California:

"On the evening of 22 July 1947, between the hours of 11:30 and 2030,
my wife and I were having dinner in the patio of our home. Our attention
was called to a moving object in the sky by some children playing in the
street. Originally, this object was quite steady. And as we watched, this
object was attracted by other persons to a strange object in the sky almost
directly overhead.

DESCRIPTION: It appeared to be round and probably spherical. At sunset, it
seemed to be a weather balloon. At about 20,000 feet in the sky was a bit
of a silvery looking object. The sun was below the range of the top of
the object and just put this object in good silhouette. It was round. At
while, I considered maybe saucer size (?). Wasn't too bright to be not a star.
It had no lights whatever. It was quite steady and then such brightness or
color gradually changed to an orange color at one end and finally appeared off
altogether when you saw the full object at twilight. It was looking pretty
well. It looked about the size of one (not distinguishable) maybe less or more
(Perhaps a commercial airplane at 25,000 feet. It was the size of a dime
held at arm's length or such a round object against the sky.) No attachments,
no tail, just a clear edge and silhouette against (not sunglasses or the clothing)
the air was very clear with visibility unlimited; ground temperature about
70-75 deg(rees) dropping to about 60 degrees an hour after dark (two hour
time lapse); direction of travel was from East directly toward the sun.

ADDITIONAL INTERROGATION OF MR. ****** AGAINST NOTES M. SPROUL

MR. SPROUL: Can you estimate the geographical location when you first
sighted the object?

MR. ******: Directly over Van Nuys, about 25-30 or 30 degrees as it traveled.

MR. SPROUL: Approximately what was the time when you first sighted this
object?

MR. ******: I didn't know the exact hour, but it was about an hour be-
fore sundown.

MR. ******: Non-commissioned member of a crew at the nearby station.

MR. SPROUL: What was the size of the object as it first appeared on the edge
of sight?
