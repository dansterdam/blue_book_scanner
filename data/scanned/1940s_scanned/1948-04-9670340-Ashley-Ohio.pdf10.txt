UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT, SKY.                                                        13 April 1948

(2)      On 12 April 1948, Reverend [blackout], Pastor of [blackout]
[blackout] [blackout] [blackout], [blackout], Delaware, Ohio was
interviewed and stated in substance:

On Thursday, 8 April 1948, at approximately 2:30 PM, Mrs. [blackout]
our next door neighbor, came to the door and told us to come out and see
the strange phenomenon in the sky. We went into the backyard and saw this
strange object in the sky, a little south of west from our house. There
was only one object and main part seemed to be spherical with a small
protrusion above it, like vapor streaks. It was very white and looked like
a concentrated bit of cloud except it was clearly outlined. The weather
was clear, the sun was shining, and there were no clouds near the object
although there was a bank of clouds to the south of us at quite a distance.
I would judge the object was up several thousand feet but I cannot be sure
because I could not tell whether it was above or below cloud level. I
also could not determine its size as I could not tell whether it was
a small object near us or a large object far away, as I had nothing to
compare it with. I would judge, however, that it could not have been less
than 5 feet in width. The wind was blowing the trees and clouds from a
westerly direction and the object was travelling away from us, not too fast,
almost due west into the wind. It traveled in a straight line and did not
maneuver. I could not hear any sound from it and I could not see any
exhaust trail of any kind. We watched it for at least ten minutes until it
disappeared from our view behind the trees.
