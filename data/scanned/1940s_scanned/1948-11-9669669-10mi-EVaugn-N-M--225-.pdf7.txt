SUMMARY OF INFORMATION
     The following information has been received from the Fourth Army Intelligence Liaison Officer, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dated 6 December 1948:

"Colonel [REDACTED] Inf., U.S. Army, New Mexico Military District reports as follows:
     "On 3 or 4 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I observed a ball
of light, reddish tint in color, I put it in disappear, rolling vertically. The
ball burst 1000-2000 feet from the ground in a spray of golden color which
extinguished before reaching the ground. This occurred at 12-1500 yards north
of the road on which I was driving. The location was approximately two miles
east of Vaughn, New Mexico, on a highway to (B-2)

     "On 23 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I was driving west
of Highway 60, about 10 miles west of Vaughn, New Mexico. I observed a ball
of light, descending vertically, which burst 1000-2000 feet from the ground.
The conditions and appearance were the same as occurred on 3 or 4 November." (B-2)

"Colonel [REDACTED] stated that he did not report these incidents as he thought
they might have been connected with some Air Force exercises. He further
states that he heard no sound or saw no streaks during either incident,
which is understandable as he was travelling in a closed automobile, weather
conditions were clear." (B-2)
