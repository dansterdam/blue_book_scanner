Mr. [Redacted] is of average intelligence and character
but could have easily been mistaken in plane identification
except for the fact "there was no sound." As the description
description was that of conventional type aircraft. As it was not possible
to determine the date of sighting exactly, it is not known whether any
aircraft of this type supposedly observed, were in the vicinity at the time,
which might have accounted for this sighting.

Dear Sirs: I was awake last night about 5:00 A. M. - sitting by the
window gazing up at the stars when suddenly there came into view,
flying east to west over the Charles River Basin, three fast-flying
single-engine planes. The planes had no lights - but city lights
made them visible like three pale moths. The two outside ones going
in a straight line, the middle one weaving back and forth - although
at no great height. There was no sound."
