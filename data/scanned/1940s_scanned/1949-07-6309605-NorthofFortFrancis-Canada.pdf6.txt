Synopsis

Dr. and Mrs. [name redacted] of Decatur, Indiana, 
were intervied on 15 August 1949, and stated that they had seen an
unidentified aerial object which they thought to be a flying saucer. The
sighting took place 1 July 1949 on [highway 70 about fifty to seventy-five (50-
75) miles north of Ft. Francis Ontario, Canada. The object was described
as silvery gray in color, flying in a westerly direction and was in sight
for about five (5) seconds. No vapor trails or protruding objects were
noted. No sound heard. Dr. [name redacted] opined the object he called
flying saucer may have some connection with the current polio epidemic
prevalent throughout the United States. His basis for this reasoning was
the assertion that of all his polio patients, he could not be certain that
they did in reality, have polio. All however, evidenced symtoms of Uranium
poisoning. Tablulation of myling source sighting from the available sources
of the Indianapolis Star and the Indianapolis News, reveals that the majority
of sighting took place in July and August for the years 1947, 1948 and 1949.
A responsible medical authority, confidential informant, CI-1, advised that
the theory is "interesting" and worthy of further research.
