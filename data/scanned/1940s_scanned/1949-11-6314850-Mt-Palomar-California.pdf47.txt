Mr. █████ showed the visitors a newspaper clipping, where he had
addressed a local Chamber of Commerce at a luncheon meeting, narrating one
or two stories of his unusual observations of flying saucers. When he asked
the gentlemen present if any of them had ever observed similar objects, fully
25 or 30 of the members present acknowledged immediately that they had seen
similar objects, but had been reluctant to report them for fear people would
think they were "off the beam."
