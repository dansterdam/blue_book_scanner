Incident No. 56 â€” 4 August 1947, Sunset, near Bethel, Alaska.

A pilot and his co-pilot observed a black object of the design and approximate dimensions of a C-54, Fuselage, flying at 300-XXX feet altitude. The object crossed their path at right angle, and they pulled up to 1200 ft to avoid a collision, when object did the same, and lost sight of it in four minutes. They estimated the speed of object to be 300 miles per hour, due to the short existing distance one: if speed to be correct, elimantary calculations deduce- Assuming the estimates of traveled as 35 miles in four minutes while the observers aerplane moved eleven miles in the same period. Therefore, the object was more than twenty miles distant when last seen. To be capable of being seen at this distance under the conditions given, the object would have to be about 50 feet in its smallets or end-on dimension. If this were true, and the object was proportionate with a C-54 fuselage, its lentgh would be about 300 Ft. Assuming the estimate of speed to be incorrect, but time in sight to be correct, the object is figured in reverse, visan, as a reasonable width to 50 ft. in aerplane the point would have been less than ten miles away when lost to view; it therefore, would have traveled about eighteen miles in four minutes, giving a speed of less than 300 MPH.

A.C. Opinion: It is believed that the pilots were suddenly startled by a conventional aircraft crossing their path, and that as they gave chase to this aircraft which was "silhouetted against a brilliant evening sky", they were partially blinded, and were therefore unable to discern wings or engines.
