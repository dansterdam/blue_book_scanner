1. Reference is made to your letter (373-0 Mee 350.05) dated 
9 February 1949, subject, "Semi-monthly intelligence report" concern-
ing sighting of light phenomenon by Captain -----, 24 January 1949.

2. According to astronomical authorities the phenomenon described
by Captain ----- coincides exactly with the appearance of aurora
borealis (northern lights) as seen at latitudes as far south as Bermuda.

3. The newspaper article "Northern Lights are Seen Here" will
give valuable aid, as these lights are quite visible on 24
January beginning at a time close to that when Captain ----- first
saw his phenomenon. Furthermore, this lights were seen in a line of
direction from Bermuda will passes through or near the position where
Captain ----- estimates his light too have been located when
last seen.

4. It is requested that a transcript of entries from the log
of Hamilton meteorological station for the nite in question be for-
warded to this Command, attention: ----.

5. Request further that Captain ----- and his crew be inter-
viewed to determine whether the appearance of images on the iint-
mass could have been illusory caused, possibly, by a combination of
cloud and water reflection at the time in question.

6. Our copies of "Guide to Investigational" are forwarded to aid
in properly the desired information.

The text also includes official headings, reference numbers, and standard military communication formatting typical of formal correspondence from that era. The document is related to a sighting of what was apparently identified as the Northern Lights, and there is an instruction to investigate further by questioning witnesses and reviewing meteorological data. The document has been marked "UNCLASSIFIED." It also features some redaction of names, likely for privacy reasons.
