There is a photograph present in the document. It appears to be a series of simple sketches, not a photograph, showing four different shapes that represent the different phases of an object, presumably a UFO, as described by the witness. The shapes are oval or disc-like.

Here's the text from the document:

4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

(1) On 11 August 1948, *****, attorney, ***** ***** Street, Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed and stated in substance:

On 2 August 1948, at approximately 1945 hours, my wife called to me to come out into the yard at *****, Columbus, Ohio, in order to observe a strange sight in the sky. The atmosphere was clear, visibility excellent and the heavens were without cloud or haze. I saw a single object, round in shape, which appeared to be about twenty to thirty feet in diameter, and moving in a southerly direction from the North, over the center of the City of Columbus. The object had a constant gray-black perimeter while the center was transparent. The like sky could be observed through the transparent center. The object, while it moved at a constant and slow speed, (maybe 10 miles from the object to location in five minutes, and then immediately made eleven or twelve mph), did not seem to traverse. The smoke or thin graying passed, and I did not observe it again during the ten or fifteen minutes I followed it with my eye. In its movement, the object changed positions, not the direction of travel, three times. Upon first seeing the object, evidently a solid or almost presented, which was a parallelism in one object. Over its position altered and it became circular in form, only to revert, after a time, to its original form. The object may have traveled five or six miles until I lost sight of it. I cannot estimate the height at which the object traveled; however, I judge it to have been between twelve hundred and two thousand feet above the ground. The object appeared to be traveling about fifteen miles an hour and made no noise of any kind. The evening was still and the neighborhood was quiet while the object was under observation.

Agents Note: ***** drew the following sketches:
[There are four sketches representing the object's phases labeled "Fourth", "Third", "Second", and "First".]
