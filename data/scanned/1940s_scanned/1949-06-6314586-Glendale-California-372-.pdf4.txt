Mr. Moorehead stated that Commander ___________ Submarine Commander 11 Naval

size of a Douglas DC-4 Aircraft) round object in the air approximately four miles
southeast of her home in the direction of San Diego, California. Mrs. ______
judged it was about four thousand feet in the air and moving rapidly away from her.
Mrs. Selby stated "It was definitely not a jet aircraft although it's speed was
more in keeping with a jet than the more conventional aircraft". The description
was, according to Mrs. _______ "brChrome plated and it threw much brighter 
than the ordinary aircraft". Mrs. _______ further stated there was definitely no
protrusions (such as wings or visible stabilizers) as the object turned in a wide
arc away from her. When queried regarding smoke or vapor trails Mrs. _______

Mrs. ________ is approximately thirty years of age, intelligent and
