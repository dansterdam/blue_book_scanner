          1. The following report is submitted from information re-
ceived by this Officer from 1st Lt. ██████████, S-2 Officer,  
563th Fighter Group (Jet), this station.

          a. At 2320 hours, local time, on 23 November 1948,
Captain ███████, 23rd Fighter Squadron, saw an object in the
air directly east of FURSTENFELDBRUCK (M 49/Y 65) at an unknown
altitude. The object, observed by Capt. ████████ from the ground,
looked like a 90 lumen star and was moving in a Southerly direction
across MUNICH (M 49/Z 85), turning slightly to the South-East and
then South-East. The speed could have been between 300 and 500
MPH, though the actual speed could not be estimated according to
Capt. ████████.

          b. Capt. ███████ called FURSTENFELDBRUCK (M 49/Z 65) Base
Operations from █████ barracks and informed them of the sighting.
Base Operations then notified Rottenburg DF Station who stated that
they heard nothing on the scope but would look. Traceboard in Base
Operations BACK stated that they picked up an unidentified
object at 27,000 feet altitude, about thirty (30) miles south of
MUNICH. Traceboard later called Capt. ████████ at his barrack and
informed him that the object was climbing and was then observed
to be at 40,000 feet altitude, about forty (40) miles south of
MUNICH and was orbiting (circling).

          2. The weather conditions at this time (2320 local) were;
clear; a three-quarter moon shining; no cloud layers; visibility, 3 miles
with ground fog; winds aloft, from North 56 Kmos an hour.

          3. There were no P-80's (Jets) flying on this night.

          4. Both the █████████ and Capt. █████████████ reg-
ularily enlisted airman and are experienced.
