UNCLASSIFIED

Incident 285 -- near Mountain Home, Idaho -- 4 February 1949

There is clearly no astronomical explanation for this
incident.

The account given seems trustworthy, even though only
one person saw two circular disks. This report differs from many
others in that the description of maneuvers described by the object
is, elliptic, rather than flat.
