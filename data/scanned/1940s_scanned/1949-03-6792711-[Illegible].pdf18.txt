The image does not contain a photograph of any recognizable subjects; instead, it appears to be a technical drawing or diagram with annotations and measurements. The image quality is quite poor, which makes the text difficult to decipher. However, I will provide the text that can be identified to the best of the ability:

- 7 Min
- 8-65
- NO. OF OBS. 1 A/C [There might be more text following "A/C" but it is unreadable]
- AZ 190° ELEV 6°
- AZ 151° - 147° ELEV 6°
- [There are several annotations related to angles and elevations like "27° ELEV" and "17° ELEV", but they are incomplete and not fully legible.]

Please note that due to the low resolution and quality of the image, exact transcription is challenging, and some of the text may not have been captured accurately.
