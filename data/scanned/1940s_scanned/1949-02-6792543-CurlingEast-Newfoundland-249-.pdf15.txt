Comments of interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer

Rated as reliable and trustworthy by police and employers.  Taxi owner,
Mr. _______, knew him for three years, and says same as foregoing.
Worked for Mr. ________, foreman of Bowaters Company, for approximately
ten (10) years.  Reliable and of good character.  Investigator notes observer
is very confident of his sighting; says he could have described it better
if we had contradicted him right after he reported it.  His intelligence
quotient would be quite low.

Did observer wear glasses, especially polaroid glasses at the time of sight-
ing or was object viewed through canopy, window, or other transparent
