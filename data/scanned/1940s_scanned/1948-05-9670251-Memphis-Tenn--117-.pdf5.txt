Supplement II to Trip Report to Wris.t Virginia. Visit with
Dr. Paul Herget of the Observatory of Cincinnati, Ohio.

SUBJECT: DR. [REDACTED]

1. A visit was made in an effort to ascertain the possibility
and the probability of individuals to see high meteors during daylight
hours with the unaided eye. Dr. Herget stated that such sighting was
a very rare occurrence and when it did take place it almost invariably
occurred in the afternoon with the observer looking toward the west.
This time and position assured the most suitable conditions for observa-
tion because of the resultant light conditions in a similarly position
shaped monoroid body with an east and west traveling time relatively slow
an a meteor would appear as a black body for a period of two
to four seconds. Dr. Herget expressed serious doubts that 50 or more
objects observed 7 May 1949 in Ohio were meteors. He was unable,
however, to offer any explanation as to a possible identification of the
objects.

2. Dr. Herget suggested that Dr. Hynek at Ohio State University
and Dr. Lincoln Lardz of the University of New Mexico be contacted. The
former is supposedly working on a project for the Air Force in an
attempt to discover the possibility of an object being mistaken for day-
light hours. The latter, according to Dr. Herget, is a recognized
authority on meteors.
