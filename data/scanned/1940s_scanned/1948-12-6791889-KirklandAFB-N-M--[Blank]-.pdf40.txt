2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 have been checked against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau, and the based on this review are included.

3. It is recommended that the “Guide to Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Objects” be changed as follows: Item 15, “Direction of Flight of Object,” should be clarified so that vertical and horizontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is specified as the direction toward which the object appears to move. “Relative to Radar Sittings” should provide a statement of the type of radar set used.
