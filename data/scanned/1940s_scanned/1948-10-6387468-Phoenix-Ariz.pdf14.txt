I am writing to you in hopes that you may be able to surmise what
the disturbance might have been and also to let you have what informa-
tion we could gather. As a correspondent for one of the press servi-
ces I was naturally interested in it. I am further interested in
your comments on it, even though I realize that the information is not
complete enough to make any deductions possible.

Do you have an observer for your meteor society in the Valley?
I would be interested in having his name if you do.

Thank you for your time and interest in this matter.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
