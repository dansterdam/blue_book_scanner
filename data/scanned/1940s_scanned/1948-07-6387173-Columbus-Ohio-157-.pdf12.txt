Incident #165 -- Columbus, Ohio -- 31 July 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.

If the information offered is to be given any weight at all, the most likely explanation is that a cluster of balloons, or a balloon with several fire-pots hanging below it, was observed.

Corroboration for this interpretation is pronounly furnished by incidents #165 and 157, which occurred a few hours later near this location. The object reported in #157 proved to be a "county-fair" type balloon.
