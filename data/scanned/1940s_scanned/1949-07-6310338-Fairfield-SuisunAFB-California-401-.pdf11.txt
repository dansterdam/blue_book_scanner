UNCLASSIFI.                              16 July 1949

SUBJECT: Report of Observation of Phenomena. 

TO: Commanding General
Headquarters 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing
Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base
California.

ATTN: Security Officer.

1. The following is a report of an observation made from the
Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base control tower on 16 July 1949 between the
hours 0500 and 0520 pst.

2. At approximately 0500, 16 July 1949, T/Sgt Vita, the control
tower operator on duty, asked me to go up in the tower to observe this
particular phenomenon. Upon arriving in the tower Vita told me position
to look with the seven power binoculars available and asked what I saw.
The position was approx. 215 deg. mag and approx. 3 to 5 deg. elevation.
At an altitude that I would judge to be well above 35,000 ft. and at an
undetermined distance, but further than 100 miles, there appeared to be
a very large sphere, of unknown size and composition. The sun was just
coming above the horizon and the sphere seemed to reflect the sunlight
much the same as the aluminum skin of an aeroplane. There was no apparent
motion to the sphere although the winds above 35,000 ft are usually quite
strong and westerly. The sphere remained under observation until 0520 when
it was obscured by a layer of haze, at about 3,000 ft, over the Vallejo
area.

3. The weather at the time was clear with 20 miles visibility except
for a fog bank over the hills between Cordelia and Vallejo and a thin
haze layer, base 3-4,000 ft over the San Pablo Bay.
