The image provided appears to be a scanned page of a map or aerial photograph with overlay annotations, rather than a clear photograph or an image of any UFOs. It is labeled "SHEET 4747 IV SW" and indicates that it is part of the "A.M.S. SERIES V882."

Since the image is not easy to read, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) may not be accurate. Nevertheless, below is an attempt to reproduce the text visible on the document to the best of my ability. Some of the numbers and labels might be coordinates and annotations corresponding to the map:

The rest of the information is not legible due to the quality of the scan and the scale of the map with overlaid details. It seems to include additional coordinates and possibly topographical information.
