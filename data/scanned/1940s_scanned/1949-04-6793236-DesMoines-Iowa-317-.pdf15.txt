Gentleman;-

I hope, sincerely, you do not think I am boring you with my occasional and small contributions.

I jest very badly about Shallett mentioning my little theory regarding the "saucers". He certainly had not asked my permission, and I really believe it gave the reader the impression that one takes his life, and reputation in his hands to dare write you in confidence. Is it so bad the chap he usually puts in ridicule by "quotin" is, Shallett is the Sat--- who covers up "little green men" who, he is to believe is observing is do quite small, as to be looking in on him and joking attitude that Foster's writer Shallett inaugurated in the "Fiasco scientist" who you can leave the flying Saucers. Paxton made my "observation" into "startleling" and made it appear that I had forgotten to be gone over with "them"... Stylishly, a stickler for accuracy, I had checked and rechecked my letter before I submitted it to the Post.

As things now stand, I am a martyr to my convictions, and only time will indicate we. Eilson you my I, as timely hold today, as I did when I first wrote you in "19" '47, that the "saucers" are extra-terrestrial "ghost-objects", propelled by a telekinetic energy and caused to remain stationary in mid-air by vibration, - hence the title of this magazine has the assurers; but FATE, 133 n. Clark Street, Chicago 1, Illinois, will print my article "The Mystery of Sor Releyo's" Last, "terrestrially or plutial to appear in the October 1949 issue, I have, in that article, sum- d up Mr. Harry Price's findings relative to the Paranormal, phenife- manifested in the Borley Rectory hauntings, and you will see my belief SOcialists in the therein.

You may use the enclosed material.

Sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]
