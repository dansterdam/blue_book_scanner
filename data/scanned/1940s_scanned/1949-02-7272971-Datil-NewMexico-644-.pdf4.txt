The image appears to be a high-contrast black and white photograph, potentially taken at night or during low-light conditions. It shows what looks to be a solid black background with wavy white lines on the left and bottom edges, suggesting the edge of a landscape or horizons, or possibly an artifact from the photo development process. In the center of the photo, there is a small, faint, white dot or light source.
