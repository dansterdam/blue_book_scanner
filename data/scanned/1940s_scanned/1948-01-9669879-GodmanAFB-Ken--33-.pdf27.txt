"All this time the weather observer at Godman Field was spotting the
object with a Theodolite and keeping a record of times, elevations and
azimuths.

"St Louis ATC advised of an article printed in the "Edwardsville Intel-
ligencer", Edwardsville, Illinois, describing an object, over the town at
0720C, of aluminum appearance without apparent wings or control surfaces
which was moving southwest. This object remained visible for about 30 minutes.
This article went on to describe the amazement and wondering of the editor
regarding this object - and you can bet that he was no more confused than I
am at this moment."
