to make a sketch of the craft at this time, but apparently didn't seem satis-
fied with his efforts and requested this agent to call back the next morning for
the sketch. Mr. GASS displayed the binoculars he used to observe the objects.
They bore the following information: "Monarch, Made in Tokyo, Japan, 6 x 25,
6163".

4. This agent requested Mr. GASS to accompany him to the location where
the strange object was supposed to have landed, and tentative arrangements were
made. It was agreed that Mr. GASS would call this agent the next morning (24
June 1949) when he was ready to proceed to that vicinity.

5. On 23 June 1949, after conducting the above interview with Mr. GASS,
this agent made a check of the Bureau of Identification and Records, Toledo
Police Department, Toledo, Ohio. Records revealed that RALPH K. GASS, 812
North Erie Street, Toledo, Ohio was listed as AWOL from the U. S. Navy on
30 October 1947. Filed with the records were fingerprints card and S. S.
Navy circular requesting arrest as a deserter offering $50.00 reward and
stating his serial number as 7230126. Also filed was another Navy circular
giving that RALPH K. GASS was apprehended 20 December 1947 by the U. S.
Navy. Records also revealed that RALPH K. GASS was born 26 August 1924 at
Toledo, Ohio.

6. At approximately 0300 hours, 24 June 1949, Mr. GASS made a telephone
call to the Lorraine Hotel, 12th & Jefferson Streets, Toledo, Ohio and informed
this agent that he would not be able to accompany the agent as requested since
he had broken the compass to his drawing set and would not be able to replace
it until the next morning. At this time Mr. GASS inquired whether it would be
suitable to wear "dungarees" on the previously mentioned trip to the island
where the objects were supposed to have landed.

7. On 24 June 1949, at 0830 hours this agent again contacted RALPH K.
GASS by telephone at his residence, 812 North Erie Street, Toledo, Ohio and
informed Mr. GASS that it would be impossible to make the trip to the vicinity
where the strange objects were supposed to have landed. During the convers-
ation this agent asked Mr. GASS if he had been able to make a sketch of the
object he claimed to have seen and Mr. GASS replied that he hadn't, but that
he could have one ready by 1130 hours that day.

8. On 24 June 1949, this agent interviewed Mr. L. E. GREER, Training
Specialist, Veteran's Administration, 501 Huron Street, Toledo 4, Ohio regard-

status in the Navy from 10 November 1942 to 3 December 1947 and had spent
