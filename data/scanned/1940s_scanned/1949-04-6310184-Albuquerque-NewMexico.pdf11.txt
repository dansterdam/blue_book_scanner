Please note that due to the quality of the scan some of the text may not have been accurately transcribed, and some numbers or letters may not be clear. The map appears to show grid sections with numbers, likely referencing particular map coordinates or areas. Certain terms like "FORT BLISS," "MILITARY AREA," "MILITARY PRESERVATION," "CITY Park," and geographical features such as "MT. FRANKLIN" and "SUGARLOAF MOUNTAIN" are noted which might reference real locations in Texas. The numbers present in the grid could refer to elevation details, coordinates, or map section identifiers.
