Incident #207, a, b, c -- Andrews Air Base, Camp Springs, Maryland---
18 November 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for the objects observed
in this incident.

The similarity of this incident to #172 is striking, and it
suggests a common origin for the objects. The two incidents were sepa-
rated by a month and a half and by half a continent. The hours of ob-
servation were about the same. It may be significant that ground ob-
servers in each incident did not report the evasive tactics described
by air observers, and it is tempting to hazard the guess that such tac-
tics were largely the result of relative motion. It should be inves-
tigated whether a lighted balloon caught in the prop wash could give
the appearance of a rapidly-manoeuvring aircraft. In fact, this inves-
tigator believes that it would be an interesting experiment to have a
typical lighted balloon paced by aircraft at night, with a competent
observer along to record apparent relative tactics of the balloon.

(It is not clear whether the two observers in this incident
who reported evasive tactics were in the same plane, or not, but it is
presumed that they were.)
