Incident #120, a, b -- Heubliebs; NW USO, Germany -- 11 October 1948

The position of this object in the sky (northeast at an
altitude of 700) rules out any possible astronomical explanation.
The moon had not yet risen at the time.

The description appears to fit that of a hi-altitude
balloon.

Question: If there had bon "no release of airborne
weather equipment prior to or during sighting," where did the infor-
mation concerning winds aloft come from?
