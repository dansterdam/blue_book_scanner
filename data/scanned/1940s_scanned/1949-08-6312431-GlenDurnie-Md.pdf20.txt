On 22 August 1949, Mr. H. CLEVELAND LOGUE, 301 American Building, 
East Baltimore Street, Baltimore, Maryland, was interviewed by Special 
Agent SUNDSTAD in his office, and stated that he purchased fifty (50) 
shares of stock in the Gray Goose Airways, Inc. on 6 March 1936 from 
Mr. JONATHAN E. CALDWELL for the sum of $5.00. Mr. LOGUE stated that 
he purchased the stock directly from CALDWELL and that CALDWELL im- 
pressed him as having a genuine interest in his invention. In his op- 
inion CALDWELL was definitely not a "con" man.

On 22 August, Special Agent EDWARD S. LEONARD interviewed Mr. 
EDWARD F. DODD, Chief of the Aircraft Record Branch, Civil Aeronautics 
Authority, Washington, D. C. Mr. DODD made available to this agent three 
files of the CAA dealing with the Gray Goose Airways, Inc. A check of 
the first file revealed that on 12 January 1936 the Gray Goose Airways, 
Inc., 1103 Vermont Ave., Room 305, Washington, D. C., filed claim for 
license for a glider-type aircraft, powered by a Harley Davidson motor- 
cycle engine no propeller was utilized on this glider. The idea was to 
use the engine merely as a motivating device on the ground. CAA granted 
License No. 4308 to JONATHAN E. CALDWELL, President, Gray Goose Airways, 
Inc. for experimental purposes on this model. The file further revealed 
that MR JERRY J. KOFCZYK, 49 Collins Ave., Spring Valley, New York, 
purchased 150 shares of stock, at 10¢ per share, on 29 December 1932. 
The device was housed in a barn on Bell-Ans property at Orangeburg, New 
York. Photos News took pictures of the flight in 1933. Mr. KOFCZYK 
stated in a letter to the CAA that he believed CALDWELL was residing in 
Pearl River, New York, in 1934-1935.

CAA License No. 355V was granted to the Gray Goose, Inc., 3201 S. 
Columbine Street, P.O. Box 192, Denver, Colorado, for the construction 
of a single-place monoplane, powered by water cooled, 60 hp, Ford 
Model A engine. This plane was built in 1930. Mr. WILLIAM S. TUTTLE, 
former auditor for the Denver-Rio Grande Railroad, was listed as presi- 
dent of Gray Goose, Inc., JONATHAN E. CALDWELL, Secretary, and OLIVE 
CALDWELL, Vice-President.

License No. 99V was issued to Gray Goose Airways, Inc., 1225 New 
York Ave., Washington, D. C., for the manufacture of a disk rotor-plane, 
powered by a Model 9-AD, Specification No. 105040, 40 horsepower engine, 
manufactured by the Societe de Moteurs, System Canton-Unne, Billancourt, 
France. Propeller blades for the aircraft were fixed-wood type ALK-25, 
manufactured by the Aero-LATIN Klemm Company. A letter in this file 
indicated that a SARA McGILL, 925 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania, had purchased 428 shares of stock in the airplane at 10¢ 
per share. This rifle also contained a letter dated 3 September 1947 
from Mr. E. G. VANDERLIP, Patent Engineer, Fiesocki Helicopter Company, 
requesting information from the CAA as to who now had control and had 
invented the disk rotor-helicopter.
