Mr. Willard A. Driggers,
1530 Olive Street, N.E.,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. DRIGGERS:

Mrs. Olive Caldwell came to my office and offered to pay your claim provided you would accept installments of about fifty dollars each extending over a period of thirty days. This offer was made after much discussion about your owing rent for storage space in Washington and a few other minor details. She explained at some length the relative features of the entire matter. I was, however, successful in getting a payment of fifty dollars in cash from her and I am enclosing my check to you in the amount of Thirty Dollars which amount represents her payment, less my fee.

I am of the opinion she will return. I hope I am correct. If she does not, however, I will enter suit before the local Justice of the Peace as the payment had reduced the amount so as to bring it within the jurisdiction of the local civil court.

Yours very truly

/s/ John W. Looper
