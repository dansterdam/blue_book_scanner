No. 217. Object reported movin4 two miles of 200-300K velocity and going faster than C-47 doing 120 M.P.H. The speeding direction are apparently very accurate since the C-47 was paralleling this object's course and several soldiers crew cluding the pilots, saw the speed indicator. If report is true, definitely no balloon.

No. 216J No date ~iven, consequently no check could be made of surface or upper-air date. As stated by observer, & flare is probable answer.

No. 219. Time of sighting coincides within a few minutes of the release time of the USAF rawinsonde at Newburgh and the pilot balloon sounding at New York. Very little description, however the entire interpreted as either being a burning balloon or a star. One cant be certain was was that the object moved from west to east, an impossible situation for a balloon since wind at all levels were westerly.

No. 220. Wind at all levels N. to NW.; object reported flying directly into these winds. Also m&e definite turn from flying due Horth to North Northwest. Sighting time 1 1/2 hours after scheduled release times at Alameda, Sacramento and "O'callahan AFB.

No. 221. To informantior.

No. 222. Winds aloft charts not available on this cnse. Object sighted 2 1/2 hours after scheduled release - at which time it was plotted by a radar DP station to be at 27,000 A short time later the same station reported the object circling at 10,000; speed estimated at between 200-500 "M.P.H. Most likely not a balloon.

No. 223. Definitely not a scheduled release balloon since it was seen to pass by the ground crew here before hours time after the circling and was since from Yuma personnel a saw to two passing at its previous sighting. Seventeen individuals saw and reported this object as definitely a green flare. All commercial and government airfields questioned concerning balloon releases with no success.

No. 224. Described exactly as that in No. 223, only at an altitude of 13,500 feet then Sea Level, 1,000 foot above the earth. Seen 2 1/2 hours after scheduled balloon release time. Wind at levels from 10,000 to 15,000 was NNW while flare was reported as travelling at very high speed in a WSW direction. Very accurate observation made by two F.3.1. agents. Definitely not a weather balloon.

No. 225. No date ::iven. Object sighted within 15 minutes of release time of Pilot balloon soundings at Albuquerque at low altitude, 500 feet. Exploded in red spray at 200 feet. This exact phenomena occurred on three different occasions at the same time which would seem to eliminate possibility of burning; weather balloon.
