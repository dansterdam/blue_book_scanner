An Unidentified Flying Object
(Pie shaped mercur-like object)
hovered over the road - a short
distance west of Riverdale School
Dome shaped with a very white
surface that put off a soft glow
all of the round-and a red light at each
of the corners of a white
appearance on the under lip - the
round as to resemble the light
and construction. Not at all
continuing of this ring it descended,
but not following the road closely,
it swayed as a falling leaf would,
but travelled steadily on a straight
course, and not swerving
nor up and down as a leaf that
crosses the road. When they saw
direction approx. on the hwy when
they first sighted, but did not
cross road. Flew over the ground or
approached the river which the
road leads to but did not care
to make much of it. Not nervous
or excitable.
