Statement

1. On 26 August 1949 at approximately 1345 M.S.T., I was present at the Base Rockonde Building, T-446, Davis - Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona.

2. Up until 1345 M.S.T., I had been conducting a test on an upper air balloon run. The balloon had been released at approximately 1315 M.S.T. and I was able to follow it with the naked eye because of the clear sky weather which was present during that period of the day. At 1345 M.S.T., after the balloon had been in sight for thirty (30) minutes, my attention was attracted to some form of object flying in the sky; when the balloon. The path of flight of this object carried it directly across the balloon and was from the south-east to the north-west. I continued to follow the object as it proceeded to the north-west. I lost sight of the object after watching it for a little over a minute, and estimated my sight angle of elevation to be twenty four (24) degrees.
