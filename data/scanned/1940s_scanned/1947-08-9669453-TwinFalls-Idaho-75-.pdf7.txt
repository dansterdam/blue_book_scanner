With 12L incidents thus eliminated, there remains ultimately four 
which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation 
which satisfies this one only under the assumption that the evidence 
accepted as reliable and accurate. When psychological and physio-
logical factors are also considered, practically all of these incidents 
can be explained rationally, as pointed out by Lewis W. McCoy, assistant 
to Professor Hynek, Northwestern University Observatory (see Appendix 
and text).

There were sufficient psychological explanations for the genuine 
misunderstood flying objects to provide plausible explanations even 
for cases not otherwise explainable. These errors in identifying nat-
ural results would shortly free from inability to estimate speed, distance, 
size.

All of the remaining 12L incidents are treated in detail in the 
reports, so there is no clear cut pattern in regard to time of day, 
type of object, or manner of observation. These are incidents in which 
the object's sighting, were influenced by the earlier reports,
probably would not have been considered unusual or reported if 
there so publicity.

PROCESS GUIDE

Strategy of ATR Evaluation of Remaining Reports

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix H) exhibit 
no pattern characterizations. Two of them, by statements of the reporter 
and no new information of eyewitnesses not part of the ", 
families 

Incidents (Incidents 10, 17). Incidents distributed without pattern 
throughout the United States. A few were outside the U.S. The two 
descriptions of appearances or performances were exactly alike. The re-
ported sightings occurred at various times of day and years.

In the following section of this report, each remaining unidenti-
fied object is considered separately. E is not the intent to completely discount 
character of observations, but often there is undesirable elements, and these 
cases to be discriminated. The numerical designation is mainly the consequence 
order of the incidents in the project files.
