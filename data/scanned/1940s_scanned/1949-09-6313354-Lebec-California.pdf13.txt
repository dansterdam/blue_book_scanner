I, SGT
3538th Maintenance
Squadron, Mather Air Force Base, California, voluntarily make the following statement to A1C B.E. PENNINGTON, who has identified himself to me as a Special Agent, OSI, USAF:

On 5 September 1949, at approximately 1200 hours, while flying at approximately 7,000 feet enroute from Los Angeles to Sacramento, California, I sighted an object over Camp Oak Flat which was several thousand feet below us coming up with a terrific ascent headed approximately due south as if to go over Los Angeles. We were just rounding an 8,000 foot mountain and took him by surprise. He was coming up at about 8500. As he and coming up from a south hill foothills to the right of the large mountain along which he reached our altitude he held his hover for a time and changed course as if going out to sea over Santa Paula. I followed him with my eyes until he was out of sight. I could not detect any sign of power or controls as the shadows underneath prevented ite. It looked metal with a canopy on top with approximately 35 feet of span. There was no way to determine speed but the rate of climb was terrific.

I have read this statement consisting of one (1) page and have initialed each page thereof and all corrections thereto. This statement is given freely
