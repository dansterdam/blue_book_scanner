MORGANTOWN, W. VA.

April " "1949

Washington D.C.

Gentlemen;

Please be advised that recently I have seen two (2) of the so called "Flying saucers". The last one a week ago was much slower and nearer the earth than the first one. Both were going south-west, very, very fast. The general outline would resemble a flattened funnel.

I have not spoken to anyone about the incidents, because you have to see them, to believe that they exist. 

Yours very truly
[Redacted]

P.S. Reason for reporting I have not heard of any in this area, and assumed that these might be some of the first and in this case you could use the information.
