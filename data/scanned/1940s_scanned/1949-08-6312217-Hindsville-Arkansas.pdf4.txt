GUIDE TO INVESTIGATION (Cont'd)                 UNCLASSIFIE.
Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Re Radars now operating on ground

   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size
      of target

   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180 degrees),
      etc., and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not
      observable, how long did the target stay in the turn and
      what was its speed.

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into
      several targets upon approach.

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent
      with size of object; faint; fading, pulsating at regular rate?

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted:

   a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits?

   b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.

                     GENERAL

1. Teletype sequences of local weather conditions : Nearest weather
   station is located at Fayetteville, Arkansas, a distance of 22 miles
   southwest of Hindsville. All weather data of that office for 10 Aug 49
   Winds alcf't report: has been forwarded to US Weather Bureau,
                         Court House, Fort Worth, Texas.

   a. Adiabatic chart for period in question:

3. Local flight schedules of commercial, private, and military
   aircraft flying in vicinity at the time
   (Check Canadian activity if close to border.)
   No commercial airlines operate in the vicinity of Hindsville and normal
   air routes do not pass over that area. A small black airplane was
   observed flying over the area about 10 minutes after the sighting.
4. Possible releases of testing devices in vicinity sent aloft by
   Ordnnance Navy, Air Force, Army, Weather Units, (for release and
   tratc of lighted synoptic balloon and other information),
   Research Organizations or any others.
   Nearest release of weather balloons is at Tulsa, Oklahoma, a distance
   of approximately 125 miles west of Hindsville.
