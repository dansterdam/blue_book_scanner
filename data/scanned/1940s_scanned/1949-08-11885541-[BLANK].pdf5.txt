Incident No. 2 -- Hamilton Field, California -- 29 July 1947

The objects observed here were almost certainly not
astronomical; although their speed, size, and manner of dis-
appearance might tend to the aircraft hypothesis. The lack
of trail and the "tactics" pursued by the second object make
the likelihood of that interpretation very slight; however,
the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out if considerable
allowance is made for looseness in reporting.
