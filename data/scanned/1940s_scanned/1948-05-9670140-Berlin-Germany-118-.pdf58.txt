The image provided does not appear to contain any photographs. It seems to be a scanned page of text, but the quality of the scan is very poor, making it difficult to read the content accurately. I will attempt to transcribe as much text as I can discern:

The bottom right corner of the image shows a handwritten notation "19—", but the remainder is not discernible. Additionally, there appears to be another handwritten part that seems to read "29" or similar, but it is not clear and could be part of a different marking or annotation. The rest of the document is either obscured or illegible due to the quality of the scan.
