Dear Sgt. Moody:

Re: Mantell Case

I would like to thank you for forwarding us a copy of the Mantell case so promptly.

As I explained in our earlier telephone conversation we were interested in obtaining data on this case to compare it with a recent P-51 crash occurring in Oregon in which the pilot also apparently became hypoxic at an altitude of over 20,000 feet and dove into the ground. Since in this case the aircraft also disintegrated prior to impact the copies of the wreckage photos were particularly helpful.

We are assisting the Civil Aeronautics Board on this investigation and due to the similarity of certain points would like to obtain a second duplicate copy of this case for our record--I forwarded your earlier copy to the CAB. Secondly, we especially needed any medical information available concerning trauma to the pilot due to impact. This report was not complete since autopsy report, medical findings, and photos of the body of the pilot were not included.

We should particularly like to obtain these medical data. Please air mail if possible.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

Richard G. Snyder, Ph. D., AM-119
Acting Chief, Protection and Survival Branch
