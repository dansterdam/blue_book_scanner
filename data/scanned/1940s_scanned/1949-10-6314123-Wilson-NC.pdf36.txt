The image does not contain a photograph but rather contains a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch appears to depict an object that seems to have flames coming out from the back end. On the right side, the words "BLUE FLAME" and "WHITE FLAME" are written, pointing at the flames. There is text under the sketch labeled "Witness's Sketch of Object". At the top right, the word "UNCLASSIFIED" is clearly visible.

Here is the OCR output of the text found in the document:

```
