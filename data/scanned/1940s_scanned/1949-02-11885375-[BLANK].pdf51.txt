The image also contains marginal notes, a signature denoting approval (which I'm not able to reproduce), and there's a handwritten indication, likely a date ("1/Sepr 47") or other reference mark, on the top right side. The bottom of the document contains standardized form information and a document control stamp, but the text is either cut off or obscured.
