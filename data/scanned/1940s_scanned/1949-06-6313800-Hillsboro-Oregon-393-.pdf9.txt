NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
AT BEAVERTON:; OREGON
    On 4 June 1949, Mr. _________, Portland 1, Oregon; and Mr.
_______, 3186 Cornett Road, Portland 1, Ore., were interviewed
and stated in substance as follows: At 1105 hours (PST), on 4 Jun 1949, they were
sitting in the open on a hilltop which enabled them to view the surrounding countryside. As was their habit during lunch hour, they were observing (with the naked eye)
the airplanes flying in the vicinity of the Hillsboro Airport, Hillsboro, Oregon.
The airport is approximately seven miles west of where they were eating their lunch.
Their attention was attracted to an amphibious-type aircraft that entered the area.
While watching this craft, they noted something reflecting light from the sun a con-
siderable height above the general level of the other aircraft. They then gave this
object all of their attention in an effort to determine what type of aircraft it was.
They noticed that they were only able to see it when it flashed, or reflected the
light from the sun. The object appeared to be metallic in color, rather large and
round in shape. They estimated it to be approximately the size of an object 3/5"
in diameter held at arm's length. They emphasized, however, that due to the reflec-
tion of light, it was difficult for them to determine with any accuracy the size or
shape of the object. In regard to maneuverability, it appeared to wobble slightly,
but remained in a fixed position. It was the lack of movement that raised the doubt
in their minds as it is being an ordinary aircraft, and resulted in their making known
their observations. The object remained in view for approximately three minutes,
and then appeared to go in a Southwesterly direction at a very rapid rate of speed.
The flashing, or "reflection ceased, and they could no longer see the object. 
There was no sound nor exhaust trail associated with the object.
The weather was clear, good visibility, bright sunshine, and no clouds in the sky.
Its position was approximately 45° above the horizon and between 
and 10 o'clock lower limbs from the North. The altitude was first estimated at six or
seven thousand feet. However, this estimate was later retracted. Due to the lack of
clouds and the uniform size of the object, they decided that they had nothing on which
to base any estimate as to altitude. They did emphasize, however, that they could
make out other aircraft far below the object. Position of observers at time of
sighting was 45° 30' 54" North latitude and 122° 54' 02" West longitude. The
observers are in the middle group. Neither has worn PAINFULOEK were glasses.
they are employed by the Wolf Creek Highway Water District, Cedar Mills, Oregon. There
