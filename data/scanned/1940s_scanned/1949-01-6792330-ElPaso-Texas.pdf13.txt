Through the use of a transit the following readings were obtained: Location 33° 49' North and 106° 13' West.

   a.

   First sighted object: 55°Magnetic North and 12° elevation.

All of the above occurrences in the description of the object as being a single, bright burning green object, which ran in view approximately 3 seconds. Body had a gentle downward glide and seemed to fizzles out with the light becoming less intense and finally disappearing altogether. Angle of elevation was estimated above with transit and none would venture a guess as to the distance of the object. Optional statements were to the effect that object appeared to be between the Base and the White Sands, located to the West of the Base.
