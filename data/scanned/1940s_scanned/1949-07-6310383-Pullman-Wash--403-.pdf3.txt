NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Between the hours of 1430 and 1530 on 17 July 1949, the wife of ______________
College of Washington, Pullman, Washington, sighted an object, described by her as appearing to be a halo, spinning end over end, not in the plane of the disc surface; and moving rapidly in a general easterly direc-
tion. The halo, she believes, must have rotated with the object itself, for she received the impression that the two were combined.

This report tallies with an item published in the Pullman Herald on 15 July, which reported an incident occurring on the afternoon of 12 July. A group of three men reported the incident and described the object as having been "big, shiny, and floating along toward the East in a kind of rolling motion, appearing very high and glinting in the sun as it rolled along". These men reported the object was in sight for fully five minutes.
