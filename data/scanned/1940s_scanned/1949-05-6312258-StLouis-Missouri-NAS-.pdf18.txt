UNCLASSIFIED                     19 May 1949

about 2100, 1 May 1949, I was walking in an easterly direction
from the recreation building toward the main gate of the naval
air station. Towards the south I noticed a light moving from
the east towards the west, it was about 20 to 50 degrees above the
horizon and seemed to have a trail of fire behind it. I told
LCDR [REDACTED], who was walking with me, to look at the meteor.
He remarked that it was traveling in a horizontal direction rather
than falling as meteors usually do. I thought no more of the incident
until I heard that several pilots had sighted a strange light about
the same time.
