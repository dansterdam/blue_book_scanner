The text in the document is fragmented and not all words are fully visible or comprehensible, which is typical for scanned copies of older documents that may have been typed on a typewriter with some fading over time. A filled-out form such as this one, especially if part of Project Blue Book, would have been used for reporting unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings by military personnel.
