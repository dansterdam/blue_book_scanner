Incident #03 -- Silver Spring, Ohio -- 7 August 1947

From all evidence, it appears that the object seen here was a bright meteor. Slow-moving meteors occur before midnight, and, while their paths are almost never "absolutely horizontal," it is quite possible that the observer could have gained this impression, since the object was in sight for only three or four seconds. Furthermore, an observer, surprised by an unusual occurrence, often tends to overestimate the actual duration of time; thus, "three or four seconds" might mean not much more than a second.

There is nothing at all in the evidence that cannot be explained under the assumption that the object was a meteor.
