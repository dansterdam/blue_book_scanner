Requisite for employment with AEC
███████ A-7. █████████████████

At approximately 0010, 8 March 1949, while making a foot patrol at station 103, I observed a light low in the sky. It appeared quite dim and constant in intensity. It was traveling nearly in a horizontal plane from north to south. I saw it for about two seconds when the trees cut off my view. It appeared to be traveling very fast as it crossed crossed one half my line of vision during the time I observed it.
