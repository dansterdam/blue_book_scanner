June 22, 1950  

Dr. L. Levitt 
Fels Planetarium 
20th; Parkway 
Philadelphia 5, Pa.

Dear Dr. Levitt:

Mrs. Esther E. King of Aldin Farms [unclear] tells me that
she has been in touch with the Planetarium and that you 
would like to have a report of what I saw in the heavens 
shortly after midnight Saturday, June 25.  

As I were sitting on the steps in front of my home at 
1125 Cornwall Ave (Leban) and facing northwest, I 
saw the brilliant object--so brilliantly brilliant and so west, 
as we gazed, my attention was suddenly caught by a halo or 
flare, sweeping across the western sky. It moved from the 
north, then a south, in a line slanting earthward, not so 
rapidly as a shooting star, but at a speed that gave me 4 or 
5 or 6 seconds to observe it before it dropped behind a tree. 
It looked to me a very bright flaming ball, red-gold in color, 
turning in its own-made A ray path which gradually 
dimpled and smoothed until it ignored away. The ball of 
fire did not appear to be as high in the sky as was the 
lights of a plane that shortly, afterwards passed overhead. 
The exact occurrence and the display which took place less than 
10 minutes after midnight.

Sincerely yours,

A TRUE COPY:
