The image contains two black and white photographs of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The first photograph appears at the top half of the page and shows a classic "flying saucer" shape, with a slightly domed top and a flatter bottom, hovering in the air. It has a blurry outline suggesting motion or a lower-quality image capture.

The second photograph is at the bottom half of the page, and it displays an elliptical or cigar-shaped object with a more defined, solid-looking body compared to the first image. This object also appears to be in flight and features a sort of shaded underside, giving it a three-dimensional appearance.
