200 feet, and let en1culated mass be plotted versus asqured size. The non-
linear character of the curve should indicate an approximate upper limit to
the size of the object.

If in addition, it is assumed that the flutter is due to aerodymamic
forces, it is possible that more precise information could be obtained.
The required angular data can probably be extracted from witnesses
most reliably by the use of a demonstration model which can be made to
oscillate or "flutter to a known way.

SUMMARY, PART 2, SECTION A.

Geophysical oscillations alone do not yield the size of objects ob-
served from a single station; such observation, together with the as-
sumption that the objects are essentially aircraft, can be used to set
reasonable limits to size.

PART II, SECTION 5. THE FEASIBILITY OF SUPPORTING AND PROPELLING A SOLID
OBJECT BY "RAYS".

Since some observers have obviously colored their reports with talk
of rays, jets, beams, space-ships, and the like, it is well to examine
what possibilities exist along those lines. This is also important in
view of the conclusions of part II, section 4 of this report.

PROPELLER. Propulsion and support by means of "rays" or "beams".
By "rays" or "beams" are meant either purely electromagnetic radiation
or also radiation which is largely corpuscular like cathode-rays or cosmo-
rays or cyclotron-beams.

Now it is obvious that any device propelled or supported by such means
is fundamentally a reaction device. It is fundamental in the theory of such
devices that a given amount of energy is most efficiently spent if the momen-
tum thrown back or down is large. This means that a large mass should
