Transcribing the text from the image is somewhat challenging due to the quality, but I will do my best to provide the text as follows:

Note: Due to the poor quality of the scan, parts of the text are unclear or obscured, resulting in several instances of "[ILLEGIBLE]" where the text cannot be confidently transcribed.
