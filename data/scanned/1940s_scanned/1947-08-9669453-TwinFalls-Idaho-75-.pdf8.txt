Incident No. 75 -- 13 August 1947, 1300 hours, Snake River Canyon, Idaho. 
A farmer together with his two sons, ten and eight years of age, witnessed an 
object move down a canyon. It was in view only momentarily at a distance of 
300 feet, and approximately 75 feet above the ground. The object made a swish-
ing sound, and was sky-blue in color. The farmer doubted the possibility of 
its visibility if viewed against the sky. The children told of smokeless tur-
bine or exhaust flames shooting from two device through which could be seen 
daylight. The object passed over some trees, which in the words of the farmer, 
"spun around on top as if they were in a vacuum." 

AFC Opinion: It seems logical to concur with Dr. Hynek's deduction,
that this object was simply a rapidly moving atmospheric eddy.
