NARRATIVE SUMMARY

████████ saw a bright silvery oblong or egg-shaped object which
appeared to have a speed of 700 to 800 MPH and which seemed to have a
sort of sunflower shape at the end of it but apart from it and close on
its tail. He perceived a bluish appearance to rear of the object which
could have been exhaust. To him the object appeared silvery instead of
white and oblong rather than round. It appeared though the object remained
stationary or that it moved to move in a semi-circle from south to east
and finally to northeast. Mr. ████████████ stated that the direction of flight
was from northeast to southwest.
