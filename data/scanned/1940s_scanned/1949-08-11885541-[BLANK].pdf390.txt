Incident #33 -- page 7

the onrushing aircraft might suddenly have appeared to be crashing
celestial objects.

In any event, since it seems possible that at the time
of Lieutenant Mantell's death, he was actually diving, chase to
Venus (and since, certainly, during the event...s...t...e...s, persons
assumedly well acquainted with outbursts of it in sky were alarmed by
the appearance of the planet), it might be wise to give information
about this incident wide circulation among Air Force personnel, so
that tragic mistakes will not occur in the future.
