STATEMENT

On this 7th of February 1949, I was on duty at the weather
Station, Godman Air Force Base at 0150C Sgt. Ladejeter call me
from the Control Tower. He stated that he and Pfc Dunphy had sight-
ed a strange object in the sky and that he wanted me to come up and
take a look at it, which I did. A few minutes after I arrived in the
tower, Pfc Jetamber also came up to the fourth of us saw the object
which was just above the horizon. The strange object seemed
to be rotating red, green and yellow color. At approximately 0200C,
I went out to the theodolite and was unable to locate the object in it
and took reading on it. The object did not seem to move from its
original spot where it was first sighted. While we were watching it,
it suddenly disappeared. The object vanished at 0210C. Sgt. Ladejeter
notified Lt. Clary, who was the Officer of the Day that night and
entered the evett in the log. After I went back to the weather Station,
I made a note of it for Lt. Hammer and Sgt. Uranski, to see the next
morning.
