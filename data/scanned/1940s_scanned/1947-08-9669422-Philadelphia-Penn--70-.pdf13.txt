The following text is transcribed from the document:

Between 10:30 and 10:45 P. M. 6 Aug 47, Miss [redacted] was seated on the
steps of her home with [redacted]. She was facing north and observed
a large white object traveling at a very fast rate of speed to the south.
There was a buzzing sound, not too loud but plainly audible just after
the object passed thru the air. The object appeared white in color and
left a thin streak of smoke which was grayish in color.
