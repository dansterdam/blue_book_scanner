MCIAO
SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO:       Chief, Air Weather Service,
          Andrews Air Force Base,
          Washington 25, D. C.
          ATTN: DCS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investi-
gation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified
flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the file
of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendations as to those
which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine
synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological
Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached
may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that
has been asked to assist in the accomplishments of Project "SIGN" except
that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball-
lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are
conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are
coordinated by the Intelligence Department of the Command. These coorg-
eneously made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MCIAO-3. These
checks are made direct from the cook of synoptic balloon flights made by
weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department
of Commerce (U.S. Weather Bureau), regulated to Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed inci-
dents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This
list does not eliminate the possibility that any of the remaining
incidents are balloons.
