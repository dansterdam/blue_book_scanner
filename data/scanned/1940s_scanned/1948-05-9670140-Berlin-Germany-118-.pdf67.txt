Indeed at the time I was married to 
[redacted] we sat outside to let the 
house cool off during those days,
we ussually slept outside I enjoyed
the beautiful clear dark sky with 
3,4,5 shooting stars, all sizes, I'd peek,
but what I saw was my very
personal secret and Couldnot
share with anyone. I mistakenly
afraid, to destroy by words or
ideas, what I saw,. On the 
other side, it did not seem impor-
tant enough to talk about it 
it was so far away, so very 
small.
     
But now I feel,
I have to report what I saw,
so long so its quite long ago,
the year I cannot even tell
correctly, but it was after 1946.
   
Sincerely Yours,
