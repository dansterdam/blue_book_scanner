The image provided appears to be a scanned copy of an old document. There is no photograph present in this image; it consists solely of blurred and faded text, making it difficult to discern the details. Unfortunately, due to the quality of the scan, there is significant image degradation, with background noise and distortion, which makes it almost impossible to accurately transcribe the text. If you have a clearer image or more context, please provide that for a more detailed response.
