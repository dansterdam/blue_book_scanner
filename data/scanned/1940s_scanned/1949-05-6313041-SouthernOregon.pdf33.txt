NARRATIVE SUMMARY;
On Friday, 27 May 1949, [censored] Los Angeles,
California, was flying his privately owned SNJ-type aircraft from Red Bluff, California,
to Burns, Oregon. He departed Red Bluff at 1332 hours P.S.T. and arrived at Burns at
1456 hours P.S.T. At 1425 hours, same date, [censored] observed the sun reflecting on an
object, or objects, at a considerable distance ahead and a few points to the starboard.
He continued to watch the course taken by the reflecting material, expecting it to
materialize into a conventional aircraft as the distance lessoned between him and the
object or objects. As the objects reached the long bluffs (shown on the Boise (V-2)
Aeronautical Chart as Lairt Mountain) which run for a number of miles along the east
side of some dry lakes (Swamp, Flagstaff, Campbell and Stone Corral Lakes), he observed
that instead of a single object there were several which seemed to be flying in formation. At this point the objects appeared to have changed their course so that they
were paralleling his course and were following the bluffs' rim at about 1000 to 1500 feet below [censored] altitude at a distance which he estimates to have been 5-1/2 to 7-1/2 miles.
[censored] certain that it could not have been as far as ten (10) miles since the bluffs
were less than ten (10) miles away and he could see the objects outlined against the
bluffs."
