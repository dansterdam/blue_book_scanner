                                 STATEMENT OF FACT

At about 2054, 20 December 1948, in company with
Inspector -------- a falling light was observed at a great height
moving toward the earth at a 45º angle; this angle decreased as the
light fell until it disappeared on about a 20º angle. When first seen
the light appeared to be white, but later seemed to be broken, and to
have flat red cores, with the broken parts being red; the light trail
seemed to be white. Its form seemed to grow more concise and seemed
to be something besides just a white unbroken moving light. It appeared
to have a flat base having a broken red trail on each side. It was
now nearer the earth. The angle of glide appeared to be 20° and was
slightly N. West of an airplane in flight. It seemed to fly thru the air
as if controlled and did not fall straight to the earth as an uncontrolled
object normally would. It was moving very very swiftly. It finally
disappeared behind Point Eagle.
