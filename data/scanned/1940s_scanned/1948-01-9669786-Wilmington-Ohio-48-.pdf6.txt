Very bright white light southwest of the field. The light did not cast
a beam and seemed the size of a flood light. From the ground the light
appeared much whiter and we were unable to determine what kind it is
the they also the light was yellow to the rest and lower. When seen that
it was shimmering. This light varied yellowish to orange and appeared to be
descending and burning out. The latter observation may be that in its
westward movement it appeared to be fading out and descending however the
light was not nearly as bright on the second observation. At first it
was very white and did not appear to be moving though when it flashed on
and off it appeared dim in a few seconds. With the naked eye I could not
make out any shape other than the light being oval shaped as though
looking at a large spot light. It was not a heavenly body of any type
nor were any headlights obvious in the background nor and the object is
that the sky was solid overcast. When I looked no area in connection with
the object. I estimated at the first observation that it was 4-5 miles
southwest of the base. At the second appearance it was 6-7 miles West and moved
westerly in a hovering manner but moving away.
