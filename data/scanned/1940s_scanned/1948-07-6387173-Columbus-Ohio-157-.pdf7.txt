On Saturday evening, 31 July 48, at approximately 8:00 P. M. , 
while driving south on Tremont Road as observers approached the OSU
Radio Tower located on the University Golf Course, a large object resem-
bling a image lantern was seen floating in the sky. The weather was
clear, and it was still daylight so object could be seen quite clearly. 
It was oblong in shape and about the size of a gasoline drum. It was
coming from the west and moving very slowly. It passed close to the
tower and was about 1/2 the height of the tower from the ground. As
it passed overhead traveling east, it spouted black smoke from the
top and at the bottom on the left side there was a dull enclosed light 
like that of a lamp. The object did not change its course or altitude 
but continued on. It made a whishy swish as it traveled. The 
object was black. It did not make any noise. There were no wings visible 
nor did it have any motor. No openings of any kind could be seen.

NOTE: Another car stopped near them with two occupants who claimed
that they had never witnessed anything like it before.
