1901ST AACS SQUADRON
Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base
California

18 July 1949

360.32

SUBJECT: Information Pertaining to Flying Disc

TO: S-2, 1901st AACS Squadron

I was looking out of the Supply building (T-516) when, first, I saw a C-82. While looking, I saw two other objects that I first thought were jet planes. They were traveling just as fast or faster than the C-82. I called the other men, telling them there were two flying saucers. They saw them too and the objects then disappeared.

Speed was very fast and altitude was about the same as the C-82, which was not very high. The color was a bright silver.
