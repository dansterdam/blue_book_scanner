11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted a metallic-looking object. There was sunlight glinting on it and it appeared to be round. Observer at first believed it to be an airliner, but it seemed to be moving too fast. He thought it to be too large to be a jet. The object was heading West. It vanished into the sunlight.
