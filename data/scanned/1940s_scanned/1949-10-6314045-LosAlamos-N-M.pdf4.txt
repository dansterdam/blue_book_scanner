```
P. H. GARRETT
MOUNT HOPE. WEST VA.

It had no wings nor other protrusions, neither was there any sound, smoke, nor vapor to be seen nor heard. Only the bottom could be seen from the ground, height and speed made it impossible to ascertain its height or depth. The bottom was smooth remained parallel with the earth,(no waivering) had a metallic appearance but did not glisten in sun light. The color was that of lead or tarnished tin.

In flight it followed a straight course, maintained a fixed equilibrium, traveled longewise as illustrated, appeared and disappeared with marked suddenness.

In my mind I am unable to correlate this object with any of the various manifestations produced by government balloons as listed by Mr.Shallett. The nearest coincidence listed was the case of two aviators who saw an object alongside their plane and later checked with their passengers for confirmation. However in this case it was night time and they were also in the air affording more complete observation.

What we saw was no illusion nor hallucination. I studied medicine and have some knowledge of them. It was no heavenly body. I have read three books on astronomy including a college text and many articles. It was no airplane of common knowledge. To us, until disproved, it was a man made, mechanical gadget, origin unknown.

Henceforth I will no doubt, doubt, the conclusions of Mr.Shallett and those who supported him in his articles. Possibly some of the reports are not illusions nor fragments of the imagination. Maybe strange objects are sailing above our heads from here or abroad.

Yours truly,
