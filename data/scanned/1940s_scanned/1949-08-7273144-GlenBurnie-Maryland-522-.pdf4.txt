The page contains two photographs. The first photograph at the top of the page appears to be a very dark image with the majority of details obscured, making it hard to discern any specific features within it. The second photograph at the bottom shows an exterior scene with part of an aircraft visible; it looks like the tail assembly of the plane and part of the fuselage with some foliage in the foreground. The aircraft is stationary and seems to be parked next to a building with a thatched roof.

Here is the text from the document:
