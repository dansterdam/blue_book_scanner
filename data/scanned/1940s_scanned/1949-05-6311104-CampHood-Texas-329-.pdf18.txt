S/I, Office of the AC of S, G-2, Headquarters Fourth Army, Fort Sam Houston,
Texas, 2 July 1949, subj. "Summary of Observations of Aerial Phenomena, Camp
Hood, Texas"

No sound or odor has ever accompanied the phenomena.

All observed groups of phenomena have "bracketed" the restricted area.

Over 100 men and officers have observed and reported the phenomena
(including field rates and college graduates).

Flights of aircraft and all firing and training schedules have been
checked and rechecked without a single such incident having been found 
that coincides in time and place with any of the observed phenomena.

No explanation of this phenomena is known to nor has any been
presented to this headquarters. In the absence of scientific equipment
and observers, it appears that no explanation is foreseeable.
