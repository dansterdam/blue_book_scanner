NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At a point 6.2 miles NE of San Antonio, Texas, about 150 yards on Judson Road off intersection of Judson Road and Nacogdoches Road, M/Sgt Ellis Stone saw an object which appeared to be in the form of a sphere, the color of which appeared a luminous bluish green intermingled with a yellow tinge. Object was seen between the readings of 325째 and 295째 off magnetic north and was believed to have been traveling from ESE to N. Time of travel in this azimuth was estimated at 5 seconds. Object was first observed at an elevation of 15째 and as it disappeared over a small hill the elevation had dropped to about 12째. It was moving with a gliding effect from the observer's right to his left and slightly away from the point of observation. The trail varied in length from approximately three times the diameter of the object to six or seven times the diameter. Color of the trail appeared a light pink with bright red sparks spraying from the trail at about 1/2 the distance of the length. (The trail was a straight shot-back trail with these sparks emitted making the only irregularity).
