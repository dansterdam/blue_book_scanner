Incident #33 -- page 6

the approximately simultaneous sightings. It is most unlikely, how-

on Venus in the daylight sky. It seems, therefore, much more prob-
able that more than one object was..involved: the sightings might have 
included two or more balloons (or aircraft) or they might have in-
cluded both. Venus (in the fatal cases) and balloons. For reasons
