The image appears to be a scanned document with a hand-drawn sketch, not a photograph. The sketch seems to depict an aerial phenomenon with various lines and swirls indicating movement or activity in the sky. A label "6000" appears to be part of the sketch, possibly indicating altitude. There's also a note on the edge of the drawing that says "EDGE OF CLOUDS." Here is the transcribed text from the document:

"UNCLASSIFIED

This text seems to be describing observations of some phenomenon related to an aircraft, including a dark cloud and distinctive red and blue-white lights. The date and local time are also noted.
