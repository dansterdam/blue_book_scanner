AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ASG'T C/S, -42, FEAF, 18O 925

FI-35-5-9

STATEMENT

At about 1200 hours on 8 September 1949, undersigned officer was flying as left wing man for Major Sabillo. While in a turn to the left, at an altitude of 6,000 feet, he saw a black spot giving a smoke trail which appeared at first to be a skywriter. After watching the rate of climb of this object, at a high rate of speed on a constant course, he realized it was not a skywriter. Approximately ten to fifteen seconds later, he called the object to the attention of his Flight Leader, Major Sabillo. Major Sabillo, Major Schildt then started a turn to the right, at least a standard rate turn or better, which took us approximately one to one and one half minutes to complete 130 to 225° of turn which put us on a course to parallel that of the object. When the turn was started undersigned officer estimated the distance of the object to have been at least five miles to the South and approximately twenty (20) miles away at an altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. Upon completion of that turn the object appeared to be approximately 30,000 to 35,000 feet, still climbing and ahead of the flight about twenty (20) miles on a course of about 340°. The Flight paralleled the course of the con-trail and the object continued to climb and move was now between 40,000 and 50,000 feet, north of us. There was a definite break or "bleb" in the con-trail when the object leveled off. The con-trail could be seen from the top of the cloud level, estimated to be 10,000 feet to the objects level of altitude. The trail was distinct and held, so that it was still visible from the ground after we had landed at 1220 hours.

STATEMENT

At about 1200 hours 8 September 1949, undersigned officer was returning from an aerial gunnery tow mission and at approximately 20 miles north of Clark Air Force Base, at the altitude of 4500 feet, while on a southerly heading, undersigned officer noticed a very dense con-trail in the vicinity of Subic Bay. The con-trail was extending north at a high rate of climb and speed. Undersigned officer could not clearly discern the object making this con-trail. From the time undersigned officer first saw this object until it disappeared up near the vicinity of Lingayen Gulf a matter of only two or three minutes had elapsed. At first sight this object appeared to be at an altitude of about 15,000 feet and about 20 to 25 miles southwest of Clark. This object was at an estimated 50,000 feet by the time undersigned officer lost sight of it. The object appeared to be in level flight just before it disappeared from view.
