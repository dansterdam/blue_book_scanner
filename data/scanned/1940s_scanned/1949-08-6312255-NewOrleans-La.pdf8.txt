To: MCIAZK                       From: MCPEAI                   2 November 1949                Comment No. 2

1. The submitted sample was a cast aluminum alloy of ordinary commercial quality. It was a sand casting, and probably made from a material equivalent to Alooa 13 alloy. Microscopic investigation revealed the casting to have a considerable amount of scattered porosity. The outer layers of grains were partially recrystallized indicating that the part was subject to fairly high temperatures at its surface.

2. A deposit which appeared to be grayish black covered both surfaces of the sample. The deposit on one side was in levels as could occur if hot "smoke" gases passed over it at high speeds. The deposit was gray in color when separated and powdered. X-ray diffraction methods revealed that it contained one crystalline material, CaCO3, while spectrographic tests indicated that the metallic elements in the deposit were principally Ca, with major amounts of Al, Si and Mg. Corrosion spots were present at scattered places on the surface.

3. An approximate spectrographic analysis of the base material of the casting was made. The elements found, including all the trace elements, were:
