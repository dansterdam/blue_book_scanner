UNCLASSI...

On Saturday June 21st, shortly before noon, I was in our yard at 
home when I happened to glance up at a passing plane. I would say 
this was a two motored one from one of the army bases, flying south 
at about 10,000 or 12,000. feet. On the mere glance at the plane 
a bright shiny flash attracted my attention, coming from approximately 
two or three thousand feet lower than the plane, but slightly ahead 
of my line of vision of's plane. My first thought was air 
plane had thrown out some leaflets, but this could not be as they 
(the flashes or disks) were ahead of the plane. On thing different 
tho, it seems to me they were not travelling as fast as the plane. 
We realize to, now, that whatever they were, they must have been 
quite large, being as plain as the nearest one was, yet so high. 
And again, they were traveling south against prevailing winds. At 
least some of the smaller flashes, if not all were as high or higher 
than the plane, but the nearest one seemed lower, both when it flashed 
and otherwise, as it did intermittently.
