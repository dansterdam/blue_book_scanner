UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #47 - Birmingham, Alabama - 6 July 1947

This incident has no obvious astronomical explanation.
The photograph purported to be a part of the report of
the incident is not documented. There is no proof in the evidence
at hand that it shows the objects described. From the word description alone, which is quite limited, the objects could be explained
simply as rockets! "Vertical ascent," "Travelled in arc." Data is
too meager for a definite conclusion, however.

If the photograph is authentic, it would be extremely
valuable to know the shutter speed at which it was taken, since from
this the angular velocity could be determined.
