The image contains what appears to be a drawing or a diagram rather than a photograph. The diagram, labeled "Figure 89", consists of four segments labeled A through D. It illustrates the concept of Searchlight shines on clouds, highlighting different situations with varying atmospheric conditions. Segment A shows a single spotlight ray through slightly foggy or dusty atmosphere, touching on cloud layers and foggy or dusty atmosphere. Segment B shows a clean level through clear atmosphere with no light value. Segment C depicts multiple thin cloud layers, and Segment D illustrates a single ray through no light atmosphere. Below the diagram is the title "FINAL GALLEY PROOF" and the chapter heading "Galley 99—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS".

Galley 99—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS

Figure 89. Searchlight shint on clouds. (a), through slightly foggy or dusty atmosphere, light continually visible as it travels through multiple thin cloud layers and foggy or dusty atmosphere; (c) is  seen level through clear atmosphere with no light value; (d) is multiple thin cloud layers, no light come visible.

While keeping an open mind on the possibility of interplanetary travel, Townhaupt himself has never supported the spaceship interpretation so often attributed to him in print but has instead several variations possible explanations-situations or air gestures denoted by irregular lights, or reflections of ground lights against the boundary of an inversion layer in the air. Of these, the inversion theory seems the most probable. The layer in which it would have been the most thin or eroded may wake, or see a true cut and thus lend themselves to the faint scars he was observing. As in the Clearbrook-Kay case, the mysterious retracts driver's undistortedly the special effect of some unique combination of circumstances, unlikely to be repeated. Conditions were ideal for the formation of small humps localized inversions the weather was clear, the thin dust layer threw a small temperature inversion existing at a relatively low elevation and smoke, haze, or dust collecting in a very thin layer at relative low altitude were the prerequisites that almost certainly must assume unknown corrive-the vicinity of the in the thin haze layer. possibilities-could have produced a ripple in the effect the wind. This ripple, tipping the haze layer at a slight angle, could have reflected the lighted windows of a house, as the ripple traveled in a weak multiple thin layer, the reflection could have moved as did the rectangles of light. Conditions of refraction at the interface would have reflected the waves upward.

Townhaupt has recently summarized his convictions on the entire UFO phenomena as well as on his own sighting:

"From my own studies of the clear system I cannot entertain any serious possibility for intelligent life on the other planets, not even for Mars (the planet to which I have devoted considerable observation and study over the past thirty-five years). The logistics of visitations from planets revolving around the millions stars is staggering. In consideration of the hundreds of year of stars in the geologic time scale when such visitations may possibly have occurred, the odds of a single visit in a given century or millennium are overwhelmingly against such an event.

"A much more likely source of explanation is some natural optical phenomenon in our own atmosphere. In my 1949 sighting the intensity of the object, together with the manner of fading in horizon. as it traveled away from zenith towards the southeastern faintness is quite suggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of slight contrast in reflective index, as in an inversion layer. I have spent a lot of time when anything like it before or since, and I set "I have never seen anything like it beyond seen well. This suggests that the phenomenon involves a complexity and rare set of conditions or circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the
