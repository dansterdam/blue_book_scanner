Incident #33 -- Aug 6

away from him) and that no cloud not seem to gain on it.

In summing up, this can be said: the evening sightings
reported in incidents #31, 32, 33, and 43 were undoubtedly of the
planet venus. Again, the daylight sightings from Godman Field
and other places in Kentucky, there seems so far to be no single
explanation that does not rely greatly on coincidences. If all reports
were of a single object, in the knowledge of this investigator no
man-made object could have been large enough and far enough away for
the approximately simultaneous sightings. It is most unlikely, how-
ever, that so many separate persons should at that time have observed
on Venus in the daylight sky. It seems, therefore, much more probable
that more than one object was involved: the sightings might have
included two or more balloons (or aircraft), or they might have in-
cluded both Venus (in the fatal cases) and balloons. For reasons
given above, the latter explanation seems more likely. Until a hypothe-
sis does, however, still necessitate the inclusion of at least two
objects other than Venus, and it certainly is coincidental that so
many people would have chosen this one day to be confused (to the
extent of reporting the matter) by normal airborne objects. There
remains one possible, very plausible explanation for this fact, how-
ever was the original report by any chance broadcast by local
radio stations? If so, with the general public on the alert, even
