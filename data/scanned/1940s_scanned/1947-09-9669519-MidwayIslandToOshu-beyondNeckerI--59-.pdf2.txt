Incident #59 - beyond Necker Island -- 12 September 1947

From the evidence at hand, it appears quite likely that
the object observed was a fireball. Fireballs have been known to
change course abruptly when splitting. The reported change to red-
dish hue from the previous color of incandescent light, the length
of time in sight, and the manner of disappearance all lend support
to this hypothesis. At sunset one can expect relatively slow-
moving, nearly horizontal fireballs.
