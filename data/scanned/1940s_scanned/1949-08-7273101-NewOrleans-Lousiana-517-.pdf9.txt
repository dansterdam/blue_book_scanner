The photograph depicts an object with a curvature lying next to a ruler for scale, indicating that the object's length is approximately between 6 and 9 centimeters. The object appears to be charred or covered with a dark substance on part of its surface, while the other part appears to be lighter in color. The background is nondescript and light in color, with some imperfections visible.

The text on the document is mostly obscured, but "CONFIDENTIAL" is stamped at the top-center, and "UNCLASSIFIED" is stamped twice at the bottom right corner of the image and on the ruler at the bottom center. There is no additional legible text in the photograph.
