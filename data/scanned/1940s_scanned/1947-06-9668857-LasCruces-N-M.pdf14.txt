SUBJECT: Interview of Person Reporting Unidentified Aerial Object

TO: Ac/I Chief of Air Staff â€“ 
   Collection Branch, AAF
   Washington 25, D. C.

1. At the request of Lt. Col. G. D. Garrett, AAF 2-2, the undersigned has interviewed this date Mr. _______ Administrative Assistant in the Rocket Sonde Section, NRL, who had previously released information to the press regarding an aerial object which he stated he saw at White Sands, New Mexico. 20 June.

2. Substance of the interview is as follows:

At between 11:00 and 11:30 E. S. Sunday, 29 June 1947, Mr. _______, in the company of the following: Mr. ________, NRL Rocket Sonde Section telemetering expert; Mr. ________, NRL Rocket Sonde high altitude spectrograph scientist; and Mrs. ________ wife of the latter, were proceeding along Highway 17 in a north-easterly direction from Las Cruces, New Mexico to White Sands V-2 firing grounds in an automobile driven by Mr. ________. At some time between those views and about one-third of the distance from Las Cruces to the White Sands V-2 firing grounds, Mr. ________ noticed at some distance in front, and above of the other occupants, Mr. ________ opened the window nearest him and observed the object moving at an unknown rapid velocity at an unknown altitude, which he estimated at about 10,000 feet, and which Mr. _______, who also observed it through an open window, estimated at between 6,000 and 10,000 feet, although the former put little credence in the estimates.

When first sighted the object was to the right and forward of the automobile at an elevated elevation and was apparently moving horizontally in a northerly direction such as to cross the highway from right to left. The object was observed by all persons in the automobile. Mr. ________ stated that he could not observe any details of the object other than that its shape was uniform, with no protuberance such as the wings of an airplane. It was too distant to enable stereoscopic visualization. There was apparently some major specular reflection which seemed to change in intensity as the object receded until it was lost for eight after an estimate 30 seconds, from the time first noticed. He could not explain how it disappeared except perhaps that the reflection angle may have changed abruptly. There were apparently no clouds or visibility obstructions at the time. The sun was to the rear of the automobile. Mr. ________ thought that at one time he saw vapor trails.
