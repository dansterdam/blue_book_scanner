rented observers guarantee their observations. Unfortunately there were
tary reports of curious phenomena by pilots during the war - e.g. incident
of the fire-ball Mi fighters comes to mind. Further, officers have been re-
porting sea-serpents for hundreds of years yet no one has yet produced a
photograph.

It would be interesting to tabulate the responses to see how reliable
were the reports on the Japanese balloons during the war. There too had a
phenomenon proven to be real.

It is interesting that the reports swiftly reach a maximum frequency
during the end of June 1947 and then slowly tail off. We can assume that
this is actually an indication of how much or how much we were actually about, or,
quite differently, we can take this frequency curve as indicating something
about mass psychology.

This point can be tested. Suppose the population is momentarily ex-
cited; how does the frequency of reports vary with time? A study of
crank letters received after the recent publicity given to the satelite
reports should give the required frequency distribution.

It is probably necessary but certainly not sufficient that the un-
identified object curve and the crank-letter curve should be similar in
order for the flying disks to be classed as hallucinations.

A large scale experiment was made at the time of Orson Welles's
"Martian" broadcast. Some records of this must persist in newspaper
files.

worry about. It is the author's opinion that only an accidental discovery
