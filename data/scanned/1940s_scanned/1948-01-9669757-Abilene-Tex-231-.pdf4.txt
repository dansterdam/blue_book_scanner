Incident: 231

Information regarding this sighting taken from a letter of ****
addressed to Air **** at Abilene, Texas, in regard 
to Mr. **** inquiry regarding a phenomena he witnessed the 
night of 1 Jan 48 at approximately 2125 A. M. and again at 1:30 
A. M.

Object was described as a fan-shaped glow which originated from a 
large ball on the horizon and which extended to the meridian due 
west of Abilene, Texas, in a perfectly clear sky. Phenomena was 
of 2 seconds duration. Five minutes later it was seen again for 
the same length of time. No sound was heard.

Mr. **** thought the phenomena could possibly be attributed to:

    (1) Disturbance of an electrical system such as transformers 
    blowing out, or

    (2) Experiments at White Sands Proving Grounds which are due 
    west of Abilene.

NOTE: Inquiry at Holloman AF Base, Alamogordo, N. M., 
revealed that research work at night and on 
Sundays does not involve the use of any lighting 
devices or flares such as described in the various 
reports submitted. See Incidents
