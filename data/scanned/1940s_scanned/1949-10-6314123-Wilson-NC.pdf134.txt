The image contains a sketch, not a photograph. The sketch appears to depict some sort of craft with annotations describing its features or motion. There are also handwritten notes.

direction of 
no noise etc.

narrative description can be

[Text is cut off and not fully readable]

[handwriting unclear]
[signature-like scribble]

Please note that due to the quality of the handwriting in the original document and the scan's resolution, some text could not be accurately transcribed, and parts of the text are indiscernible or cut off.
