Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Re radars operating on ground:

   a. Observation of range, speed, altitude and size of target:

   b. Does target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180) etc., and
      what radius of turn. If radius of turn is not observable, how long
      did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed?:
      U Turn
   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several
      targets upon approach. Track all if possible:

2. If airborne, when object was sighted:

   a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits:

   b. Give estimate of size, speed, maneuvers, etc:

GENERAL

1. Teletype sequences of local weather conditions: Approximately 80 degrees - 
   quiet
2. Winds aloft report:
3. Local flight schedules of commercial, private and military aircraft
   flying in vicinity at the time. (Check Ce..lation activity if close to
   border):
4. Possible releases of testing devices in vicinity sent aloft by Ordnance,
   Navy, Air Force, Army, Weather Units, Research Organizations or any others:
5. If object contacted earth, obtain soil samples within and without depres-
   sion or spot where object la.ded (and then presumably departed) for
   purposes of making comparison of soils:
6. If object came sufficiently near other aircraft or known objects, check
   surfaces with Geiger counters for possible radioactivity. Take comparison
   with other unaffected aircraft objects, etc:
7. Obtain photographs (or original negatives) where available; if not,
   secure sketchings of:
