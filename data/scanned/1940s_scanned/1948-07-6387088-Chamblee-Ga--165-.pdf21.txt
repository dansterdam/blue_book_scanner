EXCERPT: FROM SIGN INT REP, Dept. of the Air, Hq USAF, dated 30 Dec 47 "Flying Discs"

SUMMARY: Detailed interrogations have been completed of persons reporting nuclear-
ized Flying objects in the vicinity of Montgomery, Alabama, 24 and 26 July 1948,
between the hours of 2130 and 0215.

Analysis has been made of the compiled statements and the other available
evidence of each individual interrogated. The analysis was undertaken as only one
of 219 reported incidents with an objective of arriving towards a definite pattern
or trend in order to determine whether the objects reported were of domestic or
foreign, or a natural phenomenon.

COMMENTS: Analysis of data under Incident №4 reveals that four separate cases
are involved; one having occurred on 24 July 1948 and the others on the 26 July 1948.
A preponderance of evidence is available to establish that in almost all cases an
unidentified object was seen within the times stated and on the same dates over an
extended area pursuing a general course South. Descriptions as to size, shape, color
and movements are fairly consistent.
