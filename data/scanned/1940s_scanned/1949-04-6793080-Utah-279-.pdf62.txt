The image provided appears to be a poorly scanned or photocopied document, making the text difficult to decipher. There are no photographs depicting anything identifiable within the image. However, the document seems to contain a graphic or map with lines, possibly indicating pathways or locations. There are some very faded words and numbers, which might be indicative of coordinates or annotations related to the map, but their poor legibility prevents me from providing accurate optical character recognition (OCR) output.

Based on what can be vaguely discerned, the text at the top appears to say "SALT LAKE CITY (CB)" with other very faded text surrounding it. Due to the low quality of the scan, Iâ€™m unable to reproduce the complete text accurately.
