SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO Commanding General
     Air Material Command
     Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
     Dayton, Ohio
     ATTN: MC/IXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MC/IX, 
dated 19 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and 
endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The Incident Summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is reccommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Spotting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

                                FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
