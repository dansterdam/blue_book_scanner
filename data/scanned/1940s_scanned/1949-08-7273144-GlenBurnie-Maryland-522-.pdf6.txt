The image shows two black-and-white photographs that appear to be mounted on a page with the word "UNCLASSIFIED" stamped at the top.

The top photograph seems to portray a partially illuminated structure or object with a substantial amount of shadow and darkness obscuring full view. The object has a flat surface with what looks like wreckage or debris scattered across it. There is a more clearly defined section on the right-hand side that the text refers to as a "fuselage and cockpit."

The bottom photograph depicts an area that is primarily dark with a notable structure in the foreground that is lit more brightly. This structure has a round, disc-like shape with what could be blades or fins attached to its top, similar to a rotor. The background shows an overexposed section of light, and possibly wooden beams or framework are barely discernible in the darkness.

The accompanying text on the page reads:

"21-9 "Gray Goose
Photos No. 12,13.

and cockpit on right.
