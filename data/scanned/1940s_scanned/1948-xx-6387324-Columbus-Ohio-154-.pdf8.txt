Incident #484, 1948 -- Columbus, Ohio -- 2 August 1948

This incident is in two respects unique among all those investigated: 1) it is the only object that is defined solely by an outline, appearing vacant inside, so that the sky was visible through it; and 2) it is similar to an object that this investigator viewed as a boy.

The writer's recollection has remained vivid throughout these many years. The object he saw could best be described as a floating, ellipse, like a wire hoop travelling; slowly across the sky. The motion was uniform, and the form of the object changed slowly, as though the hoop were being distorted. The object was observed for at least ten minutes, with several witnesses, until it finally disappeared in the distance. The writer had dismissed the object as some sort of unusual atmospheric phenomenon, perhaps a traveling air pocket.

Because of the similarity between this observation and that reported in incident #484, the latter has a special interest to this investigator. In the recent incident, however, the tail of smoke is an added feature.

There is obviously no astronomical explanation for these incidents -- the most plausible explanation probably lies in the field of meteorology.
