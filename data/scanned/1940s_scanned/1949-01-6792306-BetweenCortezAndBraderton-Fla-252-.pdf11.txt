The image does not contain a photograph. It is a schematic or a drawing with multiple rectangles connected by lines, possibly representing a sequence or a process. It seems to be a diagrammatic representation rather than a photograph.

The only discernible text in the document appears to be the words "PASSED FROM V", which are written at an angle along the left side of the page. There is no additional legible textual content that can be extracted from this image as an OCR system.
