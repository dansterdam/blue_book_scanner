able information. Mr. [REDACTED] seemed sincere in his statements, however,
he took quite some time to answer specific questions. He answered most questions
with generalities. It is believed he tried to give correct answers but was un-
sure of himself. He also stated that most of the answers given by him in his letter
to the Technical Intelligence Division were mere speculations and that he believed
he was wrong with several plausible answers to specific accuracy.

swers to the best of their ability. Mr. [REDACTED] seemed to have a
background which would qualify him as a fairly reliable observer of the incident.
Mrs. [REDACTED] kept a constant watch on the object whereas Mr. [REDACTED] 
was driving. Several stops were made and their conflicting views as recorded ant
