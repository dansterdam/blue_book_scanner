The photograph appears to be a black and white image showing an unidentified object or objects in the sky. There are two bright spots near the top of the image, which could be lights or reflections, and a curving line or trail of some sort near the bottom, possibly smoke, vapor, or a cloud. The photo is quite grainy, and it's challenging to make out clear details. The image captures something that may be in motion, given the presence of the trail, but it's difficult to ascertain the exact nature of the object(s) from this photo alone.

There appears to be text captioning the photograph, but it is not completely legible due to the resolution and quality of the image provided. It seems to say "PHOTO BY" followed by text that cannot be clearly discerned. If you can provide a better-quality image or more context, I may be able to offer a more detailed description or attempt to transcribe more accurately.
