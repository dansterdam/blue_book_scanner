SUMMARY (Enter under summary of report. Give significant facts in mere outline paragraphs. List enclosures of largest length.  Give subject of report as AF Form 112—Part II)

        1. At approximately 00542 hours 6 June 1949, _____________ noticed a trail
of white smoke in the Northwest quadrant of the sky from his location in the
control tower of the International Airport, Tampa, Florida. Good apparent
causing smoke appeared to be going in a westerly direction and seemed to disintegrate
to be located approximately over the city of Dunedin, Florida. From the descrip-
the trail of smoke informant thought the smoke was caused by a falling aircraft,
its motion or trail of smoke was straight down. Actual object causing smoke was
viewed soon by this informant. ____________ was without observation of informant about
forty (40) minutes, when darkness precluded further observation. Informant
expressed his opinion that the phenomenon he observed could not have been a
meteor, regardless of st*ements appearing in a local Tampa newspaper, which
cited certain "authorities" as identifying the phenomenon as a meteor.

        2. Following data is relative to the observer. _________________________
Tampa, Florida (located west of Drew Field, Florida). He is an amateur pilot of
four (4) years experionce. It is believed that subject is reliable with average
intelligence.
