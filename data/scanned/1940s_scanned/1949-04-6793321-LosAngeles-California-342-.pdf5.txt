1. This investigation was requested by Headquarters, OSI, by letter
dated 20 May 1949, in which it was stated that certain Department of Recre-
ation employees had reported seeing an object which resembled a disc in the
sky.

AT LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

2. Mr. ****** interviewed on 25 May

c. Place of observation: North latitude 34° 08' West longitude
113° 19'

attention, he observed a round flat metallic object heading
into the northwest,

arm's length,

h. Its color was that of unpainted aluminum and it glistened and
shimmered in the rays of the sun.

i. Shape of object was round and flat; thick in the center and
tapering to a thin edge at the circumference, like a convex
lens in a magnifying glass.

at about 700 to 750 above the horizon.

k. It was first seen in the East and was observer as it traveled
into the northwest.
