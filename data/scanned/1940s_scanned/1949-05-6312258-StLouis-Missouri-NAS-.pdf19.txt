19 May 1949

Tonight, about 2100 I was flying an SNJ-BI at 3500 feet with Lt. ________
as my co-pilot and ________ as one of my passengers.

A cloud bank was moving in from the North and I was headed about 150 Degrees
when I sighted an object about 500 ft. above and approximately 2000 feet
ahead headed approximately 270 Degrees traveling at a terrific rate of
speed. The night was calm and I now only less knew to be the rate of the
plane and watched this object wondering why, if it was an airplane, it didn't
have any running lights. As I watched the object it started to suddenly
shoot out large sparks from the trailing end of same.
It ________ to look and as he did the object seem to disintegrate. There
were no clouds in this immediate vicinity as we were between the object
and the cloud bank to the North.

It seemed to have appear as though it was lighted from the interior.
