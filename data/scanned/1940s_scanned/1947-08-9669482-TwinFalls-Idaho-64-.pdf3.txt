Incident No. 6 - 19 August 1949, 2130 hours, Twin Falls, Idaho
Several people were recorded as sighting numerous groups of objects in the
night sky. These objects were described as a glow in the air with a color
similar to regular electric lights. The objects were said to have traveled
at "terrific" speed. Some flew in triangular formation. Three objects peeled
off one group of ten, and proceeded on another course. The sky was over-
cast. Two observers stated that the objects could not have been birds since
the lights were not a reflection of city lights.

AF's Opinion: Many familiar objects visible because of the fact that
they reflect light, appear to be incandescent; for example, the moon and
certain planets. The evidence is, therefore, contradictory since on one in-
stance two objects are described as normally known; and later on as not being
reflected off the sun and considered as truly incandescent as in incidents 62;
ground lights reflected from clouds; or birds in flight.
