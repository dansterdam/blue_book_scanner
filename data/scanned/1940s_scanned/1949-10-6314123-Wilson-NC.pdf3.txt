Capt. Ruppelt:

On Sat. July 5th I spoke at some length to the Duty Officer, Capt. James, about a disc or sphere that was visible in the beam of a searchlight on dates covering about a year and a half in the general Cincinnati area.
(Capt. James requested I send you a written report covering dates etc.

The object was spotted by accident when the light was swung to sighting when changing course. This was on Aug 19 1947 10:15 P.M., navy jet chase, and was held in the beam, in the same spot in the sky until 11:10 p.m. when the light was turned out.

The object was last seen, as far as I know on Jan. 11, 1950 still in the exact center of the sky. A list of Dates and places follows.
