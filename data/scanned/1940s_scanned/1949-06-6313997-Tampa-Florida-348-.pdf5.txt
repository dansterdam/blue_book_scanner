"Weather observers had no theory other than it may have been a meteorite wI:h 
a tail formed by millions of tiny particles.

"The Florida Highway patrol also had reports of the object being sighted 
near the Fernandina toll gate. The Civil Aeronautics Administration said several 
pilots reported seeing the object from planes as far north as Brunswick, Ga.

"A similar but smaller phenomenon appeared over Florida a few weeks ago, but 
left no trail. At that time the phenomenon led to reports of a plane crash in 
the Everglades, but it was finally written off as a shooting star.
