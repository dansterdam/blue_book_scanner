Visual stimuli originating within the eye itself also give rise

the clear sky, or when you are reading. They move as your eyes move.
It is sometimes possible also to see corpuscles or other objects that
are circulating within the fluids in the retina of the eye.

Then, of course, everyone from time to time mistakes some more
