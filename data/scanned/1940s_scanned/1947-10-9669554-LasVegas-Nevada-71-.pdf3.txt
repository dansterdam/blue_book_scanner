Incident No. 71 - 8 or 9 October 1947, daytime, Las Vegas, Nevada.
An Air Force Reserve pilot reported observing a trail appearing high in
the sky at an estimated speed of 1000-1800 MPH. The object producing the
trail was not visible. The trail was white as a cloud, and dissipated in
fifteen to twenty minutes. The object proceeded in a straight line, then
it made an approximately 150Â° turn of radius five to fifteen miles, and
proceeded away toward the direction of first appearance. The weather was
described as "almost cloudless."

AIC Opinion: It is difficult to understand why this individual attached
any importance to this sighting, and why he did not conclude that the trail
was caused by exactly what it appears to have been; that is, an ordinary air-
craft flying normally at an altitude too high for its trail to be visible, but
in the best altitude range to form vapor trails 20,000 - 45,000 feet.
