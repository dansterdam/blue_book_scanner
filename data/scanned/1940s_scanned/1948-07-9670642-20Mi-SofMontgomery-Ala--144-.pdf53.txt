d. All observers agree that the object was traveling in a general northerly heading and that it was trailed by a flame varying in color and that it behaved like a normal craft insofar as disappearing from the line of sight was concerned.

NOTE: It is a known fact that atmospheric conditions such as varying degrees of humidity and inci-
dence of the light refraction often influence the color of light not observed. This would serve to explain why many observers cannot
agree in their descriptions as to color of light displayed by the object or its trail.
