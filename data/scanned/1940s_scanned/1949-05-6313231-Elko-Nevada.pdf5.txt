5. On 8 June 1949, Mr. [redacted], Yard Clerk, Western Pacific Railroad Company, Elko, Nevada, was interviewed at his home, near Elko, Nevada, and the following statement (Exhibit B) was obtained:

   At approximately two A.M., on the morning of May 29, 1949, while attending to routine duties in the freight yard of the Western Pacific Railroad Company in Elko, I noticed five ember colored lights approximately five miles distant and at an altitude of 10000 feet. The lights were in a vee formation about 150 feet apart and heading West at a speed of over 500 miles per hour. I could hear no sound and there were no visible signs of exhaust. The lights were steady, giving the appearance of being seen through a window, rather than that of a ray beam. When they disappeared it was as if an obstruction or projection on an aircraft had come into my line of vision.

   I do not know how long the lights were within my sight or the distance they covered during that period. I could not distinguish any outline around them and do not know whether they came from very large aircraft or five smaller ones flying in formation.

The only portion of [redacted]'s statement made with assurance was that he had seen five (5) lights traveling West in vee-formation and had heard no sound.
