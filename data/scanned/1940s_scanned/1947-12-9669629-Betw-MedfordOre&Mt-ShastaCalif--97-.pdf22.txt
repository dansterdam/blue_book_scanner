UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #94 -- 42° 20.5' N, 114° 22.2' N -- 30 November 1947

This incident and incidents #9, #9C, and #7, which describe 
the same object, clearly refer to a thoroughly authenticated fireball.
Those sightings can be dismissed with finality by the following quo-
tation from Popular Astronomy, October, 1943:

Fireball of 1947 -- Loc. 9J
Harvey S. Hoyer

On this date at 7:30 p. m. PST a brilliant fireball
appeared travelling westward over Southern Oregon.
Prof. L. in the Mount Palomar area was reporting from
the Harvard Grid, which supplied various reports on 
these radio meteor trails to him for the Grid. He sent
both his solution and the 47 reports to the Flower
Observatory where another solution was independently made.
Ours agreed closely in all respects with that of Prof 
except for the heights.

The meteor was most peculiarly reported to be bluish-
green in color. It appeared to explode twice, lighting
up the countryside to close observers.
The sound phenomena were limited to 6 out of the 47
observers.

From the height at which this meteor exploded it is
doubtful whether any fragments reached the ground.

It is clear from the general agreement with this of obser-
vations given in incidents #94-#97 inclusive that this fireball was
the object being described.
