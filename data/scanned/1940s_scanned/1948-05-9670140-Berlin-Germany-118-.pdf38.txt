AFFIDAVIT

January 7, 1948
Franklin, Kentucky

I, William C. [unclear] of Route [unclear], Lake Spring Road, Franklin, Kentucky, Simpson County do state that on January 7, 1948 at approximately three-thirty (3:30) P.M., I heard an airplane overhead and in a few moments as I [was] driving down, and pulling up close to my entrance, I was just entering, after about three circles the airplane started [into] a powerful dive. Slowly rotating at this time, made a funnel going sideways when it started [down]. It stopped once as if it had turned over on its side and then continued on. It started off NW between [unclear] and the Portland Ave Subdivision and a trail was seen. After it or something left it there was a terrible crash. It wasn't loud when it hit the ground because it lost volume.

Witnesses: Wilberoot, [unclear], [unclear] and [possibly a name or location]. on route #100, Lake Spring Road, Franklin, Kentucky, this [unclear] of January 1948.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 7th day of January 1948.
