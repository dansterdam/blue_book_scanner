Incident #237 - Bourbon County, Kentucky - 16 January 1949

There is some confusion as to whether the object or
the smoke trail reported in this incident was visible for fif-
teen minutes. If the object itself was, it could not have been
a meteor, but the gist of the report seems to indicate that only
the trail was visible for any length of time. In that case, it
could have been either the trail from a meteor or the vapor trail
from an aircraft; the description is not sufficient to distin-
guish the two. Other observers (not those reporting the incident)
indicated that the object was a high flying plane with a vapor
trail, but this does not necessarily exclude the meteoric hypo-
thesis, because of the general unfamiliarity of the public with
such phenomena.
