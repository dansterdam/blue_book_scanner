Incident #33, ae, -- pa*4

as bright as it is when most brilliant. However, under exceptionally
good atmospheric conditions and with the eye shielded from the direct
rays of the sun, Venus might be seen as an exceedingly tiny bright point
of light. It can be shown that it was definitely brighter than the
surrounding sky, for on this date in question Venus had a solid-angulated 
of 9 seconds of arc, or a total apparent surface area of approximately
125 square seconds. Assuming that a square second of sky would be a
trifle brighter than the fourth magnitude, a portion of the sky of the
same area presented by Venus would be about -.i.-i.a. magnitude. Since the
planet, however, was -.-., it was 5 times brighter than an equivalent
area of sky. While it is thus physically possible to see Venus at such 
times, usually its pinpoint character and the large expanse of sky
makes its casual detection very unlikely; i.e., however, a person happens
to look toward a point on the sky that is just a few minutes of arc
from the position of Venus, he is apt to be startled by its apparition
and to wonder who didn't also see it before. The chances, of course, of
looking at just the right spot are very few. Once done, however, it is
usually fairly easy to relocate the object and to call the attention of
others to it. However, atmospheric conditions must be exceptionally
good. It is improbable, for example, that Venus would be seen under
these circumstances in a large city.

It can be said, therefore, that a possible explanation for
the object sighted in the daytime in Incident #33, ae, -- is that it
