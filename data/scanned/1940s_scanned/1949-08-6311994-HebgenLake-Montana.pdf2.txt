15. No evidences of outward propulsion were evidenced by objects.
16. Object definitely had no fins, stabilizers or elevators.
17. Objects had no slots or duct openings.
18. Objects had a speed of about 1500 miles per hour. Informant
    was not able to accurately estimate this speed. Speed rating was
    obtained by finding the time the objects took to pass between known
    points.
19. Objects according to informant, sounded like a siren and the
    sound was continuous.
20. Six of the objects faded from view according to informant. Two
    of the objects crashed in the surrounding area. The possibility
    of fragments or other physical evidence was taken into consideration
    and a three day search was instituted, grappling hooks being
    employed for the object that was supposed to have crashed into
    the water.

RELATIVE TO THE OBSERVER

1.
2.
3.
4.    West Yellowstone, Montana
      Hebgen Lake Lodge, West Yellowstone, Montana
      is employed by Mr. ****
      for the ********* *** and has been employed as a
      for approximately two months as of 9 august 1949. Mr. ****
                          duties entail that he also be in charge of the
      boat landing and dock area.

5. Observer's hobbies are his business, namely, hunting and fishing.
   Observer has had limited experience, little formal education
   and is virtually without qualification as pertains to aeronautical
   matters.

6. The observer should be a good judge as to the determination of
   color, size and speed of objects, however, after conversing with
   observer for a period of three days, it was felt that he is
   extremely prone to exaggerate, particularly as to the speed
   and number of things.

7. The employees of the Lodge seemed to agree that Mr. **** was
   a very reliable individual, regarding him as a sort of "Jewell"
   in the rough. They believed that because of his experience as
   a guide that he would be exceptionally well qualified to judge
   speed, color, size, and to be possessed of a quick and discerning
   eye. They stated that he knew nothing of 'flying discs' never
   having read about them at all. (This statement was open to
   doubt, inasmuch as an article about "flying discs" was in the
   boathouse where informant worked). It was agreed by all
   that the **** would be alo to take us directly to the
   objects. This he failed to do in almost three days of searching.
   A check with Deputy Sheriff of ****, West Yellowstone, indicated
   that Mr. **** had an excellent reputation, was considered an
   excellent **** and had a fair reputation for being truthful.
