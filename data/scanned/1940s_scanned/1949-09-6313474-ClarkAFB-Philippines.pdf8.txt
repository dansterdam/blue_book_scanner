SUMMARY: (Limit space report to summary of report; use tape reports of two attached sheets for pamphlets. Use no technical terms or technical terms defined in text.)

1. At approximately 0800 hours ZEBRA, 8 September 1949, five officers of the 67th Fighter Squadron, 18th Fighter Group, observed a con-trail climbing at a 30 degree angle and at a high rate of speed in a Northerly direction. The object causing this con-trail was not identified. Several of the observers saw only the con-trail and did not see what had caused said con-trail.

2. Radar Warning at the time of sighting was in operation and was in the process of calibration, using two P-51 type aircraft for this purpose. The Fighter Interceptor Controller on duty did not identify any other aircraft in the air at that time and is of the opinion that the con-trail was formed by said two P-51 aircraft. This is discounted as thirty minutes time elapsed between the time of sighting and the time these two aircraft left Clark Air Force Base at an altitude of 30,000 feet, heading 360 degrees, and also only one con-trail was observed.

3. This section is unable to discern what object or phenomena caused the above mentioned con-trail.
