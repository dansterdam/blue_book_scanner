Lt. Col. Doyle lives January 6, 1949

other attempts by the crew of another aircraft lost plane to make a
position location were observed. And Finally, two ASIS inspectors
(who had no knowledge of the anomalous sounds observed earlier on
the night of December 30) reported precisely the same sort of anom-
alous sounds as heard at Station 370 at 0540 on the early morning of
December 31. These sounds were heard for several minutes and were
reported to have receded slowly toward the southeast.

7. If we assume that Stations 340 and 350 observed the same sound
sources at 2010 and 2020, then these sources as found to project into
points lying near the paved highway which leads up the mountain side to
Station 340. On the basis of the elevation determinations made at Station
340, it is furthermore found that as a "first source" would be about 100 feet
lower in elevation than Station 350 and the second source approximately 1350
feet lower than this station. The second differences in elevation could again
seem to suggest that the sound sources may have been situated on or near the
paved highway. However, the very general observations made by our experi-
mental man, Lieutenant at Station 350, are entirely incompatible with
the assumption that the sounds as heard at 2020 was only some 1350 feet
lower than Station 350. Actually, more than observation shows that
this second source was at an elevation of or 2020 feet, not feet above the
horizontal plane through Station 350. This means there has been approxi-
mately 10,000 feet ABOVE, not below, Station 340. This, impossibly large
discrepancy shows that our initial assumption is untenable and it there-
fore seems impossible to establish a concordance between observations made
at Stations 340 and 350 PRIOR to the bogey warnings, i.e., during the times
when the observers at Station 340 heard the sound only from within their
observation post in contrast to the observers at Station 350, who made their
observations in the open air. The observers inside the house at
Station 340 actually heard sound emanating from a group located high
above them, in accordance with the conditions imposed by the oppressive
atmosphere, what they heard might well have been so distorted by the struc-
tural materials surrounding them and by their predisposition to assign all noises
to high-flying traffic sources that they would have been led to report such
elevations as were measured for them at Station 340 on January 5.

8. In sharp contrast to the discordances noted in the observations pre-
ceding the bogey warning at 2050, the open-air observations made at and
immediately following this warning show a quite satisfactory concordance.
In fact, if we assume that all three stations, 340, 350, and 390 were listen-
ing to the same sound source at 2050 and shortly thereafter, then the actual
elevation above sea level of this sound source as computed from the angular
observation observed at Stations 390 is 11,230 feet, at Station 350 is 12,213
feet and at Station 340 is 10,196 feet. The rise or that is, the

a minute and a half in latitude. In view of the nature of the noise observed.
