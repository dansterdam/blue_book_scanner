being pushed like that? Why the difference in
size of those two spheres? Oh why wasn't I
born with brains so I could have been a scientist
so I would know about such things!!!!!!!!

I didn't contact the newspaper here because I
didn't want the probable attendant publicity. I
hadn't the slightest idea who to contact but I felt
certain that somewhere in these United States there
were so me men to whom these bits of information
would mean something. I believe it was Dr. Tomp-
bury that gave so little real help save a form with a list
of sun, moon, stars. Fabulous prevost could have had
their name and address in connection with expryimental
work on rockets or space ships. . . no response from them.
Then a few weeks later I thought of contacting an
F.B.I. Agent here by the name of Al cot Furdy to tell
him the story and perhaps he would know the proper
source to relay it to. . . . Only trouble was the about
going to his office and leaving word for him to tel-
ephone I got cold feet because it would sound so
ridiculous to say to a perfect stranger, "I saw a
spaceship." Who could I contact.

This week's Post put an end to such timidity and
Dr. Irving Langmuir's qujou gowed me into action.
That a spaceman meeting atomic power are top secret
wit our government, fine, let's keep it that way.
But on the other hand, if such knowledge is not ours
for heaven sakes let's not just twiddle our thumbs
and down that their existence ouuauae we don't happen
to have yet figured out how it is accomplished.

Yours
