Incident #233 -- near Honolulu Hotel, Hawaii -- 6 February 1950

There is clearly no astronomical explanation for this incident.

The account given seems trustworthy, even though only one person saw two circular discs. This report differs from many others in that the description of maneuvers described by the object is definite, rather than vague.
