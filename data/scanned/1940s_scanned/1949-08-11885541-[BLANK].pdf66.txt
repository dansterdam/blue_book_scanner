Incident #155 -- Columbus, Ohio -- 31 July 1948

This incident and incident #157, which obviously refer 
to the same object, must be considered together. The object fell 
to earth and was retrieved; it proved to be a "country fair bal-
loon," once quite common in this part of the country. Usually 
they are lighted in mid-afternoon, having one or more fire-pots 
to provide the hot air. They then rise and stay aloft for several 
hours before finally falling to earth.

It is highly probable that the object considered in in-
cident #155, which was observed a few hours earlier on the same 
day and near the same location, was this object, seen while it was 
still high in the sky.
