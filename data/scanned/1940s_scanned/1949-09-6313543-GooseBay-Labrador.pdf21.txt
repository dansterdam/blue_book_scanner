Investigation initiated by District Commander, DO #13. On
14 September 1949, Mr. *EBRT ******** observed a shiny object
in the northeast about twenty miles awasy. The object was
about 25 feet ovbrall and consisted of an eight foot disk sus-
ported by an eight foot win*-like structure on opposite sides
which apparently provided noulsion. The object moved direct-
ly overhead maintining; a strait* course at an altitude of
8,000 to 10,000 feet and a speed of 400-500 *P*, Object was
sighted in conjunction with a four-engine bomber which was
later identified as flying on a training course at much
lower altitude. The object was in view 60 to 90 seconds and
finally disappeared behind a line of hills in the southw*st.
The weather was clear with thin scattered clouds at 20,000
feet with a visibility of 25 miles.
