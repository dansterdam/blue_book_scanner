NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

  On 4 March 1949 at 1420 I spotted an object Northeast of
Watson Laboratories. I was standing in the west side of the
parking lot.

  To me this object appeared disc-shaped and traveling at
a very high rate of speed from Northeast to North. This ap-
peared to be a very bright or shiny look. It did not appear
to change shape while it changed its course.
