TWXLOGS
FROM:
Letter Directed to Dr. E. Z. Landsberg  
from

Dr Lincoln LaPaz, Director
Institute of Meteoritics
University of New Mexico
January 12, 1949

In my opinion, ****** observation (which, as the first
paragraph of his letter indicates, reached me only through his
chance reading of my article in Science Illustrated) is of the
utmost significance. What he observed was certainly not a 
"bouncing meteorite." A much more reasonable interpretation 
of his observation is that he saw a luminous object following a
W. or W-like path (somewhat as comets travel) in the field of the Los 
Alamos fireball of 1948, December 20 GMT 5h 50m, the point from
which same observed being situated very nearly in the plane of
the trajectory of the luminous object and the direction of motion
of this object being almost directly away from ****** so that the
observed angular altitude of the first crest on the W. or W-like path
was quite large (at least 17°) while the observed angular altitude
for the second, more distant, crest was only about 10°.

In view of the fact that such important observation came to
attention only by accident, it seems to me that immediate steps
should be taken to interrogate all former and present AAF pilots
(especially all pilots now flying in Germany or elsewhere in 
Europe) in order to determine whether additional observations
similar to that made by ******* have been made. Would it not be
possible to require all pilots and co-pilots to report in detail
on any fire-balls they may observe which they have any reason to
believe are definitely or possibly non-meteoritic?
