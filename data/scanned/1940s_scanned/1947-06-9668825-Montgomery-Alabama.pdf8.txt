```
At approximately 2120 Central time, a light, with a brillance slightly
greater than a star appeared from the West traveling in an easterly
direction at a high rate of speed. It first appeared slightly above the horizon
of a clear moon-light night. There was no audible sound. It appeared to
be at great height as it is with missile to determine the altitude.
It traveled a zig-zag course with frequent bursts of speed similar to a
water bug's gait spurts and stops across the surface of water. Directly overhead
it changed course 90ยบ into the South. After 5 minutes it turned southwest
and was lost in the brilliancy of the moon. At 2145 Central it was not
longer possible to observe it.

A call was placed to Maxwell Fld operations concerning the phenomena and
inquiry was made if any experimental aircraft were scheduled for a flight
in the vicinity but the reply was negative. No plausible explanation was
offered for the unusual action of this source of light which acted contrary
to any common aerodynamical laws. Two of the above noted observers were
rated pilots and the other to, air intelligence officers.
