Incident #106-- Bakersfield, California -- 6 March 1948

While this report taken alone, with allowances made for subjective reporting, could be considered as applying to a disintegrating meteorite, the occurrence of at least three very similar incidents (see # 107, 103, 109) at the same location, over a time interval of a few days, is sufficient to make this hypothesis completely untenable.

The description applies more closely to the "star shell" (a projectile which after disintegration emits a parachute to bring instruments safely to the ground), with which this investigator was familiar during the war, than to anything else.
