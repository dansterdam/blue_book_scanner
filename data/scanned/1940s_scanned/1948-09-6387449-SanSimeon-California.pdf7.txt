The writing contains some unclear words and phonetic approximations, which may indicate the writer was attempting to capture spoken words or technical terms unfamiliar to them. The text may be referencing some kind of visual sighting or radar contact, possibly within the context of a UFO sighting, given the document's association with Project Blue Book.
