STATEMENT

Personally appeared before me a commissioned officer of the U.S.
Army's Air Forces, a credible witness, in the person of _________, and
made the following statement under oath:

"My name is ________. I am employed by the Civil Aeronautics
Administration. Before my present employment, I was in the U.S. Air Corps
for 12 years. I was a B-29 instructor pilot and at present, according to
law, possess a secret.

"On the 14th day of December, 1948, at about 1625 hours, I was on a routine
flight from Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, to Kirtland Air Force
Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. I was flying a T-6 type aircraft, at an
altitude of 8,500 feet and a 210Â° true course. My co-pilot at the time was very
able to identify the land-marks between Fort Worth, Texas, and Tucumcari, New
Mexico. In the vicinity soon as we came to the conclusion we were airborne
and myself occupied the pilot and co-pilots seat respectively of our aircraft.
Our altitude was 6500 feet and our compass heading was 100 degrees. Suddenly,
I noticed another aircraft entering the distance ahead, and slightly to
the right. I looked away for a few seconds and when I looked again, I saw the
round object converging upon us from about two o'clock position. It was at
the same altitude level as was plane and went travelling at a tremendous rate of
speed. My first reflection was that this object was a fighter type aircraft
glowing for the effect of the altitude position, but very soon discovered
faster than any jet I ever recalled seeing. Observing it a moment, we were
very able to figure out that the object was of no aircraft make. Very suddenly it
changed its course so that it crossed over in front of us. It also seemed to
come to an abrupt stop and appeared to bob up and down. Now I could see that
it was perfectly- circular in shape and very large. Major ________ asked me
I saw what he saw, to which I replied that I did. The Major then said "What do you
suppose that is?" I answered, "I don't know." He signaled for the flight
engineer (S/Sgt. ______) to come forward and view the spectacle. He did so
but he too was unable to identify the weird object. The three of us watched
as it accelerated: then slowed and finally, rapidly, in a zigzag course
again and went in a westerly direction. "Nothing it disappeared with
great swiftness, just as though it had been turned out. I estimate the
length of time we observed all this to be three minutes."

Further deponent sayeth not.

1st lt., USAF

Subscribed and sworn to before me this the 15th day of December, 1948, at
Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
