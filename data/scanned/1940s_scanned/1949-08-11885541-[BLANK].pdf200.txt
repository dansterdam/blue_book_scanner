Incident #20 -- Portland, Oregon -- 14 June 1947

There is nothing whatsoever in this incident to suggest that
the objects observed were of astronomical origin. Their maneuvers
and the relatively low time they were in sight definitely precludes
any possible astronomical interpretation.

It is of interest to note that in this locality and at this
season other possibly-similar non-astronomical incidents were reported --
e.g., #17 and #68.
