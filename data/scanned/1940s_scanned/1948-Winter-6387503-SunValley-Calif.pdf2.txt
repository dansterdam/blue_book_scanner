Questionnaire Checks Flying Saucer Stories

WASHINGTON, April 28 –(P)– Technical intelligence division experts can’t figure out the flying saucer mystery, but they have a theory that could lead to the answer.

So, they have prepared a questionnaire for anybody in the air forces who thinks he has seen a "saucer."

The questionnaire is hush-hush.

It is part of "Project Saucer," the air forces’ systematic investigation of the reports from all over the United States about the strange missiles. 

Many of the discs that have been reported were high in the sky – some as high as 40,000 feet. The questionnaire is designed to weed out possible cases of misidentification of known types of aircraft or natural phenomena.

The air forces say it has found mental answers to about 60 percent of the 270 cases it has investigated. But it has left a question mark behind the other 40 percent.

Some cases involved real objects because expert pilots have chased them. One national guard pilot died because he pursued some discs too high.
