5-Second Saucer
Zips Across Sky;
Seen By 304 Men

You can take your flying
saucers any way you like (per-
sonally we prefer them station-
ary, with a good, hot cup of
coffee in them)—but there was
a good one over Seattle last
Sunday for about five seconds.

It was sighted by Bob Byers
who at one point it out to Bill
Bunce. Both are rivet buckers in
Shop 304 and they had just re-
turned from playing golf. Byers
was lying on his back, resting, in
Bunce’s front yard at 8423 47th
Avenue S.

"It looked black, against the
blue sky, and was traveling at a
tremendous rate of speed," said
Byers, who describes the observed
whirl only dispassionately and
whether there are, or aren’t, such
things as flying disc.

"We called up one of the down-
town newspapers and told them
about it. They got it nearly right,
but they said we said it was 50,000
feet high. We didn’t. We said we
thought it was about 15,000 feet
high," said Byers.

The object grew smaller as it
sped along, and made no noise.
There was no vapor trail behind
it. It was gone in five seconds.

"We just tell the details as we
saw them," explained Bunce. "We
don't know what it was, but we
know we never saw anything like
it before."
