Incident: 223 -- Los An[TEXT OBSCURED] -- 23 November 194[OBSCURED BY BLACK MARK]

The subject described here wants to place to the mysterious fall of slow moving "green fireballs." See report on incident #223 for detailed discussion.

It can be said, however, that if this is regarded as an isolated incident, the assertion is not yet, different from that of a fireball. It is the occurrence of these incidents in a seemingly definite pattern, that is now shown by indices the interolic hypothesis.
