The object reported was probably a planet. Jupiter at this time was approx-
180° ahead of the sun on this date. With allowance for error in direction (2°)
Jupiter would have been in this position, however there appears to be no
explanation for the statement that during the period object was under observa-
tion no movement was noticed. If this object were actually Jupiter then there should
have been an observed deviation of 22 1/2° during the 1 1/2 hour object was
under observation.
