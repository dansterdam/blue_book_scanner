SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

11 May 1949

TO: Commanding General
      Air Material Command
      Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
      Dayton, Ohio
      ATTN: TDCINXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAAXS,
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 having been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau, comments based on this review are included.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction toward which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Earth Setting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
