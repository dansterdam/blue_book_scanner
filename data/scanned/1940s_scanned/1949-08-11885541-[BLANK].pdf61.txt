Incident #130 -- Osborn, Ohio -- 9 July 1949

There is no obvious astronomical explanation for this incident.

The present investigator was struck first by the fact that the description of the incident states, "...with about a quarter moon rising in the east-southeast." The quarter moon can never be seen in that position at 2147 hours (local time), for the quarter moon sets at approximately midnight. The moon at that date was not yet at the first quarter, and it set at Osborn at about 2300. The correct statement would be, "...with about a quarter moon setting in the west-northwest." This, oddly enough, is the quadrant of the sky in which the object was reported to be seen. In what direction, then, was the observer really looking?

Although the sky was reported as clear, could it possibly be that rapidly scudding clouds periodically obscured the setting moon -- a moon which, incidentally, does have a pale yellowish-white light?

Other possibilities that suggest themselves are detached auroral streamers or floodlights or searchlights playing on the sky.
