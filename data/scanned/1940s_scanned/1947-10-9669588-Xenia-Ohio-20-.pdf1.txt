The image does not contain any photographs. It is a scanned page of a text document, which appears to be a form or report from "Project Blue Book." The quality of the scan is quite poor, which might affect the accuracy with which I can transcribe the text. Here is the text as best as I can discern:

Again, due to the quality of the scan, some information might be missing or incorrectly transcribed.
