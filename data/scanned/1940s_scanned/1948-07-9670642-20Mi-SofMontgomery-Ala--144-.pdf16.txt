SUBJECT: Project "WARM" CHARACTER: Special Investigation DATE: 9 Sep 43
FILE NO. 333.5 (24-1)

DETAILS: (Cont'd)

A. 24. I would say that it looked like it was about the size of a B-29.
It might have been a little larger, in circumference. It was
too large a bomb. It's hard to tell, a dark color and constructed
of an unknown metallic type material.

25. What would you say its speed was in comparison with other type
aircraft?

A. 25. About seven hundred miles per hour.

26. How did you arrive at that estimate?

A. 26. I have seen P-60 and P-61 type aircraft flying but this was one
of the fastest objects I have ever seen. I saw German V-Is in
the summer of 1944 and they were fast, but this one was even
faster. This object was much larger, A V-1 is very small and
only goes about three hundred miles per hour speed.

27. How did it disappear?

A. 27. Just like an airplane in normal flight fading away from normal
vision.

28. Was there any sound or odors at that time?

A. 28. I heard no sound and everything was quiet. No engines were
running up at that time.

29. How about the maneuverability and exhaust trail of this object?

A. 29. It was flying straight and level and took a changing southwest
course while in sight. The flame seemed to be longer, maybe
due to the object moving through the air.

30. Had you consumed any alcohol in the preceding four or five hours?

A. 30. No Sir, I do not drink.

31. Did you ever see any planes in "Duck Dodgers" comics that resembled
this object?

A. 31. Maybe the length and pointiness resembled, but as far as the ridge,
I couldn't tell if this object had any.

32. What did you say your educational background and Air Force
experience was?

A. 32. I was a high school graduate and I was in 17Â½ years of your
years.
