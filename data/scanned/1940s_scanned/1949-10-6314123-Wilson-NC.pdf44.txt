HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, New Mexico
14 October 1949

On 11 October 1949, at approximately 1100 hours, I was located
at Ryan #4 Site, at HAFB, as a member of a balloon launching and tracking
crew. We had launched a balloon flight and were tracking the flight
with a Theodolite. Sgt. MARION H. GRAVES was tracking with the Theo-
dolite and I was engaged in recording Azimuth and Elevation angles.
I happened to peer into the sky to the Northwest and observed a white
object moving at a high rate of speed. This object appeared to move
in a straight path and disappeared from view to the Southeast in approx-
imately 10 to 15 seconds. This object appeared to be moving at a
greater speed than any object I have ever observed, with the exception
of a falling star.
