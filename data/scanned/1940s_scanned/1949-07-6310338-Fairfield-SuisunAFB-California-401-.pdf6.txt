Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

The following is a report of an observation made from the Fairfield-

Suisun Air Force Base control tower on 16 July 1949 between the hours

0500 and 0520 EPT.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At approximately 0500, 16 July 1949, T/Sgt Vita, the control tower

operator on duty, asked me to go up in the tower to observe this particular

phenomena. Upon arriving in the tower Sgt Vita told me position to look

with the seven power binoculars available and asked me what I saw. The

position was approx. 215 Deg. mag. and approx. 3 to 5 deg.-elevation. At

an altitude that I would judge to be well above 35,000 ft. and at an unde-

termined distance, but further than 100 miles, there appeared to be a very

large sphere, of unknown size and composition. The sun was just coming

above the horizon and the sphere seemed to reflect the sunlight much the

same as the aluminum skin of an airplane. There was no apparent motion

to the sphere although the winds above 35,000 ft are usually quite strong

and westerly. The sphere remained under observation until 0520 when it

was obscured by a layer of haze, at about 3,000 ft, over the Vallejo

area.

The weather at the time was clear with 20 miles visibility except 

for a fog bank over the hills between Cordelia and Vallejo and a thin haze

layer, base 30L,000 ft over the San Pablo Bay.

                                                                            /s/ Robert P. McCabe
