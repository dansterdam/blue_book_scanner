UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #63 -- W of Helena, Montana -- 29 July 1947

With the exception of the color ["blue colored nickel"]
and the lack of statements concerning a trail, the object reported 
in this incident at very well have been a daylight meteor.
Bright meteors have been observed to glow in various colors. The manner
of disappearance ("melted into thin air") further supports this view. 
Time in sight and speed also coincide. In short, it is more likely that
this object was a bright meteor than that it was anything else.
