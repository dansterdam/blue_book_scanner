Subject:  Inusual Luminous Phenomenon (Third Report)

In the second report of this series, a description was given of the trail
seen through the atmosphere of the green fireball of 1948, December 12, in the
vicinity of the coordinates: Latitude 35° 50', Longitude 106° 10', and to have disappeared 
near a point with the coordinates: Latitude 36° 15', Longitude 106° 30'. 
The fireball appears to have traversed an almost horizontal path, and at an elevation of
30 degrees, with a length of about 24 miles, at an elevation of about 10 miles above 
10 miles per second. The fireball was correspondingly constant in its luminosity 
3 and a half to 4 times the brightness of the full moon observed over an interval of 
3 and a half miles per second, depending on conditions of the report).

12 Security Maintenance Gang, is focused on the fireball of 1948, December 20 was
