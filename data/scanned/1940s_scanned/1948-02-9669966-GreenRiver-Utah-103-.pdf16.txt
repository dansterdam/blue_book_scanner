```
5. Mr. Morning exhibited a series of four photographs taken of a meteorite 
dust cloud or "train" taken on 20 May 1944 by Cpl. A. L. Aenis, ASN 37307171,
c/o Photo Section, PAAF, Pampa, Texas. The present address of the corporal is 
unknown, but his photographs are copyrighted. A portion of them and other 
photographs of similar nature would be valuable for slide or other 
comparative purposes. Mr. Morning requested that if the copyright owner of these
photographs is located, he be informed so that he may obtain additional copies.

6. Mr. Morning quoted the book, "The Book of the Damned" by Charles Fort 
as an interesting collection of unexplained aerial phenomena. He said that 
these incidents are authentic, but Mr. Fort's conclusions and interpretations 
are fantastic.

7. Mr. Morning said that he will keep this office informed or his opinions 
on any future sightings of aerial phenomena that come to his knowledge.

                                                           /s/ Marvin W. McCard
                                                           Marvin W. McCard
                                                           Major, USAF
