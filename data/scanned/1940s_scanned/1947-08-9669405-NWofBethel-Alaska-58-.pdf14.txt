UNCLASSIFIED COPY

BETHEL, ALASKA

5 August 1947

Subject: Matters of National Interest

To: Commanding Officer, Alaska Communication System
550 Federal Office Building, Seattle 4, Washington

1. Per AGAO-S 319.1 the following report is submitted on a matter which may become of national interest. Captain [redacted] and his CoPilot [redacted] have stated that on August 4, 1947 they sighted and followed a flying saucer Northwest of Bethel Alaska. This object was bigger than the Douglas DC-3 they were flying, crossed their course at right angles to them. It was flying at an altitude of one thousand feet. They swung in behind it and followed it at a air speed of one hundred seventy miles per hour but it was out of sight in four minutes. They state the object was smooth surfaced and streamlined with no visible means of propulsion whatsoever.

2. It is realized that the Fourth Air Force claims there are no such things but Captain [redacted] is Chief Pilot for [redacted] flying service and is not a man given to exaggeration. In view of the excellent reputation of Captain [redacted] and the fact that no one here doubts in the least but that he actually saw this object, this report is turned in for any action deemed necessary by your offices.
