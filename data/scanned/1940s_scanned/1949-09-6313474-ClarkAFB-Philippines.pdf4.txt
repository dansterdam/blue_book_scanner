AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Rp 365-49                                  PAGE 10 OF 12 PAGES

STATEMENT

At about 1200 hours, 8 September 1949, undersigned officer was at the PX Service
Station at Clark Air Force Base, and spotted a vapor trail south of the field,
coming from the direction of Florida Blanca. Approximately one and one half minutes
later the trail was far to the north. During the minute and a half that he watched
this vapor trail it did not appear to get wider from where he first saw it to where
he lost sight of it. This trail came from the direction of Florida Blanca going north
and passed over the west side of Clark Air Force Base, where it seemed to make a
slight change of course to the left, approximately 10°, and continued on in a
northerly direction. Undersigned officer could not tell whether or not the vapor
trail was changing altitude. It is hard to estimate the height of the vapor trail
but it seemed to be above 30,000 feet. He could not see what caused the vapor trail.
Where he saw the vapor trail make a slight change of course, the trail appeared to
burbia for about ten seconds and remain in a burble state. Then the vapor trail
resumed its straight unbroken form.

Undersigned officer had been flying from 0800 to 1145 hours, 8 September 1949,
at altitudes between 20,000 and 30,000 feet and watched GCI (Ground Control Intercept)
ships flying at altitudes of 25,000 to 30,500 feet, and they were leaving no vapor
trails and he was leaving no vapor trail.

STATEMENT

On the 8th of September 1949, while on duty as Fighter Interception Controller,
had a flight of two F-51's at 30,000 feet. They left the base at approximately 1135
hours on a heading of 360° making good a course of 350° for approximately 120 miles.
At this time they were given a holding back to base.

It is my opinion that the contrails that were sighted twenty-five minutes later
were made by this flight and were delayed in forming.

From my observation I could not see any other aircraft in the air at that
altitude during this time.
