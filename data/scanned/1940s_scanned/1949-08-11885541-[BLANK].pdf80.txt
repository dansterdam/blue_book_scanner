Incidents:181-3 and Inc.,n â€“ 22 July 1948

The information on inc,n is too limited even for guesswork. It is extremely difficult to take at face value the 
report of an "aircraft with two decks and no wings travelling
with supersonic speed, even if "seen four times through clouds"
by the Chief of the Court of Jammu and his daughter. It seems
much more probable that the observers had a subjective impression
of ordinary aircrafts or a fireball. Even though these two items
are at opposite ends of the scale, there is nothing in the evidence to favor one or the other.

In passing, it is interesting to note that this incident occurred just four days before the famous "Maury Island 
ship". Maybe our visitors from Mars were cruising around?
