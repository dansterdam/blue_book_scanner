UNCLASSIFIED

DETAILS

On 20 August 1949, Mr. ****** ****** contacted Special Agent von *****ER and offered to make the trip to Salisbury, Maryland, on 22 August 1949, and make available all information in his possession concerning Gray Goose Airways. Mr. ****** was the original informant in this case, but he refused to cooperate with agents of the Baltimore Detachment, 4th OSI District, until newspaper publicity was given the story.

On 22 August 1949, Mr. ****** ******* was accompanied to Salisbury, Maryland, by Special Agent MARCEL D'FUOGE. Mr. **** turned over about twenty-five (25) items of data, including newspaper accounts, stock certificates, photographs, personal correspondence between **** and his father, and program brochures. Photostatic copies of items of data pertinent to this investigation will be forwarded at a later date.

Mr. ***** stated in substance that he felt quite certain that Mr. ***, had no intention of defrauding any of the individuals concerned in the Gray Goose Corporation, and expressed the thought that Mr. **** actually "had something" in his ideas and just the bad luck and lack of funds had caused the failure of his project. Mr. **** expressed complete confidence in ****'s ability and expressed the hope that some day **** would perfect one of his experimental-type airplanes and be able to fly off all of his contracted debts.

Information developed previously in this investigation indicated that fabrication of the rotor-plane took place in a carpenter shop somewhere on Barre Street, Baltimore, Maryland. On 22 August 1949, Special Agent OTTO D. SUNDSTAD interviewed MR. ******** ************, 510 W. Barre Street. Mr. ********* revealed that a carpenter by the name of WALTER DOWLING had resided at 506 Barre Street. Mr. ********* stated that DOWLING had an office in the basement of his home and a work-shop in the garage at the rear of the building. Mr. ********* believes that DOWLING is dead, and further stated that DOWLING moved from 510 W. Barre Street about ten years ago to a location at Edmonston Avenue and Rolling Road, Baltimore, Maryland. DOWLING had a son who assisted him in his work, and
it is believed that the son now resides in Edmonston Village, Baltimore, Maryland.

On 22 August 1949, Sgt. HENRY T. COCHRANE and Pvt. ANTHONY DUMMER, Baltimore Police Department, Southern District, were interviewed by Special Agent SUNDSTAD in reference to a carpenter shop located on S. Barre Street. Both officers stated that they had been working in the area a number of years and had never heard of a carpenter shop in that area.
