AIR INTELLIGENCE REPORT NO. 100-203-79                 November 1948
Incident #86 -- Henieorth Beach, Helenare on September 1944
                               October 1944
                                2 June 1947

This incident contains nothing astronomical.

it is entirely possible that the objects observed on 
these three separate dates were "bumble bees," ram-jet missiles,
as fired from sort-ios by the Applied Physics Laboratory of
vohns Mopkins University. Since the hour of observation of the
various sightings (and the exact day of the first two) is not
oiven in material submitted to this investigator, positive iden-
tification cannot be made; but if these facts are known, inquiry
at the above-mentioned laboratory (address: 8621 Georgia
Avenue, Silver Spring, Maryland) might bring forth definite identi-
fication.
