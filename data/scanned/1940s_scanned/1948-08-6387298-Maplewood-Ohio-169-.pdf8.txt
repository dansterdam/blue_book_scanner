NOTE

2 September 1948

Wright A. Field

Mr. [Name Redacted] of MPAA, advises the following:

Mr. [Name Redacted] contacted a man in [Location Redacted] on August 1948, who
stated that on that date at 5:30 A.M. he observed a 29" Army silver colored
shape which seemed to rise from behind his woods and continued to fly
across his farm. During flight it seemed to increase, a silvery substance which
floated earthward. While still viewed by this farmer, the sphere disinte-
grated in mid-air. This man's name is [Name Redacted] of [Location Redacted], Ohio,
[Contact Information Redacted]. Information is rather important since the
farmer concerned was a man approximately 50 some odd years of age and appear-
ed to be very conscious and sincere while relating this incident.

The subject seemed to have risen while the two men were talking and
an airplane happened to fly overheard whereas the farmer then related the
foregoing experience. Mr. [Name Redacted] could be contacted in this event that any
assistance is deemed advisible should a meeting with this farmer be advisable.

[Signature Redacted]
