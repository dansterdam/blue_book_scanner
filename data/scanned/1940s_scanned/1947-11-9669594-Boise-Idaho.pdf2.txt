The photograph in the image appears to be redacted with black marks obscuring whatever was originally there, so I cannot provide any descriptive details about what is underneath the redaction marks.

Here is the text output from the document:

---
incident #25 - Boise, Idaho -- date unknown (possibly November 1947).

Very little can be said of this incident, inasmuch as the
date and exact time of observation, speed, altitude and size of
object, and length of time in sight were not stated. The signal and
time in sight are particularly important in forming a judgment.
In the absence of this information, the most that can be said is
that the object might have been a fireball.
