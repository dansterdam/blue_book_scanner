The image in question does not contain a photograph. It is an image of a page with a document showing text and some sort of form or log. Due to the resolution and quality of the image, accurately recognizing and transcribing the text is a challenge, and some parts of the text may be difficult to discern. However, I will do my best to provide you with the text that is relatively clear:
