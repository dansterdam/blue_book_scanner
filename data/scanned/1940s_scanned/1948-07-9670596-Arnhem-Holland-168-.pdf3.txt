Incident No. 168 -- 20 July 1948, 1730 hours, Arnhem, The
Hague.
Observer saw an object intermittently through clouds four times.
The object had two decks and no wings, was said to be very high, with
speed comparable to V-2.

A/C Opinion: Insufficient information. It may be well to point
out that the V-2 is not visible in flight, therefore, it follows that
this object would not have been visible as described if traveling at
that speed.
