Incident No. 135 - Between 15 and 20 August 1947, 2130 hours, 
Wauver, South Dakota.

An Air Force officer saw twelve "flying discs" four miles away over the 
Rapid City air Force base in a "tight diamond" formation at 4000 to 
10,000 feet descending to 6000 feet at 500 MPH. Objects made a forma-
tion turn and climbed at 300 to 400 degrees climbing. Objects were very 
maneuverable, remaining equally spaced in all maneuvers. Each object 
was 100 feet in length, oval-shaped and brilliant yellowish-whites. No 
sound nor exhaust trail were heard or seen.

AC Opinion: This reporter should be a reliable observer. How-
ever, It has been shown that distance cannot be estimated without prior
knowledge of the size of an object. If distance is not known, speed 
cannot be estimated. More notable perhaps is that such observation
could be remembered in a report made one year after the minute detail
and yet the date was not remembered. Dr. Fykec suggested the possibil-
ity of detached auroral streamers.
