11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer sighted an object which appeared to be disc shaped and flat, and from the sun's reflection appeared to be made of a metal similar to that used in airplane construction. There was no evidence of exhaust or vapor trails and no sound was heard. The object faded from view about 3 minutes after it was first sighted. Flight was level and constant.
