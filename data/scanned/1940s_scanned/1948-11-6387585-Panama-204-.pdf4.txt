Incident #204 - Panama - 3 November 1948

It seems entirely probable that the object sighted in this incident was the comet 1948l, which had been discovered two days earlier in Australia. The comet was suitably placed for observation near the equator and in the southern hemisphere. The time of observation also checks closely with the time of visibility. There is no single statement in the limited report that contradicts this comet hypothesis. If the observer had given a visual bearing of the object, then one would have clinched this matter.
