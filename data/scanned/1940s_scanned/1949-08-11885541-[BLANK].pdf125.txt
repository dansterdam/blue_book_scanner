SUMMARY OF RESULTS

What, in particular, was gathered from the evidence concerning the astronomical character of the objects observed?

Of the 244 incidents submitted, 7 are excluded from all statistical reckoning: 1 is identified (in the subject report) as a hoax, 3 are duplicates, and 3 contain no information. In summarizing the findings in the remaining 237, two systems of classification are possible:

First, all incidents can be placed in one of two classes:

1) those which under no stretch of the imagination can be regarded as astronomical or extra-terrestrial (extra-terrestrial throughout this investigation refers solely to natural objects not originating on earth; it does not include "space ships from other planets"), and

2) those which either are definitely astronomical or can by suitable manipulation of the evidence be construed as such. The object here is to segregate all cases in which any vestige of astronomical origin is indicated. When this division is made, 111, or 47%, fall into the definitely non-astronomical category, or, conversely stated, 126, or 53%, might conceivably be considered (although the likelihood of their being so may be very small) as extra-terrestrial or astronomical in origin. The exact percentage is not important. The significant thing is that over 50% of the incidents might possibly be explained astronomically, if wide enough tolerances were allowed.
