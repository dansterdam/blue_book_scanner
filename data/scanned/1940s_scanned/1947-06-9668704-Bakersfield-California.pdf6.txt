Incident No. 29 - 11 June 1947, 1200 and 1415, between Muroc, Calif. 
and Lake of the Woods, Metcalf, reported sighting ten and four balloon 
objects at 20,000 ft altitude, traveling 230 miles in a loose diamond seven.
Although the objects were apparently at a considerable distance, the reporter 
described them as being similar to a US-1 Flying Flapjack. He stated 
that he attached no particular importance to this sighting until he read of 
the Cascade mountain sightings (Incident No. 17). He then recalled this in-
cident.

A. AC Opinion: There is no information contained in this report to refute 
the assumption that these objects were ordinary aircraft beyond the range of 
identification. The fact that no one else in Murocfield reported observing 
anything unusual, tends to substantiate this conclusion.
