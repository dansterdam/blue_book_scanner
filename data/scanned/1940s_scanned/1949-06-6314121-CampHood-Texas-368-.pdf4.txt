Ball Of Fire
In Night Sky
Awes Florida

MIAMI, Fla., June 6.—(UP)—
Thousands of Floridians wound-
ered today whether the explosive
ball of fire and trail of light
they saw in the sky last night
was a meteor, a bomb, or some-
thing even more mysterious.
Residents in every section of
the state saw the aerial explo-
sion, according to the highway patrol, which was swamped
with telephone calls from citi-
zens demanding to know what
had happened.
Police and authorities at mili-
tary installations also reported
seeing the “ball of fire” that
streaked across the sky.
At MacDill Field in Tampa,
the Army Flight Service ac-
knowledged having seen the phe-
nomenon but clamped a “re-
stricted” label on whatever fur-
ther information it had concern-
ing the flash.
Officers at MacDill Field said
that since the “flying saucer
scare” they had a practice of
withholding statements until
they could thoroughly explain
the cause of such phenomena.
Officials at the Naval airport
and Coast Guard here reported
that an explosion occurred with
a tremendous burst of light
across the sky at 7:50 p. m.
(EST). A trail of luminous
gases and particles streaked
across the sky for 50 to 60 miles,
they said, and was visible for
25 minutes.
Two forecasters at the Miami
weather bureau were outside
working with their instruments
and described the phenomenon.
T. L. Mcee said the sighted
object “appeared somewhat
smaller than a full moon. It lit
up the sky to the northwest and

fell vertically, leaving a lumin-
ous, weaving trail.”
W. R. Davis said he had never
seen anything like it before. “A
meteor usually flashes and is
gone,” he said, “but this was a
larger explosion than that of an
ordinary meteor and the tail re-
mained visible for at least 25
minutes.”
