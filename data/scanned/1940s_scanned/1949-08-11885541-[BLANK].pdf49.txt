Incident #128 — Gibson, Ohio — 8 May 1948

Once again, the report given is entirely inadequate for
a conclusion. However, astronomical origin of the object or objects
observed seems very improbable.

The phenomenon described resembles the observation of an
airplane beacon or search light reflecting against an overcast.
This would certainly be periodic, appear phosphorescent, travel at
great speed, and be oval in shape. Such interpretation would dis-
miss the occasional bursting and disintegrating as a subjective
impression. — However, weather conditions are not stated.
