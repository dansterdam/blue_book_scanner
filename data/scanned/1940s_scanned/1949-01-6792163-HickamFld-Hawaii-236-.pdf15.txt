Incident No. 235 -- 4 Jan. 1949, 1400 hours, Hickam Field, Territory of Hawaii:
An Air Force pilot saw an object which appeared to be a large round
piece of flat cardboard the size of a C-54. It was white underneath and
dark on top. It approached from 25 mile distance at 1000 ft and circled
the area at 5,000 ft. The object seemed to "blink" a "whitish reflection"
repeatedly. It departed climbing at 250 m.p.h.

ATIC Opinion: This evidence does not lead to an explanation. It 
should be noted, however, that if the object were actually the size of
a C-54 at 3000 feet a greater amount of detail should have been observed.
