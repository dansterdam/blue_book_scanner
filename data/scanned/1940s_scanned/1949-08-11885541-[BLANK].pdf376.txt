Incident #26 -- Harmon Field, Newfoundland -- 10 July 1947

The evidence presented here, and in incident #27, 27a,
which refers to the same object, favors the hypothesis that the
trail of a fireball was seen.  The photographs submitted show a
typical fireball trail.  The "feathered edges" left on a cloud
which the object broke through could easily have been caused
by a fireball.
