There is no clear photograph on this page. The image appears to contain a form or a document with various fields and text, much of which is redacted or blurred. However, I can transcribe the visible text:

The document is labeled as "UNCLASSIFIED" at both the top and the bottom. It appears to be a standardized form used for reporting an incident, specifically marked as "Incident #234", with fields for various details of the observation, including the location, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the date of information being July of 1947. There is a note in the "SKETCHES" field indicating that photographs associated with this incident were not actual images of an object but were due to faulty development.
