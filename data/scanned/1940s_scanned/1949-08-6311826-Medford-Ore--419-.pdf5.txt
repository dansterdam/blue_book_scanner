UNCLASSIFIED

The following was taken from Info Doc 10-582, AF 92276;

SUBJ: Report of Sighting of "Flying Discs"

TO: Commanding General
Air Material Command
Wright Patterson AF Base
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: TID

1. The following information received from the non-commissioned
officer in Charge, Detachment 1905-1, 1050th AACS Squadron, Medford Muni-
cipal Airport, Medford, Oregon, is submitted in accordance with USAF
Letter, subject "...reporting of Information on "Flying Discs" dated 7 De-
cember 1948.

2. At approximately 1130P, 6 Aug 49, a shiny object was seen in the
sky by a member of this Detachment and reported to the writer. At ab-
approximately thereafter, another similar object was sighted, and the control To-
wer was requested to locate and attempt to identify the objects, since the
altitude was too great for accurate observation without the aid of binocu-
lars. The Control Tower operator on duty, ________, reported to 
Seattle Air Traffic Control and Lockheed Flight Service to be on the look out for
(5) silver-colored objects at an undetermined altitude, somewhat over com-
mercial mail wings, going "very fast". An in-formal conversation with Mr. ________
revealed that the objects sighted appeared to be round and at a speed com-
parable to or greater than that of standard jet aircraft, and an unofficial 
altitude estimate of thirty thousand (30,000) feet. To accurate a value
estimate could be obtained, due to the absence of clouds to form a basis
for such an estimate. However, a United Air Lines DL--- in the vicinity at
seventeen thousand (17,000) feet reported: "we didn't see any windows. We got
to see any strange objects; therefore, presumably the objects can be defin-
itely determined to have been above that height. Further investigation
by means of aircraft proved fruitless, since the objects were not seen 
again for some time prior to their arrival. Numbers of reports were re-
ceived of sightings after it was generally known that such strange objects
had been seen; but it is believed that these sightings were balls of light-
ning prevalent in the area at the time."

3. No definite conclusions as to the identity or nature of the ob-
jects were reached by this Detachment, since accurate observations could
not be made. Therefore, the foregoing information is essentially what
furnished by Mr. ________.
