The page contains two black and white photographs, each featuring parts of an aircraft. The upper photograph shows what appears to be an aircraft fuselage resting on the ground amidst vegetation, partially under the shade of trees. The lower photograph shows the same or a similar fuselage from a different angle, giving a clearer view of its entire length. Both photos are taken outdoors in daylight with shadows indicating sunshine.
