(Note: The document appears to contain checkboxes that are either blank or marked with an "X". In this transcription, unchecked boxes are indicated with an open circle (❍) and checked boxes with a checkmark (❑). Due to the quality of the image, it's difficult to ascertain the exact state of the checkboxes, so I used these symbols for unchecked and checked respectively.)
