No photograph is present on the page. The page contains handwritten text, which I will transcribe below:

object appeared to be a burning object going 
toward the earth and let off a tremendous white glare 
for awhile which was dropped suddenly. A few 
seconds later, what appeared to be a parachute was seen
drifting to the east object was 10-12 miles distance

Note: AAF, or USAF has no entry on this that this 
activity could be attributed to weather planes
