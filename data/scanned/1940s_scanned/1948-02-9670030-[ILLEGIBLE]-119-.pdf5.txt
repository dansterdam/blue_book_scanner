Incident #133 -- Norway; Vornarz, Evvdon -- 20-26 February 1948

Information given here is too limited for any conclusions
to be drawn. The stated heights, the occurrence at the same time
each night, and their specific direction makes explanation of the
objects as meteors unlikely. The green tails are also not char-
acteristic of typical meteors, but would fit into a description of
rockets or flares.
