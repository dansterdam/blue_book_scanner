FIREBALL REPORT

1949 JAN. 13-14 FIREBALL
A.M.S. No. 2351

On this date at 5:20 p.m., E.S.T., a bright fireball was observed by 7 persons who reported, one living in New York, one in New Jersey, and 5 in Pennsylvania. Two gave complete reports, one fairly complete, two were more or less reference points, one was quite incomplete. Thanks mostly to Z. A. Hill, then at Princeton, N.J., Co., Pa., who saw the object full vertically, a fair solution was derived. The object seems to have broken over Philadelphia and all the material was carried off below Philadelphia. Org. N.J. was 5o E., New Jersey green, he did not have a long enduring train and its duration was 4±2 seconds (no observer). Two initial data follow so orbit is computed due to uncertainty in altitude of the radiant.
