(c) Incident 4

Object #4 was observed by *** I was. two****
NCOs who lives unnamed and K**** between the 
hours of 2045 to 2050, 26 July 1949, at Chamblee,
Georgia and Augusta, Georgia. A description of this
object seems to indicate that it was a meteor. Three
of the observers said that the object was "football
shaped"; that it appeared to be a "green light with
a silvery tail and that it appeared was 10,000 to 20,000
feet observer stated that it seemed like a string of a ball
small and that it seemed to be 1/4 the size of a full
moon", that "it was a tail-shaped, brilliant light
trailing burning fragments." Two parties spread together
with the descriptio of a multi-colored lights trailing
burning 'fragments' seems to establish this object as a
meteor.

D. COMMENTS

   1. The only incident which possesses absolute intelligence signifi-
cance is Incident #1, it is obvious that this object has not a meteor. There
has not any evidence to support any findings of vulnerability, nor have there
been any major inaccuracies on the part of the witnesses.

   2. Weather reports establish a probe of visibility as stated in the
observ9rs' reports.

   3. Available information from Ordnance, Army, Navy and AF Weather
Bureaus, Inspector Organizations, and others, failed to reveal any evidence
of testing devices to which this incident could be attributed.

   4. Apparently it is not a domestic origin since a thorough check of
this light schedules, as to commercial and government airlines, revealed that in only 
one instance did the reported flight paths cross. (See chart inclosed as
Tab 4). This single exception was the Flight 21, a northwest leg directly
*ndicating two points in AB 29th tactical in a line thereof during 
a 2 hour emulated bombing passes through the approximate area of the 24
July light where the sightings were reported. However, the factors of speed
division of flight, maneuvers, constructions, lights and other factors rule
out the possibility.

   5. Objects similar in indescription have been reported as follows:

   a. Globular-like object capable of fantastic speed was seen 
      during the past summer in broad day light in Germany, Norway
      and USA. 

   b. A Taiwanese,* *****, in the F**** ***. The object
      was observed intermittently through clouds and was reported
      to have two deck-like.
