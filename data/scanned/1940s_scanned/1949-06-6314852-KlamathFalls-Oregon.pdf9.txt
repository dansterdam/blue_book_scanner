Synopsis

The x on a SALT LAKE E ICUISR, data 25 Oct 49, title and subject as captioned

Mr. x was interviewed at the Yelima airport, Yelima, Wash., where he is presently employed as a CAA maintenance technician.  It is advised that at about 1300 hours, 27 June 1949, while employed at the Klamath Falls airport, Klamath Falls, Ore., his attention was called to a number of unidentified objects that were visible in the sky.  These objects did not appear to fly in any formation, changed direction ather rapidly, had no apparent sound or exhaust, were pin-point in size, of uncertain, variable shape, and their speed was not determined but seemed to vary.  After having observed them for a few minutes, they appeared to fade from view and disappeared.
