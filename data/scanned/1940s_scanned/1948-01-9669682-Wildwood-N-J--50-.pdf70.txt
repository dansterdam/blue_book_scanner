UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT
Cincinnati, Ohio

DEAR SIR:

AF CINCINNATI, OHIO

On 11 August 1950, Mr. [REDACTED] was interviewed regarding the unidentified aerial object
about which he wrote to the Air Force. He advised that Mr.
[REDACTED] who operates a service station on the main
highway in Warren, Minnesota, found this aerial object about
two (2) years ago in the vicinity of Warren, Minnesota and
informed photographed it just an hour or so after it was found.
He stated this it contains a fuel tank, three (3) tube radio,
and dry cells and that the opening at the rear of it appeared
to have vented hot gasses, causing informant to believe that it
had been jett or rocket propelled. He disclosed that it contained
no directional steering and had been completely covered with
aluminum paint. In examining this object, informant found
nothing to indicate its place of manufacture. He further stated
that his son [REDACTED] then the Walnut Hills High School,
Cincinnati, Ohio, and feels qualified to say that the main body
of the object was made in a press rather than by hand, which
indicates to him that it was a product of mass production. He
[REDACTED] advised that during the summer of 1950 he talked with
Mr. [REDACTED] who indicated that he still has the object in his
possession in Warren, Minnesote. Informant explained his delay
in contacting the Air Force by saying that it was many months
after he made the picture before someone suggested his writing
to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
