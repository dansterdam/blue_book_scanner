It appears there is no photograph in this image. The image shows a document with a lot of text, most of which is obscured or illegible due to the quality of the image and redaction. However, I can attempt to transcribe the visible portions:

The document seems to be a military or official form related to an observation of an unidentified flying object as part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation into UFOs from 1952 to 1969.
