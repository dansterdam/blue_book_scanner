Incident #215 -- Goose Bay, Labrador -- 31 October 1948

No object reported in this incident was so astro-
nomical explanation. Speed was too slow and time in sight too
long.

The object, observed on a radarscope, was probably
a balloon or unidentified aircraft.

Question: Is the speed indicated the radial velocity
of the object or true space velocity? If the latter, it is
obviously too slow for conventional aircraft.
