479th STATION HOSPITAL
APO 856 c/o Postmaster, N. Y.

27 June 1949

TO : Intelligence Officer 30G

1. Using fifth degree co-ordinates, I have computed the probable traverse of the radiator, indicated as an approximate overlay measurement of procedure before some other missions charts. The held figures indicate that particular point of the skydate 27

2. A cloud of fog just east of Marvin Island to the North. Sound is my estimate of the place where the instruments observed must be, on the basis of the balloons, the house's there are hardly to the West after comparing some points of impact could hardly be farther from the point indicated (X) than the sixth arc of the circle surrounding it.

3. It will be noted therefore, that the instruments follow a path between one and four miles from, and on a bearing between west and northwest from the point of alleged observation.

4. With reference to the balloon released from R3, observation from Pepel would have been impossible.
