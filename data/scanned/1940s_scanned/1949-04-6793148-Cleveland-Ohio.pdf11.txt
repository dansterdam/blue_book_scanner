The provided image does not contain a photograph, but rather it appears to be a scanned page of tabulated data with some handwritten notes. Due to the quality of the scanned image, accurate transcription will be challenging, but I will provide as much information as can be visually discerned. Here is the readable text from the document:

COMMERCE, WEATHER BUREAU
WEATHER OBSERVATIONS
AT CLEVE---, OHIO---

DATE: APR. 5 1949

REMARKS AND SUPPLEMENTAL CODED DATA

The document lists other titles for data columns, which are partially obscured and difficult to decipher but seem to include "Wind," "Charac.," "Ceiling," "Temp.," and "Weather" among others.

At the bottom left, there seems to be a handwritten note that resembles "A315 927", and at the top right corner, there is a handwritten number "54." The rest of the text and data are either too obscured or illegible to be accurately transcribed.
