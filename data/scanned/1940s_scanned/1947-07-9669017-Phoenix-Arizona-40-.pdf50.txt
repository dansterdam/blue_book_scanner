The image appears to be a black and white photo of an object that resembles the typical shape associated with UFOs, such as a flying saucer or a disc-like shape. The details are quite grainy and not clearly defined, and the object has a somewhat blurred and shadowy appearance against a uniformly light background, likely the sky or a simple backdrop. There appears to be a contrasty, dense part at the center of the object extending to the right side.
