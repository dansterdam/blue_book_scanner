Incident #112, a-f -- Ashley and Delaware, Ohio -- 8 April 1948
(Supprodocs Interim report of 2/15/49)

From the descriptions given by the various observers --
notably that the object soon appeared like a clearly-outlined
cloud, was floosy white, moved slowly and maintained shape, was a
long vertical cylinder -- one can surmise that there is a strong
possibility that the object was nothing more than a short, vertical,
daytime meteor trail. These trails are known to persist for half
an hour or more, and to drift with prevailing winds aloft. The
fact that one observer stated that at first the cylinder resembled 
sky writing is excellent corroboration for the above explanation.
