DETAILS:

1. This investigation was requested by District Commander, 17th
District OSI (IC), USAF, Hill Air Force Base, Ogden, Utah, and was pre-
dicated upon a report to this effect that _______________ Civil Aeronautics
Administration Radio Operator, Elko, Nevada, had observed three (3) un-
identified aerial objects in the vicinity of Elko, Nevada.

AT ELKO, NEVADA

2. Special Agent CLYDE H. EDWARDS assisted in this investigation.

3. On 13 May 1949, Mr. _________ Airplane Communicator,
Civil Aeronautics Administration, Elko, Nevada, was interviewed at his
home, Aeronautical Airport, Elko, Nevada, and the following statement (Exhibit
A) was obtained:

"At approximately 10:15 Pacific Standard Time on 2 May 1949, I was
working on my car located in front of my house at ___________ Elko
Nevada. I glanced at the sky North of Elko and noticed three objects in
an inverted Vee formation proceeding in a south-westerly direction. The
objects were approximately 1/4 inch across to my naked eye; were roughly
circular in shape and seemed to be made of metal with the appearance of
oxidized aluminum. Based on my contact with aircraft at the Elko airport,
I judged the objects to be flying about 5 miles from town at an altitude of
L4000 feet. On this basis they would be approximately 30 feet in diameter,
and traveling at a speed of 250 or 300 miles per hour. I could see no
instellation of exhaust, or vapor trails and heard no sound and there were
no engines or projections on the objects. I returned my house and re-
turned with a pair of binoculars, but before I could use them (the binoculars),
the three objects seemed to veer left to a more southerly direction; all three
tilted at an angle, in what seemed a precision movement and disappeared frm
my sight. The speed of the objects seemed to increase as they started to
veer and upon tilting they seemed extremely thin and flat. I was unable
to again locate the objects with either the binoculars or my naked eye. The
objects were within my vision for approximately two minutes and upon their
disappearance I immediately notified my superior at the Civil Aeronautics
Administration, Elko, Nevada, by telephone."

______stated that when he first noticed the objects they were on a
straight line with the Elko Radio station, and when they disappeared from
view they were in line with the Beacon at the Elko Airport. Throughout
flight the altitude and formation of the objects remained the same and the
angle of elevation above the horizon was approximately forty (40) degrees.
His attention was not drawn to the objects by any special phenomena
that he could recall.
