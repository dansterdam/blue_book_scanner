Incident #222 --- Furstenfeldbruck, Germany -- 23 November 1948

The tactics described by this object, if correct, and
the implied time in sight (long enough to call others to see it)
are strongly against an astronomical interpretation for the in-
cident.

The object might have been a balloon with a light on it.
