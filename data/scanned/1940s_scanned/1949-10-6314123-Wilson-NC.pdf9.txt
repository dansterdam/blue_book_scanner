PROJECT GRUDGE Sighting of Unidentified Objects on 23 Oct 49 at Cincinnati, Ohio, by Mr. ***** Special Inquiry!

1st Ind
MCIAXA-2a/JJR/eps

Hq AMC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio

TO: The Inspector General, USAF, 5th District Office of Special Investigations, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio

1. Files at this headquarters disclose that Mr. ***** forwarded a letter to the Air Force (ATTN: General Vandenburg) dated 28 Oct 49. He also called the Intelligence Department at this headquarters on 26 October 49. At that time, General ****was also carried accounts of objects picked up in the beam of a searchlight belonging to Mr. *****. However, AIFC files do not contain any reports indicating that General Paisley actually saw an aerial object. If such a report is available, this command would like a copy.

2. A verbal report by personnel connected with this project at that time indicates that Mr. ****** acted strangely at the time of a visit by an OSI agent. He reported, that he carried a can of telescope in his possession at all times in order to observe or photograph flying saucers. It was also stated that he attempted to photograph a so-called "flying saucer" through the office window at the time of the visit.

3. While this command is in no position to make a psychological analysis of Mr. *******, it appears that he is a very sincere individual convinced that he has observed flying objects which he thinks represents a threat.

4. However, it is apparent from the information he has supplied that his background is far from technical. As far as can be ascertained, he has had little or no experience in aerial observation, for example, as would be the case if he were a pilot. Consequently, the information he has furnished based on his personal observations is a poor basis on which to conduct a technical investigation. In addition, AIFC files disclose no other reports of observations concurrent with Mr. *******, by other trained observers as indicated in the basic letter.

5. The photograph which was included, was reviewed by photographic specialists at AIFC. While the light spot on the picture cannot be positively identified due to the lack of information and control of all the factors concerned, there are several logical possibilities. It is considered that it would serve no purpose to list these possibilities. However, the illusions which are created by searchlight beams passing through clouds is a known phenomenon.
