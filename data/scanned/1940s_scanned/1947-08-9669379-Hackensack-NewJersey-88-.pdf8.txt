UNCLASSIFIED

Commanding General
Army Air Forces
Washington 25, D. C.

ATTENTION: AC/AS-2
Lt. Col. George Garrett

1. The specimens of the alleged "Flying Saucers" brought to this Command
by Col. McCoy, as apparently furnished by the FBI and given to Lt. Col. Garrett,
were examined to determine their connection, if any, with the so-called "Flying
Saucers". The specimens were carefully examined by both technicians of the
Analysis Division and Electronics Sub-division of Engineering Division. The
latter organization stated that these specimens definitely had no connection
whatsoever with the "Mogul" projects nor with any other research and development
projects of this Command.

2. It is also the opinion of this Command that these specimens have no
connection with the so-called "Flying Saucer" or "Discs". These specimens, there-
fore, are considered as part of a hoax that could be perpetrated by most anyone
seeking publicity or for any other reasons.

[REDACTED SECTION]

5. The specimens shown in the attached photographs include fragments of
an undeterminable shape made from plaster of Paris or similar ceramics and con-
taining some electrical resistance wire for measurement purposes. The condition
of the ceramics indicates that the resistance wire was heated electrically at
one time or another. If the other articles at the top of the photographs reading
from left to right are identified as follows:

a. An uncoiled type of magnetia [possible error in text: "magnetia" should be "magnetic"] deflectiongram made of aluminum
alloy, manufactured by The National Baldwin Co. of Salt Lake City, Utah, which
was at one time used by I. B. M. machines during I. Q. tests and is of no project.
