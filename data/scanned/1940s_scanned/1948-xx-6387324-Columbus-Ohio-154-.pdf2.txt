Text from the document:

On 2 Aug 45, at 7:50 P. M. Mrs. ------- observed an unusual
object in the sky. Her attention was directed toward it because
some neighborhood children were looking toward the north. She
called her husband, --------- (Inc 151) to witness the
phenomenon. The sky was cloudless and the light more than
sufficient without interference from the rays of the sun which
were hidden by the buildings of the city.

Object first appeared oblong in shape and was traveling from
north to south at slow, regular speed. Witness estimated
distance at a height of a half mile during the 15 minutes observation the object traveled approx 7-1/2 miles. Although
it did not change its course, it presented different appearances
from time to time. From oblong to smaller than to oblong,
Object went thru this change three different times until observer
lost sight of it, however, for the most part it presented a circ-
ular appearance. Outline very dark in contrast with the light-
er gray of the center. On very few time gray appeared circumscrib-
ing observer aware of the conciered entire circle smoke emitting it; the
momentary observer not being E. O Emmen at the first vertical
movement, which the objected contained no smoking coming from the
finis tail of smoke was observed but once. The entire appeared to be
that of a small plane. It made no sound and at one time observ'r
thought she detected one. At approx 8:00 P. M. observer lost sight
of the object just as it appeared to be changing direction from
South to Southwest.
