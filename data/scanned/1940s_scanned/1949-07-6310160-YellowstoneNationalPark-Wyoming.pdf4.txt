'Saucers' Noth Air Force Says

WASHINGTON (AP)—After checking up on 375 reports of "weird" and wondrous sights in the sky, the Air Force has con­cluded that there aren’t any "Flying Saucers." It took two years, a special team from the USAF’s science staff, and help from university consultants to track down the rumors of strange disks whiz­zing through the air.
PROJECT ENDED
Tuesday night the Air Force said “Project Flying Saucer” the investigation started by the Air Material command at Wright base, Dayton, O., on Jan. 22, 1948—has been or­dered ended because there is nothing to show that the re­ports were "not the results of natural phenomena."
All evidence, it added, points to three factors—misinterpre­tation of various conventional objects; a mild form of mass hysteria; or hoaxes—as the ori­gin of the flying saucer re­ports.
Under Air Force definition, "various conventional objects" include such things as meteors, balloons, birds in flight or just ordinary optical illusions.
STORY DENIED
The effect of the announce­ment was to deny a story ap­pearing in the current edition of the magazine "True." The magazine said it had learned that "a rocket authority sta­tioned at Wright Field has told 'Project Saucer' personnel flat­ly that the saucers are not inter­planetary and that no other conclusion is possible."
The Air Force last spring sought to shoot down the fly­ing discs rumors with a long, detailed discussion of the whole history of the rumors. It devot­ed a portion of that report to explaining why visitors weren’t likely to arrive from other planets on space ships.
Among other things, the re­port questioned the possibility of the existence of men even on the relatively near planet of Mars. Even if men were there, the USAF doubted that they were a "technically established race," able to build space ships.
