LENNIG COMPANY is about two and one-half miles southeast from Oxford Circle. The account of the fire does not seem to fit into the general pattern of the above-mentioned flying object, for it is noted that the flying object was allegedly traveling from a position northwest of Oxford Circle to a southwesterly direction in Philadelphia. GREBEL pointed out this, to the best of his knowledge, there're no oil refineries and chemical companies located around Oxford Circle or north of such, but that all of the companies of this type are several miles south of Oxford Circle.

All logical investigation having been conducted, no further action will be taken on the instant matter unless advised to the contrary by the Bureau.
