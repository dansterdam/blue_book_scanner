REPORT OF UNUSUAL INCIDENT

Unidentified Flying Object

At 1050E, 19 August 1948, the Wright-Patterson Flight Service Center
was notified by Lt. Colonel John Weurth, Executive Officer, Godman AFB,
Kentucky, via Plan 62 interphone network, that an unidentified flying
object was visible from the ground at location AFB. This object, when ascer-
tained to be at approximately 30,000 to 100,000 feet altitude, spherical in
shape, bright silver color, giving a bright reflection from the sun. An
F-51 was dispatched from Standiford AFB, Kentucky, to observe subject object
and a report was to be forwarded to this Center when available.

At 1101E, 19 August 1948, the above information was relayed verbatim
to the Commanding General, AIC (ACI), and this Center informed them that
all forthcoming information regarding subject unidentified flying object
would be relayed to that Office immediately upon receipt.

At 1127, 19 August 1948, a message was received from Godman AFB, via
Plan 62 interphone network, to the stature that there was no change in elevation
of subject object and it seemed to be moving southwest from Godman AFB at
approximately 255°, at an elevation of 90° from a C-47. The F-51 was
flying over Godman AFB at an altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet and was visible
from the ground to locate subject object, the conditioned object. The big
circular thing with the naked eye and assuming an elevation ranging from 30 to
taken by theodolite every minute and progress of subject object was being
charted.

At 1110E, 19 August 1948, the above information was relayed verbatim to
the Commanding General, AIC (ACI).

At 1219E, 19 August 1948, Major Lithnel, Operations Officer at Godman
AFB, notified the Wright-Patterson Flight Service Center that the unidentified
object was ascertained to be the planet Venus. This information was given
to the Commanding Officer, Godman AFB, by Mr. [redacted], Head Astrologer, University
of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky,

At 1223, 19 August 1948, this information was relayed to the Commanding
General AIC (ACI), and they requested that the azimuth and elevation readings
which were obtained on Godman AFB be relayed to them in order to verify
the assumption of Mr. [redacted]. This information was then in turn relayed by
Major De Jarnond T. Dawes and was relayed to Commanding General, AIC
(ACI), who confirmed the assumption that the unidentified object was the
planet Venus, due to the location, time, and trend of movement.

At 1542E, 19 August 1948, Major De Jarnond T. Dawes contacted Godman
AFB, to see if any additional information was available and received a
negative reply.
