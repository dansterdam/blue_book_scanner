An UFO passes across from Ålborg, Denmark, to Oslo, Norway, sighted a projectile coming from the southwest, passing along the Swedish Coast and disappearing over Norway. The missile was at 20,000 ft and disappeared over the horizon in four seconds. It emanated a bluish-green flame but left no trail in the sky. The projectile seemed to follow the earth's surface.

Note: Similar missiles have been observed at Kristiansand, Norway & Falster,
       Denmark.
       In this connection, it is of interest to know that heavy water
       is currently being produced in Ålborg.

Observers: Norwegian pilot and his co-pilot.
       The pilot served with the Royal Norwegian Air in
       Great Britain.
