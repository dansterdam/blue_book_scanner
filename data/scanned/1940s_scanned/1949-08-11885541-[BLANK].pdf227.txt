Incident 2044 - Kirtland Field, Albuquerque, New Mexico - 12 November 1948

The evidence given concerning this incident does not seem
to either physical; if the object was a bird it will eliminate, distance
disqualified two foot long and only a bird of this family, that is quite
unidentifiable that it should have been observed over such a sec trajectory,
and as bright as that, that close, in a populated spot, should/would have
attracted the attention of many to one degree.

The vaudeville routines casts a psychological jumble optical illusion
mirror than a real object in the sky. The evidence is ambiguous, 
thus it is it is not swayed, nor is it observable or reasoning on the 
object even if slide, the angle of climb, average is not told till
at a high pitch, to disintegrate, or did it fade out gradually, or
what?

There is a remote possibility that the observer saw an iden-
it in its mother overgrown silent part of its trajectory, but if this
had been the case, then should have been some sort of a trail.

The method of reporting and stenography in this incident
is very poor. It would seem that if the observer was aware enough to
note a zenith of arc and a trajectory of 500', he would also know about
the bearing and elevation of the object and its manner of disappearance.

The whole incident lacks some sort of physical reality.
