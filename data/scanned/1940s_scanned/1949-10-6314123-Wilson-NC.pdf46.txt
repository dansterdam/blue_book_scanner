DETAILS:

1. Investigation requested by OSI, Hq. to ascertain facts surrounding
the sighting of an unidentified object sighted over Davis-Monthan AFB at 1340
hours MST, 12 October 1949.

                        AT DAVIS-MONTHAN AFB

2. On 14 October 1949, 1st Lt DAVID J. LANTZ, AO-771912, Bombardier,
65th Bomb Sq, 43rd Bomb Gp was interviewed. LANTZ stated that on 12 October
1949 at about 1340 hours MST, while standing in the 65th Bomb Sq aircraft
parking area in the company of three airmen, his attention was drawn to an
object which appeared to be about 25,000 to 30,000 feet overhead. LANTZ
described the object as being round, metallic in substance, white or silver in
color with an approximate diameter of from fifty (50) to one hundred (100)
feet. LANTZ stated that the object was traveling from Northeast (200°) toward
Southwest (210°) and at an excess flying rate of speed, possibly as much as one
thousand (1,000) miles an hour. LANTZ observed the object for about 15 seconds
at which time his attention was distracted by the launching of a weather
balloon over Davis-Monthan AFB. When LANTZ returned his gaze to the portion
of the sky where the object was last seen, the object had disappeared. LANTZ
is of the opinion that the object which he saw, could possibly be an instrument
whose existence is known.
