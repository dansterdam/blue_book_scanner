the horizon toward the east at approximately 30 degrees from
this tower (Coordinates: 31-50N 106-23W). This ball of fire
was approximately 3 to 5 degrees above the horizon travelling in
a north west to south-easterly direction. They stated that the ball
of fire lost no altitude during its travel and at the end of
traverse, enlarged slightly, then disappeared quickly.

and continued travel to a true bearing of 70 degrees. The elevation
was determined to be 3 degrees above the horizon. When the fact
that the first of the incident was just prior to twilight the enlisted
