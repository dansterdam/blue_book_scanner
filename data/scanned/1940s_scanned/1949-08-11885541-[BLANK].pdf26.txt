Incident #83 - 100 mi. w of Kansas City, Missouri - 6 July 1947

There is no direct astronomical explanation for this 
incident.

The striking feature of the incident is that the "very 
bright" object travelled in the sun direction and at the same 
speed as the observer did, and that it appeared at 11 o'clock 
position at his left, or approximately opposite to the position 
of the sun at the time.

It cannot be proved, of course, but it is probable 
that the witness saw a direct reflection of the sun on some con-
tinuous object - thin clouds, ice crystals, or the like. (Had 
the object appeared on his right, then this explanation would be 
untenable.) Its disappearance can be explained logically also, 
for turning altered the observer's angular relationship to the 
reflector.

It is further noted that an apparent inconsistency 
exists in the report. The observer first stated that the object 
appeared to be the top of a water tank "low and to his left", 
after checking his position he stated that the object was at 11,000 
feet. The inconsistency in altitude throws some suspicion on the 
observation. If the object was low, then a running reflection along 
a river or railroad track would be a promising explanation.
