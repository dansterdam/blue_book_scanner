The image does not contain a photograph; rather, it shows a map. It's a black and white map with various labeled locations and lines indicating roads and geographical features.

Unfortunately, I cannot perform OCR directly. However, I can see that the document is a "TEXACO TOURING MAP OF KENTUCKY TENNESSEE" and contains a legend explaining the symbols used on the map, as well as a scale indicating that 1 inch is approximately 16 miles. Below that is population information for cities and towns based on different population ranges. The bottom of the image includes a part of the company logo and some numbers which appear to be part of a legend or indexing system. 

Please note that for a full transcription of the image, you would need to use an OCR software or manually transcribe it.
