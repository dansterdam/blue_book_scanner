At 181947 March 1949, four unidentified lights appeared in the vicinity of
915.26 - 855.29, the lights noticed at this time were yellow and red.
A patrol of Killeen Base, in the "Q" Area noticed two of these lights. A patrol
located on Crossville Mountain, which consisted of four enlisted men of the 92d
AGF Band, saw four. Immediate investigation in the general area failed to reveal any
cause or anything which would indicate that some person or thing had been in the
area. (3-3) (see Exhibit I, Point #1)

At 131930 March 1949, another yellow light was soon in the approximate
vicinity of 910.4 - 855.10. This light was reportedly seen by only one man.
There was no indication from reports that the light made any noises, there was no
noise, and the persons reporting were unable to make an estimate of the height.
(3-3) (see Exhibit I, Point #2)

At 131947 March 1949, what appeared to be blinking lights appeared in the
vicinity of the Rock Quarry, located at 905.32 - 855.61. Investigation by the
alert force and patrols of Killeen Base Failed to reveal any cause or person in
that general area. Again at 181935 March 1949, lights were seen in this general
area. (3-3) (see Exhibit I, Point #3)

At 190043 March 1949, blinking lights were seen in the same general area
905.32 - 855.61. Investigation failed to reveal the cause of these lights.
All of the lights which appeared in the proximity of 905.32 - 855.61 were seen
by patrols located in the "Q" Area and were seen from points between 910.20 -
855.36 and 905.44 - 855.41. (3-3) (see Exhibit I, Point #4)
