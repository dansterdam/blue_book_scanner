Incident No. 163 -- 15 Oct. 1948, 2305 Hours, Fukuoka area, Japan.
Airborne radar observer in F-51 attempted six times to intercept an object between 5000 and 6000 ft. The object traveled 200 MPH until approach to within 12,000 ft., then quickly accelerated. Pilot saw at estimated 1200 ft. Object appeared to be 20-30 ft. from stop - silhouette to underside of object with rounded nose, general projectile shape, cut off sharply at rear.

AMC Opinion: There is no apparent explanation. One discrepancy seems to be that the target was never seen by ground radar, which was operating and had the F-51 in sight throughout period of sighting.
