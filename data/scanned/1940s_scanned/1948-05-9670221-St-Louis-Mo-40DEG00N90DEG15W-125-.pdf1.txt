The image provided appears to be a poor-quality scanned page, with much of the text being faint and some parts illegible. It does not contain any photographs of UFOs or related imagery. However, I can attempt to transcribe the visible text:

```

It appears to be a form or report summarizing a single incident involving a sighting, possibly a reported unidentified flying object. The "Remarks" section suggests that the object in question was identified as a "Bird". Due to the quality of the scan and the cutoff text, not all the information can be discerned accurately.
