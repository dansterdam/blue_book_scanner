The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, but it does not contain any photographs. It seems to be a form with various fields, but due to the quality of the scan, much of the text is illegible. I will provide you with the text that I can decipher.

The legible text includes references to a date (Aug. 1, 1948), the state of Arizona (Ariz.), Phoenix, Ariz., a mention of "Fireball Very Low," "Star," and "RDO Form 3A." The majority of the text is too faded or unclear to read accurately.
