The image appears to be a technical drawing or a layout, not a photograph. There are no photographic images visible in this picture.

As for the text, it appears to be very faint and partially illegible. Based on visible details, here is my attempt to transcribe it:

```
FAIRFIELD-SUISUN A.F.B. CALIF.

GASOLINE SUPPLY WHARF SCALE

Arthur Conrad Jr.

Please be advised that this transcription may not be fully accurate due to the quality and clarity of the text in the image.
