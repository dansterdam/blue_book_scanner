SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

    Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
    Dayton, Ohio
    ATTN: MCIAO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, CMAC-4 dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," with endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents' numbers 173 through 233 have been screened against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and horizontal motions are distinguished if possible, and that motion is specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move. "Relative to Radar Spottings" should include a statement of the type of radar set used.

FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
