Incident #17 -- page 3

original estimate is also incorrect; if the objects had traveled 47
miles in 102 seconds, they would have been travelling at a rate of
approximately 1700 m.p.h., not 1200.)

In view of the above, it appears probable that whatever ob-
jects were observed were travelling at supersonic speeds and may there-
fore have been some sort of known aircraft.
