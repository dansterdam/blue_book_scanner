NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 5 April 1949, [REDACTED], employee of Cache Valley Electric
Company, Logan, Utah, was interviewed and described the object observed by
him as a long line - a ball of fire moving very rapidly straight down out of
the sky and leaving a short stream of smoke or vapor when it disappeared in
the air. [REDACTED] estimated the time at about 1000 hours MST and stated 
that the object was southwest from Logan when he observed it.
