UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #255 -- near Hickam Field, Hawaii -- 4 January 1949

There is clearly no astronomical explanation for this
incident.

The account given seems trustworthy, even though only
one person saw the circular disc. This report differs from many
others in that the description of maneuvers executed by the object
is definite, rather than hazy.
