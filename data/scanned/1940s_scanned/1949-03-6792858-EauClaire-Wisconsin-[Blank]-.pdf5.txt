(Size and approximate altitude were estimated on assumption that
condensation trail was normal type which could persist at 30,000 feet
during that time of year).

would not be positively determined. Movement in vertical plan was
both up and down with tight maneuvering.

11. Evidence of exhaust:

a. Color of smoke: Apparent condensation trail was intensely
white more so than cirrus cloud formations.
b. Length of trail: Estimated 10 to 15 times length of ob-
ject and width would fill width of object to 10 times that size.
c. Odor: None
d. Rate of evaporation: Complete or near of described trail.
e. Wingtip vortices: None

12. Effect on clouds: Object did not pass through any cloud
formations but at times appeared silhouetted against cirrus clouds -
therefore indicating object was below cirrus formations.
