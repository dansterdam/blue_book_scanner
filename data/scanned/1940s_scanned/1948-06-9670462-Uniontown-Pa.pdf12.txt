Incident #164, a, b -- Uniontown, Pennsylvania -- 29 June 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for the incident.

its occurrence at the time of a thunderstorm, suggests
that the object might be referred to as St. Elmo's Fire or ball lightning
to see whether this might be a possible explanation.

Another possibility is that the observers saw a beacon
