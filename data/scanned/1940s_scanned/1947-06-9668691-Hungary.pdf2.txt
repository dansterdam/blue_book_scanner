The image provided does not contain a photograph. It is a scanned page with typewritten text and some sections have been redacted with black bars. Here is the text present in the document:

Incident #168 - Hungary -- around 10 June 1947

It is extremely unlikely that the objects observed in
Hungary were meteorites, unless the meager description given here
is quite inaccurate. Without knowledge of the speed and trajectory
of the objects, nothing definite can be said.

There are redacted sections, and the text following these is not included in the visible portion of the document. The image also includes a handwritten note at the bottom right-hand corner, which I'm not providing as this was not requested.
