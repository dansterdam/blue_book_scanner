FROM:  Chief, Physical Security Branch

SUBJECT:   Reported Observation of Unidentified Light or Flare Moving Across
                   the Sky on 5 January 1949

1. On 7 January 1949, the writer interviewed Pfc. Meredith J.
Everitts, ASN 38585349, Headquarters, 3450th M.R. Group, concerning
the unidentified light or flare which he had reportedly seen moving
across the sky.

2. Pfc. Everitts advised that on 5 January 1949 he was guarding
C-97 airplanes at the landing strip, located adjacent to the
Ordinance Area, when at approximately 1730 hours he noticed a bright
orange travelling across the sky, from the Northeast towards the
Northwest. He related that the object was diamond shaped, approxi-
mately two feet long, and appeared to be much brighter in its center
than at both edges. In its train, that the object was approximately
1500 to 2000 feet in the air and travelling approximately 500 ft.,
horizontal to the earthâ€™s surface, and was not a blink of time. 
Everitts was unable to estimate the speed of the object but stated
that he has seen low flying jets planes, and that this object travelled
much faster than the jets that he has observed. There was no smoke
or other vaporous material visible to Pfc. Everitts around or follow-
ing the object.

3. At this time Pfc. Everitts witnessed the object, he stated
that the sky was clear, furnishing a light blue background, and that
the object appeared to be a bright white light, with no other appear-
ent visible source.

4. Standing guard with Pfc. Everitt were Sgt. Richard Holeslogle
and Cpl. Wilson, and according to Pfc. Everitts, neither of which
men saw the object. Everitts explained that he called to Sgt. Holes-
logle, who was standing at the other end of the plane, and told him
to look at the object in the sky, but by that time it had disappeared.

5. Pfc. Everitts stated that he attended Flight School, under the
G.I. Bill of Rights in Houston, Texas, during the year 1947, and that
he has had some experience in observing aircraft.
