VII. Relationship Between Publicity and Rates of Reports

The following graph (Fig. 2) illustrates an apparent relation-
ship between reports which received wide publicity, and the total number

to allow the conclusion that many reports are the direct result of such
publicity.

This was further illustrated recently, when this Command re-
ceived 64 reports of sightings and 51 possible solutions following a
Saturday Evening Post article and an official press release on the sub-
ject of flying objects. Virtually all of the reporters and correspon-
dents made reference to one of the above mentioned articles.
