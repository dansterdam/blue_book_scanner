The image shows a map of a portion of the western United States with a focus on the Pacific Northwest and California. Key cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles are noted, and there appears to be markings or shaded areas, possibly indicating regions of interest with respect to the context of the UFO report document. Due to the quality of the image, it is quite difficult to discern any fine details or specific annotations that may be present on the map.

Unfortunately, the image quality is poor and no specific text is legible, preventing me from acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to output the text found in the document. If there are clearer images or text from other sections of the document that you would like to read, please provide them, and I'd be happy to help.
