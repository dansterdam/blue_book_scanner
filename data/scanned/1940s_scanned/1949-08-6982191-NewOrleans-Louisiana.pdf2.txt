The photograph shows an elongated, somewhat cylindrical object standing on edge, with a pointed tip at the top. It is positioned against a lightly obscured measurement ruler extending from the numbers 6 to 10. The object's texture appears somewhat rough and weathered, with darker lines and markings along its surface. It's difficult to determine the object's material from this black and white image. There appear to be some small, oval-shaped items or marks near the base of the object, but they are not clearly identifiable.
