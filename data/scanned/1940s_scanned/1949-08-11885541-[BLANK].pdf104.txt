Incident. 203 -- Clark AF Base, Philippine Islands -- 12 October 1949

Two things enter heavily into our, possibly stereotyped, evaluation
of this incident: the reported maneuverability of the object, and
the character evaluation of the witness.

If the facts are as stated, then there is no astronomical
explanation for the object observed. A few points favor its having
been a daylight meteor: its snow-white color, speed faster than
that of a jet plane, roaring noise, similarity to "sky writing", and
the trail of dust, or the observation. The tactics, however, if really
performed, oppose it strenuously.

The question is, did the object actually maneuver in and
out of a cloud bank -- or four, did it make turns of 90Â° or less?

It is possible that such impressions were merely illusions. The witness
saw the object intermittently through clouds. It is not clear whether
he ever saw it against a cloud background or sky; it is very likely in and
between clouds, a fact which is highly important. If he saw it only
in breaks between clouds, this fact, coupled with its great speed,
makes it clear that only momentary impressions could be obtained.
Such observations, by an untrained observer, may bring forth a des-
cription that is extremely unlike the facts.

The impression of a fuselage with windows could even more
easily have been a figment of the imagination.

Unless more specific information concerning this incident
becomes available, the present investigator cannot say whether an
astronomical explanation is [CENSORED] or not. UNCLASSIFIED
