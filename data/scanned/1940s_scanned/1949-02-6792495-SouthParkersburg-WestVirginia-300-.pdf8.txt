Akron 5, Ohio

April 27, 1949

Gentlemen:-

About 1:25 A.M. on the morning of February 5, 1949, about 7 to 9 miles south of Parkersburg, West Virginia, on Route #21, I observed a comet-like ball or mass of sparkling flame (sparksâ€”red) proceeding from east to west across the lower horizon. It looked like molten iron or steel in the stage of coagulating melts.

We are of the opinion, it was a meteor, although mechanical devices could be considered, there from a far distant source.

I was in Hq. Co., 34th Inf. honorably discharged 3/17/27.

Hoping that this will aid your records in astrological survey,

Sincerely,

[Redacted personal information]
