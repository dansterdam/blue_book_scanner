An interrogator of this office stated to the writer of this report that
he read an article about the flying object in a US newspaper in about Feb or
Apr 1945. The article reported on the same object which was seen by Allied
pilots over Germany towards the end of World War II. They were observed in
flight beside German airplanes.

Both the interviewer and the assisting AFLO officer agreed that the man
had seen something and that his statements should be taken to be reliable,
essentially as Source was rather serious about everything concerning this
unknown object.
