The image you've provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a faded or poorly scanned document page with some text, but the quality is too degraded for a clear reading.

Given the quality of the image, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software or systems would struggle to accurately capture the text. Nonetheless, I will attempt to reproduce what is barely legible here:

```
WIND SPEEDS MADE
1500Z APR 5 1949

Please note that the image quality greatly inhibits the ability to reliably extract text, and there may be more text in the original document that is not visible due to the condition of the image provided.
