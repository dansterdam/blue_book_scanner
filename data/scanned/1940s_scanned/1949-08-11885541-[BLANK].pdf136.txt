Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Field

Dear Colonel Tremel:

In reply to your inquiry of March 24th, we had not planned to issue a formal report on project "SIGN" until or unless our study leads to some unusual or unexpected findings which would throw new light on "flying saucers."

We are now working through the mass of available significant correspondences or other indirect pieces of evidence. It is expected that we shall have explored all our various avenues of attack in about two months. To date we have found nothing which would seriously contravert simple rational explanations of the various phenomena in terms of balloons, conventional aircraft, planets, meteors, bits of A.F., optical illusions, practical jokers, psychopathological reports, and the like.

We should like to take this opportunity to raise a few questions, (1) Why is it so important, as it is a psychopathological curiosity? (2) Why the Airline doctos [sic] so cavalierly pooh-pooh it? (2) [apparently the fisherman incident is deleted from the data-why?) (3) We have heard from a reliable source of an incident in which fishermen observed a flying object which dropped hot material which they collected and subsequently gave to official investigators. The investigators' plane crashed but there was a survivor. We do not seem to have a file or this incident - certainly not a complete file. Why was the data?

Sincorely yours,

/s/ A. H. Wood
A. M. Moody
