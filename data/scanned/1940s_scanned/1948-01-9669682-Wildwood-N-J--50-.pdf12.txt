Incident #50, 50a -- Wildwood, New Jersey -- 10 January 1948

In view of the unbalanced character or at least one of
the observers (as indicated by the report of the interview), this
investigator wonders how much credence can be given to the reports
of two objects or objects cited. For instance, two summary stats
that the first object was in sight 5-3 seconds, while two interview
indicates l5-20 minutes. Assuming that this first incident was
authentic and the shorter time correct (it evidently being the
estimate given by the second observer), there is nothing in the
evidence that is contradictory to the notion that the object ob-
served was nothing more than a slow-moving fireball. The color,
splitting into two pieces, and manner of disappearance all support 
this view.
