NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 28 April 1949, Mr. --------- CAA, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in substance that on the night of 5 April 1949, he was visiting Mr. ---------, not the Control Tower, Cleveland Municipal airport and at about 2235 he noticed a red object in the air. After calling ------ and a Mr. -------'s attention to the light and watching it for a couple of minutes, they noticed that the lights hadn't moved. He also viewed the lights through an impersonation glass. After watching the lights through the window, ------------- went outside and it still had the same brightness to the naked eye. It appeared to be a large red object about 2 to 3 feet in diameter. It was a bright clear night and there was nothing to visually compare it with. It appeared to be about 15,000 feet above the tower, 30-40 degrees from the ground and approximately north by northwest of the Control Tower. The light looked perfectly round and had off-shoots like a person would notice in an eclipse of the moon. The light was steady, did not appear to move and faded out suddenly at about 2303 hours. A light similar to this was seen the following night by the control tower operators. The control tower could not make contact with the object. The object had no sound or odor, ------------- stated that he thought it could have been a meteor, balloon, jet exhaust, autogyro, or dirigible, but any of these would have moved in the total time visible. --------- does not wear glasses.
