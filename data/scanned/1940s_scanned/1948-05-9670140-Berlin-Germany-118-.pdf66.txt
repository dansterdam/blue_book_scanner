During the period of this sighting the Navy was conducting a program
utilizing "sky hook" balloons. The Navy program was classified at this
time and therefore these balloon flights were known only to those with
a "need-to-know". It was subsequently determined that on the date of
the Goodman sighting, a balloon was released by the Navy from Clinton
County airport in Ohio. The release time of the balloon was related to
a wind plot for 7 January 1948, and it revealed that the balloon would
have been in the area of Godman at the time of the sighting.

On 7 January 1948, at the time or the sighting, Venus was also in a
directional position which coincided with that of the UFO. This planet's
angular distance from the sun was rather small, but bright enough to
be seen in the daytime. It is possible that Venus was also a cause to
this sighting, and was observed by some of the witnesses on the ground.

released by the Navy. Captain _____ was to close on this
