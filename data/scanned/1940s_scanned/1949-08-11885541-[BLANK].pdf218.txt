Incident 357 -- C olquitt County, ....orgia -- 1 February 1949

There is some confliction as to whether the objects or
the one trail preceded the trail. The trail was visible for fif-
teen minutes. If the object itself was, it could not have been
a meteor, but the gist of the report seems to indicate that only
the trail was visible for any length of time. In that case, it
could have been either the trail from a meteor or from an aircraft. Description is not sufficient to distin-
guish the two. Other observers (not those reported) have indicated that the object was a jet, flying along with a vapor
trail, but this does not necessary exclude the meteor's hypo-
thesis, because of the general unfamiliarity of the public with
such phenomena.
