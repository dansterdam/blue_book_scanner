The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. It shows a large, roughly semi-circular shape that is labeled "(APPARENT SILHOUETTE)". Above the silhouette are two formations of smaller shapes, each labeled differently: one is marked as "FORMATION FIRST SEEN" and the other as "FORMATION SEEN SECOND".

Here is the text from the document:
