I do hereby make the follow-
ing true statement to Captain Wm. H. Smith of the United States Air
Force.

At 5 minutes to 7 on the morning of February
11 th, 1949, I was standing on the corner by Simmon and Furlong's
store in Curling East, Newfoundland, waiting for the Bus to go to
work when I saw a dull red or red orange ball over the Blow-Me-Down
Light, than it died out. and then I saw it again. She spread open in
a long flame shaped something like a blow torch flame. When I saw it
it looked about the size of the Sun when it rises only not as bright,
it was red purple or blueish when it flamed out long with little bits
of flame on it like a full Oil Light in Buss. I was about 3 miles
North West of Blow-Me-Down Light when I saw it headed towards St.
George's, then it sagged to turn and head west over lar'k [sic] Harbor and
go down and disappear. It was high over the head, it looked like it
was 6 inches above the land which means it was quite high actually.
I called that ____ attention to it and said to him what do you
think of that? I told him that I thought it was an airplane crashing
or a ship in distress and shotting off flares and that I was going to
report it to the Police when I got to work. I did report it to the
Police. When we got on the Bus the driver said he saw the ball of
fire in the sky at 25 minutes to 7. I don't know who the driver was.
