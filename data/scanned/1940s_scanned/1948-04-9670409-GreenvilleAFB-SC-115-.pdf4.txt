The image appears to be a highly degraded and poor-quality photocopy or scan of a document page. There is a very faded photograph present which is hard to discern due to the quality of the copy. It seems to show a dark elliptical or disc-like shape against a light background which could be the sky. The rest of the image consists mostly of text that is difficult to read because of the quality, along with redaction marks obscuring certain portions.

Here is as much of the text transcription as can be made out from the visible portions, though some portions are illegible and cannot be accurately transcribed:

STRICTLY
[REDACTED]

At approximately 1415 hours Captain [REDACTED] and myself were standing 
in front of the flight surgeon's office when we happened to glance up and saw an object that was heard in the control tower to be 
a weather balloon. In the same [REDACTED] was brought to our attention.
It was a peculiar incident. One object was certainly [REDACTED]
and upon [REDACTED]. It seems that the altitude of weather balloon
upon further observation lowered, or dropped to a estimated to be roughly 5,000 to 10,000 feet that approximately one mile.
Later two [REDACTED] objects were noted to close proximity. Almost 
immediately, one object resorted rapidly to the north east apparently
climbing to [REDACTED] tracer to the [REDACTED] of Jet Com[REDACTED] 
Another jet made a pass at the two objects in a close seconds [REDACTED] 
how[REDACTED] the said objects seemed to outdistance both jets with ease,
the thing being noted first to be the most astonishing.

[REDACTED] the men in the tower stated that they were 
balloon[REDACTED] according to them, I undertook the task of finding out
that [REDACTED] to assist in identi[REDACTED]. [REDACTED] M-180
with a 40 power [REDACTED].

There are [REDACTED] attached hereto and circled in red
there on as many as 5 objects. These are not planes nor, as I was
told, are they not no [REDACTED] no planes were mentioned in the
m[REDACTED] or o[REDACTED] observation statements [REDACTED] placed 
in a temporary 201 file.

This [REDACTED] was [REDACTED] to and upon [REDACTED] for approximately 
three hours moving in directions West and East [REDACTED] north and south 
but making [REDACTED]and moving along the [REDACTED] be assumed 
to be due to [REDACTED] from the ground [REDACTED].
