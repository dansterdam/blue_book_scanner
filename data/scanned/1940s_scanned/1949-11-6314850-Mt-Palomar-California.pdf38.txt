Dayton, Ohio

Dear General Garland:

In accordance with our discussion of August 29th in Washington, the attached letter is submitted for your attention as you requested.

On the strength of your informal indication that ATIC could probably accommodate the request of the Los Alamos Staff Members for a colloquium on "flying saucers", I am taking the liberty of so notifying Dr. Crew at this time.

Since you will note the Los Alamos request is posed at the convenience of ATIC, I would appreciate very much a member of your staff contacting Dr. Crew directly to arrange details. A copy of any further correspondence on this matter will be sufficient for this Division to arrange the appropriate visitors' clearances to Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.

Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

Respectfully yours,

/s/ Paul M. Butman

PAUL M. BUTMAN
Lt Colonel, USAF
