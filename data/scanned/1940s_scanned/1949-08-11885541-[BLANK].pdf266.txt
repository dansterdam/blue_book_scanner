One or two additional general remarks may be relevant to space-
ships as "flying objects". The distribution of "flying objects" is
peculiar, to say the least. As far as this writer knows, all inci-
dents have occurred within the United States, whereas very similar
events could be expected to scatter their visits more strongly over
over the globe. The small area covered indicates strongly that the
flying objects are of Earthly origin, whether physical or psychological.

The lack of purpose apparent in the various episodes is also
puzzling. Only one motive can be assigned; that the spacemen, if so
they must have been satisfied long ago that we can't catch them.
It seems fruitless for them to keep repeating the same experiment.

Conclusions:

Although visits from outer space are believed to be possible,
they are believed to be very improbable. In particular, the actions
attributed to the "flying objects" reported during 1947 and 1948
seem inconsistent with the requirements for space travel.
