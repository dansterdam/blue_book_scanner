A round metallic-appearing object moving very rapidly at an estimated 
speed of 600 MPH was observed near Belmont, N.C. at approximately 1100 
the morning of 8 Mar 48. The weather was clear with almost unlimited 
with a few small scattered fleecy white clouds. It could not 
be determined if the object were a disc or sphere. Its apparent size was 
that of a small coin of a bright or silver color. It reflected the sun 
maintaining a steady reflection which did not flicker. The object which 
was under observation for about 10 seconds was on an easterly heading and 
moved in a straight line at a constant speed without apparent change in 
altitude or direction. It was impossible to determine the altitude but 
it was moving above the clouds. No sound of any kind was heard nor was 
any exhaust trail observed.

NOTE: Witness (name) is a man of excellent character and reputation 
a first-grade engineer and an employee of Duke Power Co for some 30 to 
years. He impressed the agent as being conservative and sound 
and is a technical man with a very technical and reasonable position.

Mr. (name) was correct in his statement. He does not claim 
he saw the "flying disc" merely acknowledging that they saw 
an object which they could not identify with any natural phenomenon 
or known type of aircraft. It's "rounded" & round ball 
appearing object moving very rapidly.
