The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, but there is no photograph present. The text on the document is not clearly visible due to poor image quality, and as such, I'm unable to provide an accurate transcription of the entire content. However, I will attempt to transcribe as much as I can decipher:

"...office or up to the time..."
"...that there was..."
"...near..."
"...the lights at..."
"...approximately..."
"...I couldn't..."

Due to the quality of the image, the text is largely illegible, and only fragments of words or partial lines can be made out. To obtain a complete and accurate transcription, a better-quality image or the original document would be required.
