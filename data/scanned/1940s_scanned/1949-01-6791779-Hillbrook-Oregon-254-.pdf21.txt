AGENT'S NOTE (Cont'd)

------ is 52 years old, does not wear glasses, and
does not appear to be the type of a man that would state he saw some-
thing for the sensation it would cause. ------ is about 65 years
old or for years he picked peaches, and is a little deaf. It is believed
that he might have told the story so as to relive his daughter's and
her husband's feelings when people in the area ridiculed the story in
the newspaper. 

Please note that areas with "------" seem to redact specific names or sensitive information, as is common in some official documents.
