UNCLASSIFIED 6 Jan 49

1. In reply to paragraph 1, comment No. 2, it is the opinion of this office that the enclosed negatives reveal the following information: When the negative, containing the apparent "trails" was not level when it was taken, it is much more normal that emulsions rise at there is extreme unfavorable incident light, it is enough to state that the emulsion is raised either a drop of warm water or a drop of developer struck the film at this point and rolled down this negative and the succeeding negative.

2. To further substantiate this, it will be noted that when the two (2) negatives are placed side by side with the edges of the film aligned, the so called "trail" is continuous, that is the two sections match, indicating the drop rolled on from one negative to the next.

3. Still further proof is shown on the fogged edge of the negative containing only the trail. This is proven by the fact that the trail extends beyond the normal foreat of the negative. In other words there is a trail of that section of the negative which was not exposed in the camera. This effect shows up in one negative and not the other because the negative in question is fogged, therefore, this irregularity was developed.

4. Still further proof of these effects lies in the number of unevenly developed sections of the negative.

5. Conclusion: These negatives contain no information pertinent to Project "Sign".
