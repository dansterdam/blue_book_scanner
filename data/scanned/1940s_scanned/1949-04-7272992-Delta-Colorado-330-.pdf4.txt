The photograph on the page shows what appears to be a close-up image of a partially visible circular object with a series of equidistant markings or protrusions along its edge. There is also a ruler for scale placed against the curve of the object, showing measurements in inches. The image is black and white, and the background is predominantly dark, which suggests that the object being measured might be the only subject of importance in this photograph.

The text in the image reads:
