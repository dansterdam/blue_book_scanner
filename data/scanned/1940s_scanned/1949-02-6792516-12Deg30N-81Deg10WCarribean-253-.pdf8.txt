Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

HYATTSVILLE, MARY. First object which appeared to be a disc was sighted 
at 1630 on 6 Feb 49 at 12° 30' north latitude and 81° 10' west latitude 
in the close vicinity of San Andres Island, a Colombian outpost 500 
miles off the coast. When sighted the object was at the island's course 
from the horizon as determined by the ship's sextant in the direction of 
120°. As it passed directly over the ship, several officers described 
it as a round, silvery-colored sphere. Although *** had difficulty 
in determining its height he estimated the diameter as 12 to 14 inches. 
as it passed overhead on a bearing of 310° it changed in color from silver
to yellow to red and went out of sight in the dusk at an altitude of 22°.
Wind at the time was estimated at force four, approximately 29. At 1700 
hours 2 more objects were sighted one off the port bow at an altitude 
between 50 and 50° and the other off starboard bow bearing 201° at an 
altitude of 47°. Both disappeared abeam in the dusk. None showed any 
luminosity or motivating power. Objects thought to be some type of 
weather balloons. However any balloon released from the Canal Zone would 
scarcely float to this position due to prevailing winds in this area. 
However, backtrack computation of two Russian 300-ton sloops with respect 
to wind, courses and point of sighting land a possibility that the objects 
were in free flight after release from these 2 ships which followed a 
direct course from St Thomas to Colon where they are presently awaiting 
repairs.
