Dear Mr. Monnig:

     Reference is made to your letter of 16 May 1948 to
Commanding General, Air Materiel Command, attention Major
W. E. Zehlk, Major Zehlk has been transferred; however,
the project on which he was working is a continuing one
at this Headquarters.

     Inclosed are two technical manuals on the AN/TPS-1
and SCR-625 Mine Detectors. No information is available 
at this Command as to where surplus equipment of this type 
may be obtained. 

     It would be appreciated if you would continue to
send any information of the type Major Zehlk discussed with
you to this Command, attention MCIAO-3.

                                Yours very truly

                                JAMES C. EVANS
