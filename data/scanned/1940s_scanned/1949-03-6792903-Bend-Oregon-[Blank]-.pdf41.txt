Muroc Test Field, California
2 August 1949

While fishing with a party of friends about two and a half miles up the Rogue River from its mouth at Gold Beach, Oregon, at approximately 5:00 p.m., 24 May 1949, my attention was called to an object in the sky. The object was to the East of us about one (1) mile, but approximately 5000 feet altitude, with the naked eye was to the size of a large military tent could be seen. But after watching it for approximately one minute and a half I was handed a pair of 8-power binoculars by [redacted passage] it was no longer possible to see than the object was roughly circular in shape and appeared to be 30 to 35 feet in diameter. It had somewhat the cross sectional appearance of a pancake, being thicker in the center than at the edges. A small triangular fin started approximately in the middle and grew gradually higher to the rear as the object traveled. When first sighted the object was moving very slowly. As I watched it through the glasses, it picked up speed, and when it vanished from sight, approximately 90 seconds later, it was traveling as fast or faster than a jet plane, and far and could be seen, it had no openings or protuberances of any kind other than the fin and there was neither sight nor sound of any driving force. It was a clear day, and no clouds in the sky, and the sun was at our backs as we watched the object which vanished in a southeasterly direction, mostly south.
