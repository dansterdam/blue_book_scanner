Incident #141 -- Houle, South Dakota -- 30 June 1948

The description given here obviously does not answer
to that of a star, or of any other astronomical body.

In all probability the object was a cluster of bal[loons],
carrying perhaps, cosmic ray apparatus. This would account for
the starlike appearance and the eventual breaking up into parts.
