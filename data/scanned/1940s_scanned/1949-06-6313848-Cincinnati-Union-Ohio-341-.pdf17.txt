SUMMARY (Intelligence Requirements Memorandum 4, 15 Feb 49                            A2
All Traffic signs should bear directive signals in several passenger languages. Late drivers at report at AF Form 112—Part 11)

1. This letter is a summary of the opinion of some members of the 306th Bombardment Group
(Medium) who reported seeing a meteor or medium similar phenomena to the Intelligence
Office of the 306th Bombardment Group (Medium).

2. The meteor was sighted on the 5th of June 1949 between the hours of 1900 and
2000. Majority of the personnel sighting this meteor were all within the vicinity
of Gaynair Bridge which is located eighteen miles from the heart of Tampa, in a south-
westerly direction. Consensus of opinion gathered from the majority of personnel
indicate that the meteor when first sighted was moving in a northwesterly direction.
The position of the object was placed at about 75 to 100 miles northwest of Candy
Bridge.

3. There was only one object sighted and in color, size and shape it resembled the
sun. As near as it could be determined all reports were that the path of the object
was following the curvature of the earth. The meteor was reported as having a "Z" or
"2" shaped vapor trail which persisted for twelve minutes. The color of the vapor
trail emitted changed at the evening sky reflected a dull pink color. There was no
sound whatsoever connected with the appearance of the object. Apparently the bright
flaring light exuded by the object was what attracted the majority of the observers
attention. The speed of the object was approximated to that of a slow burning meteor
which several members witnessed before.

4. After the object reached its zenith it slowly began a graduated auger shaped
descent and disappeared behind the horizon without any noticeable brightening of
light or explosion. The "Z" or "M" shaped vapor trails remained in the sky for
almost twenty minutes and then vacillated into the night sky.
