Dear Sirs:

On the evening of July 3, 1949 at about 10:20 - 10:30 P.M. I
saw a strange aircraft at about 5 miles distant at about 40-45 degrees
angle, would not guess as to height possibly 2 miles.

Outline appeared very faint, do not know length but would guess
as about 500 ft long and about 50 ft high, had 3 or 4 large round
windows which emitted a very bright light and trailed a tail of ship
was going from South to North at a great rate of speed was seen from the
top of the haze on the horizon in the south to the haze in the northern 
horizon there, disappeared, about 10-15 seconds. This craft was not a
flying saucer, but from its speed and shape it is not based on this clay
marble which we call earth.

I have reported this craft to Dr. ________ of the Buhl Planetarium
N S Pgh, Pa., and he did not have any reports of this ship.

I got your address in the Saturday Evening Post yesterday from
installment II of the article on Flying Saucers. This is the first
I have read anything about them in a magazine.

I did not get any proof of my sanity or honesty as you suggest.

This is an honest and truthful statement. I do not crave any publicity
in this matter but correspondence is welcome.

Yours truly,

___________
(10) Pgh, Pa.
