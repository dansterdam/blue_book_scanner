UNCLASSIFIED

1949. [REDACTED] accomplished this and two negatives with their respective prints are inclosed herewith and the prints are numbered "2I" and "2A".

On 25 October 1949 at 1300 hours the writer, accompanied by Sgt [REDACTED] and Captain [REDACTED] who is the Base Photography Officer, went to the exact location where Jones had mounted his tripod previously. [REDACTED] shot three pictures on approximately 2450, 2400 and 2350, respectively. [REDACTED] states that the automobile lights visible in picture No. "I" were moving on a road which runs before the houses shown in the left part of picture No. "3A" and "3B". The writer on 25 October 1949 personally inspected the area from 1800 to 2700 up to five miles away from the position of the cameraman and searched said area also with a pair of binoculars and could find no man-made structure which would account for this light appearing in the position and the angle that it does. The distance of the light above the automobile headlights appears greater than would allow it to have been suspended or attached by any object attached or anchored to the ground to the southwest and detected by the cameraman.
