6. It is realized that it might not be possible for an observer to perform the operations suggested in the preceding paragraph, during the period that the object is sighted. If he would immediately recognize what he saw and then continue such measurements, he should be able to give quantitative answers to the last two items, E and F. In interrogating observers, they should also be asked to reconstruct their observations and then within the time so inferred. It is suggested that instructions for making such quick and accurate observations be given to teacher observers, control tower operators, airport police, forest and fire wardens, and other such people who might have good chance of seeing unidentified flying objects. If any information concerning unidentified flying objects is given to the public, instructions for reliable observation should be included.

7. This organization will be pleased to be of any further assistance
required in connection with this matter.
