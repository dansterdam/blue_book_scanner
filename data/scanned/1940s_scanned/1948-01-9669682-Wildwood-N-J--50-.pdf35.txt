An Incident Reported In Cincinnati
Summary

A letter dated 19 June 1950 was received from a
Mr. ******* reporting a flying contraption
which, according to his letter, was found in his back 
yard. Photographs enclosed indicated the incident was
a hoax. However, since it could not be explained,
based on the evidence available, the matter was refer-
red to OSI.

Upon checking, it was found the originator was no
longer in Cincinnati. After a search half around the
country it was finally determined that the object re-
ported was built of scrap materials and reported as a 
joke.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
