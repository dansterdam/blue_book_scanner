10. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was round and was comparable to the brilliance of the
dazzling sun, as if it suddenly became aflame and shot across
the sky. The object was in view only a mere instant. There
was no evidence of exhaust or trails, no sound was heard, and
the object did not appear to be supported by any discern-
able means.
