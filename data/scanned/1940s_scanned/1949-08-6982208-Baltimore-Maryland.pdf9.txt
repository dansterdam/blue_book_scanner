The document contains two black and white photographs. 

The first photograph shows an airplane fuselage, resting askew and partially under a shelter with a tiled roof, surrounded by a grassy area and trees. There is some debris scattered in the foreground.

The second photograph captures the inside of a dark structure with wooden beams, where a rotor plane is stored. The rotor plane has multiple concentric ring-shaped frames, suggesting circular wings or rotor blades, and is supported by a wooden framework.
