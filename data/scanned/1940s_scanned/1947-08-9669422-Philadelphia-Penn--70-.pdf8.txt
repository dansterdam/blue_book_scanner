Incident #69, C50 ~~ Philadelphia, Pennsylvania â€“ 6 August 1947

The reports of this incident and those of #70 refer to the
same object and are typical of descriptions of relatively slow
moving meteors. The speed, trail, hissing sound (after passage --
although this could easily have been a subjective reaction), and
color all check with the object's having been a fireball, bolide,
or large meteor.
