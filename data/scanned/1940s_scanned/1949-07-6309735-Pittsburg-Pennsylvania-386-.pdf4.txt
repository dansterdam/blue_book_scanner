air craft at about 5 miles distant at about 40-45Â°. Angular angular, could not guess
as to hight probably 3 miles,
Outline appeared very faint don't know length but would quess as about 500 ft
long and about 30 ft high. had 3 or 4 large round windows which emitted
a very ligh light and trailed a Tail of Fire, length probably 100 ft long.
Ship was going from south to north
at a great rate of speed and I know from
