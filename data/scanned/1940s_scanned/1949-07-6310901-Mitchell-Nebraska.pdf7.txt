The image displayed is a scanned page that appears to contain hand-drawn illustrations rather than photographs. The drawings are quite faint, but similar to the kinds often associated with sightings reported in the context of UFO investigations. Here are the two illustrations visible on the page:

1. A circle-like shape at the top half of the page, possibly representing a top view of a circular object. There seems to be a tiny dot or circle within the larger circle, possibly indicating a domed feature or some other detail on top of the object.

2. Below the circular shape, there's a side view of a half-oval or saucer-shaped object. This could be depicting the profile of the same object shown in the circle above.

However, given the poor quality and faintness of the illustrations, it's challenging to make out distinct details.

Regarding the textual content, due to the low resolution and the faintness of the text, it is difficult to read any words accurately. It appears that there is some writing below the saucer-like drawing, potentially specifications or descriptions, but it is indiscernible in the image provided. If you need transcription of the text, a clearer and higher-resolution image would be necessary.
