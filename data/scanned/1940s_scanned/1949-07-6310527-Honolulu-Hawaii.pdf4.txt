UNCLASSIFI 27 July 1949

Subj: Flying Saucers over Ahu Airport, Honolulu.

Project 10073.C 1949.07.27.0530Z. A high altitude flying
balloon at an altitude up to 65,000 feet would be traveling
in a westerly direction at a speed of 20 knots. Another
balloon at an altitude of 60,000-70,000 feet would obviously
ascend the first and would approach the first balloon from
the south - that is assuming that a second aid was designed
this, it could conceivably hover over the first in the 60,000-
70,000 foot level giving the effect of circling the first,
and then upon descending to the 60,000 foot level take off
toward the west. No explanation for the origin of the
"balloons" sighted by r/s ██████ could be obtained from
official sources.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
