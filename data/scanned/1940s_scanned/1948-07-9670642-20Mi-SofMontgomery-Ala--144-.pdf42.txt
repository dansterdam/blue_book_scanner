STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN CLARENCE S. CHILES

Atlanta, Ga.
Aug 3, 1948

To:
Eastern Air Lines
Miami, Fla.

The following is a report of an unidentified aircraft which was sighted by [redacted] and me, as we were twenty miles southwest of Montgomery, Ala. July 24, 1948, as we were on Eastern's trp 576.

At 2:45 A. M. we were cruising at 5,000 feet when there came, what looked like a jet type of aircraft to our right and slightly above meeting us. It was a clear moonlight night with the visibility excellent; therefore, we were able to view the ship as it passed for a period of around ten seconds. It was clear there were no wings present, that it was powered by some jet or other type of power shooting flame from the rear some fifty feet. There were two rows of windows, which indicated an upper and lower deck, from inside these windows a very bright light was glowing. Underneath the ship there was a blue glow of light.

After it passed it pulled up into some light broken clouds and was lost from view. There was no prop wash or rough air felt as it passed.

After talking to the only passenger awake at the time, he saw only the trail of fire as it passed and pulled into the clouds. I called the company at Columbus and asked if there was any reported jet army craft and requested if the ATC had any aircraft under control. I was told that no such craft was reported by either source.
