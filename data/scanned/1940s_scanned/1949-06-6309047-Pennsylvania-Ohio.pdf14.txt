Dear Sir:

I am sending you my observations of what appeared to be a 
meteor of a very bright intensity which I observed while sitting
in my back yard on Sat. night. The time was approximately
midnight. The duration of visibility for me was very short,
probably no more than 2 to 3 seconds as it disappeared from view
behind a house to the west of me. The color was a bright blue
and the intensity was enough to light up the area around us
as if a Fourth of July rocket had gone off several hundred feet
in the air. The duration of fall - it seemed to come from the
area in the vicinity of the handle of the Big Dipper and fall
to the southwest. I was facing north and when it disappeared
from my view it was almost straight northwest of me. The
angle seemed to be a perfect circle.

                                   N

                                   [----ed out text---]

I hope my very amateur observations may be of some help
to you.

                                               Respectfully yours,
