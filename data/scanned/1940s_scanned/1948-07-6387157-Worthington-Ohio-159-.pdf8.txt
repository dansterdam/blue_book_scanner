The text in the document reads as follows:

---
Object appeared cylindrical in shape with no apparent wings or tail
surfaces. No standard aircraft lights were displayed and there were no
engine noises. The object emitted a steady silver glow.

Altitude was judged to be approximately 3000 ft and the object was moving
very slowly in a southwest course. It was in line of vision some 15 minutes.
No other aircraft military or civilian were in vicinity of Felton's
horizon or vicinity. The sky was clear with high scattered clouds and
the visibility was good.

NOTE: ******* questioned by Maj Campbell of the USAF, but nothing
further was gained by this interview with the exception
that his wife also saw the object.
