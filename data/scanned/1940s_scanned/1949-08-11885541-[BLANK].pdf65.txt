SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report.  Give effective textual reference paragraph.  List attachments at which.  Begin text of report at area in Part III.)
1. The Swedish Defense has found no proof that any unidentified flying objects, missiles or vehicles have passed over or near Sweden to date.

2. All reports of sightings in Sweden during the past year, irrespective of the form they were submitted, have been funneled to a special section of the Defense Staff, who to this writing was Pilot A. Toolanen who was exclusively in this investigation.  All sightings followed, somewhat along the lines of the 27 of Project "SIGN".  All of the sightings to himself of sightings; with each case an excess of astronomical phenomena.

3. In addition, 3 ground radar stations and 2 radar equipped destroyers cooperated to maintaining watch.  The radar. equipments were Swedish modified British sets of fairly short range and were not operated on a 24-hour basis; however, no unexplained sightings were made with this equipment.

4. Conclusions: Although the possibility exists that objects have traversed Sweden and its adjacent waters, no proof has been obtained to confirm such flight in any instance.

COMMENT: The cooperation of the Defense Staff in securing this information was undoubtedly given in an effort to emphasize their need for additional U.S. radar equipment. The Swedish Air Board had previously negotiated with the Bendix Corporation for 20 TPS-1a sets but had been refused an export license by our State Department. The members of the Defense Staff, to whom I talked, were eager to point out the good use to which such equipment could be put for flying objects.  And the Swedes as convinced by our mutual interests in unidentified objects could move toward solving the problem as by the refusal to grant an export license for such equipment will do more good in implementing our national policy, as expressed in the National Security Council documents NSC 20/4, than would the information we might receive from the use of such equipment here.
