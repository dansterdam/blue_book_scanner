The photograph shows a nocturnal scene with a bright cityscape at the bottom. Above the illuminated city, there is a prominent cloud formation. The cloud is lit from above or within, creating a stark contrast against the dark sky. The cloud appears to have a somewhat flattened, elongated shape with a somewhat smooth underbelly and rougher, textured upper parts, which could lead some observers to associate it with classic "UFO" imagery. The quality of the picture is grainy and high-contrast, which is typical for older photographic technology and lower light conditions.
