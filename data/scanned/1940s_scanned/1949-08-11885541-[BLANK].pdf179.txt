Incident No. 152 - 31 July 1948, 0025 Hours, Indianapolis, Indi-
ana.

A man and his wife saw an object shaped like a cymbal, lusterless white
in color, at an altitude of 2000 ft. The object moved across the sky
to the east at approximately 1000 MPH, on a level course and shimmering
in the sun, giving the appearance of spinning. It was twenty foot in
diameter and six to eight foot high in the center. There was no sound
or exhaust.

AUC Opinion; This object could conceivably be the same or dif-
ferent aerofoils as that seen in Incident 154, although all the remaining
evidence is widely divergent. No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.
