STATEMENT

Undersigned officer, with Lt. Dall as Wing Man, took off from Clark Air Force
Base at 1010 hours, 8 September 1949 to fly Calibration Mission for 622nd AC & W
Squadron. After we had climbed to 25,000 feet over the field, Varnish Control gave
a Vector of 360° and continued climbing until we reached 30,000 feet. We continued on
to heading and at a point east of Lingayen was given a 5° correction to the right.
We followed this course about 120 miles north of the field. At this point Varnish
gave us a heading of 170°, which we followed, and we began to let down at approximately
by 15° 20 minutes North and 120° 55 minutes East. We landed at 1210 hours. While
we were flying at 30,000 feet we did not see any vapor trails, but noticed scattered
thunder showers circling the entire valley.
