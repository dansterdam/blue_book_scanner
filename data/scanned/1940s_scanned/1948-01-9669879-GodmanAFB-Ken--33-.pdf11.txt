Mr. Loedding, Kenbrook 7111 - 21204, Air Intelligence, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio
                                                  Called

Col. B. O. Davis, Jr., Commanding Officer, 332d Fighter Wing, LAAB, Cola.17, O.

Subject: Request for Information re: objects in the sky

Mr. L: Colonel Davis, this is Mr. Loedding, Air Intelligence, Wright Field.
I understand that a conversation took place January 7, Wednesday,
between Godman Field, Kentucky and your base at Lockbourne regarding
an unidentified flying object.

Col. D: If it did I am not aware of it Mr. Loedding. I read about it in
the Air Force Times a year or day - a statement about Col. Hicks saying
something looked like a flying saucer. That's all I know about it

Mr. L: Capt. Dusler said there was a call from Lockbourne Air Base and they
were assisting in this thing.

Col. D: I personally know nothing of that Mr. Loedding.

Mr. L: I wonder if you could make an investigation -- and think if some-
body in the tower did see it, maybe you could call me back and I
could come there and talk to somebody. Like to interrogate them.
Whether anybody on this station saw a foreign object in the air -

Mr. L: and who they discussed it with anyone - particularly Godman
Field. If you call me and I will drive over and talk to them.

Col. D.: Shall I call you in case I don't find anybody?

Mr. L: It would be a good idea to tell me what you find out. My number is
21204, Kenbrook 7111, Wright Field.

Col. D: I will be glad to do that Mr. Loedding.

Mr. L: I will appreciate it, Colonel. What is your extension?

Col. D: Fr. 7-6711 Extension 201.

Mr. L: Thank you very much, sir.
