Commanding General,
Air Materiel Command, Attn: MCIA
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio.

Gentlemen;

I am in receipt of a letter from Colonel W. R. Clingerman,
Chief, Tech. Intelligence Div., requesting photographs of
meteorite trails.

Enclosed is a series of four photos taken in the vicinity
of Pampa, Texas, of a meteorite trail on 20 May 1944.
These photos were made from 40 to 50 seconds after the
meteor's flight at about 15 second intervals. The time
interval was checked by actual rehearsal.

I hope these photos will be of help to you in your
research.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature]
