NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Summary of Information

The following information is taken from an article in THE SAVANNAH MORNING NEWS, dated 24 July 1949:

"Darien, July 23. - Flying saucers, rockets or whatever one may choose to call the mysterious lights currently being noted in the evening sky, this reporter has at least seen one.

"Driving south along the Coastal Highway near Darien Thursday night about 7:50, there were five others in the car - Mrs. █████ and █████. All saw the phenomenon, though it was in view less than a minute. It appeared first as a strong white light with an afterglow, streaking across the southern sky from east to west, then it became the color of flame and disappeared instantaneously as though it had been turned off with an electrical switch.

"The night was cloudy, there were no stars visible, and the light, while it appeared about the size and shape of one of the lights of a plane, traveled with far greater speed than that of any aircraft ever seen in this section.

"Mr. and Mrs. ████████ of South Newport, who were driving along the highway at that hour, also reported seeing the mysterious light." (F-6)
