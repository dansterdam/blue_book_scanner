Incident #243 -- Los Alamos, New Mexico -- 28 December 1948

The object described here seems to belong to the mysterious family of "New Mexico green flashes." See report on Incident #223 for detailed discussion.

It can be said, however, that it this is regarded as an isolated incident, the description is not very different from that of a fireball. It is the occurrence of these incidents in a seemingly definite pattern that argues very strongly against the meteoric hypothesis.
