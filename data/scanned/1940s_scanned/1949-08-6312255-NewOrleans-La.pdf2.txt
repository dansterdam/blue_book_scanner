The photograph shows an ambiguous black and white image that resembles a smudged vertical shape with slightly curved edges on the right side. It is not entirely clear what the object is, due to the quality of the image and the lack of distinct features. Below the image is a ruler measuring the width of the object displayed. The ruler in the image shows measurements from 6 inches to 11 inches, indicating the object is slightly wider than 3 inches.

The text in the document is as follows:

"UNCLASSIFIED"

Both occurrences of the word "UNCLASSIFIED" are in all caps with one instance at the top right corner of the page and the other at the bottom right corner near the ruler. There also appears to be a faint, redacted or blotched out text at the top left corner, which is unreadable due to its quality.
