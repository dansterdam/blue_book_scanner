the sighting also lasted for thirty (30) minutes of flight (ascension) at a rate of 1400 ft/min). I calculated the speed of the object as follows:

(Y) TO STATION
X (1ST DETECT)
-----
40000
-----
40000 x = 4.8 miles
-----
40000
-----
40000 y = 8.6 miles

40000 x
-----
2131
40000 y
-----
9463

4.8 + 8.6 = 13.4 miles/minute x 60 = Approx 800 miles/HR

4. The shape of the object appeared to be triangular and was greyish-brown in color. It is the belief of the undersigned that the object could have been an aircraft similar to the Convair XF-92A delta wing interceptor which is undergoing tests at Muroc Air Force Base, California.
