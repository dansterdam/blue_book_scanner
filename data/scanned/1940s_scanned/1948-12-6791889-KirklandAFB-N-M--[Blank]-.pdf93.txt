Incident #241, a, b -- Los Alamos, New Mexico -- 20 December 1948

Dr. LaPaz, who has interviewed the various observers of
this incident, has stated that the object seen was not a falling
meteorite. He had access to more detailed information than is
contained in the typed reports offered here, and he is an expert
in these matters.

It should be noted, however, that the reports available
to this investigator show many contradictions concerning the color
and trajectory of the object: One observer gives the color of
fall as 450; another states that the trajectory was horizontal.
Most observers indicate a bluish-white light; only one mentions
the color Green, which is so predominant in the New Mexico "green
flashes."

It is not at all certain that the object observed here
belongs to the "green flash" family of incidents.
