The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document with handwritten text. I will now provide the text as requested:

p m, in a clear sky I saw a large cylindrical shaped
object come out of the east toward due westerly course. The
angle of elevation about 30 to 35 degrees and from 10
to 15 miles distant at a passing point. Before reaching 
this point it gave off a plume of smoke for about 22 seconds
in a Blue mist color, flecked with red to orange dots,
on the entire observed that were round in shape
extending about one half the length of the ship & then
it was elliptical. They were fire engine red. Immediately
it was larger than that of Zeppelin Spectres I could
not guess but the time was less than 2 minutes,
I hope the enclosed sketch will be of some help.
