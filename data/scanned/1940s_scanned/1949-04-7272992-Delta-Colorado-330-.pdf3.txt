The photograph appears to show a protractor-like circular instrument with multiple markings on it, probably representing degrees or angles. It is accompanied by a ruler for scale. There is also some text in the image.

As for the text present in the document, here is a textual reproduction:

---
FOOT CANDLE (as in "ft-cd")
2-00023 7-20-24
(Ruler measurements from 1 to 9 inches)

A M MEASUREMENT (unreadable) ASSIGNED 

(The text "A M MEASUREMENT" is followed by partially obscured text that is not clearly readable.)

Please note that due to the quality of the image and potential damage or obscurity on the original document, some of the text is difficult or impossible to interpret accurately.
