"""
No. 175; Pilot balloon sounding released from Albuquerque at same
time as observation. Upper winds show WNW flow hence could not have been
the AB balloon. Great differences of opinion exist as to speed and shape
of the object. One observer states that the object was not a weather
balloon. All evidence indicates that this is true. Conclusion: Not a
balloon.
