The image depicts a page with most of the text redacted with black markings, leaving very little visible text. There is a simple line drawing on the right side of the page. The drawing appears to be a diagram representing a shape that could be interpreted as a craft, possibly a UFO, with annotated parts. There are lines pointing to various features of the drawn shape with notes.

Unfortunately, due to the redaction, it is not possible to apply OCR to most of the content, as the text is obscured. Here is the text that is visible and not redacted:

- [3,000]
- Dayton, Ohi.
- Dayton
- Evidence Officen - Case B.
- .23137

All other potentially informative text has been blacked out and is therefore unreadable. The handwritten notes next to the drawing mention "Base", "Yellow", a measurement of "15 ft", and "Center of attraction magnetism??", though the exact context of these notes is unclear due to the lack of surrounding text.
