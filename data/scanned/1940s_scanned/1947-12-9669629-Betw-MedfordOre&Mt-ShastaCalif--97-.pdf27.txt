ATTN: DSS

l. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relating to sighting of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Slips are a continuation of the files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendations as to whom of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishments of Project "SIGN" except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are checked by the Intelligence Department of this Command. All FFBDs are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" OFFICE, MCIAXO-3. These checks are distinct from the checks of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce. (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office, that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining incidents are balloons.
