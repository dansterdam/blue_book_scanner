Incident #137, 137a -- Chapel Hill, North Carolina -- 7 July 1948

This report refers solely to a sound phenomenon. Statements of two witnesses indicate specifically that no object was seen. The summary sheet given here seems to confuse the consideration of this incident with that of incident #138.

Fireballs and bright meteors are often known to emit sounds similar to the rolling of thunder. The information given in this report is so meager, however, that, while the sound referred to could have been meteoric, no decision can be made.

It seems more probable that natural aircraft were heard.
