Those Things Are Back!
Disc Spotted in The Sky

"Flying Sauceritis," the epidemic which struck many
parts of the nation in 1947, came to Pinellas County again early
yesterday morning.
Radio newsmen said they saw a huge round object flying over
Safety Harbor about 1:30 a. m. are the town's rotund police
chief, H. E. Benson, and W. Grusie Wilson, a plumber.
Says Wilson:
"The large round whirling dise . . . was headed south
and appeared to be going between 100 and 500 miles an hour.
it was perfectly round and appeared to be as large as four of
the biggest Army planes.
"It ejected formed a complete circle. It threw out a strange
greenish light with white streaks on the edges."
Benson, who tips the scales at 300 pounds plus and shouldn't
know something about size, said the saucer was "as big as a
tire ring."
