as bri^t as it is wooi most brilliant. However, under exceptionally
good atmospl-iic conditions a:i with the cye sigi-tod from th.c direct
rays of the sun, Venus mi^it be seen as a;: extraordinarily tiny bri^t point
of li^it. It can be shown that it was de!:i!itcly bri^ter than the
surroundi:.; sky, for o:: the date i; question Venus had a solid-an^le
of c seconds of arc, or a tctal apparent surface area of approximately
125 square seconds. Assuming t.:at a square second of sky would be a
trifle bri^tor than th;- fourth magnitude, a portion of the sky of t:.e
same area presented by /.enus would be about .- i...a.m.aitude. Since t: e
planet, h::.owever, was -.£., it was c ti.-es bri^ter tnan an equivalent
area of sky. while it is it.us physically rossible to see '«*.enus at suc. 
times, usually its p.inpoinc diameter ai:d the larg expanses of s:y
makes its casual detection very unlikely. i;, however, a, person hapvens

good. It is improwble, for exaip.e, that Venus would be seen under 
tr.ese ci;cunstances in a lar*e city.
