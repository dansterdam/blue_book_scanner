TO: WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.

ON THE EVENING OF 7, JANUARY 1948 AT APPROXIMATELY 19:25
O'CLOCK THE UNDERSIGNED WITNESSED A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY,
IN THE SOUTH WEST DIRECTION OF C.C.A.F., THE OPERATIONS CLERK AND
MYSELF FIRST WITNESSED IT AND CALLED THE TOWER AND HAD THEM LOOK AT
IT THROUGH THEIR FIELD GLASSES. THEY SAID IT WAS MOVING BUT COULD
NOT MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS. I WENT UP TO THE TOWER AND LOOKED AT IT
THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES AND IT APPEARED TO ME MOVING UP AND DOWN
AND FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS AT ONE TIME CLOUDS CAME BETWEEN THE OBJECT
AND THE BASE BUT THE LIGHT COULD STILL BE SEEN THROUGH THE CLOUDS.
APPROXIMATELY 19:45 THE OBJECT BEGAN TO MOVE AWAY TOWARD THE SOUTH
