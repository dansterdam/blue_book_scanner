While on vacation near [redacted] Oregon during the latter part of May, 1947 I saw a whole flotilla (more than 10) in the sky at midday with fair cloudiness, flying in a southerly direction Called the attention of the party to the same objects, circular in shape, crossing the sky at a high altitude and at a high rate of speed. Woman who estimated the height and its to be approx. ten thousand ft. One man, a former Navy pilot, said no ship now built was large enough to hold such a group in close formation divide. An estimate was tried, but it exceeded our range of vision in two or three minutes. The day had been clear, visibility was good and the sun was at mid-position. Other occupants of the party were inclined to believe the objects were [redacted], but there was no sound and the object traveled on a direct course.
