it seems to this investigator, be weighed in terms of the overwhelming evidence of the manner of disappearance over the horizon.

The stellar magnitude of Venus on January 7 was -3.7, which makes it 16 times brighter than the brightest star Arcturus. Venus, when as bright as this and sinking through interstices in a host of clouds, could very easily give the effect of a flaring object with a tail. Concomitantly, the erratic motion reported by some witnesses, ties up the said motion of clouds past the object could give the illusion of rapid movement, as when clouds scud by the moon, or this effect could have been a psychological illusion; a third possibility, remote but based on a real-observed phenomenon, is that, owing to thermal inversions in the atmosphere, stars near the horizon have been known to jump about erratically through arcs of two or three times the moon's apparent diameter. Venus, when very close to the horizon, has been known to twinkle brilliantly with rapidly changing colors.

It appears to the present investigator, in summing up the evidence presented, that we are forced to the conclusion that the object observed in the early evening hours of January 7, 1953, at these widely separated localities, was the planet Venus. To assume that a terrestrial object could be located so high as to be visible simultaneously over a wide area, could be of such intrinsic brightness (of incredible brightness, far surpassing any known earth-made light), and would so placed essentially at the very position of Venus in the sky over an
