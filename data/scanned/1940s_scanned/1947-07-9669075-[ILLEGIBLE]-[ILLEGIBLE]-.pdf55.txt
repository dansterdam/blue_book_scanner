The image appears to be of a page containing a photograph that is affixed to the paper. The photograph is black and white and is notably poor in quality, making specific details hard to distinguish. It seems to show a skyline or horizon with a long, somewhat diagonal contrail or trail of smoke in the air, typically associated with a passing aircraft or meteorological phenomenon. The lower part of the image also contains a segment that looks like it might be the edge of a desk or a similar wooden surface, suggesting the photo might have been taken at an angle where this additional element was unintentionally captured. 

Unfortunately, due to the quality of the image, I am unable to accurately perform an OCR function to produce text from the document. The photograph appears to be old and damaged, adding to the difficulty of discerning any text that may be present. If there is any text on the image, it is not legible due to the poor resolution and quality of the scan.
