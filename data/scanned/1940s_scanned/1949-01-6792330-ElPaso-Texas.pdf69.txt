NARRATIVE SUMMARY: Between the hours of 1740 to 1750, 30 Jan 1949, 
M/Sgt ROLLAND M. McDONALD, saw an object which looked like a solid fuel rocket
about 4 feet in length approximately over the Municipal Airport, El Paso, Texas
(could have been nearer or farther). It was about 3,000 feet high and was
traveling in a slight downward angle. A stream of fire about 15 or 20 feet
long was shooting out the back. (Fire died out when object appeared to be 
over the Administration Building of the Airport. -- seen in front of Post
Theatre, Ft Bliss) Flame appeared to be definitely that of a powder rocket
rather than a liquid fuel rocket. No sound was heard. Color of flame
was bluish white. Body of the object was cylindrical and gray-blue in color.
Flame was six to ten (6 to 10) times the length of the cylinder. The flame
appeared to change in intensity and length. It flared out in the manner of
a powder rocket. Direction of travel was north to south.

Sgt SITKO of the 9930 TSU, Security Detachment at Research and Development,
Ft Bliss, Texas, also saw this object.
