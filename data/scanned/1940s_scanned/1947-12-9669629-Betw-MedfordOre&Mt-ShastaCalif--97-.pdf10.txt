Extract from Weekly Intelligence Summary, HQ, ATC, dtd 1-14-48

UNIDENTIFIED AIR OBJECTS: The A-2 of the Eastern Pacific Wing, Pacific
Division, Air Transport Command, reports the following four observations of
unidentified air objects all occurring in the western states at 1925 or 1926
hours Pacific Standard Time (PST) on 30 December 1947.

While on an administrative flight from Great Falls, Montana, to Fairfield-
Suisun Airfield, on the night of 30 December 1947, a possible rocket sight-
ing was made by the pilot, Lt. Col. "W.T.," W/O "W.B." and the co-pilot,
Major A. A. Andris, HQ, FEAF of C-54 airplnes. At 1926 hours PST, location
42° 30' North, 142° 22' West (near the meeting point of the Nevada, Utah
and Idaho state borders) while cruising at 10000 feet on unidentified object,
trailing green and blue flames, was viewed for a period of two seconds. The
object was descending vertically at a very high rate of speed and seemed to
slow down slightly upon nearing the ground. The object appeared at a position
of 2:30 o'clock in relation to the airplane and the flame were intensely bright.

A report was received at the Fairfield-Suisun tower from the McClellan Airfield
tower at Sacramento stating a report had been received from Sacramento Air De-
C-47 #7485 flying near Roseville, California, to the effect that an object was
sighted at 1925 hours PST trailing several colors of flame with red and green
predominating. The object was travelling at a very high speed and low altitude
eastward towards some hills Northeast of Sacramento at approximately 30 50'
North, 121° 53' West which became considerably larger. Fairfield tower re-
quested a local night flying C-47 to also investigate the fire for a possible
aircraft accident and the pilot reported over the fire at 1933 hours PST at
a position of 30° 50' North and 120° 53' West. The fire was burning in a tri-
angular shape over a small area and went out at 2155. Two particular points
in the fire seemed to burn with a bright blue green flame.

The Fairfield control tower obtained a report approximately 2300 hours PST,
30 December 1947, from Hamilton Field Flight Control, that at 1926 hours a
motorist on US Highway #40, thirty miles West of Lovelock, Nevada, approxi-
mately 39° 53' North, 119° 53' West had seen an object explode in air at an
altitude of 1000 to 1200 feet.

The Fairfield Control tower obtained a report from Oakland Airport Flight
Control (CAA), at approximately 2315 hours PST, 30 December 1947, that United
Airlines Flight 191 proceeding on airways between Medford, Oregon and Mount
Shasta, California, observed a flash at 1925 hours PST just North of their
position.
