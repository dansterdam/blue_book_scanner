SUBJECT: AMC Opinion Concerning "Flying Discs"

TO: Commanding General
     Army Air Forces
     Washington 25, D. C.
     ATTN: Brig. General George Schulgen
     AC/AS-2

1. As requested by AC/AS-2 there is presented below the considered
opinion of this Command concerning the so-called "Flying Discs." This
opinion is based on interrogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2 and
preliminary studies by personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, Engineering
Division -T-3. This opinion was arrived at in a conference between
personnel from the Air Institute of Technology, Intelligence T-2, Office,
Chief of Engineering Division, and Aircraft, Power Plant and Propeller
Laboratories of Engineering Division T-3.

2. It is the opinion that:

    a. The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary
    or fictitious.

    b. There are objects probably approximating the shape of a disc,
    of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made
    aircraft.

    c. There is a possibility that some of the incidents may be
    caused by natural phenomena, such as meteors.

    d. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme
    of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which
    must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly
    aircraft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects
    are controlled either manually, automatically, or remotely.

    e. The apparent common description of the objects is as follows:-

        (1) Metallic or light reflecting surface

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS
