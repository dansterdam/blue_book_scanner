Incident No. 66 -- 21 June 1947, Daytime, Cascade Mountains, Washington.
A project officer could well find no signs or reasons why this incident should
need investigation by this project. The two objects were white with fluctu-
ating reddish bottoms and bent in dio one. They made no noise. In this the second
World War sight, the observer did characterize the objects as no white as to be
read of a former sighting (incident no. 17) also occurring; on 24 June 1947, and
submitted this report solely to add credence to the version who recovered that
story. While there appears to be an attempt on the part of the observer to dis-
count that these objects were possibly the same as those reported on (incident No.
17), there are several major differences, notably as Dr. Hynek points out (appx1e),
that there detected tails, and that the inferred line of directed pointed from
the estimated distance, is quite different. Dr. Valley (app b) has punctured
and Dr. Hynek concurred that it is difficult to take seriously the peculiar action
of the compass for this would imply fantastically large magnetic fields.

AFSB Opinion: From the limited evidence submitted, it is impossible to reach
a definite conclusion. However, two possible physiological factors are readily
apparent; one, the observer stated he utilized no optical solely because he
had read several days following his observation that another sighting occurred,
he very likely either consciously or inadvertently may have attempted to conform
his report to that recounted in the newspaper; and two, the colored halo report
with inference of huge magnetic fields, as to the implications of which he was
obviously uninformed.
