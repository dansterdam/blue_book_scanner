1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MC1AXS,
dated 12 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation Of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 15, "Direction
of Flight; of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that action is
specified as the direction towards which the objects appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Spotting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.
