AFFIDAVIT

       January 7, 1948
         Franklin, Kentucky

  I, William O. Mayes, of Route #3, Lake Spring Road, Franklin, Kentucky,
Simpson County, do state thus:-- on 7 January 1948 at approximately three
P.M. EWT. I saw and any airplane overhead traveling from north west to
south easternly direction but could note see any plane due to the
overcast. At this time an airplane was heard at a very high altitude
traveling at a terrific rate of speed. In a few moments an object
rotating end over end was seen at a tremendous speed from out of the 
overcast, It appeared and make a landfall headed in a south easternly
direction at a very steep angle. I could hardly keep it in view, it traveled
so fast. No fins were seen. It hit or grazed at a three-fifths of a mile from
me. It didn't explode when it hit the ground and did not burn. 

  In witness whereof, I have herenuto set my hand and seal at my home
on Route #3, Lake Spring Road, Franklin, Kentucky this 7th. day of January
1948.

The document is difficult to read, and appears to be a typed statement with handwritten signatures. The readability is not perfect, hence there are gaps where specific details like identification numbers are not clear due to the quality of the scan.
