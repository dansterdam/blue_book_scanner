incident. 2200 - 2220 Mins. Form - Color, UFO not -- visible but

If it were not for the dubious moral color of this
object, it would answer the description of a fireball. In view,
however, of many similar observations in the last twelve years, this
interpretation is open to question. It should be noted that while
heading outward over much farthest north track did so majority
of the "green flashes," yet at the observer was much south.
Nevertheless, considering the geographical differences, and the
differences in times and in time of night of the observation, this
object could very well have been a fireball. Insufficient evi-
dence is offered to decide whether it belongs to sect; the man-made
objects or an arm to fireballs.
