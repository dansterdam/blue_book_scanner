Incident #1 -- Indianapolis, Indiana -- 23 July 1948

This incident and #2 are being considered together by this investigator, because they both occurred in Indianapolis, were separated by just two days, were observed at approximately the same time of day, and included certain similarities of description.

Both incidents are clearly non-astronomical.

Drawings are available for both objects observed, and, although they are considerably different, they might conceivably represent the same object viewed on edge and in plan. Both have approximately the same size, although the size given by one observer is about three times that given by the other. Both have 3:1 ratios of length to width. If these objects were real, it seems to be a startling coincidence too far to assume that they were entirely independent of each other.

Were there by any chance some special glider experiments going on in top vicinity of Indianapolis at that time?

Barring hallucinations, these two incidents and incidents #17, 40, 75, and 84 seem to be the most tangible, from the standpoint of description, of all those reported, and the most difficult to explain away as sheer nonsense.

It should be noted that both incidents #1 and #2 had two observers.
