NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 19 April 1949, Informant __________________, Pastor
of the Lutheran Church, was interviewed and advised that he was sitting in the rear
of a Santa Fe bus returning from ____________, Arizona on 15 April 1949, when he observed
the Fireball for duration of two (2) or two (2) seconds at 0300. Informant was
approximately eight (8) miles east of Williams, Arizona on Highway 66 (designated by
an X on the Prescott Sectional aeronautical Chart, Exhibit A) when he saw a brilliant
flash of light and two (2) seconds later observed the Fireball. The Fireball silhouetted
the northern horizon and Informant believed it was North and East of Sillgreaves
Mountain (approximate location shown by a circle on Exhibit A). The fireball appeared
to be approximately 30 degrees above the horizon traveling in an easterly direction
at a rapid rate of speed. The total observed time was approximately 16 hours from
this Fireball and then it was greenish blue in color. The Fireball appeared to be a
meteorite and the observer advised it was the largest one he had ever seen. Informant
was unable to estimate the speed of the Fireball and heard no sound inasmuch he was
riding near the bus engine with the windows closed. The sky was cloudy and the Fireball
had no apparent effect on the clouds. The Fireball traveled in a straight line and
mysteriously disappeared behind an obstacle. This observer was unable to give any
further information and knew of no one on the bus or in the community who had seen the
Fireball.
