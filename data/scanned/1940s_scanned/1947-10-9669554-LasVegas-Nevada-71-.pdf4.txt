Incident #71 -- Las Vegas, Nevada -- 8 or 9 October 1947 
(Superscedes interim report of 2/1/49)

In everything except the course flown, the description 
given here answers to that of a fireball. The course indicated in 
this incident, however, appears almost fatal to such a hypothesis. 
No fireball on record, to this investigator's knowledge, has been 
known to turn back on itself. Lasting fireballs have been observed, 
however, that were invisible save for a marked white cloudlike 
trail.

Most fireballs pursue essentially straight courses, and, 
in fact, apparent deviations are often caused by illusions of 
perspective and of a spherical sky; real deviations are caused by 
effects of the navigator's encounter with the atmosphere. To execute 
a curved trajectory would require highly extraordinary circumstances 
indeed, and a meteoric explanation for this incident must be regarded 
as most improbable.

It is more likely that some sort of aircraft was under
observation.
