012025Z, and 022025Z from AAF Goose Bay, Labrador, reporting several
radar sightings of unidentified aerial objects. It is suggested
some Base Intelligence Officer be directed to initiate an immediate
investigation of the reported sightings.

2. Pertinent information relative to the reported objects is
desired as follows:

      a.  Was object apparently practicing radar evasive tactics
when it disappeared from the scope periodically, or was it running
into normal or skip "null" zones affecting appearances of all aircraft?

Five copies of Essential Elements of Information form are attached
as an aid to the interviewing officer in obtaining the desired inform-
ation.
