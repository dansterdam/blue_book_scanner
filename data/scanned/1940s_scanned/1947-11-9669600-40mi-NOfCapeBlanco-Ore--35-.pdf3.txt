incident #35 -- off coast of Oregon -- 12 November 1947

The information given here is too meager for a definite
conclusion to be drawn concerning the identity of the object ob-
served. It is probable, however, that they were two parts of a
meteor that had broken upon entrance into the earth's atmosphere.
The length of time in sight is unusual, perhaps, but one wonders whether
this might not have been grossly overestimated for psychological
reasons. Otherwise, the scanty description favors the meteoric hy-
pothesis.
