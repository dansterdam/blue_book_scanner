                                              incidents          percentage

1. Astronomical
   a. High probability                         42                 18
   b. Fair or low probability                  33                 14
                                               ___                ___
                                               Total              75                 32

2. Non-astronomical but suggestive
   of other explanations
   a. Balloons or ordinary aircraft            43                 20
   b. Rockets, flares, or
      falling bodies                           23                 10
   c. Miscellaneous (reflections,
      auroral streamers, birds, etc.)          18                  5
                                               ___                ___
                                               Total              84                 35

3. Non-astronomical, with no evident
   explanation
   a. Lack of evidence precludes
      explanation                             50                 13
   b. Evidence offered suggests no
      explanation                             43                 20
                                               ___                ___
                                               Total              76                 35

According to those findings, 78, or almost one-third, of
the 237 incidents yet remain without an appropriate hypothesis for
explanation. It is likely, of course, that with additional evidence
a number of those included in class 3a would be easily explained (some
of them, probably, astronomically). There are, however, at least 46
incidents in which the evidence, if correct as given, does not fit any
simple explanation, and a number of these were reported by presumably
well-qualified observers.
