Incident #187 -- Godman Air Force Base, Kentucky -- 12 August 1948

There can be no question but that the object sighted in
this incident was Venus. It was just three weeks past its period
of greatest brilliancy, and was somewhat from the sun. The close
approximation between the observed position of the object and the ac-
tual position of Venus, determined by others concerned with the
incident and rechecked by this investigator, is convincing.
