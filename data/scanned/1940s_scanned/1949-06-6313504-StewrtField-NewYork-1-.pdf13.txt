                                       Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Re radars now operating on ground
   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size of target:

   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (130Â°), etc., and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observ-
      vable, how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed?

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several targets upon approach:

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent with size of object; faint; fading; pulsating at regular rate:

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted
   a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits:

   b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.:

                                                 GENERAL

1. Teletype sequences of local weather conditions:
