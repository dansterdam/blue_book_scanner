Incident No. 68 â€” 24 June 1947, Daytime, Cascade Mountains, Washington.
A prospector reported sighting five or six round objects with tails, 1000 ft overhead, heading S.E., and banking in the sun. The objects were in sight 45-60 seconds
and alleged to be thirty feet in diameter. They made no noise. While the objects
were within sight, the observers compass 
fluctuated wildly. He states that he
read of a similar sighting (Incident No. 17) also occurring on 24 June 1947, and
outlined those 8-10 closely
in form to those seen. While in 
this
story. While there appears to be an attempt on the part of the observer to in-
fer that these objects were possibly the same as those reported in (Incident No.
17), there are several major differences, notably as Dr. Hynek points out (app.2), 
that these objects had tails, and that the inferred size, as determined from
the estimated distance, is quite different. Dr. Valley (App 1) has pointed out
and Dr. Hynek concurred that it is difficult to imagine any
the poler action 
of the compass for this would imply fantastically large magnetic fields.

AEC Opinion: From the limited evidence submitted, it is impossible to reach a definite conclusion. However, two possible physiological factors are readily apparent; one, the observer stated he published photos or 
or poor sleep because he,
had read several days following his observation of another sighting. Therefore,
he very likely either consciously or inadvertently may have attempted to conform
his report to that recounted in the newspaper; and two, he colored his report
with inference of huge magnetic fields, as to the implications of which he was obviously uninformed.
