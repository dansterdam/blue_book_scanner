Moore thought so, until this morning. Then he saw something
he called a flying saucer, although he said it was shaped like a funnel.
The point of the funnel was in the lead.

    -------

Moore, a milker, said the object flashed directly overhead as he
was going about his chores on a nearby mountain ranch at 3:50 A.M. It
was about the size of a 500-pound bomb and passed over him flying from
East to West at tremendous speed. He estimated its height at 2500 feet
and said it remained within his vision for about 15 seconds.

    -------

Moore said it glowed with a quickly heightened brilliance and then
faded -- just like an electrolite light bulb when it burns out, only more
slowly.

    -------

Moore had no idea what the object was."
