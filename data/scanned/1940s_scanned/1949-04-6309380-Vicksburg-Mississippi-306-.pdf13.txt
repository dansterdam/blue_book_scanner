000.92 AFRIT                                              UNCLASSIFIED
Subject: Project "Grudge"            1st Ind (contd)

discussed with Dr. Peoples of this station the problems encountered in
obtaining reliable information when observing unidentified objects.
Mr. ******* sent to Dr. Peoples an information copy of his observations
near *******, New Mexico on April 24, 1949. It is felt that although the
theodolite and stop-watch were of great assistance in making estimates,
the principal factor responsible for the unusually specific information
contained in this report, is that Mr. ******* was made aware in advance of
what factors should be observed in case such an object were sighted.
Therefore, it is urged that your office issue detailed advance observa-
tion instructions to people who might be in a position to make observations
and in reports.

3. It is felt that insufficient observing instructions are implied
on the enclosed questionnaire. Item #12 is especially misleading, be-
cause an observer cannot possibly determine what town or building the
object may be over, unless the object descends to near or actual landing, 
so that it can be triangulated to be on either the near or far side of a
known object.
