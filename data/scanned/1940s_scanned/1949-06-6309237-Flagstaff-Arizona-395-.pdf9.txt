GUIDE TO INVESTIGATION
UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS UN*
                                                    
1. Date of Observation: 25 June 1949  Date of Interview: 9,10,11 July 1949

2. Exact time of observation (local):

3. Place of Observation:
   (Map Coordinates)

4. Position of observer (air, car, bldg, location of. Give details.).
   924 Wilmont Court, Ladison & Ensor Streets, S.E., Baltimore, Maryland.
   Observer standing in common area between courts.

5. What attracted attention to object?
   Porch watching the flight of National Guard and Commercial airplanes
   in the area.

6. Number of objects and sketch of formation or grouping: Fifteen (15)
   to twenty (20) objects flying in a circular group formation when
   first noted. Formation of objects changed rapidly to include echelon
   of objects, "V" formation and straight line.

7. Apparent size (compare to known object, i.e., sun, moon, thumb or
   fist at arms length). Each object appeared to be slightly larger
   than a doubled fist.

8. Color of object: Objects were black in color.

9. Shape (give graphic description - compare with known object). Ob-
   jects resembled an open angle, with a vertex of 70 degrees, and sides
   of angle had thickness. There was no evidence of engines, fuselage
   or tail assemblies. Witness described objects as a "boomerang that
   had been pulled out," "a flying wing without interior sections."

10. Altitude (angle of elevation above horizon - 0 at horizon, 90°
    overhead) Objects varied in angular height from the observers from
    20° to 50°. Objects flying at base of clouds confirmed by metro
    as 2500 ft.

11. Direction from observer (angle clockwise from North): Objects
    varied in bearing from 135° to 95° from observer.

12. Direction of flight of object(s): Objects appeared first bearing
    135° and disappeared at 95°.

13. Time in sight: Objects in sight approximately two (2) hours,
    1630 - 2030, local daylight time.

                                                 UNCLASSIFIED
