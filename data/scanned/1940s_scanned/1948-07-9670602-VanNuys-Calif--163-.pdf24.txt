Remarks

About 4:30 PM, I answered a call from the L. A. Times saying
that they had received a report of a bright spot over the vicinity
of Big Bear Lake. At the Observatory we supposed this was
merely another flying disk rumor and thought nothing of it. But
when this remarkable bright object was seen sailing overhead after
dinner we became greatly interested and excited. Someone got out
the three-inch telescope and after taking a look exclaimed, "It's a
balloon!"

We manually speculated about the object a good deal that
evening and surmised that it was probably a meteorological balloon
of some kind. About half a dozen individuals also called
inquiring if we had seen the bright disk. I heard Musrock tell
someone that it was a meteorological balloon, but I questioned him
since we didn't know anything of the kind. Then the L. A. Times
telephoned a second time I described the object essentially as I
have here, but emphasized that its nature was unknown to us. I
guessed its altitude was 2000 feet but later realized it must have
been much nearer.

After returning to the office in Pasadena I sent R. Musrock
a copy of Popular Science only for May or June, 1948, which had
a picture on the cover of a new type RF meteorological balloon. I
enclosed a note saying that it was likely that the thing we had seen
was quite similar.
