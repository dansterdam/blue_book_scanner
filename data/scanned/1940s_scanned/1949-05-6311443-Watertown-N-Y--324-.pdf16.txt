NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Mrs. _______________ of Watertown, New York was interviewed by the writer on 17 June 1919, concerning her alleged observation of an object seen in space at approximately 1615 to 1625 hours EST, 11 May 1919. Mrs. _______________ driving the vehicle traveling along a rural route near Watertown, New York, northeast of Watertown, New York she related. The geographic location of this point of observation is St. Lawrence River area, (265), Longitude 75 degrees, 45', Latitude 44 degrees. She stated that her attention was drawn to the object by her mother, a passenger in the vehicle she was driving, who first noticed this object high to the reflection of the sun upon it. Upon dismissing the first vehicle in which they were riding, this informant stated that she saw an object in aerial flight, that it soon slowed to approximately two foot in diameter, although the ex- act distance was undetermined. She continued that this object was disc-shaped, appeared to be smooth and shiny, similar in an automobile hub cap, that the object seemed to appear over a nearby hill and then moved slowly until it was over Black River, New York about five miles northeast of observation point. She added that the object appeared in the southeast, gained altitude for two to three minutes, moved slowly north maintaining a constant altitude, leaving a trail of light smoke the width of the aerial object, extending about two hundred and fifty feet to the rear. Then, she said, the object seemed to dissolve from the tail and work forward until it completely disappeared leaving a smoke trail, which also gradually thinned out and finally disappeared. She noted that there were no violent movements of the object and that the appearance and final disappearance described happened within a period of approximately fifteen minutes. Mrs. ______________ further related that the object did not seem to be illuminated by its own source of power but seemed to reflect the rays of the sun in a manner similar to a reflection on the surface of a downtown aerial aircraft, also that the object seemed to produce neither sound nor odor. She remarked that this day, 11 May 1919, was clear and the weather excellent with no clouds present to restrict their visibility. A check of the Police Department and the Sheriff's Office, Watertown, New York was made by the writer with negative results and due to the nature of the call community in which it lay all live, neighborhood investigations were not made on any of these informants. This writer asked Mrs. _______________ about her vision in order to determine its accuracy and she related that she is far-sighted but does not wear glasses, adding that her vision was not obstructed at the time of this observation.
