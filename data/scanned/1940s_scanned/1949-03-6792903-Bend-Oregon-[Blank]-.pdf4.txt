balloons approximately 2 feet in diameter when they leave the
earth. When these devices reach high enough altitude, the ex-
panding gases cause the balloons to burst and the devices
known as "kits" fold and drift earthward. It is possible that
one of these devices from one of these radar installations may
have been blown as far north as Gold Beach, Oregon on 24 May
1949.

AT IONE, CALIFORNIA

9. On 26 July 1949, **** obtained,
the following statement from **** Ione, Cali-
fornia.

"During the latter part of May 1949, at approxi-
mately 1630 in the afternoon, while fishing in a
boat on the **** River near Gold Beach, Oregon to-
gether with **** and my wife, my attention was attracted by a
silvery object in the sky, traveling at a height of
approximately 5000 feet in a southerly direction.
The object, circular in formation as a silver dollar
traveled without sound at a speed greater than that
of a high speed or jet plane. **** **** I used
a binocular to view the object which was visible to
the naked eye for approximately two minutes. No iten-
tification or commercial could not rule out any lrgi-
larity of formation, or whether the object had a
motor or motors, landing gear, or other items usually
connected with a plane. It had no appearance of the
conventional plane but in size woud be of the dia-
mate of the fuselage length of the DC-3 plane. I 
have licated in the general area a number of years and
have Djsarved various type olnnes flying in this area,
but have njever djobserved  anything of this nature before."
