Lociants alor -- Richland, Indiana -- 5 November 1948

This incident very likely has an astronomical explanation; 
the object sighted was probably Venus. Venus rose on November 5 at 
about 3:30 A. M. and an hour later would have been a little south of 
east at an altitude of about 10Â°. Its magnitude was -3.4, or about
six times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. The photo-
graph taken of the object sighted does not contradict this hypothesis.

It is unlikely that the object observed was the Giacobini
comet (1946L) discovered one day earlier in the southern hemisphere, 
for this comet at that time was very far to the south and east, almost 
on the horizon, and was very much fainter than Venus. If the object 
seen here had been this comet, the persons observing it would lay claim 
to the first discovery. It was discovered one day later in Australia
because of more favourable location.

Venus, of course was visible all during the autumn of 1948
in approximately the same position as that in which it was seen on the 
morning of November 5.

It is also of interest to note that Mercury had its greatest 
western elongation on November 5, but it rose just at the beginning of 
the morning twilight and would therefore have begun just rising at the 
time of this incident. Furthermore, Mercury was much less brilliant 
than Venus.
