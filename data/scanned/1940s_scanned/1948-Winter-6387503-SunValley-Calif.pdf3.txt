Re: "Project Saucer and Rockets"

Gentlemen;

The Daily News, a local paper and under the date-
line of "Washington, April 28 (AP) - states the following: 
Questionnaire Checks Flying Saucer Stories.

This is to state that I, on several occasions since 
last winter have seen what appears to have been an object or 
rocket hurtling through the sky during the late night and 
early hours of the mornings. The objects were apparently 
traveling at a high rate of speed, and were traveling across 
the sky in nearly a straight line of flight, and the objects 
or object was traveling from "N.E. to "S.W. and the object 
did not have the appearance of a meteor or a star as a meteor -
normally does such is distinguished a states a greenish glow 
rather this was a constant in flight with Blue-green and White 
pattern of exhaust and quite wide. Should you desire to know 
anything further or if I may be of help please advise.
