Incident No. 207 -- 16 Nov. 1948, 2200 hours, Andrews Air Force
Base, Maryland.
The pilot of a F-6 reported seeing an object over the base at 1700 feet.
Object was an oblong ball with one light, no wings, no exhaust, in land-
ing light of F-6. It had a dull gray glow and was thought to be smaller
than the F-6. Pilot made passes and object evaded by going above air-
craft. F-6 tried to close in very tight climbing turns, but object
turned inside the aircraft. Object was lost after ten minutes at 7500
feet. Its speed seemed to vary between 40 MPH and 600 MPH.

AIC Opinion: That the object described was a symptotic balloon.
Dr. FITE's report shows that it is very difficult for the observer to
separate target motion and his own motion even in daylight, and prac-
tically impossible to do so at night. This fact has been substantiated
by the writer, who in controlled experiments attacked ordinary balloons
with a T-6--in daylight, and with knowledge of what the object was and
what it did, all the above described maneuvers were duplicated in ap-
pearages.
