5. The consultants of the AMC Aero-Med laboratory state that reliable
estimates of distance can only be made when the object is identified as
some known object or type of object by the observer. It is interesting
to note that the observers at first thought the object was the balloon which 
they had released. When they [illegible blacked-out text] that it was not, there was no
way to judge distance except by assuming that it had [illegible blacked-out text]
a fantastic speed.

The questionable data in this incident, the extremely short time 
of observation [illegible blacked-out text] and the 
overwhelming evidence of misidentification in other cases, leads to the
conclusion that the object seen [illegible blacked-out text] was misidentified [illegible blacked-out text]
by the observers. There is nothing in the evidence to refute that the
object, small, 
[illegible blacked-out text] much closer range and traveling at reasonable speed. [illegible blacked-out text]

NOTE: Since the observers themselves could not observe any detail,
it is not possible to make any [illegible blacked-out text] positive identification for 
the object.
