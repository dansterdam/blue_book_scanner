However, it is considered entirely possible that the object observed was a small kite, kite balloon, paper carried aloft by the wind, a wandering weather balloon, or other such object. Recent newspaper reports concerning "flying saucers" could have pre-conditioned the imagination of the witnesses resulting in their over estimating the speed and nature of the object.
