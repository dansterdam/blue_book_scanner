Arnold had never been much of a reader and was not a science-fiction fan, but his interests were obviously widening. The next two issues of Fate carried other articles under his name. Palmer's growing influence is suggested by the titles: “Are Space Visitors Here?” [14] and “Phantom Lights of Nevada.” [15]
