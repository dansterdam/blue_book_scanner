Incident No. 77 - 3 July 1947, 1430 Hours, South Brooksville, 
Maine. 
This observer, an "astronomer", heard a loud roar and with difficulty 
observed at 50° elevation approximately ten very light olive drab objects 
traveling N.W. The group held together with no regular formation. He 
diameter of the sky, chances to remain to recover still 1/20° angular 
diamter in that at a distance of 10 miles the objects would have a 
speed of 1200 MPH; that their width must be 100 feet across and due to 
their color would be barely visible. He also estimated the of 600 
would have a width of fifty feet at five miles with a speed 3,000 MPH. 
He believed they were aircraft of some type, owing to the load roar. 
In his letter he asked, "have any meteorites been reported?"

AFC Opinion: It is believed that the observer should have been 
able to rule out the possibility of meteorites. Reducing the estimate 
of distance, and correspondingly reducing the required size to that of 
objects such as birds or insects, then the speeds become very modest. 
If the objects were actually five to ten miles distant, and responsible 
for the "unusually loud roar", it is expected that numerous other re- 
ports would have been received from this section of Maine, which is 
thickly populated.
