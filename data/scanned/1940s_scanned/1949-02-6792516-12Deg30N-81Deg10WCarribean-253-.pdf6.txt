changing colors of the object can probably be attributed to the reflection
of the setting sun.

6. On 7 February 1948 two Russian 300-ton sloops (Omar and Blask) 
arrived at Colon, Republic of Panama, from St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, en-
route to vladivostok via Honolulu, Hawaii. This aroused computation of
wind and course and point of sighting lend a possibility that the objects 
were in the flight path release from these two ships which followed a 
direct course from St. Thomas to Colon. Th;so two vessels were presentley 
awaiting repairs at Colon, and two others of the same type are presently 
in St. Thomas undergoing repairs. Any further developments will be prompt-
ly reported.
