Incident 205 -- Carta[illegible], obscured -- 31 October (?), 1943

The vague nature of the information reported in this inci-
dent and the informed unreliability of the observer makes it difficult
to take the incident seriously, especially since the observer has ob-
viously jumped to conclusions on the basis of insufficient evidence.

However, if credence is given to the observations, either
they must be placed with the group of "aluminum-colored objects," or,
if liberal allowance is made for subjective impressions, one could
stretch a point to say that a slow-moving fireball was seen. This hy-
pothesis is far fetched, but the speed of the object and the time of
day favor it. The fact that the observer stated that the object was
aluminum colored actually means little, since in Luminosity identified
it as a flying saucer, which is known from numerous prior reports to be such
a color.

It is very difficult to deal with reports of untrained and
unreliable observers, because they invariably see in an incident
what they wish to see there.

From a purely physical basis, this investigator would prefer
the meteor hypothesis, even though the evidence is entirely insuf-
ficient to establish it.
