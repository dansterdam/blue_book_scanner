The information in the form is incomplete with many fields left blank. The fields are placeholders for data such as the date of the document, the number of enclosures, the office symbol, and a signature for receipt confirmation. There is the number "5" under "ENCLOSURES:" which perhaps indicates the number of items enclosed with the transmittal.
