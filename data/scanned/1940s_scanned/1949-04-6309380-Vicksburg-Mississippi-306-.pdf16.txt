1. The incident where theodolite measurements were made of an unidentified 
aerial object and to which the article by Commander McLaughlin apparently refers, 
was reported by several persons engaged in the measurement of wind velocities
by balloon releases in White Sands New Mexico. 

2. The report of the incident gave the following information:

    "On 24 April 1949, 3 miles north of Arrey, New Mexico, five persons 
saw a rapidly moving object xxxxxxxxx. These persons had released a 
balloon and were following it with a theodolite. After taking a reading at 
1030 MST, one observer continued to follow the balloon while two others observed 
a whitish spherical object with the naked eye right along the direction that 
the theodolite was pointing. The object observed with the naked eye was 
drifting east rapidly (5Â°/sec. as estimated by stopwatch and width of fingers)
but the observers had expected to encounter similar winds on the balloon.
