                             Fort Worth 1, Texas

1948, January 7

Abilene, Texas

Dear ------------- 

          The brilliant blue-green glow which you report as seen
as west of you at 1:25 A. M. and again at 1:30 A.M., January 1st, could
hardly be any kind of astronomical phenomena that I know of.

          I am more inclined to think that it was either (1) some
sort of disturbance of an electrical system such as transformers blowing
out, or (2) experiments at the White Sands Proving Grounds which I believe
are easily in that direction from you.

          I am sending a copy of this letter to Dr. ------------
of the University of New Mexico at Albuquergue and if he is not under any
restriction as to military secrets, perhaps he can tell us whether possibility
number 2 applies. As to possibility number 1, ------------ of the
Abilene, connected with the West Texas Utility Company, ought to be able
to find out for us whether there was any kind of electrical trouble which I
doubt could have been more than 10 or 15 miles away.

          I note you say that the glow seemed to be fan shaped,
originating from a large ball on the horizon, extending to the meridian, due
west of you in a perfectly clear sky lasting about two seconds each and
extremely bright blue-green; also, that you heard no sound.

                                 Yours sincerely,
                                 ---------------
