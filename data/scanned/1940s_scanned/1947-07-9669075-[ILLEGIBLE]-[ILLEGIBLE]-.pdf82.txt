Please note that some text is illegible due to redactions and the poor quality of the scan. The entries in the table appear to describe UFO sightings, their locations, the observer's classification (such as Civilian, Military Air, ARMY Officer), and the evaluation of the sighting (e.g., Insufficient Data, Weather (cloud), Astro (Sun Dog), N/C for No Comment, UNIDENTIFIED, etc.).
