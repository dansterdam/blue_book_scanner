The image you've provided appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch depicts an elongated, somewhat cigar-shaped object with a grid pattern on its upper section, and some notes and annotations scattered around.

Unfortunately, due to the quality and clarity of the image, I cannot transcribe the text accurately. Most of the words are either too faint or partly obscured, which makes it difficult to read the content reliably. However, I can make out the wording "EXHIBIT 'C'" along with the words "Pearl L. Humes" towards the bottom of the page. The rest of the text is indiscernible in the provided image.
