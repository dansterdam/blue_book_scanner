[REDACTED] has a "peculiar" fellow and odd in many of his ways. Informants do
not believe that [REDACTED] would intentionally tell a falsehood, but because
of his age and eyesight, he might see things that do not exist, or his
judgement of things he does see may be faulty. [REDACTED] ordered by a
Water Committee to have a leak in his plumbing fixed. [REDACTED] and
raved and threatened to sue as he said he could not get a plumber to fix
the leak, and finally had the water at his place shut off. This matter
was checked into, informants stated, and it was found [REDACTED] had not
contacted a plumber to do the work for him. [REDACTED] and be-

are correct and are not to be questioned. [REDACTED] never practiced law
to informants' knowledge. [REDACTED] eyesight is bad and it is difficult 
for him to read. Informants stated that [REDACTED] said told a "wild" story
