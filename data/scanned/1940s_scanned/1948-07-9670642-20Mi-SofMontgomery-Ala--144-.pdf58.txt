Detailed interrogations have been completed of persons reporting unidentified flying objects in the vicinity of Montgomery, Alabama, 24 and 26 July 1948, between the hours of 2130 and 0245 hours.

Analysis has been made of the compiled statements and other available evidence of each individual interrogated. The analysis was undertaken as only one of 173 reported incidents with an objective toward arriving at a definite pattern or trend in order to determine whether the objects reported were of domestic or alien origin, or a natural phenomena.

COMMENT: Analysis of data under Incident #24 reveals that four separate cases are involved; one having occurred on 24 July 1948 and the others on the 26 July 1948. As a preponderance of evidence is available to sub-
stantiate that in almost all cases an unqualified object was seen within established times and dates over an extended area, pursuing a general Southerly course, Descriptions as to size, shape, color and movements are fairly consistent.
