[Redacted]

do hereby make the following true statement to
Captain [Redacted] of the United States Air Force.

At 5 minutes to 7 on the morning of February 11th, 1949, I was standing
on the corner by Simmon and Furlong's store in Curling East, Newfoundland,
waiting for the Bus to go to work when I saw a dull red or red orange ball
over the Blow-Me-Down Light, than it died out and then I saw it again. She
spread open in a long flame shaped something like a blow torch flame. When
I saw it it looked about the size of the Sun when it rises only not as bright,
it was red purple or bluish when it flamed out long with little bits of
flame on it like Fuel Oil when it burns. It was about 5 miles North West of
Blow-Me-Down Light when I saw it headed towards St. George's, then it seemed
to turn and head west over Lark Harbour and go down and disappear, it was
high over the Head, it looked like it was 6 inches above the land which
means it was quite high actually. I called Jim Byrnes attention to it and
said to him "Jim what do you think of that?" I told him that I thought it
was an Airplane crashing or a ship in distress and shooting off flares and
that I was going to report it to the Police when I got to work, I did
report it to the Police. When he got on the bus the driver said he saw the
ball of fire in the sky at 25 minutes to 7. I don't know who the driver was.
