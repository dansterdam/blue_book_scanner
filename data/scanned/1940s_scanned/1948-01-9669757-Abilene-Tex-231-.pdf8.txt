                               Fort Worth, Texas

1948, January 7

Mr. 
Abilene, Texas

Dear Mr.

     The brilliant blue-green glow which you report as seen 
the west of you at 1125 M, and again at 1:30 A, M, January 1st, could
hardly be any kind of astronomical phenomena that I know of.

     I am more inclined to think that it was either (1) some 
sort of disturbance of an electrical system such as transformers blowing
out; or, (2) experiments at the White Sands Proving Grounds which I believe
are usually in that direction from you.

     I am sending a copy of this letter to Dr. , 
of the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque and if he is not under any 
restriction as to military secrets, perhaps he can tell us whether possibility
number 2 applies. As to possibility number 1, someone right there in
Abilene, connected with the West Texas Utility Company, ought to be able to
find out for me whether there was any kind of electrical trouble which 
could have been no more than 10 or 15 miles away.

     I note you say that this glow seemed to be fan shaped, 
originating from a large bell on the horizon, ascending to the meridian, in a 
west of you in a perfectly clear sky lasting about two seconds each and 
extremely bright blue green; also, that you heard no sound.

                               Yours sincerely, 

[REDACTED]
