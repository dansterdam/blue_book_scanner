SUBJECT: Semi-Monthly Intelligence Report

TO:        Commanding Officer
               2105th Air Weather Group
               Westover Air Force Base
               Westover Field, Mass.

1.       In compliance with 55th Reconnaissance Group (weather) letter,
subject, "Semi-Monthly Intelligence Summary," File 55th TRG 350.05,
dated 29 July 1947, the following report is submitted for the period ending
31 January 1949.

2.       On 21 January 1949, crew of B-29 aircraft, number 45-21768, returning
from a special search mission for Doc’smander IV, Star Ariel, observed the
following described atmospheric phenomena:

        a. At 0100Z, 24 min. flying from position 29° 50' N - 67° 29' W, on a
               true course of 050°, altitude 10,000 ft., Captain ————-, Aircraft
               Commander, first saw a red glow off this left wing which at first resembled the
               moon rising and which soon later became blinding white.

        b. At 0025Z, pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the light,
               530° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so close to the red
               light object that a sharp bank was executed in order to avoid flying into the
               red light area.

        c. On approaching the redlight it was observed as a dark red glow,
1 to 1-1/2 miles wide, lying on the water, and resembling burning oil with a
phosphorescent red light, raised to 2,500 to 3,000 ft altitude. Also from heading
of 350° and 100° two columns of white light, 1/4 to 1/2 mile apart, resembling
search light beams and extending upward angle approximately 45°. Captain ————
estimates the beams were at a sight that turned towards the left of the focusing
light mass. If the white light beams had extended above the red light mass to
an altitude of 10,000 ft., they would have intersected. The white light appeared to
have had mass as it broke off enough light to illuminate the wings of the B-29 
and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (squall condition?) 55

        d.  Aircraft position borne true red light area, 5,000 ft, altitude,
               at 0029Z, 29 Jan 49, was 3O° 01' N - 67° 04' W.

        e. That is the only programme reported or noticeable as light was
               due to the red glare.

        f.       Clouds were present, way to four tentacles of red faint balls at
               3,500 ft and tops to 5,000 ft.
                                                                      UNCLASSIFIED
                                                                                                 2-37514-48
                                                                                                 9-9397-8
