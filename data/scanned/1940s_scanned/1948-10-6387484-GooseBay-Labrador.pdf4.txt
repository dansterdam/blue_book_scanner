1. In compliance with basic letter, this attached re-
ports are submitted.

2. Message 291600Z continuued three (3) sightings, which
were intended separately and are listed as inclosures "1,"
"2" and "3". Message 031502 contains no instructions on where
to route UFO sightings if called at this station, or the
message 010425Z. It is believed that this number is in
error. Message 031501Z, which was initiated by the
1932nd AACS Sq., and addressed to the headquarters, was
probably dislayed in Message Control and this date to map group
changed to 022005Z. This message referred to a sighting
at 2145Z on 1 November 1948.

3. Our message 021515Z, referred to above, could not
be placed on a message, due to the scope of the message tape
being clogged.

a. By plotting a point three and three quarters
(3 3/4) miles from the station on a bearing of one hundred
and twenty-three degrees (123°) and following a flight path
on a heading of two hundred and forty-nine degrees (249°)
for a distance of severn and one half (7 1/2) miles when the
message states the object disappeared, would not put the
object's disappearing point one hundred and eighty-two de-
grees (182°) from the station.

b. This same message stated that the object tra-
veled the distance of four (4) miles in four (4) minutes
and seven (7) seconds timed by a stop watch. If this were
true, the object could not have disappeared from view and
one half (1 1/2) miles scope on which it was sighted, neither
could it, large, disappeared at on, hundred and eighty-two
(182°) degrees from this station, assuming there it did travel
on a heading of two hundred and forty-nine degrees (249°) as
