SYNOPSIS

An investigation conducted to develop additional information regarding the observation of an unknown flying object on 10 September 1949 near Boston, New York, indicates that three witnesses sighted this flying object from ten to fifteen seconds. Excellent weather conditions enabled witnesses to follow object's westerly course, without interruption or obstruction. With the exception of the object's position in flight, the information of observers agreed. Attention is invited to the qualifications of witnesses. One witness is employed an operator of farm and are also employed by industrial firms situated in Buffalo, New York. Employment investigation reflects that witnesses are considered reliable, loyal, and trustworthy. However, both male witnesses have completed only the equivalent of seven (7) school grades. In conclusion, further investigation failed to reveal other observers, radar tracing, or experimental operations being conducted in this area during the incident period.
