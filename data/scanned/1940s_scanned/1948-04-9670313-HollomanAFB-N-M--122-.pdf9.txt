1. Reference is made to Par 2, basic communication. Apparently a 
misunderstanding exists in that I did not personally see unidentified ob-
jects moving at an excessive rate of speed on a radar scope. Rather, 
Mr. P__________, of Watson Laboratories, very probably saw unidentified 
objects. However, Mr. _________ informed me that the objects seen were
not moving in an excessive speed, but were rather motionless at an altitude
somewhat in the vicinity of 220 miles. When these were seen on the Radar
scope of the CPS-4 (Model?0) the angle of view/elevation of the Radar antennae
was approximately 70 degrees from horizontal.

2. During the latter part of August, 1947, this organization was carry-
ing on several tests runs with a modified SCR-270 at this base. I had re-
leased a cosmic ray reflector and two balloons and was watching them in their
flight as they drifted to the southeast from this base. While watching the
balloons through a pair of ten power binoculars, a white object, appearing
to be round, came into my field of vision. I followed the object as far as
possible but lost it within seconds after picking it up. The object was
traveling at an unprecedentated rate of sped and appeared to be several
thousand feet over the top of the Sacramento mountain range, travelling in 
horizontal flight south to north.

3. There may been other times when manning the M-33 Optical tracker,
that I have seen round or flat-round objects that were unexplainable.

4. In view of Par 1, this endorsement, it is suggested that Mr. P________
_______ of the Radar Laboratory, AMC Watson Laboratories, Red Bank, New
Jersey be contacted.
