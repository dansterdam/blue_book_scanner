SYNOPSIS On the morning of 7 July 1949, at approximately 0915 hours, the 
Writer observed at the foot of Prytanna Street near the Mississippi
River, an object in the sky which was approximately one and one-half 
(1Â½) miles east at approximately twenty-five hundred (2500) feet alti-
tude. The object appeared to be round or oval shape and was moving
in a northerly direction and had a very bright appearance. When the 
Writer first sighted this object, it was believed to be the reflection 
of the sun rays on an airplane which was in a very steep bank. The
object remained in view for about thirty (30) or forty (40) seconds
at which time it disappeared from sight over some trees. The fact 
that the shape of this object remained unchanged for such a long period 
of time caused the Writer to believe that the reflection was not 
caused by conventional type aircraft.
