DETAILS (cont'd)

10. On 23 July 1949, S/A THOMAS E. KELLEY obtained the following statement from [redacted] at Ione, California:

"While on vacation near Gold Beach, Oregon during the latter part of May 1949 and while fishing from a boat in the Rogue River in the late afternoon, my husband [sic] attention was called to the attention of the group to a silver object, circular in shape, crossing the sky at a high altitude and a high rate of speed. I could not estimate its height and its size was as large as a large passenger plane shaped like a shiny circular disk. No sound was heard as it crossed our range of vision in two or three minutes. The day had been clear, visibility was good and the sun was just setting. Other occupants of this party who observed this object were, [redacted] and husband. There was no sound and the object traveled on a direct course."
