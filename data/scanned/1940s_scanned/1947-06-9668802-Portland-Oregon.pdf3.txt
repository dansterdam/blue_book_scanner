Incident #68 – Portland, Oregon, – 24 June 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident, 
which should be considered together with the Maury Island case
( #47 ), which occurred on the same day, and in which similar discoid
objects were observed. (The present objects appeared to vive [view] 
however; another major difference between this and the Arnold inci-
dent is the inferred size of the objects, as determined from the
estimated distance.) 

It is difficult to take seriously the peculiar action of 
the compass, for this would imply fantastically large magnetic 
fields.
