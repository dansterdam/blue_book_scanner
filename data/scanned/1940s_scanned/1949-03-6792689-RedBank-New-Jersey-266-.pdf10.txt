TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On Friday, 4 March 1949, at about 2:30 p.m., I and three other employees of Watson Laboratories were looking skyward at an approaching B-29, when my attention was attracted to a snow white disc-like object which appeared at that moment to be under the port wing of the B-29. I called it to the attention of the other fellows with me and they also saw it.

The object was moving rapidly to the left of the plane and, veering to the right, it disappeared into space. I had the impression that it was moving under its own power. The total time of observation was approximately one minute. We all agreed that it was different from anything we had ever seen in the sky before.
