Synopsis

Investigation initiated by District Commander, 13th OSI
District. On 15 September 1949, Mr. ***** and
two witnesses saw an unidentified object moving over
Scottsbluff Monument, approximately six miles away. Object
appeared to be spinning and wavering slightly from
side to side, emitting a bright light, which was apparently
the sun shining off the sides of the object. The object
appeared to have about the same average dimensions
as an automobile tire and wheel, was at an altitude of approximately 2500 feet, was in sight about two minutes, and
finally disappeared from view over the Monument. The
weather was clear with a visibility of 50 miles.
