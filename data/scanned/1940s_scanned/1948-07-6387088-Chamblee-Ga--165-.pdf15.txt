The image provided shows a highly degraded and faded document page with three pieces of paper, none of which seem to contain photographs. Instead, they look like typed pages or reports. Unfortunately, due to the poor quality and significant wear of the image, the text is nearly illegible and doesn't allow for a reliable OCR (Optical Character Recognition) reproduction.

The top of the document has some readable text that contains the word "RECORD," which indicates this may be some form of official recording or file. There is also a signature at the bottom right, but making out the name is difficult due to image quality.

For an accurate transcription, a clearer image or the original document would be required.
