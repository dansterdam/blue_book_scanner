STATEMENT BY:
On 21 Feb 49, ------, 2583rd Base Service Sqdn., Orlando AFB, Orlando, Fla., was interviewed. Diaz stated that he was at his post, Gate No. 1, Orlando AFBI which is located approximately 200 yards South of the intersection of Colonial Drive and Forest Street, Orlando, Florida, when he saw a light in the sky at approximately 0152 hours on 31 Jan 49. Diaz described it as round, approximately the size of a large round dishpan and bluish-green in color. This object was first sighted by ---- at a position of less than 45Â° above the horizon over a point approximately 1/2 mile, at 3000' from his post. The object was in sight approximately 1 1/2 minutes. It was traveling in a southerly direction at approximately the same speed of a light aircraft approaching to land at Orlando airport. There was no sound, odor, trail or proj_____ in or around this object. ---- stated that it looked like "a ball of cotton saturated with luminous paint," with fuzzy edges and appeared to be very similar to the flame of an acetylene torch when first lighted. The object maintained a level flight all the time it was in sight with the exception of one sharp steep drop. After which it resumed its original altitude, finally disappeared from sight in mid-air "like a light switched off." There was no moon, the stars were out and the weather was clear with good visibility. ---- did not wear glasses, is not color blind and did not view the object through any material.
