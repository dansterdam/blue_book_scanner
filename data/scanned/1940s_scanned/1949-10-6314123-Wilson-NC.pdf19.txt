The image appears to be a photocopy of a very faint photograph or a poorly captured image with a high level of contrast and low detail, making it difficult to distinguish any specific features. What can be observed is a light, diagonal streak across the middle that could potentially be an artifact or the subject that the photograph is intended to show. There are also two rivet-like spots towards the top of the framed area, which suggests the original photograph might have been pinned or mounted at one time.

As for acting as an OCR to produce and output all the text found in the document, there is no discernible text present in this image.
