Incident 94 -- 420-03' N, 1140 22.2' W -- 30 December 1947

This incident and incidents 95, 96, and 97, which describe the same object, clearly refer to a thoroughly authenticated "Fireball". These sightings can be dismissed with finality by the following quotation from Popular Astronomy, October, 1943.

Fireball of 1547 -- Dec. 30
Harvey S. Hagar

On this date at 1730 f. m. MST a brilliant fireball appeared travelling westward over southern Oregon...
Prof. L. H. Higgs, Austin, previous reports from observers in Oregon, California, and Nevada, and from these made an appropriate solution for its path. He sent both his solution and all the 47 reports to the Flower Observatory where another solution was independently made. Ours agreed closely in all respects with that of Prest except for the heights.

The meteor was most generally reported to be bluish-green in color. It appeared to explode twice, lighting up the countryside to close observers. No sound phenomena were limited to 6 out of the 47 observers.

From the height at which this meteor exploded it is doubtful whether any fragments reached the ground.

It is clear from the general agreement with this of evidence given in incidents 94-97 inclusive that this fireball was the object being described.
