approximately twenty-six (26) inches in diameter when new. At release
two hundred (200) to two hundred eighty (280) yards per minute, and the

is white in color. CAPT TALBOT stated that, according to the Sandberg winds
Aloft Report at this time, the balloon would have drifted northwest, towards
Lebec, during the first two thousand (2,000) foot ascension, and then veered
Northeast towards Mojave, California.
