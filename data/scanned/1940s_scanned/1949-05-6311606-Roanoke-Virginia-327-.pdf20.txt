loyal American who wants to help the Government clear up the mystery
of these flying discs, and believes that the objects which people are
reporting seeing are nothing more than reflections. Mr.____stated

one is not sure. To illustrate his point, he told a_____story of an in-
cident which occurred when he was a young boy.______stated that
