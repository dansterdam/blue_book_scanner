Mr. Ben Hibbs, editor
The Saturday Evening Post
Independence Square
Philadelphia 5, Pennsylvania

Dear Sir:

I am sending you a copy of my letter to the Commanding Officer, Technical Intelligence Division, Air Materiel Command Headquarters, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base of Dayton, Ohio. Those are facts. Maybe we've stumbled on to something, however, for safety sake, I suggest you contact the above before using any of this material. Publicity would be bad if these discs are a secret.

I made these photos to let you see this type of people who saw the discs. I asked my folks if they remembered what two discs looked like well enough to draw them or make a clay model. They said "Yes".

I am a Post addict and read your articles on the discs. If you want more information, I will be glad to supply same.

Incidentally, the radio station is back operating, OK. When I suggested that the discs might have caused their difficulty, the Station Manager wanted to know if I might be suffering from a "Saturday hang-over". However, he couldn't tell me what knocked the station out.

Cordially yours,

Executive Secretary
