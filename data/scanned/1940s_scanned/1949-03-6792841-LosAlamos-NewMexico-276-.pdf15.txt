The image displays a hand-drawn sketch on a sheet of paper with several annotations. The sketch appears to depict a UFO sighting from the perspective of an observer looking through a window. It is not a photograph but an illustrative representation of an event.

The annotations on the sketch are as follows:

- At the top left, there is a letter "(A)" with cardinal directions marked around the edges of the page ("S" at the bottom for south, "E" at the bottom-right for east, "W" at the top for west).
- Along the west edge, the text says "TREES AND CANYON WALL".
- On the right side in the northern direction, it states "OPENING IN CLOUD OVERCAST" indicating a break in clouds.
- There is an arrow in the middle labeled "LINE OF FLIGHT" which points towards a saucer-shaped object that is the focus of this sketch.
- The saucer-shaped object has an arrow pointing at it with the label "OBJECT".
- Below the object, near the eastern direction, it states "TREES AND CANYON WALL".
- Just below that, it reads "OUTLINE OF WINDOW IN THE SHACK".
- At the bottom of the image, the text reads "SKETCH - by Inspector Patterson."

Please note that the text is handwritten and might not all be transcribed perfectly due to the handwriting style and the quality of the scan.
