The photograph on the document appears to show an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the form of a small, elliptical or saucer-shaped object against a sky. The image is grainy, monochrome, and details are not clear due to the quality and age of the photograph.

The text on the page reads:

Incident #24 -- pag.2

The shooting up and down might be dismissed as subjective 
and illusory, although small bits shooting off from the main saucer 
could also give this effect.

In spite of all this, this investigator would prefer a
terrestrial explanation for the incident.
