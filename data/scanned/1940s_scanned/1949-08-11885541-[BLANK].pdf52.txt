Incident #130 -- Florence, Montana -- 17 May 1948

If this report is to be taken at face value, then no astronomical explanation of this incident is possible.

However, in seeking even a remote logical explanation for the incident, the present investigator is impressed with the fact that on this very night, May 17, Venus was at its greatest brilliancy, with a magnitude of -4.2, â‰ˆ about 100 times brighter than a first magnitude star. It would have appeared that night as an intensely bright light in the northwest.
