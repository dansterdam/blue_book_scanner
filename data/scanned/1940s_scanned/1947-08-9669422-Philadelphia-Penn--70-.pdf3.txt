The image contains a single photograph at the bottom. The photo is very blurry and of low quality, making it difficult to discern any specific details. It appears to depict a streak or trail of some sort, possibly related to the reported UFO sighting described in the text. The streak is horizontal and extends across the width of the image. There are some irregular patterns or disruptions in the streak, but due to the low resolution and quality of the photograph, it's not clear what they represent.

Here is the text from the document as requested:

M. the night of Aug 6, 1947 and that his neighbors, the family, were also sitting on their steps. All parties were facing east. noticed an object which emitted a bluish-white flame pass quickly thru the air. It was traveling E to W. Using his experience in the Army Air Corps he estimated the speed to be between 300 to 500 MPH. The object did not lose elevation and left either a smoke or condensation trail in its former path. The vapor lasted for about 2 seconds. A hissing sound accompanied the passing. The sound was moderate and not nearly as loud as that occasioned by a rocket ship.
