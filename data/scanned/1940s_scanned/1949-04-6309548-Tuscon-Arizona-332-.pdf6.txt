STATEMENT

At about 5:30 P. M. on the night of 28 April 1949, I noted an object in the sky northwest of where I reside which traveled in a southeast-ward direction and gradually turned to the southwest and disappeared from sight. I would judge this object to be at an angle of 60 degrees and from 4 to 5 miles high.

This object seemed oval in shape and when it caught the sun's rays it was a brilliant silvery color. When I first observed this object it seemed to turn over and disappeared for awhile. I noticed it again a few minutes later again much farther south of my first observation.

I noted no exhaust or vapor trails. It made no noise. I could see no lights, wings or tail surfaces, I have noticed Bâ€”29's passing overhead but this seemed to travel much faster.

Looking at this object as I did for at least a half hour it seemed to be 5 or 6 feet long and I would say it would be 20 to 25 feet long if it was on the ground.

When I observed this object I was in company with a man named [REDACTED] another named [REDACTED], who I believe works in a florist shop somewhere on the east side.
