Incident 12, 13: - Between 15 and 20 August 1947, 2100 hours,
Weaver, South Dakota.

An Air Force officer saw twelve "flying discs" four miles away over the
Rapid City Air Force base in a tight diamond formation at 4000 to
10,000 ft ascending to 25,000 in about two minutes. Objects were to fol-
low in turn and climbed at 500 to 1000 accelerating. Objects were very
maneuverable, remaining equally spaced in all maneuvers. Each object
was 100 feet in length, oval-shaped and brilliant yellowish-white. No
sound nor exhaust trail were heard or seen.

ATC Opinion: This reporter should be a reliable observer. How-
ever, it has been shown that distance cannot be estimated without prior
knowledge of the size of an object. If distance is not known, speed
cannot be estimated. More notable perhaps is that such minute detail
could be remembered in a report made one year after the observation 
and yet the date was not remembered. Dr. Hynek suggested the possibil-
ity of detached auroral streamers.
