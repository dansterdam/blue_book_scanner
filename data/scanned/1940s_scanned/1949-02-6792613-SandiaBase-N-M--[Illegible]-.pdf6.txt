NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

M/Sgt John P. MITCHELL sighted a globular shaped object with a trailing
tail about 1/3 the size of a half-moon in the sky. The color was orange
red as fire and the trailing tail was blue like a gas flame. Speed was
like a F-80 jet plane and the heading was NW to SE. There was no deviation
from a descending course of 35° to 5°. There was no identifiable sound.
Considerable motor noise at Kirtland AF Base drowned out other possible sound.
It first appeared on a vertical azimuth 35° CL 00' and horizontal azimuth
of 222° 30' 00' according to transit. measurements taken at 0730. It
disappeared on a vertical azimuth of 05° 00' 03' and a horizontal azimuth of
166° 29' 00". Time in passage ws 5 to 7 seconds. The exhaust trail was
blue flame 4 to 5 times the length of the object. M/Sgt MITCHELL stated
that the object looked like a plane hit by AA fire, gliding out of control
on a long angle to earth. He further stated that it was in range of a
multiple .50 cal. AA weapon."
