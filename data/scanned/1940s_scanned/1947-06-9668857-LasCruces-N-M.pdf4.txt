SUBJECT: Analysis of Project "Twilight" Reported Incidents

Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: TICAO

1. Reference is made to the letters from your Headquarters to this station of 22 November 1946, 6 December 1946, and 14 January 1949, Subject "Project SIGN" *, requesting that reported incidents I through 172 be analyzed to determine whether or not these might have been caused by balloons launched by these laboratories.

2. A listing has been compiled of all balloons launched by these laboratories and first contractors for special stratospheric research purposes, from the first such launching to no. 101 on 17 November 1948. Each of these launchings has been compared with the reported incidents I through 172. Factors of comparison were dates of launching and dates and places of recovery with respect to time and place of occurrence of reported possible observations from the listed incidents. A descending velocity factor was taken for each type of balloon with respect to the place of reported incidents. So that your office may make an independent analysis, three copies of the launching list are included.

a. Incidents No. 5 through No. 16 reported on 4 July 1947 throughout Oregon, Idaho and Washington gave, in general, descriptions of clusters or groups of objects. The 3 July 1947 balloon Launchings No. 6 at Alamogordo was a cluster of balloons and was not recovered, and so might be suspected of being the cause of these reports. However, although not recovered, this flight was confirmed in the Fort Sumner Valencia Valley only a few miles northwest of Alamogordo. That the balloons were down was determined both by airplane spotting and by radio direction finding upon the balloon telemetering instruments. Recovery of the balloons and instruments was prevented by the inaccessibility of this terrain.

b. Balloon releases No. 11 of 7 July 1947 could compare with respect to date with incident No. 1 through No. 4, and again with incident No. 10. This balloon flight was again a cluster.
