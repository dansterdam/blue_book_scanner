1. In compliance with Joint Reconnaissance Group (Weather) letter,
subject: "Semi-Monthly Intelligence Summary," File 50VA 550.05,
dated 7 July 1947, the following report is submitted for the period ending
31 January 1949.

2. On 21 January 1949 crew of B-29 aircraft, number 44-87750, returning
from a special search mission for SAAC under 1st, Star Aerial, observed the
following described atmospheric phenomena:

a. At 2150Z, 24 Jan 49, from position in 29° 50' N - 67° 29' W, on a
course of 050°, Altitude 10,500' A. Captain, aircraft commander, Aircraft
Commander, First saw a red glow off the left wing which at first resembled the
moon rising and which the crew later believed to be a burning ship.

b. At 0252Z the pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the light,
350° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so close to the re
light on the that a sharp bank was executed in order to avoid flying into the
red light mass.

c. On approaching the redlight it was observed as a dark red glow,
1 to 1-1/2 miles wide, based on the water, and resembling burning oil with a
phosphorescent red light rising to 2,500 to 3,000 ft altitude. Also from bearing
of 350° and 150° two columns of white light, 1/4 to 1/2 mile apart, resembling
search light beams and extending upward through approximately 3/4 of the red
light mass. The beams were at a slight angle toward each other. Captain made
estimates that if the white light beams had extended above the red light mass to
an altitude of 10,000 ft. they would have intersected. It was also observed that
the red light mass gave off enough light to illuminate the surface of the water
and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (see inclosure #5)

d. Aircraft position abeam the red light, 3858, 6,000 ft. altitude,
at 0020Z, 25 Jan 49, was 31° 21' N - 57° 08' W

e. Wind at 5,000 ft was from 025° with velocity at 45 m.p.h.

f. Clouds 70%, How to 3/4 CuNim containing coverage, with bases at
6,300 ft. Tops, 12,300 ft.
