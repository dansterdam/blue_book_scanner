The image provided appears to be a scan of an old, poorly preserved document. It is extremely faded and difficult to read, with no discernible photograph visible. Given the quality of the scan, extracting text is highly challenging, but below is the text that can be faintly made out:

"UNCLASSIFIED
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
T.I. 1/2 MF 1/2"

The rest of the text is not clear enough for accurate transcription. If there is more information you require that may be in a clearer portion of the document, please provide additional images or more context for further assistance.
