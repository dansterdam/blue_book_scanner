Please note that due to the quality of the image and character distortion from the copying process, some interpretations of characters, such as "19:9" for the year, may be incorrect. They likely were intended to represent 1949, which is consistent with the document's historical context. Also, the text at the top of the page is partially obscured and unclear.
