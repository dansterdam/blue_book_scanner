File #24-9

DETAILS:
  
   1. Investigation initiated by Acting District Commander after
reviewing a newspaper article in the 26 March 1949 edition of the
Oregonian (a Portland, Oregon, daily newspaper). Article republished
from the 25 March 1949 edition of the Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, set
forth information pertaining to two "flying saucers" sighted over Bend
on 24 March 1949. (See Exhibit #1)

   2. Bend, Oregon

   A. Mr. ______ _________ and Mr. ______ _________ both employed as
barbers in _______________, Bend, Oregon, were
interviewed at their place of employment and stated in substance as
follows: The objects were first sighted at 1105 hours on 24 March 1949
through the barbershop window. At the time of sighting, ______ ______
remarked to _______ "Let's step outside and see how many people we can
get to look up." The weather was clear with good visibility. The obj-
ects were two in number, of no specific shape, but were more square than
round. The first object (hereinafter referred to as Object #1) appeared
to be similar to bright metal on one side and of a slightly duller color
on the other. The second object (hereinafter referred to as Object #2)
appeared to be of a light tan color on both sides. Neither object showed
any sign of speed, and they seemed to be drifting in a Southwesterly direc-
tion with Object #1 showing a greater drift toward the West. The objects
were considerably smaller than a dime held at arm's length, and both were
believed them to be the size of a large commercial cigarette carton in the
air. Object #1 appeared to be flying over #2, one over the other, but
Object #2 seemed to float lazily in space. There was no sound or visible
trail associated with either object, and they were guessed to be about
10,000 feet above the terrain. Both objects were sighted at approximately
the same time at a position 30° above the horizon at what would be a pos-
ition of one o'clock clockwise from the observer's overhead position.
The objects drifted to a 90° position above the horizon, or a straight
overhead position, and continued past the vertical, receding toward the
southern horizon.
   Mr. ________ and Mr. ______ lost interest at this point and did
not see the objects disappear. It had taken over thirty minutes for the
objects to traverse 90° of arc in regards to the horizon. Mr. _______
stated that he had done no flýing until after the war, ______ further stated
that the local paper expanded to some extent on the objects sighted.
   Mr. _______ does not believe that the objects were any of the
the so-called "flying saucers", but believed them to be a phase of pool-
ting' or some such articles released aloft by the wind. Both stated that
it is not uncommon at this season of the year for "float days" to develop
in the open country surrounding the town and raise pieces of debris to
