At about 0230 on July 24, 1948, *****, pilot, and Captain ****
***** saw what they thought was an unusual meteor. It was brighter than any
ever seen before and traveling in a horizontal direction, slightly
above the horizon. It was observed for 3 seconds before it died out. At
no time did it appear to travel in a downward direction. *****
discussed the matter that the meteor appeared to be traveling horizontally.

At the time they were traveling between Blackstone, Va., and Greensboro, S.C.,
the sky was clear and the visibility unlimited. They were of magnetic
heading of 240° and estimated the object to be on a bearing of about 210°
from them - that is - about 30° to the left of their heading. It appeared to
be traveling in a southerly direction, above, but close to the horizon.

NOTE: There is a 15 minute variance in time if/this sighting (0230) to the
rocket sighting at 0245 in ***** Montgomery some 1400 to 1475 miles
distant. The time (0230) also tallies within l min. with **** Pilot ****
****** account of sighting a jet or rocket trill just after
leaving Blackstone.
