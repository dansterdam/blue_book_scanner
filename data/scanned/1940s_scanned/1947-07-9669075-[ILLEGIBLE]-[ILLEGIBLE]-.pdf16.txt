The image appears to be a photocopy of a document, and there are no photographs present within the image. The text is exceedingly faint and not fully legible, but I will transcribe as much as I can decipher:

"...off to Redmond Hill... object to ground which was too high...
...that Captain... could hear... object, which was still in sight...
...darker... direct his vehicle... square-shaped object...
...the object was... phone... insisted on classifying it...
...flying saucer... distance was... of about 1000 ft...
...objectionable... between 500 to 1000 ft altitude of about 1500 to...
...could hear a... sound and is positive that it was not...

"In view of good visibility and the competence of the observer this..."

Evaluation: Confirmed by radar contact.

UNCLASSIFIED

Given the quality of the scan, the above transcription is incomplete and gaps have been indicated by ellipsis (...) where the text is illegible. The context suggests it is a part of a report discussing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting, including a mention of "flying saucer," and that radar contact appears to have been used for confirmation. The word "UNCLASSIFIED" is clearly visible at the bottom of the page.
