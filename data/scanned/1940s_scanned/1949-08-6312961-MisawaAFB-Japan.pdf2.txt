AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Object

Northern Japan               Headquarters Fifth Air Force,
                             APO 925
September 1949               23 August 1947

Captain Richard J. Hefford    Four (4) 10/P 175-r-hq
                                               

Air Memorandum Number 6, dated 15 February 1949 

An object which appeared to resemble a row of three dots observed by four (4) F-80 pilots from the 339th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. The object located along the road at Kisawa Air Force 39-57, 17.57 following ROE. The object, all one color, resembled a tower-like, however, no tower has ever been sighted on 23 August 1947 at 1430 K.

There were three (3) F-80 flying 10-10 circuits at the time of sighting. Personnel flying these aircraft all said as a personal opinion that they saw no unusual objects.

Anti-aircraft units were contacted at intelligence that none were firing which left us more in the dark, actually.

Radar site in the area was inoperative due to routine shutdown.

Observers report that the object could only have been an airway kite due to the speed; it flies that it definitely was not an aircraft due to its shape.

There were no roads in the area which would allow the object to have been towed from the ground.

U.S. Navy reports that they had no activity in the area at time of sighting.
