SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO : Commanding General
       Air Mat√©riel Command
       Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
       Dayton, Ohio
       ATTN: AMCIAO-X3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAAS,
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and First
Indorsement thereto by this Headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The Incidents-numerics 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Disposition
of Flight of Objects," should be classified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, but so that motion is
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Settings" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.
