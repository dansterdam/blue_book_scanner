Captain DALE C. TASKER, the other pilot, did not observe the
object because at the time, he was engaged in adjusting the radio
controls and his gaze was directed to the lower rear section of the
pilot's compartment. The flight engineer, T/Sgt SMITH, was in the
rear of the aircraft at the time, and did not observe the object.
