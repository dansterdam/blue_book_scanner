Incident No. 10 â€” 4 July 1947, 2004 hours, Boise, Idaho. An airline
pilot and crew watched from the air two groups, (5 and 4 in number) of objects
described as thin and smooth on the bottom and rough on top, silhouetted
against sunset and flying "Loose formation." They followed them for forty-five
minutes; therefore, had them in sight for approximately ten minutes. No further
information was submitted. 

ATIC Opinion: Since the sighting occurred at sunset, when light con-
ditions change rapidly and illusory effects are most likely, the objects
could have been ordinary aircraft, balloons, birds, or pure illusion. In-
sufficient information.
