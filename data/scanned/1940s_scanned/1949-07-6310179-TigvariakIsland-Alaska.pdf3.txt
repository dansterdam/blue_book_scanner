a. The object was circular in shape, and the upper 
entire structure had a silver color, with the under part of the 
craft, emitting a sort of blue glow. Neither wings, propellers, 
nor any moving parts could be observed. The object was smooth 
without any visible openings or protrusions, and there was no 
exhaust or vapour trail. There was no sound similar to an engine 
curb and when the object speeded up the "blue glow" under 
the circular craft, which was about 45 to 50 feet in diameter, 
got very bright; other than this there was no other visible 
changes. At one time it was difficult to discern the craft against 
a cloud background in the clear, but it was brought back to 
sight back to view each time. It rotated at what looked like 
at a fast, periodic rate, and would be completely out of 
sight into the south-southeast; a minute or two later it would 
emerge out of sight in the clouds.

b. The balloon used in weather observation may parallel the 
visibility on surface - 20 miles; and in no way could it be seeing 
at 15,000 to 20,000 feet at this distance, even when it was 
leaves in clouds, light contrast exists.

c. The interpretation of the observer is expected that the object was possibly, 
following the dispersing pattern of the emitting.

2. Weather: Various cover at FL 170 
Sky, OK, weather conditions at Point Barrow 
was estimated to be from an altitude of between 5,000 to 20,000 feet, but 
visibility was 20 to 25 miles - 375°-5°; not regular pattern 
of flying formed by the object that was observed from the 
ground with and without the aid of a binocular. No pictures taken 
viewed the object through the binoculars, the object still far in view at 
272325. The weather at this time was partly overcast, visibility 25 
miles visibility with breaks in the overcast. 

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

This officer was unable to contact Mr 
for further information, as to whether irresponsibility 
of Nanivak island, but Lt. Jones who submitted the 
report found him. Must be an honest, dependable 
employee. This is his second year in the arctic. 
after a review of all available information it is 
the opinion of this office that the object sighted 
at Point Barrow was the planet "Venus".
