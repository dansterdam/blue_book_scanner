The image appears to be a photographed document page, but the quality is poor and the text is very faint, making it challenging to discern the details. There is no photograph within the image; it is entirely text-based. From what can be identified, the text appears to relate to a UFO report, including data such as incident number, date, location, source, type of observer, and other descriptive information about the sighting. It concludes with remarks.

Here is a best-effort transcription of the faint text visible:
