The photograph present at the top of the document appears to be an elongated, blurry object in the sky with a trail behind it, which might resemble a classic "cigar-shaped" UFO or some sort of flying object at a distance.

Incident #165 -- Los Angeles, California -- 30 August 1948

The observer of this incident states that the object looked
like a rocket and was larger than a B-29. He does not give the dis-
tance, but states the altitude was well over 10,000 ft. At the
highest distance, it appears to the analyst that reasoning to
a rocket must have been largely subjective.

Although a rocket cannot be ruled out, it is also possible
that the object seen was a bright meteor. If the time of observation
given is correct, it was late twilight. It seems that a bright meteor
appearing at this time would give the general impression of a rocket-
powered trail.

The report states that the object was observed through a field
glass taken from a German 88 mm. artillery piece and that the lens
was 8" in diameter. This is an improbably large size for a field glass.
If the object continually filled the lens at that given altitude, either
it was of a truly tremendous size or the glass was out of focus. Fur-
thermore, the terrain and survey states that the object was travelling
from west to east (another report says from north to south). If it
had been a rocket heading east, the launching would probably have been
reported.

All in all, the evidence supports the conclusion that the 
object was more likely a bright meteor than a man-made rocket.
