Northern Lights Seen Here For Second Time

Northern Lights were seen last night for the second time in succession
in the sky to the north and northwest.

A red-orange glow appeared to the north-northwest shortly after 9:30,
but was partially obscured by low clouds. The Hamilton Met station re-
ported a faint aurora borealis at one o'clock. Radio reception was hampered
by the phenomenon.

Cables and Wireless (West Indies) Limited reported earth currents in
their cables and complete wireless failure on wireless circuits. All cables
were received, the company stated, and the wireless messages received were
not for public service.

Capt. G. H. Fletcher of the Gascony was as surprised as a lot of other
people when he first saw the display on Monday night. "I didn't know at first
what they were," he said this morning aboard his vessel.

This was the first time, Captain Fletcher said, that he had noticed
these lights so far south. In northern latitudes he had often seen them.
On these occasions he said they were more spectacular, with less red but more
blue and violet in their makeup.
