NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Between approximately 0000 and 0900 on the mornin; of 16 July 1949 I was called to the door (Bldg T-516) by Pvt Claremond who exclaimed, "Hey, you guys, come and see those flying saucers!" He sounded rather serious about the matter, so I went to the door and he pointed "it" out to me. I saw an object which appeared to be moving at a great rate of speed in an easterly direction. It was visible only for four or five seconds and seemed to disappear. A C-82 was flying by at the time and the object appeared to be beyond the C-82 and at an altitude of approximately 5,000 to 6,000 feet. It seemed to pass on by the C-82 very fast.
Its shape was more or less round and not particularly flashy in a white color. No exhaust trails, weather very clear, no audible combustion sound.

I was looking out of the Supply building (T-516) when, first, I saw a C-82.
While looking, I saw two other objects that I first thought were jot planes. They were traveling just as fast or faster than the C-82. I called the other men, telling them there were two flying saucers. They saw them too and the objects then disapoared. Speed was very fast and altitude was about the same as the C-82, which was not very high. The color was a bright silver.
