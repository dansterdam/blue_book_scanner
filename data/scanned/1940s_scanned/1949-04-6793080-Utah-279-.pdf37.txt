"FIREBALLS"
Explode In Midair

Over Wide Utah Area And
Searching Parties Look For
"Things"—Meteors, Maybe.

Salt Lake City, April 5—(UP)—
At least one ball of fire—perhaps as
many as six—blazed brilliantly
through the clear-blue sky over
Northern Utah today.
The chief controlman at the Salt
Lake City airport tower said he
thought the display came from a
meteor.
Some of the hundreds of reports
also told of jarring explosions. And
police and sheriff's officers organized searching parties to look for
the "things"—man-made or heaven-
ly— that caused them.

The witnesses to the phenomenon
were scattered through the 100-mile-
wide, 150-mile-long area from Salt
Lake City north through Ogden to
Logan and then into Idaho. More
than three-quarters of Utah's 850,-

First reports came from Brigham
City, 60 miles north of Salt Lake
City, where frightened householders
rushed into the streets when they
heard explosions. They also felt
two—-earthquakes.
The Utah Highway Patrol said
it got the explosion were in midair
—one about 10:30 a. m., the other
at 11:15 a. m.
Ted Martin, chief controlman at
the Salt Lake Airport tower, said
he saw a ball of fire, high in the
heavens about the same time. When
it neared the earth, Martin said,
about 200'00' feet up, it appeared
the red-glowing object "blazed
brightly and became white in color."
At 1:45 p. m., Cliff Nielsen, Logan
newspaper correspondent, called his
Salt Lake City office and said
"things were still coming over.

"Wait and I'll count them
for you," he told his editor batch
"There's one ... two ... three."
he counted deliberately and contin-
ued until he had counted six
"things" that he said were speeding
