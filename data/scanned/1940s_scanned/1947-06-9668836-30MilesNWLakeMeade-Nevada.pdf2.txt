Incident #53 --- near Lake Meade, Nevada -- 28 June 1947

There appears to be nothing astronomical about this incident.
According to the observer, the objects had a speed of 285 
MPH and were moving on a course of 120°. Now, since the plane was
moving at 285 MPH on a course of 300°, it is possible that this ob-
served motion of the objects was only apparent (since 180° plus 120°
equals 300°), and we can conjecture that a cluster of balloons (cosmic
ray apparatus perhaps) was observed, the motion of which was merely
a reflection of the motion of the plane.
