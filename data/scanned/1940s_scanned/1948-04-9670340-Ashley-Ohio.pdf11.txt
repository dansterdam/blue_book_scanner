UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IN SKY.                                             13 April 1948.

Shortly after this I was called outside by my wife to see an unusual shape in the sky. My first reaction was that it was a plane on fire as it seemed to be an object surrounded by a vaporous substance. After studying it for a few seconds it became clearly outlined
