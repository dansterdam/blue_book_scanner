The photograph shows what appears to be a smudged or streaked image, possibly of a light or bright object against a dark background. The object is elongated and slightly curved, with irregular shapes protruding from its edges. The bottom part of the image shows a ruler for scale, indicating the object's size in comparison to inches. The ruler measures from 6 inches to 10 inches.

The visible text on the document reads:

- In the top right corner, obscured text with the visible part reading "... ASSIFIED"
- Above the object, text partly obscured seems to read "JNN A...SSIFIE D"
- At the bottom, under the ruler, the text reads "NOT DECLASS"
- On the lower right-hand side, "UNCLASSIFIED"
