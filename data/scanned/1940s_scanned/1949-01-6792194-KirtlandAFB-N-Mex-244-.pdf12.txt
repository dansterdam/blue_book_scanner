Incident #242 --- Los Alamos, New Mexico --- 6 January 1949

The information offered concerning this incident is meager, and there was only one observer. Accordingly, to the description, a brilliant green incandescent light was seen low on the horizon for about two seconds; speed was "hi" but slower than that of a meteor. In view of this scanty evidence, no definite conclusion can be drawn.

If it were not for the fact that this incident appears to belong in the family of low-axis 7 green flashes," this object would be considered to have been a slow meteor, even though the time of night of this sighting does not favor that hypothesis. It is much more probable, however, that this incident falls into the pattern of those dealt with in detail in the report on Incident #2235. See that report for further discussion.
