OFFICE MEMORANDUM                                         UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

Date:  20 December 1948

TO:       Captain Shea

FROM:  Inspector [REDACTED]

SUBJECT: Object seen on I05 Patrol

From 2050 to 2100 this date Inspector [REDACTED] and myself were at Pt. Eagle in the regular performance of the I05 patrol.

At 2058 we saw the object described below making a path thru the sky. The direction of travel was from West to East, possibly a trifle Southerly. The object was travelling in an almost flat trajectory and its decline formed an angle with the horizon of approximately twenty degrees. The angle of elevation from our point of observation was approximately thirty degrees. The object was moving at a very fast rate of speed and disappeared behind the mountains directly to the northeast of Pt. Eagle. Total time of visibility was about one and one-half seconds.

Description:

An intense blue-white light about the size of a basketball. As the object traversed the sky, there was a faint trail of lights behind it, and two objects the size of a baseball separated from the main body. These objects were of the same color and intensity as the main body, and trailed behind it directly in its path at even intervals of distance equal to approximately three times the diameter of the main body. The size of the main body was approximately one quarter the size of the moon.
