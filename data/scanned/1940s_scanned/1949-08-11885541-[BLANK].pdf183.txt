Incident No. 176 -- 23 Sept. 1945, 1200 hours, San Pablo, Calif.
On a warm hay day, Two men saw a large translucent object over a mile
overhead. It was the siez of a four-engine bomber, but "gray in color,
and appeared to be made of wax." According to the first observer,
the amorphous blob was spherical and undulated, having appendages fore
and aft, like an amoeba. The second observer said the object looked
like a "vegetable crate" covered with translucent material. The in-
vestigator states one observer's description was difficult to obtain
since it was over twenty years ago. One wore prescription glasses,
the other, who was seventy, needed glasses to read but wore none at
time of sighting.

AMC Opinion: The only fact that might be accepted is that an ob-
ject was seen. Two observers, side by side, could not agree on its
appearance. The evidence is useless. A balloon or cluster of balloons,
an aircraft, or a cloud could have been the stimulus.
