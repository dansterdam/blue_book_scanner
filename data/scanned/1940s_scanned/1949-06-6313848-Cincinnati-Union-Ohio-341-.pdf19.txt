NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

1945 hours 5 June 1949 at Tampa, Fla. an unidentified object traveling from SE to NW at a very high rate of speed was observed by Aircrew personnel of the 307th En Gp. This object was emitting white smoke and/or vapor trail which indicated its flight path was horizontal, but very erratic in direction. It made a large "Z" turn on course and then faded from view. The trail was visible for about 50 minutes.

It is the opinion of this officer that this object was not a meteor due to its erratic course.

ALL of the information contained in this report is endorsed by the ten (10) eyewitnesses interviewed. All ten (10) witnesses are Aircrew members of the 307th En Gp.
