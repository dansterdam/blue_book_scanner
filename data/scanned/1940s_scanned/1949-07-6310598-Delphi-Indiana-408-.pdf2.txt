NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

        letter, 7/24/49 -- The undersigned and ___________________, both of Lafayette, were fishing at the Merrill Store quarry just back of the Monon R. Railroad station at Delphi, on the evening of Saturday, July 23rd.
        At approximately 11 P.M. Daylight Saving Time, Robertson called to me, saying; "What are those lights flying around in the sky?"
        I came over and looked where he pointed. There were two luminous objects in the sky to the North of Delphi, at an approximate elevation of 1,500 feet. These two objects were soaring in circles. The one on the right was flying horizontally in an orbit, clockwise. The object on the left was flying in an orbit, counter-clockwise.
        ______ said, "Those must be the flying disks of which I have heard." We watched the objects. As they approached the near portion of the orbit they would emit a phosphorescent glare. They were flying at a terrific speed, and as they flashed around they would appear to tower us, then as they disappeared on the far swing of the orbit, would appear far ahead the flat portion which appeared as a glowing straight line until they faded from view.
        The courses which the objects took, while flying in circles, was somewhat erratic. They would dip and dive just as would a plane in taking evasive action.
        We had two flashlights, and we focussed the two spots together and held the objects as they came past, just as a hunter leads a flying pheasant. Then it was that we could make out that they were tangible objects. They appeared to be made of some shining metal, aluminium or magnesium, and appeared to be, as well as we could judge from their estimated height, about the size of a five room house in the area they covered.
        I then went across the road to a house and found a man sitting on the porch. I got him to come out and look at the objects. He said that he was going to call the editor of the Delphi paper, and the police department.
        Shortly after this several powerful searchlights swept the sky, following the disks; those of the police or fire department, I presume.
        Shortly after this the objects gradually kept getting farther away until they disappeared from view over the horizon. Approximately 30 minutes later they re-appeared, this time to the left of the place in the sky where they had first been seen. They flew in orbits in that area until, I would say, about 1 A.M.
