UNCLASSIFIED
MCIAO-X-3/III/WS/rm

21 March 1949

SUBJECT: Project "Grudge"

TO: Commanding Officer
37rd Reconnaissance Sqd VLR Wea
Kindley AFB, Bermuda
APO 856, c/o Postmaster
New York, New York

1. Reference is made to your letter (373 D Wea 350.05) dated
9 February 1949, subject, "Semi-monthly Intelligence Report" concerning
sighting of light phenomenon by Captain [redacted], 24 January 1949.

2. According to astronomical authorities the phenomenon described
by Captain [redacted] coincides exactly with the appearance of aurora
borealis (northern lights) as seen at latitudes as far south as Bermuda.

3. The Newspaper article "Northern Lights Are Seen Here" which
is evaluated A-1, states that the aurora was visible in Bermuda, 21
January beginning at a time close to that when Captain [redacted] first
saw his phenomenon. Furthermore, the lights were seen in a line of
direction from Bermuda which passes through or near the position where
Captain [redacted] estimates his light mass to have been located when
last seen.

4. It is requested that a transcript of entries from the log
of Hamilton Meteorological Station for the night in question be for-
warded to this Command, Attention: MCIAO-X-3.

5. Request further that Captain [redacted] and his crew be inter-
viewed to determine whether the appearance of nearness of the light
mass could have been illusory caused, possibly, by a combination of
cloud and water reflection and the intensity of the aurora.

6. Four copies of "Guide to Investigation" are forwarded to aid
in recording the desired information.
