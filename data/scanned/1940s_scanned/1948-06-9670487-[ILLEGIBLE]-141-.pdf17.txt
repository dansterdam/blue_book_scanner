Dear Sir:

This will serve to acknowledge receipt of, and to express appreciation for, the very comprehensive and interesting report on the unusual atmospheric phenomenon observed by you, together with your wife and several other persons, on June 20, 1948, while traveling by car, on Route 61, between specified points in South Dakota.

Your original letter and attached map section is being forwarded this date, to the proper authority in Washington, D.C., and, no doubt, you will be communicated with directly by such authority should additional information be desired.

By direction of the Commander, Second Coast Guard, District.

Very truly yours,
