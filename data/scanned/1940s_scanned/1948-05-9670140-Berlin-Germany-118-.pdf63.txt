During the period of this sighting the Navy was conducting a program
utilizing "sky hook" balloons. The Navy program was classified at this
time and therefore these balloons flights were known only to those with
a "need-to-know". It was subsequently determined that on the date of
the Godman sighting a balloon was released by the Navy from Clinton
County airport in Ohio. The release time of the balloon was related to
a wind plot for 7 January 1948, and it revealed that the balloon would
have been in the area of Godman at the time of the sighting.

On 7 January 1948, at the time of the sighting, Venus was also in a
directional position which coincided with that of the UFO. This planet's
angular distance from the sun was rather small, but bright enough to
be seen in the daytime. It is possible that Venus was also a cause to
this sighting, and was observed by some of the witnesses on the ground.
However, the prime culprit is believed to have been the sky hook balloon
released by the Navy. Captain Mantell was attempting to close in on this
balloon which was still more than 10,000 ft above him.

It is the Air Force conclusion in this case that Venus was probably the
original cause of the sighting since the object remained in the area for
a long period of time and was relatively stationary. The object pursued
by Captain Mantell is believed to have been the sky hook balloon, and
this object was probably seen by other witnesses who described the object
as pear shaped and metallic.
