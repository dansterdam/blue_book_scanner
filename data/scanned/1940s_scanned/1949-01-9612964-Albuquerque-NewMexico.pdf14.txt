SUBJECT: Surface Synoptic Situation and Winds Aloft, 4 December 1949

TO: Base Intelligence Officer
Keesler Air Force Base, Miss.

1. No synoptic weather observations are made at the actual point 
in question...i.e., 30 degrees 15 minutes west and 50 degrees 30 minutes
north; the closest observations being those at New Orleans some 35 miles
south. The general synoptic situation for the area was as follows:

A cold front oriented northeast-southwest had moved across the
area approximately five hours earlier replacing the Maritime Tropical
air with cool, dry Continental Polar air. There was a thin scattered layer
of cirrus at 30,000 feet and occasional scatted patches of strato-cumulus at 5,000 feet over the area. Surface visibility was ten miles.
Surface winds were from the northeast at 10-12 knots.

b. Winds aloft for the area were the following: At 2,000 feet wind
from 50 degrees at 20 knots, 4,000 feet from 30 degrees at 10 knots, 6,000
feet from 30 degrees at 10 knots, 8,000 feet from 340 degrees at 10 knots,
10,000 feet from 340 degrees at 10 knots, 12,000 feet from 320 degrees at
15 knots, Remainder of winds up to 35,000 feet are from a general 320
degrees at 40 knots, increasing to 70 knots at 35,000 feet.

2. Regarding celestial phenomena, the air almanac shows that the
planet Venus would be at an angle of approximately 50 degrees above the
horizon at an azimuth of 220 degrees from the north at 1635 C. There were
no other stars or planet of sufficient magnitude to be visible at that
time.
