5. Mr. ******, purser on ******* flight 9 January
1948, also saw the object (the flame only, that is), but can give
no further evidence for its identification.

6. Army Flight Service reported no jet aircraft in the vicinity
that night. 

7. Neither Headquarters, Third Army nor the FBI has had further
evidence of an unidentified object in the air or crashing on that date.

8. Mr. ****** advised this office on April 29 that seventy-five
(75) cattle had died of an unknown disease on the farm of Mr. ******
at ********, Georgia, and expressed concern over a possible connection
between the unidentified object, the reported gas attacks at ******
approximately eighteen (18) hours earlier and the cattle fatality.
Industrial Division, U.S. Department of Agriculture, advises that this
"unknown" disease has appeared for over 1 year, and other cases
repeated elsewhere in the country for some time back. Although they
admit no cure yet has been found and the disease remains incompletely
diagnosed, there apparently remains no basis for connection between
the death Mr. ****** reports and the death of the seventy or more
cattle at ******, Georgia.
