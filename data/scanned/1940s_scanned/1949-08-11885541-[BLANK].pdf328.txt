Incident No. 77 – 3 July 1947, 1430 Hours, South Brooksville, Maine. 
This observer, an "astronomer", heard a loud roar and with difficulty observed at 50° elevation approximately ten very light objects traveling N.W. The group held together with no regular formation. He claimed that the sky, cloudless to more than two over 1-1/2° angular diameter in that at a distance of 10 miles the objects would have a speed of 1200 MPH; that their width must be 100 feet across and due to their color would be barely visible. He also estimated the dB of 300 would have a width of fifty feet at five miles with a speed of 600 MPH. He believed they were aircraft of some type, owing to the loud roar. In his letter he asked, "have any meteorites been reported?"

AMC Opinion: It is believed that the observer should have been able to rule out the possibility of meteorites. Reducing the estimate of distance, and correspondingly reducing the required size to that of objects such as birds or insects, then the speeds become very modest. If the objects were actually five to ten miles distant, and responsible for the "unusually loud roar," it is expected that numerous other reports would have been received from this section of Maine, which is thickly populated.
