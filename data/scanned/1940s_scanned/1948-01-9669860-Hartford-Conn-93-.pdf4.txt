The photograph shows a page with text describing an unidentified flying object (UFO). The image is somewhat blurry and faded, with the top part marked "UNCLASSIFIED".

Here is the text from the document:

Object appeared to be a disc which had a bluish center was red on its
edges and was traveling at a very high velocity. It hade no tail nor
did it leave any sort of a trail in the air. Because of its high
velocity and the short space of time that it was sighted neither observer
could be certain of the size but in general, reported it resembled a shooting
star. It dropped out of sight on the north side of Mt. Tom which is near
Holyoke, Mass.

The bottom part of the image has some text that is obscured and not legible due to the quality of the scan. The word "UNCLASSIFIED" is visible again at the bottom edge.
