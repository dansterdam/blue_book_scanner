STATEMENT

On 24 July 1949 at approximately 2030 hours, my wife called
to my attention a flight of several objects flying almost
directly over our heads at a phenomenal rate of speed. They
were approximately seven in number and were emitting a bluish-
white light. I watched their flight from South to North until
they disappeared.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to
the best of my knowledge.

Captain, USAF
