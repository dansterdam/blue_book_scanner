MAXW-PBB3
21, May 1948

SUBJECT: Incident Report

TO: Commanding General
          Air Material Command
          Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
          Dayton, Ohio
          Attention: MCID

    Commanding General
    Air Defense Command
    Mitchel Field, N.Y.
    Attention: A3/2, Intelligence

1. On January 10, 1948 one ****, Eastern Air Lines pilot,
reported to the Atlanta office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
that shortly before midnight 9 January 1948, he had observed an
unidentifiable object crossing the path of his aircraft in the area
of Cartersville and Acworth, Georgia.

2. Mr. **** was on a heading of about 130° Mag. enroute from
St. Louis, Missouri, to Atlanta at altitude of about 3000 feet, flying
at about 170-180 m.p.h. when the object crossed his path on an approximate
heading of 175° Mag. at the same altitude. All he could observe was
an intense blue flame (light, sky-blue) in a shape circular except
for the top quarter which was flat (the pilot compared the flame to the
surface of the top part of an iron cross about 100' below horizontal, but
definitely did not have the curved trajectory of magnesium inside.

3. Mr. **** estimates the speed of the object as being in the
neighborhood of 170-180 M.P.H. Shortly after crossing his path, the
blue flame sputtered and turned immediately earthward. The flame
then died altogether and Mr. **** could not see anything hitting
the ground.

4. Mr. **** states that the flame was not of the long-trailing
type but rather gave the impression that you were looking at it down a
long exhaust stack a short but concentrated mass of blue flame, and
further stated that his conversations with RAF pilots in England during
the war leads him now to believe this object looked the same as the
"Buzz Bombs" chased by those RAF pilots at night.
