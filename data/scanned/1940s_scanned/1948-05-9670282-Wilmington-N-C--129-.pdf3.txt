Incident #129 -- Wilmington, North Carolina -- 31 May 1948

Evidence in this incident is contradictory, especially concerning tactics, but from the ragged description and the fact that the object emitted smoke and travelled at high speed, the possibility of its having been a meteor is not ruled out. Apparent oblong shape might have arisen from persistence of vision of a rapidly travelling bright object.

Is there a government testing field for guided missiles near by?
