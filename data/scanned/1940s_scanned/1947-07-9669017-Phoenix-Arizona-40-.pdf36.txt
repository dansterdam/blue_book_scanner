This form of distortion is equally report. The camera which took this photograph being a box camera had a rotary wiping type shutter.

2. In clarification of comment in sub-paragraph b; paragraph 2, Comment N: the following explanation is given: In the photographic processes it is quite possible to increase the contrast of the finished product over the original print contrast of
the original object by increasing developing time of the negative and printing the object archive on a hard or contrasty paper. As stated in the report by Mr. that the negative being gray blended with the gray overcast clouds. It also appears that the underneath side of the aircraft or object in question not to be lighted by the sun i.e., there would in shadow would not reflect as much light - to impress it's image on the film, as would the clouds which are diffusing the light from the sun.
