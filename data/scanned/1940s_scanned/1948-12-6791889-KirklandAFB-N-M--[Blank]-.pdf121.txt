other attempts by the crew of this hypothetical lost plane to make a 
position location were observed. And finally, two AACS operators
(who had no knowledge of the anomalous clouds over Sandia for on
the night of December 30) reported hearing the same sort of anomalous sounds as heard at Station 370 at 0540 on the early morning of
December 31. These sounds were heard for several minutes and were
reported to have receded slowly toward the southeast.

7. If we assume that Station 540 and 530 observed the same sound
sources at 2010 and 2020, than these sources are found to project into
points lying near the road leading West out of the mountain side at
Station 340. On the basis of the elevation determinations made at Station
350, it is furthermore found that the first source would be about 500 feet
lower in elevation than Station 340 and the second source approximately 1500
feet lower than this station. These differences in elevation would again
seem to suggest that the sound sources may have been situated on or near the
paved highway. However, the very careful observation made by the experienced
transit man, Inspector _______, at Station 540, 2020 was entirely incompatible with
this assumption that the sound sources was here, or menos than one thousand feet
lowerthan Station 340. Authority has advised 2020 observation in this
his sound source was at an elevation of more than 11,000 feet above the
horizontal plane to which Station 350. It must therefore, have been approxi-
mately 10,000 feet ABOVE, not below, Station 340. This impossibility thereof
discrepanncy shows that our intial assumption that the unaccountable and larger-
area sounds impossible to establish a geodesic ranging between observations mad
at Station 530 and 350 PRIOR to the bogey warning, i.e., during the times
when the observers at Station 340 heard the sound only from inside thei
obsevatories in contrast to the observers at Station 350, who made their
observations in the open air. Had the observers and Station 340, with as
STation 340 in reality heard a sound emanating from a very local source
above them, an accordance with the conditions imposed by the open-air
observations, than what they heard might well have been so distorted by theze
abnormally stratified layers that their proposition led to fall all noises
to have traumatic sources. And by their triangulation to a region at heights
strains observations as were measured for them at Station 340 on January 30.

8. In sharp contrast to the discordon noted in the observations pre-
ceding the bogey warning at 2050, the open-air observations made at end
immediately following the warming show a quite satisfactory concordance.
In fact, if we assume that all three staions, 340, 350, and 390 were listen-
ing to the same sound source at 2050 and shortly thereafter, then the actual
location above normal level of the actual sound source as computed from the angular
elavation observed at Station 340 is 11,230 feet, at Station 350 is 12,213
and at Station 390 is 10,136 feet. If we pairs Stations 340 and 350, the
projection of the sound source on the surface of the earth lies approximately
the coordinates 106Â° 17' 30 52" while if we pair stations 390 and 350,
the coordinates of the projection of the sound surce on the earth differ
from the above by less than one-half minute in longitude and no less than
a minute and a half in latitude. In vies of the nature of the noise observed
