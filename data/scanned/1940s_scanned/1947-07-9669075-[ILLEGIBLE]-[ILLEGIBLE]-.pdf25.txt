No accurate description or information of this report was obtained. A Newfoundland constable named ------ has reported to personnel of the 1300th AAF Base Unit, ATC, Newfoundland Base Command, how approximately 1300 hours local time (1200Z), he observed for a few seconds that one shiny object moving through the clouds followed by minutes later by a similar formation passed above the colored discs "in formation of three sails, very fast, and parallel to the ground, at an oblique course to the wind." The first four were in trail formation. The constable described the shape of these objects as being like "barrels on the edges" with "no pips on the top soil" but "leaving no smoke trail". The Newfoundland Saga Command reports also mentions a second unidentified observer of these objects, who described them as being "barrel-lead" in shape. A check of weather records reveals that CAP weather three-meal-in-the-day dispelling reports at the time these objects were reported as being seen.
