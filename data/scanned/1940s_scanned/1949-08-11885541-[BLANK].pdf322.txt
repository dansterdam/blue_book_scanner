Incident No. 64 â€” 19 August 1947, 2130 hours, Twin Falls, Idaho.
Several people were reported as sighting numerous groups of objects in the
night sky. These objects were described as a glow in the air with a color
similar to regular electric lights. The objects were said to have traveled
at "terrific speed". Some flew in triangular formation. Three objects pulled
off of one group or tane, and proceeded on their course. The sky was over-
cast. Two observers stated that the objects could not have been birds since
the lights were not a reflection of city lights.

A/IC Opinion: Many familiar objects visible because of the fact that 
they reflect light, appear to be incandescent; for example, the moon and
certain planets. The evidence is, therefore, contradictory since as not being
reflectory. The submitted evidence has really a glow, and later on as not in-
stances the objects are described as merely a complex reflection incident 6Z;
ground lights reflected from clouds, or birds in flight.
