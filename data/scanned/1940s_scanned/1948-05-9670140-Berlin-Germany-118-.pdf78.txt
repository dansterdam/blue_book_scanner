35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Around 1950 I read about the 
u.f.o’s flying saucers. Living in 
Israel from 1946-1956, I had no time 
nor thought of the incident to report.

The reason I didn’t even
think about those shiny spots in 
the sky was, you wouldn’t 
take it as a reason. What 
I saw was beyond my power
of thinking. I knew all the 
flying things that could have 
been but couldn't think of any
human made object. So 
I shut myself off and thought,
it's not from earth and 
therefore not my right to 
question him. Of those things 
are stars, then God made 
them meant for a change.
