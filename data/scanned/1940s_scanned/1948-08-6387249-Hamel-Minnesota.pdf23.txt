Incident #152 -- Hamel, Minnesota -- 11 August 1948

No astronomical explanation is possible for this inci-
dent. A meteorite would not have descended so gently, nor would
it have risen again.

It seems illogical that this could have been an actual
physical occurrence, out if it was, it is doubly unfortunate that
no mature observers were at hand. If the object did land just a
few foot away, one would think that even children would have given
a mere detailed description. Is it known whether the children
have normal vision? To one with myopic vision, even a buzzard or
hawk alightng to a landing might appear as a strange object.
