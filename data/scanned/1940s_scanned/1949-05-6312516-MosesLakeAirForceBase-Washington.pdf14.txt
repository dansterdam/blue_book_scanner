NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

at 1435.

It is believed that two separate and distinct alert conditions existed on
the afternoon of 21 May 1947. The first was caused by the sightings of Flying
Saucers (noted) by Hanford using a telescope and the operations crew of the
657th AC&W. The second was caused by the dropping of leaflets by an aircraft
into the Hanford area. It is believed that there is no connection between the
two events.
