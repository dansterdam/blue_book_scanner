9 Aug 1948
A-1917

On 2 August 1948, Mrs. [REDACTED], housewife, and Mrs. [REDACTED],
mother of Mrs. [REDACTED], both of [REDACTED] Avenue, Columbus,
Ohio, were interviewed concerning an unidentified object in the sky and
stated in substance:

On Saturday evening, 31 July 1948, at approx 8:00 P.M., we were
driving south on [REDACTED] Road and as we approached the WOSU radio tower
which is located on the University Golf Course, we saw a large object
which looked like a huge lantern floating in the sky. The weather was
clear there were no clouds, and it was still daylight, so we could see the
object quite clearly. It was oblong in shape and was about the size of a gaso-
line drum. It was coming from the west and moving very slowly. It passed
close to the radio tower and was about half the height of the tower from the
ground. As it passed overhead ,traveling east, it was spouting black smoke
from the top and at the bottom on the left side there was a dull enclosed
light like a lamp. The object did not change its course or altitude but
continued on to the east with a black smokey trail behind. The
object was black and did not make any noise. It did not have any motor
or wings visible and we could not see any opening or any kind. We stopped
our car to observe this object and another car stopped near us. There
was a boy and a girl in it and they both said they never saw anything like
the object before. We did not get their names. We called the Columbus
Dispatch (newspaper) when we got home and the editor took our story but
he misrepresented the facts in the newspaper. We did not see any "glittering
whirling discs" or "glittering balls" as stated in the paper. We say only
one object.
