Incident #50, 50a - - Wildwood, New Jersey - - 10 January 1948

In view of the unbalanced character of at least one of the observers (as indicated by the report of the interview), this investigator wonders how much credence can be given to the reports of the object or objects cited. For instance, the summary states that the first object was in sight 3-5 seconds, while the interview indicates 15-20 minutes. Assuming that this first incident was authentic and the shorter time correct (it evidently being the estimate given by the second observer), there is nothing in the evidence that is contradictory to the notion that the object observed was nothing more than a slow-moving fireball. The color, splitting into two pieces, and manner of disappearance all support this view.
