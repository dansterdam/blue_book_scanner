11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers sighted an amber cylindrical-shaped object. It was stationary and appeared to be fairly high. Later on observers returned to the site of the observation and a Pyrex insulator was observed casting an unusual and weird reflection of the lights of a football stadium. The observers identified it as the strange object which they had seen.
