Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):
Agent's Note:

On 15 August 1949, the following information concerning the sighting of
unidentified aircraft was obtained from a University *****************
TC Reserve,********* student of Ohio State University, **************
Ohio ******************** Columbus, Ohio

At approximately 1900 hours, 15 August 1949, while visiting the Traffic
Control Tower, Port Columbus Airport, Campbell observed a smoke trail directly
above the airport, which appeared to be caused from an unseen object flying at
very high altitude, estimated as 30,000 to 70,000, in a westerly direction.
The trail was described as cushion; abrubtly at not maximum intensity and con-
tinuing at maximum intensity for approximately two-thirds its length and then
fading away. According to Campbell, the trail was visible for about fifteen
seconds and that the source of the smoke seemed to increase its velocity during
this time. The phenomena was described by informant as resembling a smoke trail
issuing from a high speed plane, which may have been using a device similar to
JATO (Jet Assisted Take Off) for an additional burst of speed. Informant did not
believe the vapor or smoke trail to be a "contrail" because of its density and
color. The trail was described as greyish-white, and according to informant
did not dissipate as rapidly as contrails he has observed. Informant estimated
that the object emitting the trail traveled through a angle of approximately
fifteen degrees in; ten-fifteen seconds which would be an So an earth to
smoke trail disappeared, a light was observed in the sky at about 50,000 to
60,000 feet, directly over the Outerbelt, right at the southwest corner of
the airfield. The light remained motionless for a short time and then appeared
to travel toward the horizon in a northerly direction. ************* stated
that the Port Columbus tower contacted the pilot of a Trans-world Airlines DC-3
enroute to Dayton, Ohio and asked for his observations on the light. It
reported that the pilot gave his position as over the West Jefferson, Ohio radio
ran on a - that the pilot gave his position as eight . from left to right at
an altitude estimated at 10,000 to 50,000 feet. The path of radiant the course
on the Dayton bound plane as 265 degrees at the time the report was made.
Informant left the Control Tower, Port Columbus airport at 2015 hours 1 august
1949, and the lit described was still visible at that time. (C-6)
Agent's Note:
a thoughtful, straightforward statement that he has seen flight training and
considers aircraft as a hobby. Mr. Sewood to be describing; what he had seen in
report of the incident as carried in the local press is attached to this report.
