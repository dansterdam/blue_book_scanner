Incident #33, d-e: -- 29.0 2

it seems to t.is investi[ator, b]y wei[gh]ed in term [of the evi]den[ce]...ing,
evidence of th...er of disa[ppearance over the h]orizon.

The stella[r magnitude of Ven]us on January 7 was -3.4, whi[ch
makes it 20 times br]ighter than the bri[ght star Arcturus. Venus, whom
as bri]ght as this and simil[ar through a]nterfer[ence ]ike a host of cl[ouds,
could very easily] give the effect o[f a flari[ng object with a tail.
Conce]rn[ing, the erratic motion r]eported by so[me witnesses, this ca]n be 
said: motion of clou[ds past the o]bject could give the illusion of
rapid mo[vement, as when clouds scu]d by the moo[n; or this effect could
have been a psy[chological] illusion; a thi[rd possibility, re]mote but
based on a real[ly]-observe[d phenomenon, is tha]t, owing to there[o-]three
slons in the a[tmosphere, stars near t]he horizon have been k[nown to
jump about errat]ically th[rough arcs of two or thr]ee times the moon's
appar[ent diameter. Venus, when very] close to the horizon, has been
known to tw[inkle brilliantly with rapid]ly changing colors.

It ap[pears to the r]esent investi[gator, in summi]ng up the
evidence presented, that we are forc[ed to the conclu]sion that the ob-
ject observ[ed in the early ev]ening hours of J[anuary 7, 1953, at these
widely separ]ated localities, was t[he planet Venus. To assum]e that a
terrestrial obje[ct could be located so ]high as to be visible simul-
taneously over a wid[e area, and ha]d such intrin[sic] brightness (of
incredible bright]ness, far surpa[ssing any known earth-made lig]ht), and
would so
