Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

I am a Resevre pilot, 703rd A&E Unit, at Reno, California. On the night of
February 20, 1949, I was pilot of a T-6 aircraft No. 7385 on a round-robin flight
from Reno to several California airports and returned to Sandberg Pass on 
the approximate time of 2030. At approximately 2030 PST while in the vicinity of 
M.T.R. Sandberg Pass, 10 miles south of Bakersfield, while flaying on a northerly heading
at an altitude of approximately 9,000 feet, I observed what appeared to be a jet-
propelled aircraft of an unfamiliar type. Weather over Sandberg Pass was thin
scattered clouds, visibility 10 miles, temperature 26, cloud coverage at approxi-
mately 20,000 feet, dew point 34, wind south 7, altimeter 3007. The visibility
was was 1 mile with fog rolling and visibility variable due to scattered strands
drifting in thin streaks. The object which the general shape of a blimp approached
head-on about 1500 feet above me, made a complete 360° spiral, and left on a heading
of 60° to my course. The object left a steady glow in the rear which I believed
to be a jet exhaust. At the time the co-pilot was in the rear of the aircraft
and at no time observed the object. I was unable to determine its distance from 
me due to darkness and elimination conditions. The object appeared about as big as
two fingers at arm's length. But it took about 3 seconds for the object's
glow to turn about my craft and during this maneuver I could observe the glow to be
approximately 20° above my line of flight. The windshield of my aircraft was
clear at the time the observation was made.

When the object completed the turn and loft, I immediately attempted to contact
the pilot of another aircraft also on a round-robin about 10 minutes behind me.
I was answered by someone whom I believed to be this pilot but I later learned
that, although he had received my transmission, had been unable to reply due to
the interference of the unknown individual who was answering me. I was never able
to identify the individual with whom I communicated. The other pilot that I was
attempting to contact did not observe the object, and to my knowledge I am the only
person who made the actual observation.
