WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

July 13, 1949

Mr. [Redacted]
Vice President & Chief Engineer

Springfield, Illinois

Dear Mr. [Redacted]

Thank you for your letter of June [Redacted] furnishing information to the Government on objects observed traversing the night sky. This Committee has not been involved in the analysis of observations of this type. The United States Air Force has, however, been concerned and active in such analyses and is cognizant of the related defense aspects and we are therefore forwarding your letter to the Chief of Staff, USAF, for appropriate action.

The Committee is appreciative of your interest in the national defense.

Very truly yours,

NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE
FOR AERONAUTICS

P. G. Robinson
Assistant Director for Research
