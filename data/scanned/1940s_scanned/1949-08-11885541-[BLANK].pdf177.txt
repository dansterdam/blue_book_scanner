Incident No. 125 - Between 15 and 20 August 1947, 2130 hours,
Waver, South Dakota.

An Air Force officer saw twelve "flying discs" four miles away over the
Rapid City Air Force base in a "tight diamond" formation at 8000 to
10,000 feet descending to 6000 feet at 500 MPH. Objects made a forma-
tion turn and climbed at 90° to 140° alternating. Objects were very 
maneuverable, zooming equally spaced in all manouvers. Each object
was 100 feet in length, oval-shaped and brilliant yellowish-white. No
sound nor exhaust trail were heard or seen.

AC Opinion: This reporter should be a reliable observer. How-
over, it has been shown that distance cannot be estimated without prior
knowledge of the size of an object. If distance is not known, speed
cannot be estimated. More notable perhaps is that such observation
could be re-absorbed in a report made one year after the incident[sic] 
and yet the date was not remembered. Dr. Hynek suggested the possi-
bility of detached auroral streamers.
