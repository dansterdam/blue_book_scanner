SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report; Give significant, factual, and descriptive paragraph. Link reports—same subject. Identify source later in report and in Form 112—Part III)

On 31 May 1949 at 1130 hours the pilot of an F-80 aircraft, while on a training
mission, at an altitude of 20,000 feet over Misawa Air Force Base (40°43'11"/141°22'12"),
reported that he observed what appeared to him to have been from the reflection of sunlight 
off an aircraft in flight. The amount of light reflected appeared to him to be that
equal to a B-29. The object appeared to the pilot to have been 20 to 30 miles distant,
above 30,000 feet, moving at a high rate of speed in a northerly direction for a dis-
tance of from 7 to 10 miles and then disappear into the overcast.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER: Operational units have been consulted and it has been
determined that neither weather, tactical, civil nor special classified aircraft were
in the area at the time of the sighting. In addition the observer stated that he had
the other F-80 Aircraft in sight at the time of seeing the object and that it could
not have been the shadow of other aircraft.

It is believed that this object may have been the planet Venus or a foreign air-
craft on reconnaissance.
