Incidents 165 — Rehoboth Beach, Delaware — September 1946 
October 1946
2 June 1947

This incident contains nothing extracontinental. 

It is entirely possible that the objects observed on 
these three separate dates were "Bumble bees," ram-jet missiles, 
as fired from fort Miles by the Applied Physics Laboratory of 
Johns Hopkins University. Since the hour of observation of the 
various sightings (and the exact day of the first two) is not 
given in material submitted to this investigator, positive iden-
tification cannot be made; but if those facts are known, inquiry 
at the above-mentioned laboratory (address: c/o 8621 Georgia 
Avenue, Silver Spring, Maryland) might bring forth definite iden-
tifications.
