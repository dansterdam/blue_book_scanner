The photograph shows an elongated, rod-like object with a fin or appendage protruding from one side. It is positioned vertically against a light background. There appears to be a ruler placed horizontally at the bottom of the photograph for scale, measuring the object in inches. The ruler indicates that the object is approximately 7 to 8 inches in length.

The text on the document reads:
- CONFIDENTIAL (at the top left)
- UNCLASSIFIED (stamped on the lower right side of the ruler and also written at the top right, although not fully visible)
