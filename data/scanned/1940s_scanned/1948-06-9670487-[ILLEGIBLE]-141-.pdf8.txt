The image appears to be a scanned document page with a series of schematic drawings or sketches. It does not contain any actual photographs.

The text on the document reads:

First part of break up
Break up completed.

The drawings seem to depict a sequential series of events, potentially indicating the process of an object breaking apart. There are a number of circular shapes, with one in the center that is more detailed, as if to show an object disintegrating or changing form over time.
