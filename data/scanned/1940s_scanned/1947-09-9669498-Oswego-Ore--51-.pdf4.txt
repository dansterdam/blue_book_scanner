Incident #61 -- Oswego, Oregon -- 3 September 1947

The limited information given here does not suggest anything astronomical.

It is surprising that there was only one witness to this incident, since it occurred in a city, at a time when there was a plane in the sky.

If these objects were not ordinary aircraft at a great distance, or a cluster of balloons, then the incident must be considered together with others reporting groups of unidentified round or discoid objects, several of which occurred in this locality (e.g., incidents #5-9, 12-16).
