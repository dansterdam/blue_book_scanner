ARMSTRONG advised that this radar station tracked an outbound aircraft from about
1630 hours, 30 September 1949, which appeared to originate in the vicinity of
Makapuu. Force Base, and traveled towards the sea at about 1150 for a distance 
of approximately 10 miles and then assumed a course of 072Â° where it was tracked until
about 1745 hours. For a distance of about 172 miles. The estimated speed of this
aircraft was 150 miles per hour. No report covering an object floating in a northeasterly direction from this base was noted by the Kahuku radar station. Major
ARMSTRONG also advised that he had checked the Oahu Navy Radar Unit (Schoefield),
and was advised that this station was not in operation at 1700 hours, 30 September 1949. Mr. A. A. ALEXANDER, Operations Clerk, Detachment VT-2, US Navy, Honolulu 
International Airport advised that Navy Mars (JRM) Flying Boat departed that station
enroute to the mainland United States at 1630 hours, 30 September 1949, and the 
usual route followed by this aircraft would closely approximate that plotted by 
the 6th Alternate Control & Warning Squadron. The large flying boats travel 
at a slower speed than the usual C-54 aircraft; the cruising speed being between
150 to 180 miles per hour.

following previous reports of unidentified flying objects:

a. Agent Report dated 20 October 1948, SUBJECT: "Flight Disc by 
SA BAYNE P. SCURLOCK, last Counter Intelligence Unit, Pacific Air 
Command, APO 953, as follows:

On 19 October 1948, this Agent, accompanied by Special Agent
RIDLEN, drove to 7137 Pacific Heights Road, the Honolulu resi-
dence of Major ROBERT C. DUM, AO 431328, Deputy Chief of Civil-
ion COmponents, Pacific AIr Command, APO 935. This trip was made 
with the hopes of observing a similar incident observed by 
Major DUMB the previous afternoon from his home, that of "fluttering 
discs". Major DUM stated that on the afternoon of 18 October 
1948, at approximately 1705 hours, while lying on the lawn with 
his 8 yr. old daughter, he observed what appeared to be a strang-
ly shaped, silver, glistening object high in the sky, in a northe-
erly direction. The distance from the object was traveling in a north-
ary direction. The object at 30,000 feet altitude. At about this 
particular time of day, the Major stooted, a stratus layer of clouds
was situated above the flying object at an approximate altitude of
14,000 feet. The "discs" were moving below this layer of clouds.
Because of lower broken cumulus clouds at a very low altitude,
moving in a southwesterly direction, the Major was not certain
whether he saw the same "disc" on four (4) different occasions or 
four (4) different "discs". Covering a period of ten (10) minutes
the "discs" (or disc) were observed each time for approximately
ten (10) seconds. On first observing the strange objects, Major 
DUM called it to the attention of his wife and 8 yr old daughter.
When asked what they had seen the previous afternoon, Mrs. DUM
and the small daughter, LINDA, agreed exactly the same observation 
as stated above by the Major. Major DUMB compared the
