The document contains two images. The first image, located at the top left, is a portrait of a humanoid figure, likely a sketch or illustration rather than a photograph. It depicts a face with prominent eyes and a neutral expression.

The second image, located at the top right, appears to be a blurry aerial photograph or possibly an illustration mimicking a photograph, featuring indistinct shapes which could be interpreted as objects in the sky. It's difficult to discern specific details due to the image quality and blurriness.

4. The discernible pattern of observation and exploration shown by the so-called "flying disks" varies in no important particular from well-developed American plans for the exploration of space expected to come to fruition
within the next fifty years. There is reason to believe, however, that some other race of thinking beings is a matter of two and a quarter centuries ahead of us.

The only other possible explanation is that the "saucers"
are extremely high-speed, long-range devices developed
here on Earth. Such an advance (which the Air Force has
convincingly denied) would require an almost incredible
leap in technical progress even for American scientists and
designers.

Starting at first glance, Tsu's conclusions are logical
and reasonable in the light of the facts. They have
long since been fully accepted by informed authorities.

After the first flurry of excitement, juggling sightings
of the so-called disks or saucers in early 1947, the various explanations were put forward: hoax, hallucination, hypnosis,
weather balloons, the planets Neptune, Venus, or Mercury,
and optical illusions. Some hoaxes and mistakes naturally
occurred; such things usually follow highly publicized
events. But none of the explanations will stand up in
the important, most authentically reported cases. However,
most people were satisfied, and the great flying-disk mystery
was generally forgotten. An important magazine publisher
wrote strangely inconclusive and contradictory articles, stated
to have been prepared with the cooperation of the Air
Force, purporting to dismiss the disks as no basic significance.

In two fields, however, interest in the strange phenomena
rose instead of declining.
The United States Army Air Force investigators operating in "Project Saucer"—the official investigating agency
charged with solving the mystery—kept on with their work.
Today they are receiving and evaluating sighting reports
at the rate of twelve a month.

Various scientists, thinking independently, began to
scratch the records of the past. They discovered reports of
strange, air-borne, disklike objects in the sky as far back
as 1772. They began to ponder the tremendous implications of that discovery.

There was fortunately a good deal of current material
with which to work. For a beginning, let's consider the
Mantell case. About 1:15 p. m. on January 7, 1948, a round
object, estimated to be at least 250 ft. in diameter, was
sighted over Madisonville. Kentucky. At 1:50, state police
alerted Fort Knox, as the disk appeared to be heading in
that direction. Fifteen minutes later, an alarm acted in the
Godman Air Base tower, ninety miles from Madisonville.
was the disk over the field. It appeared to be hovering and
saw clearly seen by most of the officers on the base. At
times it gave off a reddish glow. The commanding officer
on the base, Colonel Guy F. Hix, ordered radio contact
made with a flight of three F-51s passing over Fort Knox,
led by Captain Thomas F. Mantell, Jr. The flight was
near Godman Field, en route to Louisville, an experienced
pilot with a distinguished ETO combat record. Mantell
called in shortly and reported contact with the thing.

At 2:45, Mantell radioed Godman that the object was
at 12 o'clock high (directly ahead and above him). He
said: "I'm closing in now to take a good look. It's directly
ahead of me and moving at about half my speed. The thing
looks metallic and it's tremendous in size." For twenty five
minutes, Mantell and the two F-51s with him tried vainly
to close in. Mantell reported that the thing was climbing
and making speeds equal to his, which he said was 360 m.p.h.
In broken cloud at 18,000 feet, the other two ships lost
sight of Mantell and could not find him again. At 3:15,
minutes, they broke off and landed at Godman. After five
Mantell called in to say that he was not gaining on the
object and that if he were no closer when he reached 20,000
