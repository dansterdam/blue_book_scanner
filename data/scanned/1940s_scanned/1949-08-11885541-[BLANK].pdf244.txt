Group 5. The fifth group includes reports of objects to which little 
credence can be placed.

General Remarks.

In general, it is noted that few if any reports indicate that the ob-
served objects made any noise or radio interference, nor were there many 
indications of any material effects or physical damage attributable to 
the observed objects.

SUMMARY, PART I.

This report will consider mainly the reports of groups 1 and 2.

PART 2. ON POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENA.

Section A. Thats can be deduced concerning the entry of unknown aerial 
objects from a single sighting.

There are two problems: first, how much can be deduced concern-
ing the nature of the objects from observational calculations alone; second, 
how much more can be deduced if, in addition, it is assumed that the ob-
jects obey the laws of nature as we know them.

Concerning this first problem, it can be stated that only ratios of 
lengths, and rates of change of such ratios can be accurately determined. 
Thus the range and size of such objects cannot be determined, and it is 
noticeable that reports of size of the observed objects are widely var-
iable. However, angles, such as the angle subtended by the object, can 
be observed. Likewise, there is fair agreement among several observers that 
the diameter of the objects of Group 1 is about ten times their thickness. 
Although velocity cannot be determined, angular velocity can be, and in 
particular the flutter frequency could, in principle, be determined.

All that can be concluded about the range and size of the objects, from 
geometrical considerations alone, is 1) from the fact that estimated
