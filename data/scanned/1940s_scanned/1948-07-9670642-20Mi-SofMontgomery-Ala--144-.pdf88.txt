The image contains a photograph at the bottom. It appears to show a sequence of sketches or images of an unidentified flying object or phenomenon, consisting of three separate frames. These frames portray the object in different positions or moments in time, suggesting movement. The object depicted is somewhat sinuous or wave-like, with undulations along its form.

on such a body would be accompanied by high drag; plus: a serious limit-
ation on the range of the aircraft for any particular gross weight.
IF this type of unidentified aerial object has extremely long range, it
is probable that the method of propulsion is one which is far in advance
of presently known engines.

POWER SOURCES

(a) The foregoing discussion is predicated upon the
assumption that power sources presently avail-
able would have to be used. If an atomic energy
powered engine were available, a small mass flow
at a large velocity would accomplish the required
lift and propulsive forces and the large energy
expenditure would be of small importance.

(b) However, the head exchange requirements for the
atomic powered engine appear to demand physical
dimensions of inordinate size that presently
would preclude the use of this powerplant for
aircraft. Experimental work in progress to con-
vert the energy of the atomic pile directly to
electricity, rather than heat, offer the promise
of a more compact atomic powerplant.

Conclusions: 1.  The flying anomaly observed, remains unidentified 
as to origin, construction and power source.

2. A definite trend of flight headings has evolved as 
generally South, in bearing.

3. Supporting evidence from separate reliable sources
establish existence of this configuration.
