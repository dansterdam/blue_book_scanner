SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
Andrews Air Force Base,
Washington 25, D. C.
AV/11/ DDS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investiga-
tion and interpretation of data relative to a sighting of unidentified
flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 through 172 from the files
of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendation as to
which of the incidents may be elimintated as balloons released on routing
synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological
Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached
may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that
has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except
that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball
lightning. Research projects in which balloons and Air Force are
engaged or approved by the Army, Navy or industrial parties are 
conducted by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks 
should be made direct from the Project "SIGN" Office, MCIAO-3. These 
checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by 
weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department 
of Commerce. (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the balloon listed inci-
dents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This 
list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining
incidents are balloons.
