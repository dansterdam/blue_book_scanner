The nature of the actual content, where visible, suggests it could be part of a report describing a sighting of unidentified flying objects with specific details about the observation. The numbers written as fractions (such as 7/15, 7/8) may refer to handwritten notes in the margin or a specific coding or rating system that is not explained in the visible portion of the document. The heavy redactions obscure much of the personal and potentially sensitive information.
