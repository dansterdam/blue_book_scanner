DETAILS:

AT KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE UNCLASSIFIED

On 18 January 1949 Dr. LINCOLN LA PAZ provided a letter from one
******* **********, a student at the University of *** *****, relevant to
an observation of 5 December 1948. The information contained in this letter
is summarized below:

At about 2000 hours, 5 December 1948, while walking along the west
side of Varsity Village, a University housing area, ****** saw a bright
green "meteorite". The color was a brilliant green, as in a traffic signal
or a neon tube. There was a definite area to the object; i.e., it was not
merely a point of light. The size was very hard to determine, but was esti-
mated at one third that of Venus when that planet is visible in the sky.
****** did notice any claim of accuracy as to the size, however, stating
that he could not definitely say. The object appeared in the western sky,
vertically to about five degrees. There was a definite corona or halo effect,
but no sparks or trail were produced. The sky was hazy and there was some
cloud cover at the time of the sighting, but ****** did not recall the
extent of the cloudiness. No stars were visible in the part of the sky where
the "meteor" was observed.

No other report or observation for 5 December gives a time element of
2000 hours. ********* will be contacted by Dr. LA PAZ in an effort to obtain
precise measurement of his observation angle.

2. A report of observation by Inspector EARL WILLIS, AESS, was provided
by Lt. Col. JOHN A. CARROLL, Chief Inspector, AESS, Los Alamos, New Mexico on
17 January 1949. This report provided the following data:

Date: 6 January 1949 Color: Brilliant green
Time: .0310 Elevation: 3 to 5 degrees
Direction: Azimuth 30 degrees Trajectory: Flat
Speed: Slower than a meteor OP: Station 101

The object was visible for about two seconds, low in the sky to the
northwest. It moved in a straight line at a high speed. It looked like a
bright green meteor with trails. Its elevation of course did not vary. Direction
of movement was east to west, low on a level course, disappearing behind the
mountainous horizon to the west. (Inclosure 1)

3. On 7 January 1949 the Chief, Physical Security Branch, Sandia Base,
New Mexico, (CHRIST J. DOYLE), Forwarded a report of observation by PFC.
******** ********, ASN # 55 952 954, 8450th H.P. Group. ******** reported
that on 6 January 1949, while guarding an aircraft near the Ordnance Area,
Kirtland Air Force Base, he had observed a bright object traveling across
the sky. The time was approximately 1720, and the sky was clear, providing
a light blue background. The object was diamond shaped, about two feet long,
bright white in color, and moving at a high rate of speed. Altitude was
estiimated at 1500 to 2000 feet, and distance travelled was estimated at 500
feet. There was no noise or trail. Two other persons with ******** did not
see the object. (Enclosure 2)
