Incident No. 122 â€“ 5 April 1948, Holloman Air Force Base, New
Mexico. 
Three balloon observers saw an object very high in the sky, moving 
faster than any known aircraft and possessing a rounded indistinct form, 
which disappeared suddenly. It was soon less than thirty seconds and 
was approximately at simulated 5 degree elevation. The observers could not 
also guess size they stated if the moon were the size of an orange the ob-
ject would approximate the size of a disc. 

AFC Opinion: No explanation. However, the above comparison of 
size is to be noted. A disc held at arms length would shield the moon 
from the eye even if the moon appeared several times larger than it 
does. To reduce the proportion then, this object must have appeared as 
an infinitesimal point. From trained observers, this is certainly a 
major discrepancy.
