Incident #255 - near Vaughn, New Mexico

It is difficult to ascertain whether the objects described
in this incident belong to the general group of "new looking green
fireballs," or not. The description here is sufficiently different
from the majority to indicate that they do not: the characteristics
green color is not mentioned.

It is noteworthy, however, that the three separate sightings,
all occurring at approximately 2200 hours and in the same locality,
can be explained as astronomical phenomena. Furthermore, the stated
altitude and distance are entirely out of keeping; this fact might
be discounted as an illusion, common in the observation of fireballs,
if the instance were isolated. The weight of the evidence, however,
inclines to the conclusion that the objects were man-made devices
and part of some scientific experiments, so common in that section
of the country.
