The image does not contain a photograph, but appears to show a scanned page with text and some redacted segment marked with black bars. I will now act as an OCR system and provide the text from the document:

Incident #32 -- over Columbus, Ohio - 7 January 1948

The evidence given in this incident fits the hypothesis that the object observed was the planet Venus, and, considered with incidents #33, 38, and 49, it is incredible that it could have been anything else.

See report on #33 for detailed discussion of sighting of 7 January 1948.
