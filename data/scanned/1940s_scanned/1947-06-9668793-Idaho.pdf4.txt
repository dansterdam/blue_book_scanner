There is no discernible photograph present in the provided image. The document image is highly faded and the text is nearly illegible. Despite this, I can attempt to transcribe the partially readable text as best as I can:

"... he observed the four-like object through the [...]
Telescope for roughly [...] 45 seconds to 1 minute. He stated that the object didn't leave any vapor [...]
however, and that he [...] observed in the vicinity of the object [...]
tended to indicate the location of the air motion of the earth [...]"

The poor quality and low contrast of the image prevent an accurate and complete transcription of the text. It appears there are also three holes punched into the paper â€“ two on the left side and one at the bottom, indicating it was stored in a binder or similar filing system. The text and context suggest it is a portion of an observation or a report from Project Blue Book regarding an object observed through a telescope.
