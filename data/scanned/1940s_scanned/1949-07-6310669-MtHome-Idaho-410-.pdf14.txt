1. Forwarded herewith, in compliance with your request of 27 July
1949, are seven (7) spark plugs which were taken from Aircraft Number
N5622A, a Piper "Clipper" on 25 July 1949. The eighth spark plug from
this aircraft had been thrown away and could not be located.

2. Subject aircraft had on 2 July at 1203 hours (lST) been ap-
proached within 1500 feet by seven (7) unidentified aerial objects,
according to Mr. --------- of Mountain Home, Idaho, who was flying
subject aircraft at time of incident. As soon as Mr. --------- flew his;
aircraft through the flight path of the objects, he states that his
engine began running rough. Upon landing, Mr. --------- had plane in-
spected and found that all the spark plugs from the Lycoming engine which
powers his plane, had been shorted, and that the insulation of the plugs
had been broken down. Mr. --------- states that his plane and engine are
new, and have less than 20 hours time.

3. A complete report of Mr. --------- account of the incident is presently
enroute to your office through District Headquarters, 16th District.

4. The plugs which are forwarded herewith, were removed from
aircraft about 1600 hours (lST) 21 July 1949, and were thrown into a
trash can where they remained until 1630 hours (lST) 25 July 1949. From
1630 hours, 25 July 1949, subject plugs were kept in the container in
which they are herewith forwarded.
