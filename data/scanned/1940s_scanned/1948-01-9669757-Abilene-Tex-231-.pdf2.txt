The image does not contain a photograph, but it features a document with text. I will now transcribe the text as if I were an OCR system:

Incident #231 -- Abilene, Texas -- 1 January 1948

This incident has no astronomical explanation.

The fan-shaped glow that extended momentarily from the
horizon to the zenith suggests a maze-made disturbance -- electrical
or explosive. The green color is the only characteristic that
might connect this incident with the "new Mexico green fireballs",
the rest of the description does not.
