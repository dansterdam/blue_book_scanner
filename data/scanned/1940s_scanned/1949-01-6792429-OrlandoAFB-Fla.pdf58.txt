Project No. 10073 - NY 1949, # 6792429
HEAOQUARTERS A, Y, D, S.

1949 JAN. 1-4+ FIREBALL
A.M/S No. 2351

On this date at 5:30 p.m. E.S.T., a fireball was observed by 7 persons who reported, one living in New York, one in New Jersey, and 5 in Pennsylvania. Two gave complete reports, one fairly complete, two stated house or reference point, one was quite incomplete. Thanks mainly to R. A. Hill, then at Princeton Univ. Co., Pa., who saw the object fall vertically, a fair solution was obtained. The object seems to have begun over Wabashie indy and its terminus was near G, W. New Bethlehem, Pa. N.W. corner of Coudersport figree did not have a long enduring train and its duration was 42 sec. (one observer). Two until data follow; no orbit is computed due to uncertainty in sightings of the finder.
