Class                                      Number of        Approximate
                                           Incidents        Percentage

1. Astronomical
   a. High probability                           42               18
   b. Fair or low probability                    33               14
                                              Total             75               32

2. Non-astronomical but suggestive
   of other explanations
   a. Balloons or ordinary aircraft              43               20
   b. Rockets, flares, or
      falling bodies                             23               10
   c. Miscellaneous (reflections,
      auroral streamers, birds, etc.)            18                5
                                              Total             84               35

3. Non-astronomical, with no evident
   explanation
   a. Lack of evidence precludes
      explanation                               50               13
   b. Evidence offered suggests no
      explanation                                43               20
                                              Total             93               35

According to these findings, 78, or almost one-third, of the 237 incidents yet remain without an appropriate hypothesis for explanation. It is likely, of course, that with additional evidence a number of those included in class 3a would be easily explained (some of them, probably, astronomically). There are, however, at least 40 incidents in which the evidence, if correct as given, does not fit any simple explanation, and a number of these were reported by presumably well-qualified observers.
