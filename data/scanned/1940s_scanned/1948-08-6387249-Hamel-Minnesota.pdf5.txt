SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

Gentlemen:

Accompanying this letter is a small sample of soil. The soil was taken from a depression reported to have been caused by a "flying saucer" described as being approximately two feet in diameter and one foot thick which reportedly settled gently to the ground, resounded to a height of about twenty feet and then continued on its journey. Although the density was immediately covered by a large rainfall a heavy rain subsequently filled the depression about one/half full of water before any sample of dirt could be taken.

In an effort to approach this incident objectively to determine every possible clue, it has been deemed advisable to have this soil sample analyzed and tested. In inquiry, your Dayton representative stated that the FBI Laboratory would accomplish the required tests.

It is the desire of this headquarters to ascertain, in particular, if there are traces of unusual elements or alloys adhering to the surface of the particles, or if any abnormality in structure exists showing that the soil was subjected to intense heat, gases or radioactive substances, etc. Unfortunately, in this regard, no one thought to forward a sample of the soil surrounding the depression so no comparison of soils can be made at this time. Should the subsequent tests show anything unusual some arrangement along this to obtaining some of the surrounding soil so that a comparative analysis could be made. The accompanying sample has not been tested by any other agency, nor will it be.
