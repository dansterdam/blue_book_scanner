Both observations were made with object approximately 8 to 11 miles distant

turning to final course of approximately 270° but were mainly in an inverted
V with sides at a 30° angle. Object was observed thru 7 x 50 binoculars.

2,000 feet with occasional rapid losses of altitude of approximately 4,000
feet; resulting in an overall climb till lost to view at an altitude of the
order of 40,000 feet.
