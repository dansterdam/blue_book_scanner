Companion To Flying Saucer, "Monster Bird"

BY PAUL DIX

ST. LOUIS, April 10—(UP) — A retired Airforce colonel said a 14-year-old boy "swiped" the bird shown the picture by the Dayton Herald made as a goof on the "flying saucer bird."

The boy wasn't identified by name or area by the picture, said.

K. L. W. Sigmund, former superintendent of the air base at Kearns, Utah, said he observed the creature at about 11:20 a. m. last Sunday while horseback riding four miles north of Alton, Ill.

James Trares, 12, said he saw the bird flying over his home in suburban Clayton, Mo., about three months ago. Both Sigmund and the boy said they were apprehensive of telling anyone about it until they read the United Press dispatch from Belvidere yesterday.

THE BELVIDERE report quoted Robert Price and Verly Babb as saying the bird was "bigger than an airplane" and flapped its wings.

Sigmund now sales manager for the Western Cartridge Co., at Alton, said he didn't see any flapping of wings but he was sure it was a huge fowl and not a type of aircraft.

Sigmund was riding with a companion, Col. Ralph Jackson, head of Western Military Academy, at the time. Jackson, however, was talking to a farmer and didn't see it. Sigmund said, "and I didn't mention it to him because it looked too incredible."
