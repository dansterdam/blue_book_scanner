STATEMENT OF:

On September 23, 1948 at approximately 0930 hours, while on East Marcy Street down town Santa Fe, New Mexico. I discovered an oblong bright object fly-
ing at a high speed (estimated between seven (7) and eight (8) hundred miles an hour, at thirty (30) thousand feet or seven This object gave a blinding glare to the rear and was traveling from North East to South West. I did not hear any sound but discovered this object while looking up at K.T.N.C. radio tower. At first glance I thought this object was an insulator on one of the wires, but when I discovered it was moving an effort was made to detect sound and to establish height and direction of course.
