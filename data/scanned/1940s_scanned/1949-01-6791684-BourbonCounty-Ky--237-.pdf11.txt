PHONE 6

7 JAN 1949

At approximately four thirty (4:30) P.M. on January 15, 1949, my
attention was called to a Vapor trail. It was climbing at
approximately 35-30,000 feet over a formation of Cirrus clouds and
moving in a south east direction. Its position was at an angle of
about 50 degrees to the horizon when first observed. Due to the
altitude of said formation, its source was not visible from the ground.

UNCL^SIFIED
