The quality of the text at the bottom is relatively low, leading to uncertain transcription in some areas. The date "27 Jan 49" indicates the document is from the year 1949. The handwritten note at the bottom right corner appears to read "Unidentified," possibly relating to the classification of the UFO incident described in the report.
