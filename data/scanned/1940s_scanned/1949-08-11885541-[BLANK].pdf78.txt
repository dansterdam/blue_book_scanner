Incident #165 -- Los Alamos, California -- 30 August 1948

The observer of this incident states that the object looked
like a rocket much larger than a B-29. He does not give too dis-
tinct, but estimates the altitude as well over 20,000 feet. At this
estimated distance, it appears to this investigator that something to 
a rocket must have been horribly subjective.

Although a rocket cannot be ruled out, it is also possible
that the object seen was a bright meteor. If the time of observation
given is correct, it was late twilight. It seems that a bright meteor
appearing at this time would give the general impression of a rocket
leaving a trail.

The report states that the object was observed through a field
glass taken from a German 88 mm. artillery piece used that each lens was 3" in diameter. (This is an improbably large size for a field glass.)
If the object constantly filled the lens at this given altitude, either
it was of a truly tremendous size or the glass was out of focus. Fur-
thermore, the telet_Air and summary states that the object was travelling from west to east (another report says from north to south); If it
had been a rocket heading east, this heading would probably have been
reported.

All in all, the evidence supports the conclusion that the
object was more likely a bright meteor than a huge rocket.
