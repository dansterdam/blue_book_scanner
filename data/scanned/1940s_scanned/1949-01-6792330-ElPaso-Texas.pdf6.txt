the vicinity of Lamesa, Texas, for physical evidence was negative. A 
report from a ten year old boy in Amherst, Texas, reporting a sound ac-

DETAILS:

1. A telephone call from Mr. CHARLES NAVELJOER, Administrative 
Supervisor, 10 #117, Kirtland AFB, Kirtland Field, New Mexico, on the 
morning of 31 January 1949, instructed this office to ascertain the azi-
muth, elevation, and direction of a peculiar light observed near Walker 
AFB at 1755 hours, 30 January 1949, by Sgt EDWARD P. McCRARY. 

2. This is a joint report of Special Agents JACK B. WILLIAMS, 
LEWIS S. RICKERTT, and the writer.

AT WALKER AFB, ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO

H. Sgt RAYMOND D. PLATT, AF 122SL077 (MOS766); Sgt EDWARD P. 
McCRARY, AF 1916155 (MOS 552); Sgt DONALD M. McKENNA, AF 9V201050 
(MOS 561); Cpl WELLIAM L. BRYNE, AF 11Q62900 (MOS 552); and Pvt RUSSELL 
V. JOHNSON, AF 3727133 (MOS 552), A. Sq. 206 Sp. (Jackie) Jackson Heights 
AFB, Sgt DANIEL SULLIVAN, AF 11108687 (MOS 213); and JAN McDOWELL, Special 
Agent of Office of Special Investigations, Walker AFB, Roswell, New Mexi-
co, were interviewed on 31 January 1949 and the following facts obtained:
In 30 January 1949 at 1755 hours, a blue-green light resembling a flare 
was observed travelling on a horizontal line. This light came out of the 
North headed South at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet, moving slowly, 
and disappeared in the vicinity of SE Walker Air Force Base. To some 
observers, this phenomena disappeared in its entirety while other state-
ments mentioned a disappearance as a disintegration into a shower of
smaller lightened fragments such as a shower of sparks. The only sound 
accompanying this object was heard by Sgt McCRARY, who described it as 
a high pitched whining noise similar to that of a blowtorch. All of 
these observers sighted this light from a position West of it while 
facing East. 

5. Obtaining the services of an engineer's transit, the follow-
ing information was secured by making a reading from points of observa-
tion:

First observed at 52° magnetic. 
Last observed at 373° magnetic.
Elevation of 22°.
