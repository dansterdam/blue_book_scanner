A large white ball of fire was observed some four to five miles directly ahead of and slightly above the aircraft. It was observed for only a split second and was comparable to the explosion of a shell There were no streamers or "tails" observed such as usually related to a meteor or a distress signal. As the aircraft progressed the approximate position where the ball of fire was observed a single white light was seen on the water surface. However, this disappeared within a few seconds after sighting because of the setting cloud coverage. More lights were immediately observed on the water surface some 10 miles north of the plane's course. It is the opinion of the witness (Capt Barnes) that these were from a surface vessel. Some 10 minutes elapsed after these lights were observed on the water surface when an aircraft was sighted flying a reciprocal course (240Â°) at about 1000 ft below the observer's aircraft and slightly to the right of the course. Capt Barnes made numerous attempts to contact this aircraft on Channel "B" and "D", "Y" but acknowledgment of his transmission was never received.
