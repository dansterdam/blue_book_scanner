Incident #10 - Boise, Idaho, 6 July 1947

There appears to be no astronomical explanation for this incident.

One minor lead is suggested: observation was made at the time of sunset, when light conditions are changing rapidly. Disappearance of the object might have occurred simply because of the changing visibility. It is the time of day when illusory effects are most likely to occur, and it might not be out of the question that the objects actually were other aircraft.

Despite these conjectures, no logical explanation for the incident seems possible at this time.
