1. On 30 November 1949, this office received a letter from the
Los Angeles Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation which reads
as follows:

On November 24, 1949, ████ ██████ motion picture actor, tele-
phonically advised this office that on the previous afternoon he had been
playing golf at the Lakeside Country Club with ████████. CABOT over-
heard █████ talking about a magnetic radio the latter had in his poss-
ession and which he claimed had come from a flying disc which had
crashed in New Mexico. █████, who claimed to be in the oil business,
had the radio with him at the golf course. █████ described the radio 
as being about 7x2x2 inches.

█████ further advised ████ that he and an unnamed scientist 
were using the radio as a "doodle-bug" to find oil deposits in the
ground. █████ stated that several of the flying discs had recently
crashed in New Mexico, Arizona, and Maine. He also told █████ that
the discs had contained men and that he had bits of cloth at home from
the clothing of these men. In addition, █████ claimed to have pieces
of metal from the gears of the discs.

███████ told ████ that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio is making a
"hush-hush" picture which could very well concern the matter of flying
discs inasmuch as the whole story would break soon any way.

█████ states that he has ascertained through a friend at Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer that they are now making a picture called "Project No.
█-██" (the actual number not known). █████ said he was unable to
Find out what this picture is about.
