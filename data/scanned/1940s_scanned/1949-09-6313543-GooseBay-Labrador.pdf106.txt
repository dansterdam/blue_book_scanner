9. The Honolulu Police Department advised on 1 October 1949, that during the
afternoon and early evening hours of 30 September 1949, no report had been received
by them of any unidentified flying object.

10. 1st Lt NORMAN H. STEVENS, AO 821899 and Cpl JAMES R. OLSON, AF 131 176 125,
Operations Officer and Operations Clark, respectively, 1500th Air Base Group, Hickam
Air Force Base, advised, on 2 October 1949, that there was little flying craft
activity in the vicinity of Hickam Air Force Base at about 1700 hours. Flights during
the day usually land at about 1650 hours while at about 1750 hours pilots not being
before 1300 hours. Banshee jets of the 199th Escort Squadron (ANG), which normally
bounce from Barbers Sands, Hawaii, T. H., which landed at 1714 hours. An R4D (C-47)
assigned to VJ1 Squadron 352 (USNDb) (Unreadable) from Barbers Point, Oahu, landed at
1725 hours. Two F-47 Aircraft of the Hawaiian National Guard landed at 1658 hours.
No traffic were reported. All aircraft described as above believed to have been well
under 6,000 feet while in flight and were readily identifiable as such.

11. Lt. William A. TENQUOOD, Meterological Aide, US Weather Bureau, Honolulu
Airport Station reported: on 2 October 1949, that he released a white colored radio-
sonde balloon at 1636 hours, local time, 30 September 1949, and that it followed the
flight of this balloon by means of a theodolite. According to TENQUOOD, this balloon
traveled in the general northerly and described by lts WOLFF and MARTIN at about
the times reported. TENQUOOD curve recoil of Mr. WOLF was as to general description
of the balloon; that these balloons expand while rising, and that they can be
observed with the naked eye up to 45,000 feet, if followed closely and atmospheric
conditions are favorable. It was TENQUOOD's opinion that atmospheric conditions
were favorable during the afternoon of 30 September. TENQUOOD also reported that
the balloons used by the local Weather Station are in three (3) colors - white, for
use on clear days, black for use on cloudy days, yellow for use in haze - and that
the white balloon had been selected on 30 September because of its properties in
reflecting sunlight. TENQUOOD advised that while "tracking" this balloon, he
observed it to shift to and fro due to wind action, but did not observe it to spin,
nor did he observe any contradiction which would account for any sort of axis or
haust. TENQUOOD did offer the observation that perhaps eye strain and optical-
illusion could account for such report, recalling that parlor game of gazing steadily
at a spot, shifting the eyes and the spot retained would seem to move.

12. Major GEORGE H. ARMSTRONG, JR, 752A1, Commanding Officer, 64th Aircraft 
Control and Warning Squadron, APO 953, advised on 4 October 1949, that the only
radar station operating at about 1700 hours, 30 September 1949, on the island of 
Oahu, was the radar station at Kaaikul, located on the opposite side of the island.
