NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

AT MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA

On 3 May 1949, [Redacted], Morgantown, W. Va., was interviewed and stated in substa+ce that at approximately 2100 to 2130 hours on 15 March 1949, he was in his back yard looking at the sky checking weather conditions as was his nightly habit. He was standing approximately half way between his garage and the rear door of his house looking toward the north, when he observed a single round flat object resembling the cover of a garbage can or a barrel top northeast of Morgantown and moving across the sky toward Fairmont, W. Va. at a terrific speed. The object appeared to be approximately 15 inches in diameter at an estimated distance of about 20 miles and an angle of 45° above the horizon. It was yellowish in color, comparable to the color of the moon. The object’s trail was from northeast to southwest and was in sight for two or three seconds before it disappeared into the distance. The object sounded like a sky rocket reaching the peak of a climb and expending its power. There was no odor discernible. It left a yellowish, tapering trail estimated to be 20 to 30 feet long or about the length of a telephone pole. This trail was comparable to the flame of improperly combusting gas. The object glowed as though its body was covered with a yellowish flame. There were no projections and the object main­tained straight and level flight with its flat surface on a horizontal plane. There were no clouds and the sky was clear with the stars and moon discernible.

For second sighting see Incident 350.
