WHAT IT DID: ALT:

The object first appeared high in the sky to the southwest;
apparently headed southwest. It then dived steeply, turning
toward the West, then leveled off and climbed to its original
height. This diving and climbing was repeated two or three
times. There was no change in the ratio between the length and
width during these maneuvers. At the top of one of the climbs,
the object appeared to head back toward the east; there was a
bright glitter of white light at the head of the object as it
leveled off." Then it dived and turned back to the west.
