No sketch of the object is enclosed because all observers agreed the shape of the object was perfectly round and no details were visible due to the distance of the object from the observers. From personal and official contacts, the investigator believe all three observers are reputable and competent. A check of the local OSI detachment revealed nothing derogatory as regards any of the observers.
