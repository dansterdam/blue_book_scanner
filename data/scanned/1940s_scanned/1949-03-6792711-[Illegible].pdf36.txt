NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
Eight moving "lights" appeared in the atmosphere over or in the vicinity of the "R" area, AFSWP, Camp Hood, Texas, on the evening of 17 March 1949. At the time of these sightings, the alert guard of the 2nd Armored Division, under the Assistant AC of S, G-2 of Camp Hood, was in the area concerned and prepared to fire flares and record instrument readings of elevation and azimuth. The purpose was to check the powers of observation of observers who had previously reported the phenomena observ on 6-7 March 1949 and heretofore reported in Summary of Information, this headquarters, dated 17 March 1949, subject "Unusual Lights." However, before this attention could be begun, the series of 8 unusual "lights" appeared.

Coordinates of lights and time of sightings follow:

Coordinates                         Time
1.   910.40 - 855.11h               1952
2.   910.39 - 860.13                1956
3.   910.42 - 860.11                1956
4.   910.38 - 860.15                2000
5.   910.32 - 855.20                2020
6.   910.30 - 855.17                2010
7.   910.36 - 855.06                2020
8.   910.37 - 855.35                2152

Coordinates were based on dual sightings of each light by sights on tanks or observers. Time was clocked at instant of sighting. Captain McCullough, the Assistant G-2, personally observed three of the lights. Physical characteristics of the "lights" were recorded as "quite different" from those reported on 6-7 March 1949. No bursts nor smoke was visible. No vessels in the vicinity, no other plane-like objects in sight (at an altitude too vary pistol flares). While this phenomena was occurring, 3 security detachments from the "R" area arrived in the vicinity of the crew from the 2nd Armored Division.
