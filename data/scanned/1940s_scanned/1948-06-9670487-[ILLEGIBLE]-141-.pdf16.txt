I may be able to give more details if wanted. I know about the navy
large plastic balloons for weather or cosmic ray observations. It could not have
been one.

I am a chemical engineer and have been an amateur astronomer for years,
so please don't take this as a crackpot's story. I'm in dead earnest and will
swear to these statements.

Very sincerely yours,
