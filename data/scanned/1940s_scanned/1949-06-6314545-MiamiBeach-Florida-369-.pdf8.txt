NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

(continued)

of these.

I have seen falling stars scores of times before, saw several in the sky at the same time, but never saw any behave such as these or last as long as they did. It might be altogether possible for falling star fragments following the same path to repel and attract each other such as these did, but if they do, I never heard of it. I hope that is the explanation of what we saw because I still don't want to believe in the so called "flying discs"!
