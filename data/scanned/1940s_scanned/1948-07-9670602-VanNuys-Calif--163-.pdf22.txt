easily discerned through the outer envelope against the bright 
background of the sky. After sunset the object then appeared 
like a brilliant white star in the western sky, which might be
than the planet Venus, It was very conspicuous owing to the 
fact that it was still illuminated by the sun's rays while the 
valley below was in shadow.

11. Maneuverability if any. During the time we observed the object 
it moved steadily westward without any sudden change in direction.

12. Approximate Altitude. At least 10,000 feet above San Ilson 
which would make its altitude above sea level 15,000 feet. I 
told the reporter who called me from the L.A. Times that it was 
only about 2000 feet overhead but later realized that that was 
much too low.

13. Sound if any. No sound.

14. Exhaust Trails. No exhaust trails detected. They should have 
been readily visible through the six-inch telescope.

15. Odor. None.

16. Apparent size - Moving or Other Formation. Approximately pencil size, 
The sky was exceptionally clean around the object all during 
our obseruations.

17. Flight formation. Steadily westward.
