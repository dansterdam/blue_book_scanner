The image you provided does not contain a photograph; it is a scanned page of a document. The text in the document is not fully clear due to the quality of the scan, but I will reproduce as much of the text as possible:

The specific information such as dates and numbers are not legible in this image, and it appears that some stamp or official marking is present toward the bottom of the page, which includes a date and possibly some sort of classification or cataloging detail. However, due to the low resolution and quality of the scan, much of the stamped content is also indiscernible.
