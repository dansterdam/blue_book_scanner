Jackson, Mississippi
January 6, 1949

Commanding General AMC
Wright-Patterson AAB
Dayton, Ohio

Attention: MCIAAX O-3

Gentlemen:

This letter is in reply to a request from the Base Commander, Jackson Army Air Base, Jackson, Miss., on a strange object sighted by my wife on 1 January 1949.

Mrs. and Mrs. [redacted] my wife, and I were flying from [redacted] to North Jackson Airpark and were approaching the airport and our altitude was about 1,000 feet when I saw something go in front of us. I assumed that it was another plane since it was headed toward the municipal airport in Jackson and was on the eastern leg of the airways.

I watched the object to try to recognize the type of plane. After it passed, it made a turn of about 50 degrees and headed southwest. The time was 17:00 as we had just made a comment on the time and I had checked our ground speed. As the object made its turn, it was then that I noticed the object didn't have wings. At that time, my wife saw the object and became excited. She is a private pilot and is familiar with plane identification from the air.

The sun had not set and the weather was clear to the southwest as the object went away from us. When it crossed in front of us, I estimated its speed to be about 200 mph and about 500 feet in front of us. After the turn, it was as close as 1,200 feet from us. We tried to point out the object to the pilot, but he thought we were trying to show him something else.

As the object turned and went to the southwest, with a sudden burst of speed, it was out of sight. In all, I saw the object 10 or 12 seconds.
