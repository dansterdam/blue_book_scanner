these quantities were 390 40' and -90. According to Figeroa, the azimuth of
the sound heard at 2050 was 390 40' and the elevation 490 30'; according to
******, these quantities were 1010 45' and 1140 30'.

3. At Station 390 a statement was obtained from Army Inspector ******, also
heard the continuous sounds, but Inspector ****** was not available for inter-
rogation on January 5). According to Inspector ******  none of the sounds ob-
served at station 540 as 2010, 2020, and 2050 were heard at Station 390, but
some 10 to 15 minutes after the hoovering act at 2050, both he and ****** heard what first sounded like the straining noise of heavy engines on a roadway and
which later sounded like a whistle rising rapidly to great sharpness and very loud in
flight. The duration of the sounds as determined by stop-watch measurement
of aircraft acting in or in association, according to the continuous burst,
and irregular gusting, was 45-63 rpm. Furthermore, ****** reported that he
was lead to the sounds probably for a minute or more after he went outdoors
the second time. According the places, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2100-
2105 was 420 00' and the elevation 450 15'.

4. At Station 530 statements were obtained from four inspectors, all approxi-
mately 240 feet apart in a North-South line pointing directly at ******. 
no real or necessary tie to the incident was present, which he believed
by the noise heard at 140 ft. out. The duration of his first observation
of the motor noise if it really was a noise at this time-being only about 2-3 seconds
in length. (So definite was the impression the observed noises originated
in an airplane flying over the field that ***** to complete blackout was
executed both during the first observation, and the second in the hope that
the lights on the alleged would be observable. However, no visual contact
whatever was established with the source of the noise.) At approximately
2045 a third observation of the same noises was made and according to the
impression that an airplane was going into a nose dive as he was
warning was transmitted to all stations. It is by understanding or both
****** and ****** that the information stated to the inspector's was
responsible for issuance of the bogey warning. The duration of the third
sound was estimated to have been approximately 2-3 minutes. Inspector ****** confirmed all of the statements made by Inspector ****** with this qualification: that ****** first interpretation of the noises reported at 2010 was that it came from a jet tank cruising on the high road into Station 530
(225 s.f). The noise grew out or other ... Coming ... the above on
(225 s.f.), more of a bank and the flight (76 l.p.m.-144 l.p.m.) motor or
Club type planes had been the subject of discussion between Inspectors ****** 
****** until they had rejected the flying by intuition, since the
motor Club would be laboring heavily in the high altitude where the
noises on the night of December 20 to be believed to have taken place.
Inspector ****** the azimuth of the sound heard at 2010 was 390 20'
****** the duration of the noises heard on December 30 and January 5
except 390 2' and the elevation 250 30'. Inspector ****** used and
time on the tape of a transit, it being felt that was able to achieve
accurate azimuth determinations. Since it would not have been possible to
have set up the transit in the positions occupied by ****** ****** at the
time he observed the sounds on December 30, no azimuth-elevation reading
******
