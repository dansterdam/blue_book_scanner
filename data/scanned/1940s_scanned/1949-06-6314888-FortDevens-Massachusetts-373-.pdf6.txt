    a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size
       of target;

    b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (190Â°), etc.,
       and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observ-
       able, how long did the target stay in the turn and what was
       its speed?

    c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into
       several targets upon approach:

    d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consis-
       tent with size of object; faint; fading, pulsating at regu-
       lar rate:

    e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted
