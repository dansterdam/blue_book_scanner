Elko, Nevada
13 May, 1949

At approximately 1015 Pacific Standard Time on 2 May 1949, I was watering an
my car located in front of my house on ranch property, Elko county, Elko, Nevada, glanced
at the sky north of Elko a rid noticed some objects in the sky proceeding in a south westerly direction. The objects were approximately 1/4 of an
inch across to my naked eye were roughly circular in shape and seemed to be
made of metal with the appearance of oxidized aluminum. I assumed my contact
with aircraft at the Elko airport, I judged the objects to be flying above 5
miles from town at an altitude of 14000 Feet. On this basis they would be
approximately 50 feet in diameter and traveling at a speed of 270 or 300 miles per
hour. I could see no exhausts of exhaust, or vapor trails and heard no sound
and there were no extensions or projections on the objects. I entered my home
and returned with a pair of binoculars, but before I could use them (the
binoculars), the three objects seemed to veer to the more southerly direction,
all three tilted at an angle, in what seemed a precise movement and disappeared
from my sight. The speed of the objects seemed to increase as they started to
veer and upon tilting they seemed extremely thin and flat. I was unable to
gain location the objects with either the binoculars or my unaided eye as the objects 
were well up into vision for approximately two minutes and were gone in the seconds
I immediately notified my superior at the Civil Aeronautics Administration, Elko,
Nevada, by telephone.

I have read the foregoing statement and it is true to the best of my
knowledge and recollection.
