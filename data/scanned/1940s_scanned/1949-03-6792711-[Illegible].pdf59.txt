The document you've provided is a blurred, scanned image of an old report and does not contain any clear photographs or visually discernible images other than text. Due to the poor quality and significant blurring of the text, it's not possible to accurately perform optical character recognition (OCR) and produce reliable output text from this document. The clarity is insufficient to make out the details necessary for transcription. If you have a clearer image or need information about Project Blue Book, please provide that, and I would be happy to assist you with any questions you may have.
