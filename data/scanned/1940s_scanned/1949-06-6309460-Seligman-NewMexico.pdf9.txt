U. S. WEATHER BUREAU OF ANNOUNCEMENT OF SCIENTIFIC ATTACHE

White Sands Proving Grounds, ..., New Mex-

“Flying saucers” seen in Britain throughout France, Italy, ‘Belgium,..., 
and Egypt by hundreds of observers in 1947, continue to cause speculation
in the press.

Military authorities deny that any such apparatus was built or could be built
and suggest either mass hypnotism or a very real, 
albeit laugh-off-able, scientific fact.

As all Americans, it puzzled me to a great extent after reading 
an article "Saucers don’t laugh it off" by ..., who from 1940 to 1945, was
with the British R.A.F. in scientific work, and trying to do a quite 
reticulated evaluation of the elements that might figure in the controversy.

Regardless of conjecture - That fact remains - the mysterious “saucer” was
particularly well demonstrated during my twelve months tenure at the command
of White Sands Proving Ground in technical and scientific evaluation 
group in the Spring of 194..., traveling at a speed approx. of 
three to four miles a second!

One afternoon last May, for instance, a highly polished, pear shaped object
approximately thirty feet across and fifty feet in overall length, and traveling
about twelve miles high calculated an engineer after having been followed
by a photo theodolite atop a mountain top for 60 seconds until it was over 
the general area of Alamogordo and vanished as suddenly as it appeared! 
Three to four miles a second!

Air observers at first thought they saw a conventional fighter aircraft
but on examining their street pictures of the apparatus with an unbiased "eye"
discovered the mystery ship to be a saucer shaped and manned by at least
3 occupants..., traveling up to 12 and 15 miles in altitude and converted
“sunbeam” for a propulsion element.

Contained..., short - line all-azimuth technical projected saucer; object
that 25 times assumed a nose end was traveling at a course of a "V-2 test,
located in a 20-power elevation telescope, an instrument that can follow
a missile to altitudes of 100 miles or more.

It isn’t known what it was, but I had never seen anything like it before,"
he told me. “It seemed to be metallic, but I couldn't tell its size, its
speed or its altitude. It would be impossible unless you knew one of the
three factors."

He added he had informed his superiors of the incident and was told the 
next morning he had seen a "disk".

“Another Balloon? - A check of one officer elicited the response: “It was
probably a weather balloon," but one informed the enlisted technician is 
considered "highly" UNCLASSIFIED
