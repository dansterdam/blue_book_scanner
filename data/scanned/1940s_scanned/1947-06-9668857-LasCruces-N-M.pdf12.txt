---

Mr. [redacted] who was driving the car noticed the object first. He called
it to the attention of the other occupants, Mr. [redacted] thereupon opened
the window nearest him and observed the object moving at an unknown
rapid velocity at an unknown altitude (which he estimated at 10,000 ft)
and which Mr. [redacted] thought was between 8,000 and 10,000 feet.
When first sighted the object was to their right and forward of the
automobile at an estimated elevation and apparently moving horizontally
in a northerly direction such as to cross the highway from right to left.
The object was seen by all the occupants of the machine. Mr. [redacted]
could observe no details other than the shape was uniform with no proturberance[protruberance]
such as the wings of a plane. It was too distant to enable stereoscopic
visualization. There was some solar specular reflection which seemed
to change in intensity as the object receded until lost from sight
(after an estimated 30 seconds from the time first noticed.) Mr. [redacted]
could not explain how it disappeared except that he thought the reflection
angle could have changed abruptly. The sun was to the rear of the automobile.
Mr. [redacted] thought at one time he saw vapor trails.
