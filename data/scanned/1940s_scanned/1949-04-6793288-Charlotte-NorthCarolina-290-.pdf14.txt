NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Left the stadium after the show at approximately 2230. When he had walked several blocks from the stadium in a northerly direction on his way home he stopped and observed the sky to see if the object was still visible but could not locate it. The object did not move in any direction during all of the period that he observed it and he did not see it appear or disappear. Mr.____remarked that this is above observation impressed him as being about half the diameter and length of his "little finger" when observed at arms length and that he was of the opinion that it was possibly 20,000 feet in height but that it may be been only several thousand feet high as it was very difficult to estimate heights. He stated that for an amateur aeroplane pilot, that is required a student license and flew his plane over a period of several years during the past few years. He was not flown for approximately the last year and although he has logged approximately 75 hours flying time he never received a Private Pilots License. He was wearing his regular eye glasses at the time the above observation was made and stated that viewing this object "upset" him as he has never been able to decide what it was. After he showed this object to Mr.____ he remarked to Mr.____ that it was probably a mistake to have told him about it as, according to Mr._____, Mr.____ is well known in local flying circles as an avid "flying saucer" advocate, going to extremes to obtain publicity, ____ till did not remain at the stadium but a few minutes after the object was pointed out to him and Mr._____, who assumes the position of the Charlotte Observer to report the incident; as Mr. Dixon, reporter for the above paper, telephoned him at his home later in the evening to verify information given him by Mr._____. He estimated that the object was pointed out to____ approximately at 2130 and that he had observed it for less time than the time before leaving. He delivered a number of other persons standing near him in the stadium observed the object but that he does not know the identity of any of them except as mentioned above. He has never studied the heavens mystified by the above object and has never observed anything like it before. (End)
