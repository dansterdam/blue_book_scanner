Incident #6 -- Rehoboth Beach, Delaware -- September 1947
October 1947
Blue 1477

This incident contains nothing astronomical.

It is entirely possible that the objects observed on
these three separate dates were "Skyhook seene," far-go missiles,
us fired from fort miles by the Applied Physics Laboratory of
Johns Hopkins University. Since the hour of observation of the
various sightings (and the exact day of the first two) is not
given in material submitted to this investigator, positive iden-
tification cannot be made; but if those facts are known, inquiry
at the above-mentioned laboratory (address: 8621 Georgia
Avenue, Silver Spring, Maryland) might bring forth definite iden-
tification.
