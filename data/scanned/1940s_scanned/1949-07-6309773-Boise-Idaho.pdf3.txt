DETAILS:

AT FAIRFAX, CALIFORNIA

On 25 August 1949, *** and *** were interviewed regarding the unidentified aerial object reported to have been sighted by them,

*** and his wife stated that while they were at one of the highest points on Skyline Boulevard about six (6) or seven (7) miles northwest of Boise, Idaho, on 5 July 1949, before sundown and while the sun was still visible but at about its lowest point before ending, from sight, their attention was drawn to an object in the sky, *** the son of ***, Boise, Idaho.

The object appeared to be circular and about the size of the bottom of a 55 gallon oil drum. The object was an undeterminable distance away from their vantage point, *** estimated *** most probably travelling at about 400,000 ft. and at 1500 (fifteen hundred) mph. The object was at about a 30 angle from the horizontal and travelling, northeast or toward their position and about 300 to their right as they faced northwest. When this object reached a point at about 90 from their almost direct (southwest), it suddenly appeared to gain altitude and turn slightly north to their clock, disappeared from sight. This object was in sight 1-1/2 minutes to this clock, and performed no acrobatics or maneuver other than ascent or turn and climb as mentioned. The object appeared to be constructed of a silvery metal and reflected the reflection of the sun but red or orange-colored smoke appeared to drift from one side of the object to the other. The red or orange-colored smoke disappeared from sight at the bottom rt. of the circle and reappear, but at the object did not ***. This smoke appeared to follow the lower contour line of the object half-way up the other side of the object and would then dissap. There was no vapor or smoke trail. No sound nor unusual odor could be connected with the object. There were no appendages emanating from the object, and its surface was entirely round. The only appearance of rotation was a probable rotation determined by the motion of the smoke mentioned from the object. The sky was cloudless and there was good visibility. The object appeared to have excellent stability and control.
