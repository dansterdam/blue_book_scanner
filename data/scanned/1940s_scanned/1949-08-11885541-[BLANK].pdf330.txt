Incident No. 41 - 7 July 1947, 1300-1400 hours, Lakeland, Fla.
One observer reported bearing a swishing noise and then seeing, five 
shiny objects climbing from 5000 ft to 7500 ft in fifteen to thirty 
seconds. He estimated the objects were one mile from him. The lead 
object was of plastic appearance and appeared to be towing the other 
four. The reporter made a model and exhibited it to an exhibit. The 
model is roughly two feet in diameter, domed top and bottom and with an 
opening in the rear on either side of a vertical fin. Police records 
list the man as having been AWOL from the Navy on two occasions. A 
neighborhood employment check disclosed he is an excitable person, 
very talkative and nosey, in an ex-aggravating manner, and inclined to 
impress people with his continuous verbal chatter.

AMC Opinion: This incident has all the aspects of a psychopath-
ological report.
