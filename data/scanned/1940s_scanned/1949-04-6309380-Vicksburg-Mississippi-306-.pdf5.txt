When a difference in the angle between the theodolite and supposed balloon
became apparent, one person observing with the naked eye took over the theodolite
and found the true balloon still there. The balloon was then abandoned and
the other object picked up just after it came out of the sun. The object was
moving too fast to crank the theodolite around, therefore one of the observers 
pointed the theodolite while another looked through it. The object appeared
to be ellipsoidal about 2&1 slenderness ratio, length about 0.02 subtended xxxx
angle, and white in color, except for a light yellow on one side as if it
were in shadow. A hard focus on the object was not obtained at any time
due to the speed at which the angles changed. Therefore, no good detail
was seen. The azimuth angle continued to decrease as the object continued 
on a north heading, growing smaller in size. At around 20-25° azimuth, the
azimuth held constant and the elevation angle began increasing from the
25° minimum to about 29°. The object then apparently disappeared due to distance
after a total observation time of about 60 seconds.
One observer, *******, by assuming that the object
was traveling at escape velocity of 2500 ft per second, calculated that
the object was at an elevation of some 300000 ft (about 58 miles).
