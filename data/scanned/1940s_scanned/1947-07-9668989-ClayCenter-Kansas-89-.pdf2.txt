Incident #789 — 100 mi. W of Kansas City, Missouri — 6 July 1947

There is no direct astronomical explanation for this
incident.

The striking feature of the incident is that the "very
bright" object travelled in the same direction and at the same
speed as the observer did, and that it appeared at 11 o'clock
position at his left, or approximately opposite to the position
of the sun at this time.

It cannot be proved, of course, but it is probable
that the witness saw a direct reflection of the sun on some con-
tinuous object -- thin clouds, ice crystals, or the like. (Had
the object appeared on his right, then this explanation would be
untenable.) Its disappearance can be explained logically also,
for turning altered the observer's angular relationship to the
reflector.

It is further noted that an apparent inconsistency
exists in the report. The observer first stated that the object
appeared to be the top of a water tank "low and to his left",
after checking his position he stated that the object was at 11,000
feet. This inconsistency in altitude throws some suspicion on the
observations. If the object was low, then a running explanation along
a river or railroad track would be a promising explanation.
