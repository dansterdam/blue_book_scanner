2. The Best Photo of the Only Green Fireball. So Far Observed at Two
Separate Stations. Among the numerous observations so far made, there is
only one pair of corresponding observations, i.e., those made simultaneously
by different groups of observers at widely separated stations. The only
such observations are those obtained on the night of December 12 by one
group of observers near Hanover Peak (Jornal), New Mexico - see separate
radiation of 1948, December 12, 9h 2m p.m. or mms 30s), and a second
pair of observers stationed within the Los Alamos reservation. By graphic
reconstruction of the trajectories of observations, the following estimates
both observers seem generally reliable: December 12, 21h 02m or mms
30s appeared very near a point with the coordinates latitude 35° 50', longi-
tude 106° 00' and disappeared near a point with the coordinates latitude
