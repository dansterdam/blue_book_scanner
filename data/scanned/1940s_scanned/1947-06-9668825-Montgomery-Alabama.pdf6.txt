SUBJECT: Report of Unusual Celestial Phenomenon.

TO: Assistant Chief of Staff, A-2

rence observed by the staff of the Personnel at Maxwell Field, Montgomery,
Ala. on the night of 23 June 1947:

CAPT. ____ ____ _____ ____ ____ _____ ____
CAPT. ____ ____ ____ _____ _____ ____ ____ ____ _____ TAC
1ST LT. ____ ____ ____
CAPT. ____ Randolph Field, Texas

2. At approximately 2120 Central time, a light, with a brilliance
slightly greater than a star, approached from the West. It was first noted
above the horizon of a clear moon-light night, traveling in an easterly
direction at a high rate of speed. There was no audible sound and it was
impossible to determine the altitude, except that it appeared to be at
great height. It traveled in a straight course with frequent bursts of
speed, much like a water but it is directly overhead across the surface of 
water. It continued traveling in the above manner and changed course 90Â°
to the south, and while it was directly overhead for approximately five
(5) minutes, it turned southwest and was lost in the brilliancy of the moon.
at 2145 Central it was no longer possible to observe it.

3. A call was placed to Maxwell Field operations reference this
phenomena and inquiry made if any experimental aircraft were scheduled for
a flight in the vicinity. The reply was negative.

4. No plausible explanation is offered for this unusual motion of this
source of light, which acted contrary to any known aerodynamical laws.
This report is submitted upon request, in view of the many recent reports
reference unusual aerial objects observed throughout the U. S.

5. Two of the above noted observers are rated pilots and the other two
are air intelligence officers, All observers may still be sure.
