In the sun. A definite, regular oscillation was observed and
was timed at the rate of 48 oscillations per minute. He
described this motion as a skulling or falling leaf motion
rather than a movement through the axis of the disc.

The wind was at all times observed to be from the south-
west at a definite angle to the line of flight of the disc.
This direction was confirmed by a constantly rising column of
smoke from an industrial plant and by smoke from smything
at 10,000 feet. Reported ceiling and visibility un-
limited at all times with wisps of cirrus clouds in a small
fractional portion of the sky. He described the object as
the size of the head of a pin held at arm's length. It was
metallic in color and cast a reflection upon the ocular.
He stated it was definitely circular rather than oval or
globular in shape. He was unable to estimate its thickness.
No smoke or vapor trail was observed.

Upon the same occasion reports observing a second
disc at 1049T and a third at 1125T. He described them as
identical to the first observed. These were initially sighted
at an altitude of 45 degrees from the west at approximately
30,000 feet. They also disappeared into the sun overhead after
a three minutes' observed flight.

A local at a show was scheduled for the afternoon of this
day and there were approximately 150 people on the field at
this time. All of those present saw the objects.
is a stunt pilot of Big Bear, California, agrees with
and confirms Mr. observations.
, Washington, an aeronautical engineer and an em-
ployee of estimated altitude of these discs at
7,000 feet and felt the first one could have been a balloon.
He stated it was yellowish in color. In his opinion, how-
ever, neither of the last two observed could have been
balloons.

feels that because of his background and experience
with balloons and pilotless aircraft, he is well qualified to
determine whether these objects were conventional aircraft or
balloons of any type. He is positive they were neither.

, Longview, Washington, reports observ-
ing a disc similar to those described above in the same region
