The image shows what appears to be a dark night sky with a bright, elongated object near the center. The object has an uneven, cylindrical shape with a white or light-colored hue and seems to be emitting light, though it's not clear if the light is coming from the object itself or if it is reflecting light. There are specks of lighter dots scattered around the image, which could be artifacts, noise from the photo quality, or other less bright objects in the sky. There are two hole punches on the left side of the image, indicating that this photo was likely filed in a binder or similar filing system.
