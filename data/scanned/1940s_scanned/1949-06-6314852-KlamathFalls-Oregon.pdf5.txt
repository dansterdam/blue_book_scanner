that on 23 June 1949 at approximately 1300 hours (PST), her husband called
her on the telephone and asked her attention to some unidentified objects
in the air over Klamath Falls. She immediately went into the yard where
she observed the objects for approximately two minutes. There were four
or five objects traveling horizontally in a trail formation in a south-
easterly direction at an undetermined altitude. They appeared to be
traveling about as fast as a jet airplane. She first sighted them at 50°
above the horizon. She described the objects as being oval in shape, about
the size of a dinner plate, olive drab in color, of metallic construction,
no spinner; left no exhaust trail. They made no sound. They made no wing-
tip angle, appeared to be smooth, had no noticeable effect on the clouds,
and no visible means of propulsion. During the period of observation, she saw one
of the objects pass the one in front of it and then the group made a sharp
turn toward the east and faded from view.

6. Mrs. ****** is a housewife. She wears glasses, and appears
to be an intelligent person. However, she may have been influenced by
her husband's report of the same objects. She has a hobby of target shoot-
ing and gun collecting.
