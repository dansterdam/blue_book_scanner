Incident No. 162 -- 11 August 1948, 1200 Hours, Hamel, Minnesota.
Two children, ages ten and eight, described a dull gray object two 
feet in diameter and one foot thick, shaped like two plates together
which settled gently to the ground. It clanked when it touched down.
On the ground it emitted a whistling noise and "shot" up to twenty feet 
where it hesitated, whistled once more, "shot" up to thirty feet, then 
"shot" off in a northeast direction.

ATC Opinion: This apparent bit of fantasy is hardly worth further 
consideration.
