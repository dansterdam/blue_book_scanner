11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers attentian was drawn to eight objects by a sound like the whirl of duck wings. The eight objects appeared to be round and about 20 ft in diameter. They were not in a formation, but reminded the observer of blackbirds in a group. There was no smoke or exhaust. Estimated altitude was 800 to 1000 ft.

Reflection of the sun's light off the wet bodies of birds often gives the appearance of a very large object at a much greater distance from the observer than they actually are, especially during the periods of dusk and dawn.
