UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: Captain Shea
FROM: Inspector ------
SUBJECT: Object seen on 105 Patrol

Date: 20 December 1948

From 2050 to 2100 this date Inspector ---- and myself were 
at 27th. Engin in the regular performance of the 105 patrol.

At 2050 we saw this object described below taking a path thru the
sky. The direction of travel was from west to east, possibly a little
Southerly. The object was traveling in an almost flat trajectory and its
decline formed an angle with the horizon of approximately twenty degrees.
The angle of elevation from our point of observation was approximately forty-
five degrees. The object was moving at a very fast rate of speed and disappeared 
behind the mountain directly to the northeast of P.I.P. Statue. Total time of
visibility was about one and one-half seconds.

Description:

An intense blue-white light about the size of a basketball.
As the object traversed the sky, there was a faint trail
of light behind it, and two objects the size of a baseball
separated from the main body. Those objects were of the same
color and intensity as the main body, and trailed behind it 
directly in its path at uneven intervals of distance equal to
approximately three times the diameter of the main body. The
size of the main body was approximately one quarter the size
of the moon.
