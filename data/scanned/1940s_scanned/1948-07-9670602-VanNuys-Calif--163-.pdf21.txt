[Redacted] Page 3.

For an object 10,000 feet away that subtends an angle of 3' of
are has a diameter of 17.4 feet. If 20,000 feet away its diameter 
would be 34.8 feet; if distant 30,000 feet its diameter would
be 52.2 feet, and so on. From the general appearance of the
object I should say a diameter of about 25 feet would seem 
reasonable.

6. Color change. The outer envelope resembled a thin white membrane. 
The convex disk below was distinctly yellow without markings. e
observed no change in color.

7. Speed. When the object was first sighted at 7:00 P.M. it was 
slightly south of the monastery and high overhead, probably over
Sierra Madre. Then last seen about 8:20 PM., 1948, it was far
to the west probably near the coast about 30 miles away. This 
would mean that it had moved 30 miles in 1.5 hours making its 
speed 20 miles per hour nearly straight west.

8. Part of Sky First Observed. I would estimate that it was
directly south of the monastery at an altitude of approx. 30Â°.

9. Direction of Travel. Nearly straight west as seen from points
1 & 3.

10. Manner in which Last seen. The object was last seen about
8:30 PM., PDT, through the 5-inch telescope at the monastery
by Mr. and Mrs. [Redacted] and myself.
