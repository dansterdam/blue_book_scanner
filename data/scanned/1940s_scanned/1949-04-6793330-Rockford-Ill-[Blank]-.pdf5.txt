The image does not contain any photographs. It's a page with handwritten text. Here is the output of the handwritten text as best as I can decipher:

Circling object a stiff East
wind. It went around
again stopped, & laying in a
northeast, elongated position,
after a period fell & settled 
to Earth, and a sort of
spur of a streamer hung
down which passed over
our heads very clearly and
high.
The page got a little mussy
including section attached to
which I may refer many
other objects I may sight.

(The rest of the text is mostly obscured by a black mark and thus indecipherable.)
