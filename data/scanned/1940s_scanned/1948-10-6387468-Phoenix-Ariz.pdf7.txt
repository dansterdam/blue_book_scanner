OFFICE MEMORANDUM         UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO:     Lt. E. J. Hightower
FROM:   Insp. ██████████
SUBJECT:    Unknown Object

          At approximately 0343, this date, while looking east from Station 109
towards Station 101 I noticed high in the sky what appeared to be a falling
star, white in color, descending in a vertical path. My attention remained
with the object when I noticed its rate of descent seemed to be slower than
that of a falling star. After watching it lose altitude for several seconds,
I saw it suddenly disappear with a greenish-tinged flash which momentarily
illuminated a small cloud between the object and myself.

          The object may also have been traveling east or west to some extent
since I could not estimate that angle; however the object descended in a
perfectly straight line with reference to North and South. At the time of the
flash the object was a good distance east of Station 101 and at an estimated
altitude of six thousand feet.
                                                               /s/ ██████████
