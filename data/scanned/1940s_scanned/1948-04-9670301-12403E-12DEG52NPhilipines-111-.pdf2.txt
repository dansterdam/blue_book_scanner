Incident No. 111 = 1 April 1947, 0955 Hours, Central Philippines.
An F-47 pilot leading three other aircraft at 1500 ft saw an object
approximately three miles away at 1000 ft. Object appeared to be a
flying wing thirty by twenty feet, silver in color. The pilot turned
to intercept the object and in five seconds on nearly the same course
and disappeared from sight. The object turned on approximately a 
dorsal fin but distance was too great to note any other features. The
report does not reveal whether any of the other pilots saw the object.

A/C Opinion: No definite explanation. However, every pilot has
experienced the sensation of seeing an aircraft obliquely at nearly the
limit of vision and then losing sight at the same range when the air-
craft presented, in storm view, a smaller surface.
