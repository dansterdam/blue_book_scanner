other attempts by this crew of the hypothetically lost plane to make a 
position location in over observed. And finally, two instances nominata
(who had no knowledge of the anomalous sounds observed earlier on
the night of December 30) reported precisely the same sort of anomala-
lous sounds as heard at Station 370 at 0540 on the early morning of
December 31. The sound surges were reported over Station 540 and were
reported to have receded slowly toward the mountains.

7. If we assume that Station 340 and 350 observed the same sound
sources at 2010 and 2020, then these surges are found to project into
gorges lying near the great highway which leads up the mountains into
Colorado. On the basis of the attraction data mentioned in point 4 of
this letter instructions found in the electron source would be about 2500 feet
2800 ft elevation more. Station 340 at Zirah it sounds obvious approximately 350 
feet lower than this station. These differences in elevation would again
seem to suggest that the sound source may have been situated on or near the
great highway. However, the very careful observations made by an experienced
patrolman, Inspector [Redacted], show that the 2030, an entirely incompatible with
the assumption that the sound source heard at 2020 was only some 1500 feet
lower than Station 340. Actually, the projected 2030 observation shows that
this sound source was at an elevation of no more than 11,000 feet above the
horizontal plane through Station 340, or more than 40,000 feet above approxi-
mately 10,000 fee AGL, that is, 35,000 feet to 40,000 feet in height. These
discrepancies show that our initial assumption is untenable and it is there-
fore necessary to institute a change in our reference observations made by
at Stations 330 and 350 prior to the bogey warning, i.e., during the time
when these observers attention had not been attracted to certain direction. Their
observation but in contrast to the observers at Station 350, was made near 
observations in the open air. While these initial indications suggest that
Station 340 actually heard a sound emanating from a source located high
above them, an extended search in the conditions imposed by the open-air
observation, what they heard might well have been so distorted by the structural
integrity surrounding them or by their predisposition to assign all noises
to the usual traffic across that they would have been led to report sonic naga-
tive observations as occurred for that at Station 330 and January 5.

8. In sharp contrast to the discordance noted in the observations pre-
ceding the bogey warning at 2050, the open-air observations made at and
immediately following this warning show a quite satisfactory concordance.
In fact, if we assume that all three stations, 340, 350, and 370 were listen-
ing to the same sound source at 2050 and shortly thereafter, then the actual
elevation above sea level of this sound source was computed from the angular
plane was there any a more ultimate 11,700 feet at Station 340 and 350, and...
