Incident No. 163 -- 15 Oct. 1948, 2305 Hours, Fusanose area,  
Japan.  
Airborne radar observer in F-51 attempted six times to intercept an  
object between 5000 and 6000 ft. The object traveled 200 MPH until  
approached to within 1,200 ft., then quickly accelerated. Pilot saw  
at estimated 1200 ft. Object appeared to be 20-30 ft. long from  
silhouette to underside of object with rounded nose. General pro-  
tile shape, cut off sharply at rear.  

AMC Opinion: There is no apparent explanation. One discrepancy  
seems to be that the target was never seen by ground radar, which was  
operating and had the F-51 in sight throughout period of sighting.
