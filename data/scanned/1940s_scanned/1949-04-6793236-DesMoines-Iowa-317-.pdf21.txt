Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer (Check neighbors, police dept., FBI records, employer, etc):
This writer believes this to be a publicity stunt which didn't materialize. Subject is fairly intelligent but lacks ambition for doing anything constructive. He is approximately 65 years of age and has no outside interests or within the home. He has read numerous articles on aerial phenomena and is more or less intrigued by them. He has much time to do about nothing. He is stablishly dressed and generally unkempt. His reasoning has been easily changed to conform to this writers opinion, and would readily change his to conform to what was correct.

Did observer wear glasses, especially polaroid glasses at time of sighting, or was object viewed through canopy, window, or other trans- parent material? No glasses were used and object was observed through window pane
