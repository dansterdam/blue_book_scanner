Here is the text from the document:

I wear glasses, bifocals, I turned and shifted my head to make
sure that the phenomenon was real. I lowered the window another turn or
two. The patches remained. I was still unware that the phenomenon was
exceptional until the southern object suddenly disappeared. I then asked
the driver to stop the car, but the northern object vanished at that
moment. The northern one had been slightly brighter. At maximum
brillianoe the patches must have been of zero to first stellar magnitude.
The color was white possibly with a greenish ting. They endured for
about 4 minutes, during which time the car, travelling at 50 miles per
hour, covered at least 3 miles. During that period, I am sure that the
direction of the object did not change by more than 2°. I would prefer
to say that the change was not more than 1°. With a base line of 3 miles,
this latter figure indicates that the objects were at least 180 miles away,
that their separation in space was at least 9 miles and that the diameter
was about 3/4 of a mile.

There is a bare possibility that the patches were clouds, but
the behavlous was unusual, to say the least. The whole phenomenon is
puzzling. It may have some simple explanation, but there seems to be
no completely satisfactory theory available. I report the event for
future records.
