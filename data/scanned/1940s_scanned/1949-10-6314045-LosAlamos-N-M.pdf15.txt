Subject: AERIAL PHENOMENA

Dear Sir:

This office has been informed by [CENSORED], scientist with
Group P-9 of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, of the follow-
ing celestial phenomena observed at approximately 1950 hours,
November 5, 1949, at Los Alamos:

Two bluish-green lights (similar to that given off by
burning zinc) in tandem were seen overhead, slightly
south of the zenith. They appeared to be stationary,
but suddenly curved around and disappeared to the north
with the speed of a meteor. No sound was heard in con-
junction with this observation.

Mr. [CENSORED] said that his attention had been called to the sky by
some children who reported having seen erratically moving green
lights, and it was while he was looking, in response to their questions,
that he observed the phenomena described above.

                                Very truly yours,

                                /s/ Sidney Newburger, Jr.
                                SIDNEY NEWBURGER, Jr.
                                Chief, Security Operations
