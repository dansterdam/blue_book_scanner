SAUCER? VIEWED NEAR TILLAMOOK

TILLAMOOK, Jan. 24 (Special) - The flying saucers are back.

Mr. and Mrs. [Redacted], driving south on highway 101 at 11:05 a.m. Sunday, saw a silvery object in the sky above that at an elevation of about 2000 feet, they estimated.

[Redacted] first discovered the object about one quarter mile southeast of Pleasant Valley. She called her husband's attention to it and they watched it as they drove slowly to the store at Pleasant Valley.

There the store operator, Allen [Redacted], went with [Redacted] to observe it, but by that time it had disappeared. A check of the airport here indicated that a yellow plane was the only one in the air at the time.

[Redacted] described the object as round and silvery. She said she could not tell whether it was moving.
