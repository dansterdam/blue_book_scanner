Incident No. 151 â€“ 29 July 1948, 0955 hours, Indianapolis, In-
diana.
The observers driving a truck saw an object shaped like a broad short
propeller traveling very fast in a bank just above the tress at thirty
feet altitude. It was 20-30 feet long, two feet wide and one foot
thick, with "cups" on the upper sides of the blades. The object
tilted with no spinning action, and there was no sound or trail. The
object was thought to have fallen, but a search revealed nothing.

AC Conclusion: No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.
