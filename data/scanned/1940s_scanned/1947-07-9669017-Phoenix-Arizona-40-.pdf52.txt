Security Information. Reference TT 143 dated 10 June 52, CSAF Item No. ATIC
has no negatives of the unidentified object that were taken by Mr. __________ 
_______ in July 47. In addition, there is no information available as to whether 
or not Mr. ________ ever sent his negatives to the Air Force or whether he just 
sent prints. We do have some rather poor quality prints of this object. As 
you know, we have concluded that these photos were probably not authentic.
It seems as if Mr. ______ attempted to get on the "picture selling band wagon"
and if he can prove he sent the negatives to ATIC or to the Air Force and they
were never returned, it may lead to a touchy situation. Will you recover Mr.'s
________or do you request that we enquire? Copy requests of the prints can be
made if you so desire, however, the originals are not here.

                                                                       DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
