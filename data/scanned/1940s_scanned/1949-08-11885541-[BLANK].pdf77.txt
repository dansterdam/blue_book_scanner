Incident #165, a - C _ Charlblis, Jord(ja - 23 July 1948

The object reported in incident #165 and #166 (which presumably refer to the same thing) was, by easily, explained as having been a very bright meteor. The majority of observers a_^7^5 that the object did not ^-^^nouvers, was on a steady course, and lost altitude slowly.

Numerous other reports (included with incident #165), from the vicinity of c^n^justs, which are widely divergent as to time, direction of motion, and color of the object, all appear to refer to a bright meteor. It may be that these separated reports all describe the object of Incident #165, f. It could be, of course, that that state of foor^ja was treated to several fireballs in one syro^uli, but it seems ^-^m likely that we have here an example of serious dispersion in the description of one object.
