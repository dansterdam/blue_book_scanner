The photograph in the document depicts what appears to be a sketch or drawing of two elongated, cigar-shaped objects with a trail behind them, indicating movement. There is a numeric scale or reference next to the objects, but it's not completely legible. The objects are somewhat reminiscent of the typical "cigar-shaped" UFOs reported in various accounts.
