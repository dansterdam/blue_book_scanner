The photograph present in the document appears to be a grainy black and white image showing what seems to be a trail or streak, likely of the meteor mentioned in the text below the image. The streak is to the right side of the image, with a slightly irregular and diffuse appearance, indicating its movement through the sky. The background of the photo is indistinct and dark, making the streak stand out distinctly.

Here is the text from the document:
