AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Ass't C/S, A-2, FAF, APO 925                                   TR-365-49                            

8. Appearance of object: Major Louis J. Sabille, 6653A, Commanding Officer, 67th
Fighter Squadron described it as being dark in color and far enough away so that
nothing more was distinguishable than a black dot. 1st Lt. R. J. Serra, AO-922143,
67th Fighter Squadron states he saw a black spot giving off what appeared to be a
smoke trail and then saw that it was a con-trail. The other observers did not
discern any color or description of a object but did see the con-trail.

9. Direction of Flight: Heading of approximately 350 - 360 degrees from Bataan
Peninsula (14째45'N - 120째25'E) to the area South of Lingayen Gulf (150째50' -
120째10'E).

10. Tactics or maneuvers: Object climbed at a 30 degree angle up to 25,000 - 30,000
fast at which point it made a slight change of course to the left and continued on the
30 degree climb up to 40,000 - 50,000 feet where it abruptly leveled off and continued
on the same heading with no change in altitude.

11. Evidence of exhaust:

     a. Color of smoke; no smoke was observed. Lt. Serra at first thought the trail
       was very similar to trail left by a skywriter but as the trail climbed he saw it to be
       a con-trail.

     b. Length: Approximately eight miles.

     c. Width: Could not estimate the width.  It appeared to be thin, yet definite,
        and traveled in a straight unbroken form with one exception, when it made a slight
        course correction.  Refer to statements of Lt. Cree and Lt. Moore.

     d. Odor: Unknown.

     e. Rate of evaporation: Thirty minutes after the first sighting the con-trail
       was still discoverable.

     e. Does trail vary with sound? Unknown.

12. Effect on clouds. No effects observed.

13. Lights: No lights observed.

14. Support: Unknown.

15. Propulsion: Unknown.

16. Control and stability: Unknown.

17. Air ducts: Unknown.

18. Speed-MPH: Estimated as well over 1,000 MPH.

19. Sound: Unknown.

20. Weather Conditions: Radar look clear.
