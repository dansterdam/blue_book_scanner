10. Appearance of object

    (a) Color - Steel gray reflected sunlight brilliantly; appeared
ruby red when viewed from great distances.

    (b) Shape - Consisted of two (2) principal parts, a disc supported 
by two (2) flanges extending around the disc. Appeared rectangular in some
positions. The sketches, shown in Inclosures 1 and 2, are reproductions of
rough sketches to show appearance at different distances.

    (c) Apparent construction - Metallic. **** is definite on this
even though flanges were flexible under what appeared to be air pressure.

11. Direction of flight:

    After the four (4), hovering near the cloud, had been observed
for about 20 minutes, they dispersed. One proceeded in a smooth direct course
to the southeast, a second moved straight east, a third went northeast, and the
fourth moved upward at about an 82 degree angle. The fifth object, which we
not visible at first, appeared in the west and moved eastwards.

12. Tactics or maneuvers:

    Four (4) were observed to move horizontally, one moved upward at
about an 82 degree angle.

13. Evidence of exhaust:

    None noted.

14. Effect on clouds:

    No effect noted.

15. Lights:

    Reflected sunlight brilliantly in some positions. Gave off ruby
red light at distance.

16. Support:

    The only visible means of support consisted of two flanges or
extensions from the inner disc. These flanges partially enveloped the disc.

17. Propulsion:

    (a) Propeller or jet - None noted.

    (b) Rotor - None noted.

    (c) Aerodynamic vanes - Extensions or flanges in front and back
of disc could serve as vanes.
