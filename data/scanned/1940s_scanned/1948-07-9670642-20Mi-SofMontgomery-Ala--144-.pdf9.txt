The image provided appears to be a heavily redacted and poorly scanned document, with no photographs visible. Due to the poor quality and redactions, extracting all text from the document is challenging, but I will transcribe as much as possible from what is legible:

```

2. T-2 Latest from CG [...]

[The remaining text is heavily redacted or illegible.]

The visible text appears to include a date (6 AUG 1947), a subject line (PROJECT "STORK"), and references to military offices and personnel. However, the main content of the document is obscured, with numerous black redactions making it difficult to infer the context or information contained within.
