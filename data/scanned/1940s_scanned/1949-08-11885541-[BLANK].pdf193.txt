Incident #23 – Boise, Idaho -- 30 June 1947

It seems exceedingly probable that the object observed
in this incident was a combination sun-cloud effect. The altitude
of the sun was 30°, azimuth 230°. At that time of the afternoon,
the sun's position was such that it could easily have illuminated
a back round cloud which was perhaps almost entirely covered by a
foreground cloud. (Boise weather reports indicate an entirely
clear sky, but the report of the incident itself states that the
object "seemed to be shining; to a huge cloud.") This investigator
himself has observed such effects.
