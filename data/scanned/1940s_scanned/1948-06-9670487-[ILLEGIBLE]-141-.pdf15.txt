This territory is very thinly populated and these people are my only witnesses.

We continued north (making innumerable observations at a few minute intervals. No change in appearance or position was noted, except it appeared to be a cluster of parts or pieces instead of one solid piece:

thus;

The next stop of importance was at arrow #6 on Highway #12. The location was nearly exactly the same, a couple of degrees closer to overhead if anything. It was slightly smaller and its shape was not constant. It appeared to very slowly change from __________ to _________. It was just about to _______ when we both

got into the car when my wife said; "Look, a piece fell off." I would have sworn at that moment it was a parachutes. (Parachutes don't operate 50 to 150 miles altitudes.) In the next 2-1/2 minutes, three only spots started to very slowly disintegrate. Three larger parts moved away slowly from the mass and formed a perfect isometric triangle, then remaining mass slowly moved into hundreds of small parts, seemingly leaving very faint trails of vapor. Although points that high was very apparent - 50 to 150 miles. The smaller parts at this point the object was, seemingly leaving very faint trails of vapor. Although point the object was, seemingly leaving very faint trails of vapor slowly disappearing as if moving upwards - 50 to 150 miles. The smaller parts observer, the three remaining parts continued to move apart and hold their constant position of a perfect triangle, gradually getting smaller and fainter until they disappeared about 9 minutes after the initial break up. It could easily be seen that the parts were moving away from the earth. No other point was that just was had - after this at arrow #6. My observations at this point were that it could not be anything terrestrial.

The day was brilliantly clear, no cloud or haze, visible above the horizon, Wind velocity about 3 MPH in direction shown on map.
