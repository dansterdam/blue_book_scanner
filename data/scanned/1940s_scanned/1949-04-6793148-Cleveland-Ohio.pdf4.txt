(SUPERMAN MAYBE??)

THERE’S A SAMPLE OF A CONVERSATION ON ANY STREET CORNER IN
CLEVELAND TODAY:

“WHAT WAS THAT IN THE SKY LAST NIGHT—A BIRD, A PLANE—
SUPERMAN?

AND THE ANSWER, LIKE AS NOT IS—“IT LOOKED LIKE A STRANGE,
GLOWING RED LIGHT TO ME.”

AND THERE YOU HAVE THE BIG QUESTION IN CLEVELAND TODAY,
JUST WHAT WAS IT MANY CLEVELANDERS SAW IN THE SKY LAST NIGHT.
AN AIRPORT OFFICIAL SAYS IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING HE'S EVER
SEEN. THERE WERE NO JET PLANES IN THE AREA LAST NIGHT. AND
THERE WAS THIS RED LIGHT—SOMETIMES WHIPPING AT HIGH SPEED...
SOMETIMES HOVERING IN ONE SPOT.

ONE THING CERTAIN—IT WASN’T A FLYING SAUCER. THEY WERE
SEEN ONLY IN THE DAYTIME LAST YEAR. AND SPEAKING OF THEM....
THE AIR FORCE SAID TODAY IT STILL CAN’T EXPLAIN THE SAUCERS.
THE AIR FORCE SAYS THERE’S NO REASON TO THINK SOME FOREIGN
COUNTRY WAS PRACTICING WITH ROCKETS OVER AMERICAN TERRITORY.
YET ON THE OTHER HAND, THE AIR FORCE SAYS CAUTIOUSLY THAT IT
CAN’T RULE OUT THAT POSSIBILITY. JUST WHAT WERE THEY? LIKE
CLEVELANDERS TODAY, THE AIR FORCE JUST SHRUGS ITS COLLECTIVE
SHOULDER AND SAYS "YOU TELL ME.”
