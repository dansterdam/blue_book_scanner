Fifty tŵfô silÿary objects were seen moving at a speed faster than any
knoun aircraft on an easterly heading at an extremely high altitude.
For the most part these objects travelled in a straight line altho
some of them zig-zagged slightly. No sound was heard. Some objects
seemed to have a silvery tail which might have been exhaust. These
objects could not have been weathér balloons as only one balloon was
released by the Mergphis Weather Bureau that day.

NOTE: Witnesses thought they had seen a meteor; however subsequent
investigation seemed to preclude this possibility.
See Supp III to Trip Report to Memſhis - Visit with Dr. Paul
Herget of the Observatory of Cincinnati, Ohio, in which Dr.
Herget expressed serious doubt that the 50 or more objects
observed 7 May 1948 in Mempħis were metrors. He was, however,
unable to offer any explanation as to a possible identification
of the objects.

Dr. Hynek of OSU and Dr. Lincoln LaPaz are to be consulted
about the possibility of the objects being a meteor shower.

Witness of this incident were: [Redacted], salesman
