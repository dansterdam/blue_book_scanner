Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of
observer(s):

Mr. _______appears to be of average intelligence and of good character.
He appears disgusted with publicity given to what he considers to be only 
a "vapor trail" of an aircraft flying at high altitude.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY

About 1630 hours on 16 Jan 49 Mr. _________ noted a "vapor streak" building up. One occasion when he
gazed at the sky he noted a "vapor streak" building up. The "streak" was form-
ing in a manner similar to that used in ejecting smoke in "sky writing."
The building up process was observed for a period of approximately three
minutes and then was lost behind the clouds. The streak formed on a bear-
ing between ten and twenty degrees south of east and appeared to be climb-
ing during the period of motion observed. The altitude of the "vapor
streak" was not less than 15,000 feet and appeared to be at an angel of
approximately 70Â° from the horizon.  _______ stated that he had seen numerous 
"vapor streaks" from both the air and ground during his period of service 
as a paratrooper in the European Theater and had given this sight no further 
consideration.
