APPENDIX "C"

Some Considerations Affecting the Interpretation of Reports of
Unidentified Flying Objects

By
G.E. Valley, Member Scientific Advisory Board,
Office of the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force

The writer has studied summary abstracts and comments 
pertaining to unidentified flying objects, which were forwarded 
by Air Force Intelligence. These remarks are divided into 
three main parts: the first part is a short summary of the 
reports; the second part consists of a general survey of 
various possibilities of accounting for the reports; the third 
part contains certain recommendations for future action.

PART I -- SHORT SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS

The reports can be grouped as follows:

Group 1 -- The most numerous reports indicate the daytime 
observation of metallic disk-like objects, roughly in diameter 
ten times their thickness. There is some suggestion that the 
cross section is asymmetrical and rather like a turtle shell. 
Reports agree that these objects are capable of high acceler-
ation and velocity; they often are sighted in groups, sometimes 
in formation. Sometimes they flutter.

Group 2 -- The second group consists of reports of lights 
observed at night. These are also capable of high speed and 
acceleration. They are less commonly seen in groups. They 
usually appear to be sharply defined luminous objects.

Group 3 -- The third group consists of reports of various 
kinds of rockets, in general appearing somewhat like V-2 
rockets.

Group 4 -- The fourth group contains reports of various 
devices which, in the writer's opinion, are sounding balloons 
of unusual shape such as are made by the General Mills Company 
to Navy contract.

Group 5 -- The fifth group includes reports of objects 
in which little credence can be placed.
