Attached Incident Summaries l thru 172 from the files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendations as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Army Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau.
