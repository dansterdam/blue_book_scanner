'Flying Disc'

Youths Say It Passed Over Ludington

Ludington -- Two youths reported seeing a fast traveling "flying disc" pass over Ludington
Wednesday afternoon.

Paul Baum, sophomores in Ludington High school, and a companion, Pat O'Connell, said
the disc looked like a "coin with a tail a block long." It was traveling west and
disappeared over Lake Michigan.

They said it was white and clearly visible. There was no clouds over Ludington
Wednesday afternoon.
