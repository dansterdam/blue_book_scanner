HEADQUARTERS

MCIAO-3/cms/ra

4C MCI AO

SUBJECT: Project “SIGN”

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
Andrews Air Force Base,
Washington 25, D. C.
ATTN: DSS

1. Project “SIGN” is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files of Project “SIGN” are forwarded for study and recommendations as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project “SIGN” except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball lightnings. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are checked by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks are usually made direct from the Project “SIGN” office, MCIAO-3. These checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations or the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce, (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining incidents are balloons.
2, 21, 25, 26, 11, 16, 44, 22, 23, 50, 52, 72, 33, 91, 92, 96, 104, 67, 89, 69(Samlee2), 113, 115, 122, 135, 151, 154, 155, 157, 159, 163, 165, 167, 169, 159
