UNCLASSIFIED

To my cognizance, none of the neighbors in the vicinity of my house 
sighted the objects. However, I have made no inquiry of the neighbors. I did 
tell my nearby neighbor who were not home at the time, about this occurance.

I reported this to my Squadron Security Officer on Tuesday, 10 May 1949.
I have read various comments and articles concerning objects of this nature 
but never put much stock in the information.

These objects appeared opaque in nature. I can think of no possible 
explanation as to what these objects were nor what kept them in the air or 
how they could travel at such an excessive rate of speed. I was fully awake 
when I saw them and can vision them perfectly in my mind at this time.
