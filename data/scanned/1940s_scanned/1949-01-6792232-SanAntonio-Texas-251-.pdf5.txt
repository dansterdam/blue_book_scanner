M/Sgt Ellis C. Stone, Headquarters Fourth Army, AG Section, reports observing an unidentified aerial phenomenon on 20 January 1949 between the hours of 1800 and 1900 (looser estimate given to be about 1835 hours).

The point from which this observation was made is 6.2 miles northeast of the city of San Antonio, Texas, about 150 yards on Judson Road at the intersection of Judson Road and Nacogdoches Road.

In making compass sightings on the azimuth of the observation it was determined that the object was seen between the readings of 325째 to 297째 with the first noticed the object was traveling in a path believed to have been from the 293 direction. When first observed was at an elevation of about 15째 and as object went out of sight over a small hill, the elevation had dropped to about 12째.

The object appeared to be in the form of a sphere the color of which appeared to be luminous bluish green intermingled with a yellow tinge. It was moving with a gliding motion from the observers right to his left and slightly away from the point of observation.

The trail from the object varied in length from approximately three times the diameter of the object to six or seven times the diameter. Color of this trail appeared to be a light pink with bright red sparks spitting from the trail at about one half the distance of this length. The trail was a straight streak and with these sparks emitted making the only irregulatirley.

No investigation was recommended that the following named persons may have seen the object since they are known to have been in the same vicinity as Informant at the time of his observation. They will be interrogated.

[address redacted], believed to be of Converse, Texas. (10 miles north of the telephone installation on the Austin Highway between San Antonio and Converse, Texas).
