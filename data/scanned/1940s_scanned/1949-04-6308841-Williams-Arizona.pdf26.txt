observed the FIREBALL from his home, in the rear of the museum, while
sitting in bed. (Shown a rough one exhibit A). Only one (1) FIREBALL
was seen and informant was approximately 50 to 60 miles away. (Approximate
location of the FIREBALL is within the area covered by the rectangle on
exhibit A). Witness interviewed stated the FIREBALL was visible approximately
30 degrees above the horizon and disappeared, approximately 5 degrees from
the horizon. Count of all until no more sand at the base of the FIREBALL
witness stated it was from 75 to 100 miles high. He saw the FIREBALL for
two seconds before it faded from view. The object was round in appearance,
was the size of a 100 watt light bulb at 25 feet and was bright green in color
with a bluish tail. The FIREBALL appeared to be traveling a straight course
in a north westerly direction. However, he advised he was not so positive of
the direction of flight due to his angle of observation. Inasmuch as the informant
was indoors with lights dim when called to be heard a sound. Detected
no evidence of smoke or aftermath and does not believe that it caused fires
in anyway. Considering the object was a meteor it would have been travelling
at 25.2 miles per second. The FIREBALL faded from view and probably fell north

meteors, but ones seen on 18 April was much larger and more brilliant than any
he has seen. Informant know of no other individual who has seen the FIREBALL.
