( TOP SECRET ) 
Incident #17 -- Mt. Rainier, Washington -- 24 June 1947

There appears to be no astronomical explanation for this 
classic incident, which is the prototype of many of the later flying 
saucer stories.

It is impossible to explain this incident away as sheer 
nonsense, if any credence at all is given to Mr. [REDACTED] integrity.
However, certain inconsistencies can be pointed out in the facts as 
reported:

[REDACTED] attention was first drawn to the objects by a 
bright flash on his plane, which was followed by numerous other similar 
flashes. If these were something like the flash one gets from a dis-
tant mirror, it means that the reflection was specular, or direct.
For a direct reflection, the angle between the observer, sun, and ob-
ject must be "just right," and at such distances as 20 or 25 miles, 
the chance of a series of direct reflections is extremely small. If 
the object was a diffuse reflector -- that is, scattering the sunlight 
falling on it, much as the moon or a balloon does -- then at such a 
distance it seems quite unlikely that Mr. [REDACTED] would have been 
startled, or that our attention would have been called to it, unless 
the objects reflecting were extremely large.

The supersonic speeds called for in the estimated distance 
is correct also throw suspicion on the original calculations; by
computation (see below) it can be seen that, considering the detail
which Arnold observed in the objects, at least one of his estimates
