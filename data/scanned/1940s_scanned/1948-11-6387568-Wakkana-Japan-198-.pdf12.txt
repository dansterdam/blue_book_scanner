...ident: 193

Target appeared in ground clutter area during entire period of observation. 
Target was not observed in station area, and was not observed visually at
any time. At times the target appeared as 2 aircraft and at other times 
as a singe aircraft. Gave impression of 2 fighter craft dog-fighting.
Evaluated as Soviet aircraft conducting electronic reconnaissance mission.
Thought to be a Soviet "ferret" since the object was computed to have held
a speed of 240 MPH and since the size of blip on radar scope was normal
for an aircraft. The unidentified aircraft circled (20 mile radius)
continuously for one hour and fifty minutes immediately above radar site
installed at Wakkana, No authorized aircraft was in the vicinity.
Weather conditions precluded visual observation.
