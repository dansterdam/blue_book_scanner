INVD. #873

17. STROULL: What was the approximate size of the object?

-REDACTED-: The size, as near as I could judge, would be a weather balloon
at 2,000 feet. I am POSITIVE it was not a weather balloon.

18. STROULL: What would you estimate its speed?

-REDACTED-: That I wouldn't know except that it traveled about 25 or 30
degrees of approximately forty-five minutes to an hour.

19. STROULL: In what direction did it move?

-REDACTED-: Overhead and directly into the sun,

20. STROULL: Did you think it might be a reflection from something?

-REDACTED-: I thought it might be a reflection from the sunlight at first
but then I couldn't account for it being time.

21. STROULL: Did it glint or sparkle?

-REDACTED-: No, it didn't sparkle at all. The light from the object was
constant with a constant luminescent or soft glow, As the sun set
lower until it seemed to travel at a very high speed into sunlight
losing its luminescent and then got smaller, smaller, and faded.
It being orange color, It was just over my head when it started
changing of coloring, when it disappeared completely, 

22. STROULL: What was the manner of disappearance?

-REDACTED-: It disappeared without leaving a trace of it, I was looking
directly at it, then it, it seemed to dissolve as an incandescent
light with one turns off the switch. There was no change in speed
and no change in direction whatsoever, That is the last I saw
of the object,

23. STROULL: Any tactics employed during flight or object?

-REDACTED-: No change in altitude or direction,

24. STROULL: Was there any sound to this object?

-REDACTED-: There was no sound whatsoever,

25. STROULL: Was there an exhaust trail?

-REDACTED-: No exhaust trail at all,

26. STROULL: Did you notice the object-to overhead any other?

-REDACTED-: There were no distinguishing characteristics at all except for
the bluish light,

-REDACTED-:
I was at least over and over, but frankly, there is immediately
came to my mind.
