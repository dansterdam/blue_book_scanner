SYNOPSIS

On 13 August 1949, at approximately 2145 hours, a metal object
allegedly fell to the pavement at the intersection of Canal and
Bourbon Streets in New Orleans, Louisiana. This object is pie-shaped
apparently of metal alloy construction. The exterior is covered with
a sooty substance while underneath the metal is of a silvery-gray
color. Two (2) sides of the object are rough, indicating that the
metal may have been broken from a larger piece. The rounded edge of
the object is apparently a finished edge. The object varies in
thickness from approximately one-sixteenths inch (1/16") to one-
half inch (1/2"). Witnesses to this incident were Patrolman
                           of the New Orleans city Police, Mr. 
                           for the Illinois Central Railroad, and Mr.
                           for the vendor. Buildings in the vicinity of
alleged incident were examined with negative results to determine
if the object fell from a building.
