believe this object he observed was any known aircraft as it traveled horizontally
and was invisible. FS3 Agent made crude chalk marks in mud and snow at locations
to take the approximate bearings and landing points where the phenomen 
was seen and observed.

time mark thereof. Agents made mud and snow marks and sighted this above-
mentioned object.

    On 8 April 1949 at 2000 hours, Agent made the aforementioned
