aircraft to be a source the conclusion by a psychologist could be considered
as an explanation for th objects is emitted by source. Since sourc was not
flying into the sun and since he had an ex port photo interpretor, V-7 (f)J5 does not
appear to be a reasonable explanation, nor do reflections, or
irregularities of, the plexi-glass canopy through which source viewed the
objects offer a reasonable explanation, because of the wide r..ge of
observation of the objects. As far as the reportiÂ·:"g officerls conceI:" tis
