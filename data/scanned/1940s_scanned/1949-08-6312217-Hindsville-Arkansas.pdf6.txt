A F F I D A V I T UNCLASSIFIED

I, _________________, a temporary _______________ of the Hindsville, Arkansas
do solemnly swear that I am 73 years of age and that
the statement contained herein are true and correct to the best of my 
knowledge and belief.

About 6:00 PM on the 10th of August 1949, I was lying on my couch in
the living room of my home looking out of my South living room window
watching some birds, when I observed a disk like object in the sky. This
object appeared to be the size of the full moon and it was round, bright
and shining as if the sun was reflecting off of aluminium. When I first
observed this object I was looking through the glass window, then I went
outside and continued to observe it. The object was flying over a ridge
which is about a mile from my house and it was flying from West to East.
The ridge also runs West and East on the South side of my house. After
observing the object for about two minutes, I went in the house an called
two of my neighbors but they said that they did not See it. When I re-
turned to the yard the object had disappeared. This object did not make
any sound; it did not leave any smoke trail; it did not have anything pro-
jecting from it and it was sailing in the object at the normal rate of
an airplane. About ten minutes after the object had disappeared I heard
an airplane flying overhead and I went outside to see what it looked like
and saw that it was a small black airplane and it did not look anything
like the object I had seen before. Although there were a few scattered
clouds in the sky at the time I observed the object, the sky was clear in
the vicinity of the object and the sun was shining.
