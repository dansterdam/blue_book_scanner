INCIDENT

24 July 1948

At 2:45 in the morning, the pilot and co-pilot of an Eastern Airlines
DC-3, flying at 5,000 feet between Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama
sighted a dull red exhaust some 700 feet ahead, a little above and to the
right of the airliner.

Captain [REDACTED] the pilot, immediately turned to his co-pilot,
[REDACTED] and remarked: "Look, there comes a new Army jet job."
The object approached in a slight dive, deflected a little to the left and
passed the plane on the right, almost level and parallel at flight path,
at a distance of approximately one-half mile. After passing, it pulled
up sharply and disappeared into a cloud.

The object appeared to be a wingless aircraft, 100 ft. long, cigar-
shaped and about twice the diameter of a B-29. It had no fins or
protruding surfaces. [REDACTED] thought it had a "snout" similar to a radar
pair on the front and he had the impression there was a cabin with
windows above -- much like a pilot compartment -- except that it appeared
brighter. The illumination inside the body itself approximated the
brilliance of a magnesium flare. He saw no occupants nor did [REDACTED]
visible from the side only, was an intense, fairly dark, blue glow running
the entire length of the object beneath the fuselage.
