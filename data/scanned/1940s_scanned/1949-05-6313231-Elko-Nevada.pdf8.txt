19D GSI 24-12                                                         Elko, Nevada
                                                                                    8 June 1949

At approximately two A.M. on the morning of May 29, 1949, while attending to routine duties in the freight yard of the Western Pacific Railroad Company in Elko, I noticed five amber colored lights approximately five miles distant and at an altitude of 10,000 feet. The lights were in a very formation about 150 feet apart and heading West at a speed of over 500 miles per hour. I could hear no sound and there were no visible signs of exhaust. The lights were steady, giving the appearance of being seen through a window, rather than of a ray or beam. When they disappeared it was as if an obstruction or projection on an aircraft had come into my line of vision.

I do not know how long the lights were within my sight or the distance they covered during that period. I could not distinguish any outline around them and do not know whether they came from one very large aircraft or five smaller ones flying in formation.

The foregoing statement is true to the best of my knowledge and recollection.
