The document is marked as "UNCLASSIFIED" at the bottom. Various other pieces of information, such as dates and locations (all relating to May 1949 and locations in Texas and Louisiana), indicate that they concern investigations into "Unidentified Aerial Objects", which is consistent with what you'd expect from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was the U.S. Air Force's investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs).
