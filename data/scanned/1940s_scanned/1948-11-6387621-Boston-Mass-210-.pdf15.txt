UNCLASSIFIED

11 November 1948

Dear Sirs:

I was awake last night about 5:00 A. M., sitting by the window
gazing up at the stars when suddenly there cam into view, flying
east to west over the Charles River Basin, three fast-flying single-
engine planes. The planes had no lights but city lights made them
visible like three paliominoes. The two outside ones going in a
straight line, the one was middle one weaving-back and forthâ€”al-
though at no great height, There was no sound.

Yours very truly

[redacted]

Boston, 3, Mass.

Sent to:

Army Intelligence Service
Washington, D. C.
