Two Eastern Air Lines pilots reported yesterday that their plane 
Thursday night winged a tremendous windstorm at least 20 feet of
range from the bank and was traveling 550 - 700 miles per hour.

                    Descriptions of sightings and conditions blacked out

object looked like a 75-foot fuselage "blown up about 4 times" and was brilliÂ­-
antly lighted with a series of big square windows. The object veered within sev-
erall hundred feet of the DC-3 and then shot up into the clouds.
