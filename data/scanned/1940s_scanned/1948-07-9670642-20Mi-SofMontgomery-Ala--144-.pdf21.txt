The image provided appears to be a scanned copy of a heavily redacted document. Unfortunately, the quality of the image is very poor, which makes it difficult to discern details. There are no photographs visible in this image; it seems to be a page of text with many parts blacked out. Due to the extensive redactions and the low resolution of the scan, most of the text is illegible, and transcribing it is not possible.

Despite my capabilities, this specific document's condition does not allow me to provide a full transcription. If you have specific questions about Project Blue Book or if there's another document or portion of text that's more legible, I would be able to provide more information on those.
