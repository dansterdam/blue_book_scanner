The samples of the "flying disc" were very similar to the slag
found at a nearby foundry. ------ admitted that the sample that
was sent to Palmer was not of any disc.

An investigation of the B-25 crash showed that an exhaust stack
had burned out on the left engine which caused a fire in the left
wing which subsequently broke off the wing and the tail section.
The plane at that time was carrying both intelligence officers, a
hitch-hiker and a Crew Chief. The Crew Chief and the hitch-hiker
parachuted to safety but both intelligence officers were killed.

On August 7------ and ------ were again interviewed by government
representatives. Both denied that the fragments were parts of a
flying disc. They stated that they had sent some rock samples to
Palmer for analysis and that Palmer had asked them if these samples
could have been part of a flying disc. They stated that he passed this
all off as a joke. They stated that the rock samples were parts
of a disc because that's what Palmer wanted them to say. ------- 
stated that they mostly talked to Arnold and the intelligence
officers about flying and that no one was very interested in the
rock samples they had found.

The case is considered a hoax and no other action was deemed neces-
sary.
