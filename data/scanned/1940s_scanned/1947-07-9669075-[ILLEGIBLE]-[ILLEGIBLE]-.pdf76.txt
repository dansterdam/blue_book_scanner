Stewart's attention called to unidentified flying object by Capt Ryderd
Stewart estimates the P-80 at 250 miles on preliminary approach for
landing at Hamilton Fld. Object was estimated to be following P-80 at 
three or four times its speed. A moment later another object appeared and
flew a course described as something similar to a fighter's maneuvers when
accompanying a heavier ship, on a left to right movement, over the object
first sighted. The object continued this maneuvering until out of sight.
Size could not be estimated but not believed to be above 6,000 ft altitude.
Described as milky-white in color, and unlike any conventional aircraft seen.
