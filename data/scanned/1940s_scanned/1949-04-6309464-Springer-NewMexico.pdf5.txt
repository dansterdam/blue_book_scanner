The image appears to be a reproduction of a typewritten report, and it contains three hand-drawn illustrations of aerial formations. The topmost drawing depicts a tight V-shaped cluster of objects, with an arrow indicating southward movement. The middle drawing shows a broader, more dispersed formation with an arrow also pointing south. The bottom drawing shows a simple line with regularly spaced dots and an arrow indicating southward movement.

Below is the extraction of the text from the document:

The first time we saw the "objeots", heading due west 
at an extremely high altitude and at a very high 
rate of speed, they were not in a tight over 10 seconds.
They passed directly overhead. Time 6:30 in the 
morning. They were in a tight group as shown at
left, eleven in group.

About 10 minutes later we observed another flight
of these "objects" heading west very high and 
fast. When directly overhead the lead one on the
left suddenly left the rest and headed southwest.
All went out of sight in a very few seconds. Nine
in group.

At approx. 7:00 we saw two more "objects" heading due
east in the same manner as the others we had seen.
These were much farther apart than the first ones we
had seen.

South
-------------------------------------------------->
The last large "formation" we saw passed due south
across low and behind sprush. They were strung out in 
a line going very fast and low but at quite a dis-
tance from us. All these "objects" made a pecullar
sound like a high pitched whstle. The sound was 
more in strange behind the objects. Flying in line.

Dr. La Paz I do not believe that these objects could have been
picked up or followed with ridad glasses they were moving much too
fast.
