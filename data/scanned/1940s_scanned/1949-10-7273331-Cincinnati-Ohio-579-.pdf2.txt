The image you've provided appears to be a scanned document page, but due to the orientation and the quality of the scan, it's a challenge to make out any specific details. The image is mostly dark, and there seem to be a few markings or artifacts on the scan; however, there is no discernible photographic content, such as an object or scene related to the UFO report that can be described from this image alone. Since the image does not present clear text either, I'm unable to act as an OCR system to produce and output text from the document.

It's possible that the document was incorrectly scanned, or the image may not be correctly oriented, which may have caused the lack of visible content. If there is additional context or another image with clearer content, please provide it for further assistance.
