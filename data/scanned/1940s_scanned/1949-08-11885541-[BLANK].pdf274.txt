MEMORANDUM REPORT ON                                                    25 April 1949

SUBJECT:    Psychological Analysis of Reports of Unidentified
                   Aerial Objects

SECTION:     Aero Medical Laboratory

SERIAL NO.: MXCRO-69p-150                                           Expenditure Order No. 69p-38

A. PURPOSE:
    1. At the request of the Technical Intelligence Division, Intelligence
Department, AMC, an analysis has been made, from a psychological point of 
view, of 212 investigations of persons reporting sightings of unidentified
aerial objects.

B. FACTUAL DATA:
    2. A report of this analysis is attached as Appendix A.

C. CONCLUSION:
    3. It is concluded by the writer that there are sufficient psychological
explanations for the reports of unidentified flying objects to provide
plausible explanations for reports not otherwise explainable. These errors
in identifying real stimuli result chiefly from inability to estimate
speed, distance and size.

D. RECOMMENDATIONS:
    4. Test the ability of pilots to estimate the course of a small 
lighted balloon while doing acrobatics with it at night. It is suggested
that several pilots try to fly pursuant curves and collision courses on 
such targets at night and report accurately their sensations. It would be 
desirable, but probably impossible, to keep them from knowing the nature
of the light source.

    5. In all future reports of unidentified objects specify the location
of object with reference to polar coordinates (direction and degrees above
the horizon) rather than asking individuals to estimate distance. If
possible, obtain an estimate of size in terms of the visual angle sub-
tended by the object.

    6. In all future investigations determine the angular position
of the sun with respect to the unidentified object and the observer.
