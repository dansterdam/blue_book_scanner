Accident, Major

- 9 - Captain Mantell's home life was normal,
he had a wife and two boys, one 15 months, and one
about 5 years, but was not familial; closest friends and can 
vouch that he never had any versions or talkers,
except the normal interested knowledgeable type.
Unknown to me if he had any of this type. His interest 
in flying could n-t be called. He loved the P-51, 
felt always the master of it, and flew, not carelessly 
yet like an excessive fighter pilot. I firmly believe
that if he thought he had any chance of catching the
object he would have pursued it, knowingly to his
certain "end". I knew no man more than he that
was "allot". He was sure, never an intelligent. He 
did not harbor a "flame over the horizon" complex.
If some outside force did not cause a heart ... I
think he expired before Jackie change his flame 
to kill it. Mantell was six foot, weighted 190 Ths.
A dark swallow-id man.
