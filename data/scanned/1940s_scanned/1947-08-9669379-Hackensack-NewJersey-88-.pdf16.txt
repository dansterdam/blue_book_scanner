Mrs. *************
Wildwood, New Jersey

Dear Mrs. ************:

With reference to your letter of 27 March 1948, this is to advise
you that Major W. T. Faulk left suddenly on leave due to pending transfer
orders. No information or film has been received since the departure
of Major Faulk who had been receiving all correspondence in connection
with the Wildwood sightings. Only one roll of film has been received;
the other two rolls mentioned, as well as additional information, may
possibly have been forwarded to Major Faulk at his leave address and
not as yet returned to this headquarters. The one roll of film re-
ceived was processed in the Photographic Laboratory with negative results.

For security reasons, it is impossible to keep you informed of
the official action being taken by this headquarters. However, an in-
vestigation has been initiated on the Wildwood, N. J., incidents.

This Command is making considerable effort to acknowledge receipt
of all information. Your cooperation, as well as the cooperation of
all individuals sufficiently interested in the security of their country,
is urgently required. It is hoped that you will continue to inform
this headquarters, as well as the P&eAC, of any new developments in
Wildwood. The official address for such correspondence is as follows:

Commanding General
Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: MCIA

Sincerely yours,

/s/ **********
