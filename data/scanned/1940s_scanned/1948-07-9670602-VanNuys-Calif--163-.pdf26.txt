The image contains a sketch, not a photograph. The sketch appears to depict a circular object or sighting with annotations indicating angles, trajectory, and approximate size as observed through a telescope. There are two parts to the sketch; the upper part shows a thin, elongated object, and the lower part shows a circular field of view with a larger object within it, along with angle measurements and directional notation.
