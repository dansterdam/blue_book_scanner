an altitude of 5500 feet and the speed was estimated to be in
excess of 600 miles per hour. When first observed the object was
travelling West and approximately 30 seconds later it changed course
abruptly to the South. During the 3 to 5 minutes of observation
by the pilot and crew the object went through a series of rapid
declinations and accelerations and made several sharp changes in
direction and altitude. No vapor trails were visible during the
time of observation. The outstanding characteristic as quoted by
