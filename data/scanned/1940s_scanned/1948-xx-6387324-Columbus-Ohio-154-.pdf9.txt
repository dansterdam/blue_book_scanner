With 106 incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation--
That statement is true only under the assumption that the evidence is
valid and reliable and true. When psychological and physiological
factors are taken into consideration, all of these incidents
can be explained rationally as pointed out by the Rand Corporation

212 Incidents considered)

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the reports of
unidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanations for
reports not otherwise explainable. These errors in identifying known
objects result chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, and
size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in this
report. These incidents force us, perhaps in regard to free all
type of objects, or manner of performance. These are incidents
which, had they sightings were recognized by other reports,
probably would not have been considered unusual or reported
because of publicity.

incident is discussed separately. It is not the intent to generally discredit
the character of observers, but each case has undesirable elements, and these
must be comprehended. The numerical designation is merely the catalogue
order of the incident in the project files.
