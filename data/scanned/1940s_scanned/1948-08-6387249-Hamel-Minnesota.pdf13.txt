Dear Sir:

Re: MCIAO/X-3

This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 26, 1948 concerning the sighting of a "flying saucer" at Hamel, Minnesota, which was originally referred by us to Captain Charles L. Victor, Area Intelligence Officer, St. Paul, Minnesota.

As pointed out in my letter of August 12, 1948, to Captain Charles L. Victor, this matter was referred for informative purposes only and we are unable to make any investigation.

Very truly yours
