Witness observed a large silver-colored sphere which seemed to
arise from behind a woods and continued to float across his farm.
While in flight it seemed to unravel a silver substance which
floated earthward. While under observation it disintegrated in mid-air.

incident. Subject arose while witness was talking to a man from
this Command (ACLRP?) when an airplane chanced to fly overhead.
