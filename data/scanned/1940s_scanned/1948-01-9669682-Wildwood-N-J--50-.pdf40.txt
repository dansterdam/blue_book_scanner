Maj. W. A. Houkill
Forwarded in confirmation of conversation between [REDACTED] of your office and Mr. Rodgers of this Division, this date.
 
2. As pointed out in this conversation, it is believed that the attached letter has been forwarded to the Air Materiel Command as a hoax. However, since the matter cannot be completely analysed on the basis of the information presented, it is believed that an investigation is warranted. If your investigation indicates that the item is of any merit whatsoever, this office is desirous of getting the physical article for further analysis.
