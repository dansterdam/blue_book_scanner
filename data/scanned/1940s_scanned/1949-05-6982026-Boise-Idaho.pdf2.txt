There is one black and white photograph present on the document. It shows a paved two-lane road stretching through a rural area with open fields or grasslands on either side. There are no vehicles on the road, and it appears to be a sunny day with no obstructions in the sky. Trees and bushes can be seen sparsely dotted along the horizon, which is also where the road seems to converge due to the perspective.
