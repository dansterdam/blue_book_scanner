Beaumont, Texas
March 7, 1957

Gentleman:

I have just finished reading an article in the Saturday Evening Post entitled "What You Can Believe About Flying Saucers". I am a sane young man 18, and I still don't believe what I saw last summer at High Island Block Co. summer village resort in the road to Galveston Texas.

I have never repeated this information to my buddies when were out at the creek or any of is anywhere.

Or, is in early June of 1956. It was very night.
