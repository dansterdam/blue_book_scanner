The image contains no photographs, only a series of four dark, hand-drawn circular shapes or objects with lines drawn through them that could depict motion or other attributes. They are not uniform and seem to be rough sketches rather than precise illustrations.

Regarding the text, due to the quality of the scan and the faded or unclear nature of the text, it's not possible to provide an accurate transcription of the text in the document. The text appears to be extremely faint and is unreadable from the image provided.
