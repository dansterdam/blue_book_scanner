NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Lt. ---- ---- stated that on 26 Mar 1952 at approx. 2100 to 2115 hours, he was again
in his back yard making his usual weather observations when he sighted another object
in the same vicinity and angle from the horizon as the one previously sighted on 15 Mar
1952. This object was shaped like a flattened funnel, with a reddish gold tint and
appeared to be about 5Â° across at altitude. First estimated the object would cover
an area of two city blocks on the ground. It following approximately the same route,
was observed approximately the same length of time, and gave off the same sound as the
object previously sighted. Have no odor. It left a persistent dark red trail 
similar to that previously sighted. There were no projections. The object maintained
straight and level flight and disappeared into the distance. There was no reflected on
the clouds noticed. The weather was clear, average conditions prevailed. Heights could
not compare sizes with any object at average length, but insisted on his own estimates as
to size and altitude.
