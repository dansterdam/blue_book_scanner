The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document with various symbols and text descriptions related to a map, possibly indicating drainage features and cultural features. The image is very faint, but I will transcribe as much as the visible text as possible:

MEXICO

LARGE RIVERS & STREAMS
CANAL

The text is incomplete due to the cutoff at the edges of the scan. The visibility of the document is poor, making it difficult to read all of the text accurately.
