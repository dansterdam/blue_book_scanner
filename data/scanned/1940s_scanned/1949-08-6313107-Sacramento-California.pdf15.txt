and I agreed not to describe this object in order not to influence each other's opinion. It did agree on th tg 2217, its direction of flight 220 to 230 and we sped 700 to 800 miles per hour. I also agreed that ------------- was to make the initial report and I would follow up with any additional information.

The psychological effect on me was a weird sensation best described as a hair raising experience. This object had size, shape and motion and not knowing what we were looking at in all probability gave me this strange feeling.

The shape of this thing is: short, rounded nose, very short wings rounded at tips, fuselage short and thick. There were no visible jets or exhaust openings and no visible indications of engines. There were no visible traces of jet or exhaust flames or smoke. There was no noise of any sort, no navigational lights or any other lights indicating its position or presence in the sky. Also in describing its shape, it had no tail surfaces that were visible.

The sketch attached to this statement is my impression of this object.

Sworn and subscribed to before me this 6th day of September 1949.
