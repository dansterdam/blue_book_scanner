AFS WP-291 Dept. of the Air Force
Ltr, ETEL, to CG, AMC, Subj: Analysis of Project "Grudge" Reported Incidents.

a. Incident No. 17 is reported in connection with an unusual air traffic communication problem on 10 Apr 49 between two CAA controlled aircraft in the vicinity of Las Cruces, N. Mex. Both CAA and AACS had been trying to contact the CAA flight service station at Albuquerque, N. Mex. Full details n these attempts and the complete $64 question with respect to CAA facilities and operating practices of this Albuquerque point could try to be ruled out as aggressors.

b. Incident No. 47 compares event in this with balloon launching on 10 of 5 July 1948. However, balloon No. 10 although not recovered was sent to secure the Canada characteristics of launching. Protective co-ance where burst to expectancy of torn balloon. Incident No. 115 is a reasonable description of the IQ Series plastic balloons that includes tethered lights characteristics this incident on was after the balloon accident No. 163 of 7 April 1945 at Albuquerque. However, this event or the reported incident (2005 CDT) is about 1/2 hour before the timing of balloon release (1413 MST). Thus the incident could not have been that balloon.

c. It is of interest to note that incident No. 122 was reported by an employee of these Laboratories who had considerable experience in the use of balloons of all kinds, and could have been depended upon to know this appearance and behavior of a balloon if it was who he saw.

d. Incident No. 163 bears a fair description of the appearance of a large plastic balloon in sunset light. The object's disappearance could be accounted for either by its movement into the earth's sunset shadow or by an initial defocusing of the observer'e eye. This finding logically possibly have been balloon release No. 75 or No. 76 on 20 or 21 July 1945 at Amarillo base. Telegram 75 to the recovery at 135PDT, California, which is in thetimezone U.E. shows, on 22 July 1945 and could have readily have a trajectory which would have been within sight of the Lee Angelos area. Balloon No. 76 was never recovered. It is possible that it had a trajectory similar to No. 75.

f. All other reported incidents from 1 to 172 do not seem to have reasoneable comparison with balloons launched by these Laboratories.

3. The balloons used by these Laboratories are now somewhat standardized. They are 20 feet long, plastic, white in color, and have telephone cones in shape. Nearly all launchings are made at the balloon AFS at Alamogordo, New Mexico. Two photograph prints are enclosed showing the appearance and size of these balloons. The larger photograph shows the typical flight appearance at cry altitudes where it would be visible. It is hoped that this information may be of some use to you in identifying future reports of incidents.

Please note, typos and grammatical errors in the original text have been transcribed as they appear. The document appears to reference observations and reports of unknown flying objects and attempts to explain them, possibly with reference to high-altitude balloon launches.
