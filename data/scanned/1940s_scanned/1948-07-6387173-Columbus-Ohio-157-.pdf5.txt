Witness Statement:

Objects first looked like large stars. They seemed to be at a very
great distance and appeared to be about the size of an ash tray.
There were approximately six or seven of them in a formation that
resembled the shape of the wide dipper. Did not have a distinctive sound
indicated but proved to me to be enormous to suggest anything in the
sky. Finally went gold in color and seemed to be just hanging in the
the sky was clear and blue and the sun was shining but do not believe
the gold color caused by a reflection of the sun.

Corroborated by truck driver but/could not obtain his name.
