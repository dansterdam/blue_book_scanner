SUBJECT: AMC Opinion Concerning "Flying Discs"

TO:      Commanding General
         Army Air Forces
         Washington 25, D. C.
         ATTENTION: Brig. General George Schulgen
                     AC/AS-2

1. As requested by AC/AS-2 there is presented below the considered
opinion of this Command concerning the so-called "Flying Discs". This
opinion is based on interrogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2 and
preliminary studies by personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, Engineering
Division T-3. The opinion was arrived at in a conference between
personnel from the Air Institute of Technology, Intelligence T-2, Office,
Chief of Engineering Division, and the Aircraft, Power Plant and Propeller
Laboratories of Engineering Division T-3.

2. It is the opinion that:

    a. The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary
       or fictitious.

    b. There are objects probably approximating the shape of a
       disc, of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made
       aircraft.

    c. There is a possibility that some of the incidents may be
       caused by natural phenomena, such as meteors.

    d. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme
       rate of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which
       must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly air-
       craft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects
       are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely.

    e. The apparent common description of the object is as follows:

       (1) Metallic or light reflecting surface.
