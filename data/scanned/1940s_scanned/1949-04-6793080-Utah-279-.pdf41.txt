The image provided is highly degraded, and the quality is very poor, making it difficult to discern any specific details. There do not appear to be any clear photographs or distinguishable images present besides text and perhaps some smudges or artifacts from the scanning process.

Since the image quality is so low, an accurate OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output may not be possible, but I will do my best with the visible text:

```
WILD FEEDING HORSES
037007 APR 6 1949

Please note that the text extracted may not be entirely accurate due to the poor quality of the image.
