1. Reference is made to latter from your headquarters, ACIAS,
dated 9 March 1949, subsect "Unidentified Flying objects," and first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments are made as follows as inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 15, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion in a
specified direction from launchers within the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Spotting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.
