Incident No. 193 -- 24 Oct. 1948, between 1100 and 1130 GMT, 
Kubiersre, Germany.
An Air Force officer heard a sound like a F-47 at high altitude, 
looked up and saw a dark object shaped like a coin at undetermined al-
titude, 400 elevation flying southwest at fast undetermined speed in 
level flight.

ATIC Opinion: There is nothing to controvert the conclusion that 
this object was a conventional aircraft at a range outside the limit 
of visual resolution.
