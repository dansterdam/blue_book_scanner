Please note: N/S appears to represent "Not Stated" or "Not Specified" throughout the document. The last line in the remarks section and the number in brackets have markings that make them illegible. There are censor redactions present in the document (text covered with black bars). There are also handwritten marks on the document, but I am directed only to transcribe the printed text, so the transcription does not include these handwritten notations.
