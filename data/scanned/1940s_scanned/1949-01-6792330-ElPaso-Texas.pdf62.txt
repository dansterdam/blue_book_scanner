Composite of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of
observer(s):

In all cases it was noted that the people involved could not
be specific as to their observations or descriptions either because of the 
lack of interest or failures to observe the incident very closely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:    On 30 Jan 1949 while on duty as Control Tower Operators,
Blggs AFB between 1751 and 1754, ------------------------- saw a green
ball of fire on the horizon on an estimated true bearing of approximately
335° from the Blggs Tower (coordinates: 31-50N 106-23W). This ball of fire
was approximately 3 to 5° above the horizon travelling in a northwest to
southeast direction. They stated that the ball of fire lost no altitude
during its travel (seemed reported, states that "There was a slight decline then
a change to a level course, after which it flared out and disappeared), and
that as the end it enlarged slightly then disappeared quickly. The reporting
agent took a transit to the Control Tower at Blggs and determined the actual
true bearing was 335° when first sighted and that the object actually travelled
on a true bearing of 50°. The elevation was determined to be 10° above the
horizon.

Due to the fact that the time of the incident was just prior to nightfall
the above-mentioned could not be sure of its exact locations. They stated
that a ----------------------- of the 3315th Technical Training Wing, Scott AFB Base,
had also seen the green fireball and that the tower operators at the El Paso
Municipal Airport had likewise seen it. (See 246A)
