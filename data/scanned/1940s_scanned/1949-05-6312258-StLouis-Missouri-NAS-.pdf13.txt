UNCLASSIFIED

19 May 1949

About 2100, 16 May 1949, I was walking in an easterly direction from the
recreation building toward my car in front of the Naval Air Station.  Moving to
the South I noticed a light moving from the west towards the east.  It rose
about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon and seemed to have a streak of fire
behind it.  I told LCDR ------, who was walking with me, to look at the object,
he remarked that it was traveling in a horizontal direction rather than falling
as meteors usually do.  A moment or two parts of the incident until I heard that
several pilots had sighted a strange light about the same time.
