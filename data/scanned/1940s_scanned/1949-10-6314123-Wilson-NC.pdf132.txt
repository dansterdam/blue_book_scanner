Capt. Ruppelt:
On Sat. July 5 I spoke at length in your Duty Officer Capt. James about another matter. Might possibly join with him and promised to send in a complete report including status etc. When I returned to Pittsburgh this article was in the morning paper. It was less of a report to compete so I'm sending it on ahead. My idea of a visible prop. saucer may be off the beam but it seems worth mentioning.

Sincerely,
[Redacted Signature]
Pittsburgh, Pa.
