Northern Lights Are Seen Here

For nearly six hours last night Bermudians were treated to the un-
usual sight of Northern Lights. Entries in the Hamilton Meteorological
Station's log indicate that the northern lights or otherwise known as the
Aurora Borealis â€” were visible from about 9.30 P. M. to 2 A. M. Appear-
ing to the north-northwest, they began with a reddish hue and changed
throughout the evening to a powerful white, which spread like a curtain.

The Lights which are seen frequently in the far North are very visible
this far South. When they are seen in these latitudes the area ther is ex-
ceptionally fine, the log station said. Last night conditions were were
still and fine.

John Jeffries, branch engineer for Cable and Wireless, Ltd., in Bermuda,
said the service was unnormal from about 11 P. M. to 6 A. M. As expected
he explained the station experienced fading on the wireless circuits.

This was the first time interference due to the aurora had been noticed
in Bermuda, he said, although in some other parts of the world it is not
uncommon
