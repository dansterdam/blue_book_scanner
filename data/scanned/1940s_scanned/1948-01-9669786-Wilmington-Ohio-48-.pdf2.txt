Lt. C.W. Thomas and Lt. Sims (5-02-26) were making a regular cross-country flight. They reported in to Columbus Airways who asked them if they saw any unusual object in the sky. They could see a large bright light off to the west. They estimated it to be below them, or about 3000 ft. It seemed to lower. The light was amber and looked like a large star or planet. It was about 15 miles away from them. The night was dark and clear over the east.
