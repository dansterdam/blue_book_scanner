"My *** following statement to JAC. L. ***, Homer, Michigan, do hereby make the following statement to Lieutenant Colonel *** as an agent of the Inspector General's Office, US Air Force.

On the 28th day of April 1949 at 09:15 *** I was sitting at my office at the Pet Mil:. Co. local feed ***ier, **d while looking out of the window, saw strange objects in the sky which first appeared to be sea gulls. Quickly going out doors and calling to a fellow worker, ****, who was working in the mill room of the plant, we both were able to observe that they were not gulls but a silvery colored discs rotating around in a wide circle at about a 45 degree angle and traveling due west. They seemed to be revolving around as if they were attached to an axel. I judged them to be between 300 and 400 ft. off the ground and traveling at about 40 miles per hour. After they had disappeared over the tree tops I and another co-worker who had just come out of the plant, jumped in my car and pursued after them on highway M-60. We traveled for about 3-1/2 miles west of town, but were unable to locate them. After returning back to town, I called the Jackson Citizen Patriot correspondent, LOTHIS TILLIONOI and informed her of my experience and then drove up town and informed RAY FUGIL, editor of the local paper.

The above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

(Signed)
