The image does not contain any photographs, it is a page from a document with text that is mostly illegible due to the quality of the image. 

Unfortunately, the text in the document is largely unreadable due to the low resolution and quality of the scan. There are some words and fragments that are visible but out of context, making it difficult to transcribe the content accurately. The upper right corner of the document seems to indicate "Incident #130," and below that "Date of Info: 17 May 1952." Other noticeable words are "ALONG FLIGHT PATH OF AC," "Below A/C," "than A/C," "TIME OF OBSERVATION," "DURATION OF OBSERVATION," and "TYPE OF OBSERVATION." 

Due to the quality of the image, I can only identify isolated words, but not complete sentences or the full context of the document. This looks like part of a standardized reporting form from Project Blue Book, but without clearer text, the specific information contained in this report cannot be determined.
