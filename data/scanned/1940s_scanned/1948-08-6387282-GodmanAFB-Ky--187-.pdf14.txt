INFO FOR Col. McCoy

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

The following message was telephoned by Major Mathews, T-2
Flight Service Center at 11:30, 19 Aug 48, to 5-1107:

"An unidentified flying object was reported to the Wright-
Patterson Flight Service Center at 1050 Eastern, 8-19-48, by
Lt. Colonel [...] Texas, executive officer, Godman Air Force Base,
Ky. The object was estimated to be 30,000 to 40,000 ft. high,
circular in shape, bright silver color, giving a bright reflection
from the sun. An F-51 was dispatched from Standiford AFB Ky to
observe object an[d] a report will be forwarded to Wright-
Patterson Flight Service Center as soon as available."

Major [...] said he would send us a confirming R&R.

Mr. [...] was given this information.

On receipt of the above information, I immediately got in touch
with Major [...] and learned that another report had been received
from Godman Field to the effect that there was no change in altitude,
that the aspect reading was 235° and the apparent elevation, 6°,
with Nash turnout at 12:50 stated that the object was now at 210°
Azimuth and apparent altitude of 5° to 5½°. This information was immediately phoned to Mr. [...] with the thought that it might be Venus.
Mr. [...] made a rough approximation of the whereabouts of Venus
at that particular time and although there was a slight variation in
figures, subsequent reports confirmed the fact that the object sighted
was probably Venus. For example, the reported position of the object
at TIFI was 235° Azimuth, 5° elevation, whereas the computed position
of Venus was 251° 37' Azimuth and 3° 31' elevation. At 11:50 the
aspect was reported as 210° and 5° to 5½° elevation, whereas Venus
was then 243° 44' Azimuth, 3° 17' elevation. The only other
bright star in this area is Pollux, however, no check was made against
its computed position since the Venus readings so closely approximated
those of the reported objects.
