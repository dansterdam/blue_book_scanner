discussed with Dr. People of this station the problems encountered in 
obtaining reliable information when observing unidentified objects.
Dr.  sent to Dr. People an information copy of his observations 
near Alamogordo, New Mexico on April 24, 1949. It is felt that although 
the principal factor - two hours of the past time is in the realm of the 
theoretical and this responsible for the unusually specific information 
contained in this report, is that Mr.  was made aware in advance of 
what factors should be observed in case such an object were sighted.
Therefore, it is urged that your office issue detailed advance observa-
tion instructions to people who might be in a position to make observations 
and turn in reports.

3. It is felt that instructional observing instructions are implied 
in the enclosed questionnaire. Item #12 is especially misleading, be-
cause many observers will probably determine that town or building the 
object may be over, unless the object corresponds to a low enough altitude 
so that its can be determined to be on either the near or far side of a 
known object.
