Incident #136, 136a -- S. Knoxville, Tennessee -- 30 June 1948

This incident answers well to the description of a typical
fireball: color -- orange; apparent construction -- fiery exhaust --
"streamer of bluish color trailing", manner of disappearance -- "over
horizon", and (in remark) "streamer emitted sparks."

All of the above fits the typical phenomena associated with
a night-time fireball.

One witness states that the object was in sight for three
minutes and the other states for three seconds. The lower time estimate
is clearly more in keeping with meteoric phenomena. It is also prob-
ably far more nearly accurate, since one is much more likely to grossly
overestimate than underestimate intervals of time.
