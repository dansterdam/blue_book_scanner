Please note that the text in the image is a bit blurry and incomplete, so I've transcribed the legible parts to the best of my ability. The document appears to be a standard administrative form, possibly related to the reporting and internal communication regarding an unidentified flying object, given the context of Project Blue Book you've mentioned.
