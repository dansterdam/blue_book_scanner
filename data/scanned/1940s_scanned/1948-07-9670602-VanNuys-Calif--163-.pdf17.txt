UNCLASSIFIED

Q. SHOULD: Do you feel that you were observing a definite object?

A. "Yes, it had a definite sharp outline - something I had never
seen before. At first I thought it might be a meteor coming
toward us. It didn't have the characteristics of gaseous forms-
comet and the outlines was to definite and sharp to be gaseous.
It instead appeared to be a definite material object. I had
even considered that it might be an astronomical object caught
in our Earth's rotation like the moon, but it travelled faster
than the sun so it couldn't have been. It was travelling three
times as fast as the sun and was going in the same direction as
the sun.

Q. SHOULD: Do you know any of the persons who observed this object per-
sonally?

A. No.
