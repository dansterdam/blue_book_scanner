FILE NO
1794 DISTRICT OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE BASE, NEW MEXICO

12 March 1953

Subject: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon
Over Green River, Utah the 12/13th

Reference: 1794th Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon
Investigation Report dated 2 March 1953

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

1. Reference is made to your interest upon the enclosed report
of an unidentified aerial object.

2. The photograph(s) mentioned in the enclosed report referring to
the alleged unidentified aerial object that is allegedly contained somewhere
on the microfilm in reference is too blurred, due to an extremely high closing
rate of the two objects, to have a fair feature. The 1794th District Office had
not possessed the original microfilm since the two objects were initially
photographed. Special Weapons Command has always been in possession
of the original microfilm. The Department, apparently under misunderstanding,
forwarded reprints obtained after a tract of this microfilm was uncovered
and traced to the Goody's hidden facility and subsequently led this office
back to the manufacturers of equipment and personnel.

3. The reprints now forwarded were forwarded for your information and
use and at no time were they represented as that of "flying saucers" or
flying objects that have received much conjecture of late with the public. No optical
illusions were contained in these microfilms, and what movies were received
have been forwarded.

This office cannot forward as requested for your information and perusal
a copy of the requested "good" picture that is assumed if your headquarters
has advertingly or inadvertently charged photographic coverages and that these are classified
and unobtainable tape.
