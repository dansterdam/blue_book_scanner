Incident #202 -- Newark AAF Base, New Jersey -- 3 November 1948

In everything but the luminosity, the object reported 
bore answers to the description of a slow-moving fireball. Since
it was in sight "one second or less," the first quarter moon was
probably, the lights of the city and the airport, providing back-
ground and foreground illumination, may have tended to diminish the
brilliance of the object. This time of day was most propitious for a 
slow-moving meteor. Unless a more likely explanation is forthcoming,
this incident may be tentatively ascribed to the flight of a fire-
ball.
