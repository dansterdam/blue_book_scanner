Incident #101 -- near Junction City, Kansas -- 24 October 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.
The description given is sketchy and would be entitled
to no weight whatever if it had not been reported by a responsible
USAF officer. With size, shape, tints in sight, motions, and sound
not stated, it is impossible to say anything further than that this
seems to be a typical example of the "garden variety" of flying
saucer.
