other attempts by the crew of this hypothetical lost plane to make a
position known wer observed. And finally, two AACS Operators
(who had no financial o [?] responsibilities) observed slight variations
the night of December 30 reported loud thumps the same sort or anoma-
lous sounds as heard at Station 370 at 0540 on the early morning of
December 31. These sounds were heard for several minutes and were
reported to have receded slowly toward the southeast.

7. If we assume that Stations 540 and 350 observed the same sound
sources at 2010 and 2020, that these sources are found to project into
point lying near the road leading west out of Vaughn, into joint
Station 340. On the basis of the elevation determinations made at Station
350, it is furthermore found that the first source would be about 700 feet
lower in elevation than Station 340 and the second source approximately 1350
feet lower than this station. These differences in elevation would again
seem to suggest that the sound sources may have been situated on or near the
paved highway. However, the very careful observation made by our experienced
transit man, Inspector Aukutt, at Station 350, 2020 approximately 1350 feet
lower than Station 340 should surely make us entirely incompatible with
car than station 350. Actually, hes heard a DC3 airplane. In this
his sound source was at an elevation of not more than 11,000 feet above the
horizontal plane to which Station 350. It might therefore, vary seem approxi-
mately 10,000 feet above not below, Station 340. This incompatibility larg-
discrepancy shows that our intial assumption - the inaccepable and there-
fore seems impossible to establish a concordance between observation made
at Stations 340 and 350 PR so it to be a bogey warning, i.e. during the time
when the observers at Station 350 heard the sound only from inside their
observations in a control to hide observers and Station 350, to make their
observations in the open air. The observers at Station 340, on the other
Station 340 to audibly heard a sound emnating from a lighted aircraft
above them, in accordance with the condition imposed on them by observ-
observations, what they heard might well hayve been so distorted by the aetherial
tonalities surrounding them that their perception led to all sorts of noise.
to harshly traffic a rumens and by their mis observation to employ all naga-
tive observations were measured for them at Station 350 on January 5.

8. In sharp contrast to the discordane noted in the observations pre-
ceding the bogey warming at 2010, the open-air observations made at and
immediately following the warning show a quite satisfactory concordance.
In fact, if we assume that all three stations, 340, 350, and 390 were listen-
ing to the same sound source at 2050 and shortly thereafter, then the actual
location the even was several 100's of miles from the actual
observation observed at Station 340 would, 230 degrees, as computed from the angular
and at Station 390 is 10,136 feet. If we pair Station 340 and 350, the
projection of the sound source on the surface of the earth lies approximately
the coordinates 106° 17' 55° 32', while if we pair stations 390 and 350,
the coordinates of the projection of the sound source on the earth differ
from the above by less than one-half minute in longitude and by less than
a minute and a half in latitude. In view of the nature of the noise observed
