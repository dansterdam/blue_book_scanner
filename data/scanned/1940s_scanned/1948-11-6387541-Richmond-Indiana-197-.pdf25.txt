Strange Glow In Eastern Sky
Attracts Notice; Picture Taken

Richmond, Ind—A
One of those strange bright
lights in the sky attracted the
interest of a few local persons
early Friday morning.
No one was able to say wheth-
er it was one of those "flying sau-
cers" or not. But it remained in
the eastern sky for nearly 20 min-
utes and at least one photograph-
er took a picture of the night
visitor.
Two calls were recieved at The
Palladium-Item at 4:35 a.m. about
a "light which resembled a flare
hanging from a parachute."
According to reports, it was
visible about five to 10 times
the size of a normal star. One per-
son said it looked "like a kin-
dled flare."
Dale Stevens, sports writer who
happened to be in the office writ-
ing some stories, said he thought
the light flickered a great deal, and
it "seemed to grow dim and
bright. The sky at the time was
clear and stars were visible." Stevens
said. "I watched it for a few
minutes before I took a picture of
it. By 4:35 a.m. it could moved
slightly eastward, entirely.
An observer said he was impressed
by its size and brilliance and the
fact that it flickered and seemed
to swing.
Professor Berlin Earls, member
ber of the Earlham college facul-
falty, indicated that perhaps it might
have been a flare dropped from
a passing plane.
