SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

On 28 October 1949, THE KNOXVILLE N-E-S-S S-E-N-T-I-N-E-L carried an article which
stated that a Mrs. Winnie Lytle, Old Maryville Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, reported 
that about 1530 hours on 27 October 1949, she sighted two (2) bright looking objects
flying high and fast over her home. The newspaper quoted Mrs. Lytle as saying, that 
the objects were tube shaped, noiseless and about a yard in length, and that they
looked like airplanes when the sun shined on them.            (C-2)

On 28 October 1949, Mrs. Winnie Lytle, Housewife, Old Maryville Pike, Route
#3, Knoxville, Tennessee, was interviewed and stated that while standing in her
back yard at approximately 1530 hours, 27 October 1949, she sighted two (2) objects
which were flying toward the South (180 degrees) at approximately the same altitude
and speed as commercial type aircraft. She said that she first sighted the first object 
by coincidence while looking up at the sky. Then she first sighted the object it
was directly overhead, and was flying in a level flight. She said that the object
was shaped like a straight tube, and that no openings either in the side or rear
were visible. There was no evidence of vapor trails or exhaust, nor was there any
sound from the object. The informant said that she kept this object in sight for 
approximately one (1) minute before it disappeared from her vision in approximately 
a forty-five (45) degree angle. Mrs. Lytle continued by saying that immediately 
after the first object disappeared, she again looked overhead and sighted another 
object, which was identical to the first one in shape and size, and that it was
flying at the same altitude, in the same direction and at the same rate of speed 
as the first object. This object was also sighted for approximately one (1)
minute before it disappeared. The informant stated that from the reflection of the 
sun on these two objects, they appeared to be constructed of metal similar to that
used in airplanes. She said that the sky at the time was void of clouds. Mrs.
Lytle further stated that she was alone at the time the objects were sighted. (B-2)

AGE/SEX NEG: Mrs. Lytle is approximately fifty-five (55) years of age, and of
        about average intelligence. All her answers were made without hesitation.
        It is not believed to report the above incident to Headquarters by telephone 
        with negative results since the informant was not obtainable until about 1715, on
        28 October 1949, and no personnel were in the office at that time.

On 29 October 1949, Officials of the United States Weather Bureau, McGee-
Tyson Airport, Knoxville, Tennessee, were contacted and stated that weather balloons
were released by that Bureau on 27 October 1949, at 0405, 1000, 1602 and 2203; but
there were no other meteorological instruments were released. They said that the balloons
that no approximate velocity (30) inches in diameter, and that the color of the first 
balloon was red, the second was orange, the third was yellow and fourth was orange.
The officials furnished the following information relative to winds aloft on 27
October 1949:
