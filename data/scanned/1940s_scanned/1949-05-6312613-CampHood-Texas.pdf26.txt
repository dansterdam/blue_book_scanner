As the result of the emergency landing, four fence posts bent completely 
out of shape, and forty-five feet of fencing badly mangled, torn loose 
and stretched. As the pilot was a civilian, the matter was referred 
to the F. B. I., and a report submitted from San Antonio Field Office 
of that organization indicates the object to have been CHARLES EDWIN 
CARLOW, residing at 1316 Wallace Avenue, Taylor, Texas. The aircraft 
was a Ballanca Monowing, red in color; No. NC 74403. Investigation by 
the F. B. I., indicated nothing unfavorable regarding subject's loyalty 
to the United States.
