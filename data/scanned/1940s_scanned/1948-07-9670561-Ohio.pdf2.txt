Here's the text output from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #140, a -- Gahanna, Ohio -- 1 July 1948

The object sighted here was probably a bright, slow-
moving meteor. It is described as a "bright yellow/white light,"
moving at a "horrific" rate of speed, and was in sight for two
or three seconds.

This investigator is again struck by the reference to
the ubiquitous moon. "Bright moonlit night" was reported; at the
stated hour of observation, the moon had not yet risen.

SHF

UNCLASSIFIED

RESTRICTED

[Stamp on the right side appears to read but is partially obscured]
KIRTLAND AFB, N.M.

The stamp on the right contains reference numbers and dates, including "JUL" (July), "26," and "1952," while the stamp in the middle of the document has the letters "SHF" visible, and the bottom left part of the document is stamped with "RESTRICTED".
