NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On the evening of July 3, 1949 at about 10-20 - 10.30 P.M. I saw a strange aircraft at about 5 miles distant at about 40-45 degrees angle, would not guess as to height possibly 2 miles.

Outline appeared very faint, do not know length but would guess as about 500 ft long and about 50 ft high, had 3 or 4 large round windows which emitted a very bright light and trailed a tail of ship was going from South to North at a great rate of speed was seen from the top of the house on the horizon in the south to the haze in the horizon where disappeared, about 10-15 seconds.
This craft was not making any sail, but from its speed and shape it is not based on this clay marble which we call earth.

I have reported this craft to Dr. Draper of the Buhl Planetarium & Inst Pgh, Pa., and he did not have any reports of this ship.
