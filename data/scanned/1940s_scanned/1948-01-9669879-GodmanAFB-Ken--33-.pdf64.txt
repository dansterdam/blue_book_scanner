The image is a map, not a photograph. Since there is no photograph of a UFO or related phenomena to describe, I'll proceed with being an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the output of all the text found in the document:

Be certain to observe location of U.S. Interstate Highways

The map details a web of roads and highways across a region, along with various city and town names. There are several tables at the bottom of the map with alphabetical listings of place names and corresponding map coordinates. Unfortunately, due to the low resolution and possible degradation of the document, accurately transcribing the entire text verbatim is highly challenging. If you require specific details from the text, such as certain place names or map coordinates, please provide more precise instructions or a clearer image.
