center. He further described the objects as shiny objects that were silver in color.
Mr. ________ further declared that he viewed the objects at a forty-five degree angle,
and that the objects appeared to be at the height of a thirty-five story building and
at a distance of five to eight miles. He related that the objects appeared to gain
very fast and that they stayed along side his vehicle for approximately fifteen seconds.
