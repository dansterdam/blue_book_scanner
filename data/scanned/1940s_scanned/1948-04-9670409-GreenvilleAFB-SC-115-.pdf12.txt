Witnesses were attracted by sound of fighter aircraft in vicinity.
They started searching the sky for the aircraft and sighted the
objects. From first sighting, the witnesses thought object might
be weather balloons. However, when they accelerated so rapidly in
a northerly heading, they determined the object could not be balloons.
They were in a trail formation on a north-south line and several
miles they went out of sight within a few seconds. From one 
rapid change in the southerly position to their disappearance, a period
of approximately two (2) minutes elapsed, during which time objects were
in a stationary position for approximately one (1) minute.
