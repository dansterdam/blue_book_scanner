s (distance object traveled) - 2 times the distance from point of observation 
to the object times the sin of Â½ the angle 
subtended.
There are times involved which involves variables exact two of which must
be known to solve for a third. In the case of this observation only one 
known value was available, i. e. the angle subtended. The observers had no
possible way to determine either the speed of the object nor its distance from 
them.

The observers arbitrarily selected 2500 ft. per second (1700 mph) and 
solved the equation. This is how the altitude of 30,000 ft was obtained.
We may just as easily select 70 mph for the speed of the object and 
find that it would have been at 800ft. of size in the first instance equals 
105 ft. in length; in the latter an object of less than one foot length.

These values can be calculated using the following formulae:

2
350 x .020 = .00035 radians

.00035 radians times the distance of object from point of observation 
equals the length of the object.
