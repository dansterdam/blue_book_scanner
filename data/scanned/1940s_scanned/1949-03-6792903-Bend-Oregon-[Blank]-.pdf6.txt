DETAILS (cont'd)

3. On 2 August 1949, in [redacted] Field,
California, signed the following statement:

"While fishing with a party of friends about
two and a half miles up the Rogue River from its
mouth at Gold Beach, Oregon, at approximately 15:00
p.m., 24 May 1949, my attention was called to an 
object in the sky. The object was to the East of
us about one (1) mile, at approximately 5000 feet
altitude. With the naked eye little but a glare and
silvery glint could be seen. But after watching it
for approximately one minute and a half was handed
a pair of 6-power binoculars by [redacted]
It was then possible to see that the object was 
roughly circular in shape and appeared to be 30 to
35 feet in diameter. It had somewhat the cross
sectional appearance of a pancake, being thicker
in the center than at the edges. A small triangular
flap fin started approximately in the middle and
grew gradually sharper to the rear as the object
traveled. When first sighted the object was moving 
very slowly. As I watched it through the glasses,
it picked up speed and when it vanished from sight,
approximately 90 seconds later, it was traveling as
fast or faster than a jet plane. After first sighting
it seen, it had no openings or protuberances of any
kind other than the fin and there was neither sight
nor sound of any driving force. It was a clear day
and no clouds in the sky, and the sun was at our
backs as we watched the object which vanished in a
southesasterly direction, mostly south.
