Capt ██████ and his Copilot ██████ stated that on 4 Aug at sunset they sighted and followed a "flying saucer" northwest of Bethel, Alaska. The object which appeared as eleven or larger in size than a C-54 and 
blue in color appeared silhouetted against a brilliant evening sky in 
order to avoid a possible collision (being unable at first to determine in what direction the object was moving) they reversed their DC3 at
in order to avoid possible collision. The object crossed their path at 
right angles to them. Seeing that it was moving away from them at a very rapid rate and flying at an altitude of from 500 to 1,000 ft they swung in behind it and followed it at an air speed of 170 MPH but the thing was out of sight in four minutes. They state the object was smooth-surfaced and streamlined and resembled somewhat a C-54 without motors (from the rear) and was without wings or any reliable means of propulsion whatever. Wind was negligible and it was on a NW course.

Official in Charge of the Airlines for which ██████ was working states that the pilot is not the "imaginative type".
