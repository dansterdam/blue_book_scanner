The photograph on this document is very blurry and lacks clear details, making it difficult to describe specific features of the content. However, there is a discernible, light vertical streak on the left side of the image, so it is possible that this could be interpreted as some sort of fleeting light or object captured at the moment of the photo, which could be related to the report's context of a UFO sighting.
