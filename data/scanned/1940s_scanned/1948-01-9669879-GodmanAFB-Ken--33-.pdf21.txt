Mantell Case, January 1948

23 July 1964

Coroner
Simpson County
Franklin, Kentucky

Dear Coroner,

In January 1948, at Franklin, Kentucky, an aircraft accident
occurred and the county coroner, Mr. Harry W Booker, examined the
body of the pilot, Captain Thomas F Mantell, Jr.

The Federal Aviation Agency is conducting an investigation of
a similar accident in which the cause of death is considered iden-
tical. They have expressed a desire for medical records or any
other information regarding the condition of the pilot's body after
the crash. I am enclosing a copy of their letter to us regarding
this information. The case file at Wright-Patterson contains infor-
mation on the wreckage but nothing concerning the pilot's condition.

Any information which you may have, such as the autopsy report,
medical findings, photos of the body, etc., would be appreciated by
the Federal Aviation Agency. We request that you forward any
available data which you may have to:

Dr. Richard G. Snyder, Ph. D., AA-119
Federal Aviation Agency
P O Box 1082
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73101

Sincerely,

ERIC T de JONCKHEERE
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Technology
