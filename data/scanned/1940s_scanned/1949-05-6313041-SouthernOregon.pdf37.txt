of refraction give curved paths to light propagation. Although there is little evidence to support the optical anomaly conclusion, is there reason to exclude it? The arbitrary phenomena observed is the probability of physical disturbances being the phenomena observed is two-tenths.

(3) The conventional airborn vehicles, when viewed from a distance at unfavorable aspects, do present the appearance of ellipsoid, have the appearance of reflection observed and commonly frequent the atmosphere close to the earth. However, when viewed from less than 10 miles over a period of minutes, most aircraft would present a recognizable configuration. The arbitrarily assigned probability is one-tenth.

(4) For non-conventional aircraft, one must say that no such configurations are known to Allied aircraft designers; that no propulsion systems capable of moving a fantastic (from our present aeronautical engineering knowledge) drag forces through the distances commensurate with the spheres of our influence are known. Yet that exists as a possibility and the arbitrarily assigned probability is one-tenth.

4. On a scale of probability where six-tenths is the minimum necessary to make a prediction, we can intelligently make no conclusions as to the nature of the objects observed.
