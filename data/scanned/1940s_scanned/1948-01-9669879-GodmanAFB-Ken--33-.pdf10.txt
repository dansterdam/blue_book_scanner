The photograph at the bottom of the document is quite blurry and lacks clear details. It appears to be an image taken from inside an airplane cockpit pointing out towards the sky, with a portion of the aircraft's structure visible. A faint, dark, round object can be seen in the lower region of the photograph, which might be the object of interest relevant to the UFO report. The quality of the photo does not allow for sharp details to be discerned.

b. It is doubtful that Venus could be observed by the unaided eye from the ground
or 15,000 feet as it would probably be hidden by the high degree of sky brightness due
to its proximity to the Sun.

c. Jupiter is the only other planet within ±90° of the Sun during this period and
its magnitude of brightness is only 1.4 as compared with—4.3 of Venus, making it impos-
sible to observe with the unaided eye. However, the following figures on the Moon are
submitted for your information:

Time Local Altitude Azimuth
10:30 25°00' 197°
10:50 26°00' 201°
11:00 25°00' 211°
11:30 20°00' 217°
12:00 17°00' 223°
