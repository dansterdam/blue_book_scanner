UNCLASSIFIED

Objects were brought to Mrs. [redacted] attention by Mrs. [redacted] who
saw "a most unusual thing drop out of the sky. I think it was a flying 
saucer as I have never seen anything equal to it before!" She then states that 
she saw what appeared to be 2 round orange colored discs or balls, the one 
being smaller, and that these objects appeared to descend vertically toward 
the earth in a slow and steady manner until disappearing from their sight.
Mrs. [redacted] stated that she saw one object with two objects (apparently related), but 
that they were originally one object which separated at about the time Mrs. 
[redacted] sighted it.

All witnesses+ (Mrs. [redacted], her son and Mrs. [redacted]) agree on the following:

Color and size - that of an old-fashioned gas light which had a yellow, red or 
amber shade. Outline was distinct and did not appear false 
or irregular. No noise or sound of kind. No smoke or exhaust 
trails seen. Swam[e] oval to round, all stated. No motion pattern 
not to their knowledge a balloon, dirigible, flare, or parachute 
or any other known object and all seemed to have a pretty good 
knowledge as to the appearance of the foregoing.

NOTE: Witness appeared calm and normally sensible in her responses to various 
questions.
