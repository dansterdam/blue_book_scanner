NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Certificate

    I, 1st Lt. James J. Giles, AO-752222, certify that the following is true and
correct to the best of my knowledge;

    On 31 May 1949 at around 1110 hours I was flying an F-80 on a check ride with
Lt. Nelson. Lt. Nelson had taken off a few minutes with instructions to meet me
over the field at 20,000 ft. When I got to 20,000 feet I started a slow orbit arou-
nd the field trying to spot the other F-80. My attention was caught by a reflecion
out to sea at an altitude higher than mine. I continued to turn while watching the
object, It was twenty to thirty (20-30) miles from shore, above 30,000 feet and
moving at a high rate of speed at the base of a cirrus overcast. The object moved
in a Northerly heading for seven to ten (7-10) miles and then disappeared into the
overcast.

    I continued on the mission and reported the incident to my operations officer
after the office opened in the afternoon.

                                       /s/ James J. Giles
                                       JAMES J. GILES
                                       1st Lt., USAF
