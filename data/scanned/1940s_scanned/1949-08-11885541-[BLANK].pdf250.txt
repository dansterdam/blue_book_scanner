for instance by making an artificial satellite - but this presumably is not what has been observed.

SUMMARY, PART II, SECTION B.

Several unorthodox means of supporting or propelling a solid object, have been considered - all are impracticable. This finding lends credence to the tentative proposed assumption of Part II, that the objects are supported and propelled by some normal means, or else that they are not solids. No discussion of the type of Part II, Section C. can, in principle, of course, be complete.

PART II, SECTION C. POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE REPORTS.

CLASSIFICATION I. NATURAL TERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA.

1) The observations may be due to some effect such as ball lightning. The writer has no suggestions on this essentially meteorological subject.

2) The objects may be some kind of animal. Even in the celebrated case of incident 172 where the light was chased by a P-51 for half an hour and which was reported by the pilot to be intelligently directed, we can make this remark. For consider that an intelligence capable of making so remarkable a device would not be likely to play around in so idle a manner as is described by the pilot.

In this connection it would be well to examine if some of the lights observed at night were not fire-flies.

3) The observed objects may be hallucinatory or psychological in origin. It is of prime importance to study this possibility because we can learn from it something of the character of the population; its response under attack; and also something about the reliability of visual observation.

One would like to assume that the positions held by many of the ro-
