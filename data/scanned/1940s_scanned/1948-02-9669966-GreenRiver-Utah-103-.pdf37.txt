3. A determined effort is under way to check up on the veracity
(and sanity!) I had no either seen nor talked to -------, but another member
of the Institute of Aeronautics purity (Dr. -------, an instructor in the
Dept. of Mathematics) who did go to -------- (who is a well-to-do 
farmer) to be sincere and very badly scared. Of course vagueness to a big
meteorite fall would scare one as badly as an atom bomb but how could it
produce such testimony as ---------
   
The three meteorite incidents from the month of Fall of 1945, November 20
(from which no tektites have been recovered and!) through the sequence
of six White Sands culminating into the Port ------ of December 8, 1946,
coupled with a total eight as the USSR incident, convinces me that either
the earth is under a most unusual cosmic bombardment or many of the
eyeballs are not meteorites at all. While I still cling to the meteoritic
hypothesis, it is clear that while ever statements are the right ones, the
situation cries aloud for thorough investigation.
