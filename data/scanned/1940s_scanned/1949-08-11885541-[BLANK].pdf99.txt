Incident #28 -- Newark AFB Base, New Jersey -- 8 November 1948

In summarizing the luminosity, the object reported
here answers to the description of a slow-moving fireball. Since
it was in sight "one second or less," the first quarter moon and,
presumably, the lights of the city and the airport, providing back-
ground and foreground illumination, may have worked to diminish the
brilliance of the object. This time of day was most propitious for a
slow-moving meteor. Unless a more likely explanation is forthcoming,
this incident can be tentatively ascribed to the flight of a fire-
ball.
