The graph shows peaks and valleys representing the intensity of sightings over a period from 1947 to 1949, with the highest peak appearing in 1947. The horizontal axis has months labeled from January 1947 to March 1949, while the vertical axis has numbers 0 to 25, likely indicating the number or intensity of sightings. The text at the bottom right corner of the image seems to be part of the classification note, perhaps indicating a page or document number: "UNCLASSIFIED 611750".
