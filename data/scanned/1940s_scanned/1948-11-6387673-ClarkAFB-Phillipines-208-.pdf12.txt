UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #203 — Clark AF Base, Phillipine Islands — 17 November 1948

The limited information in the description of this incident 
can be explained as refering to the trail and explosion smoke left
by a Fireball. The white exhaust trail extending some one to ten miles,
the "Flak-like" terminal burst, the estimated altitude, and the color
and tl.e in sight all concur in ascribing this sighting to a Fireball.
The time of day of the observation is also in agreement.
