Accident, Major

At about 1600 CST, two pilots, flying a Reynolds
Metal C-47 were on VHF channel, over Bardstown,
Ky. when they heard someone say they were at
33,000 feet and couldnâ€™t see anything. They
landed at Bowman Field, Louisville about 1615 CST

My personnel opinion of the accident
is that Mantell, an aggressive pilot, attempted
to push the object as long as possible, even
though he realized his danger from lack of oxygen.
At about 25,000 feet I believe he passed out from
anoxia and the plane continued to climb to about 
30,000 feet where it done three lazy circles &
and went into a power dive, slowly rotating
to the left with the canopy not out. I believe that
he reached compressibility speed at about 15,000 feet
and the left wing flew off, part started to flaps
and the rest of the plane tore nearly in two with
right rad wing down for a split second, then started
to south direction, scattering the 21 ft. parts
to farthest away. The witness whose report 
we got of a spiral when it started down. Mantell, the left 
wing came off the right wing acted as a fin or
rudder for the fuselage and headed the fuselage
straight down, parallel to the ground. The plane
did not burn upon impact The pilot which shattered
at 1518 CST.
