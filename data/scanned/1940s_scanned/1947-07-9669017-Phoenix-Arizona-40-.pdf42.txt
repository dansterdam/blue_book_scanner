SUBJECT Identification of Subject Matter (as per sample)

TO MCIA FROM MCI DATE 19 Feb 43 COMMENT NO. 1

1. Reference is made to the films taken by Mr. _________ (Incident #40) which were
Forwarded for examination. The following data were derived from a study of the specimen:

2. It is concluded that the image is of true photographic nature, and is not
due to imperfections in the emulsization, or lack of development in the section in question.
The image shows too hard an edge, and the proper type of distortion due to the type of
shutter used, the speed of the object and the fixed speed of the shutter. This "trializing off" combined a good indication within in this report.

b, The report states the object was seen at approximately 2000 feet at the
time of exposure. The observer also reports being able to see clearly a canopy or enclosure. The visual quality of a reverse personal would show for this perspective, but certainly not much further as the subject had low visual contrast, being gray against
a gray sky. If we can establish the distance from camera to subject, we will have
quantity fig. The report states that a 620 camera was used, indicating several possi-
bilities, since the 620 is nomenclature for the spooling and width of the film we may
have negatives 2 1/4 x 2 3/4" and extract from the same. The subject had been ruled out,
it was not possible to establish the exact frame size samples 2 x 2 1/2 size was out and
larger size 3 1/4 x 4 1/4". If that 3 1/4" film. This 29th film, film had a small lens, it
would be 4", said using 2000 feet as the approximate subject distance and the image size
at 764/7, we have an approximate size of 44 feet as the diagonal of the object. Now if
we choose the latter value of 5" for focal length, we have an approximate value of 55'
for the diagonal. Points of measurement are indicated from X to X on Exhibit "A."

c. It should be pointed out, the need for more detail in reports is brought
out in this report. A summary would suggest the following points:

(1) Name of camera, type of film used, developer as well as time and tem-
perature, exposure time, focal length of lens and F value used.

(2) If possible, the camera should be aimed to include some ground and
horizon as this will help fix this distance from camera to subject by
imaging reference points. These reference points can be referred to
for evaluation.
