incident #24 -- weiser, Idaho -- 12 June 1947

There is nothing in the description of this incident that is 
fatal to the hypothesis that the objects observed were parts of a 
"double fireball," but any such identification must remain uncertain.

The most convincing element favoring the meteoric hypothesis 
is the persistent train. Fireballs occasionally leave trains that per-
sist for over an hour.

As far as trajectory is concerned, this is in agreement with 
that to be expected from a meteor on its way out from the sun (it having 
gone toward the sun several weeks previously and now being on its return 
journey toward outer space). Such a fireball would travel relatively slowly, and could appear to "shoot out from the sun" and to travel 
in a southeasterly direction.

The absence of bright flare and of noise is not unusual, since 
reported daylight meteors are frequently not luminous (but do leave a 
trail), and often no noise is heard.

Nor is the fact that there were two such objects fatal to the 
hypothesis. The objects could easily have been single and have broken 
into two, either in its journey around the sun or upon entering the earth's 
atmosphere. There have been several cases of comets that were single 
on their trip toward the sun and double on the way out. Since comets and 
meteors are closely related as far as structure is concerned, the double 
feature is entirely possible.
