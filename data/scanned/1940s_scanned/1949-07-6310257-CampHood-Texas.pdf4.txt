The text is partially obscured in some areas, but the OCR has been applied to the visible text. It appears to be part of a standardized form for reporting radar sighting of unknown objects, possibly related to UFO sightings or investigations. The "N.A." likely stands for "Not Applicable" and parts of the form have been marked "UNCLASSIFIED." There are also markings indicating the document has been downgraded to "UNCLASSIFIED" after a certain time interval.
