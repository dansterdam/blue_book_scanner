The image provided is very unclear and seems to be a photocopy of a document with poor quality. It appears to have a waveform or a line drawing towards the bottom of the page, annotated with "27c." There's no discernible photograph nor any descriptive elements indicating a photograph in this image. The text above the waveform is mostly illegible due to the quality of the copy; however, I can attempt to transcribe some of the visible text:

"...objects...could not tell...altitude...one object was bright...object...sonic...it moved in the manner of a kite and did not...faster...or...(sound of a plane was heard)."

Unfortunately, the lack of clarity in the image prevents a more detailed and reliable transcription. It's important to note that without clearer text, providing an accurate transcription is challenging.
