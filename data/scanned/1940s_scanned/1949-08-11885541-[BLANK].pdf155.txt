(4) Jumping of gap by lightning indoors.
    (When lightning strikes a house, lightning streamers 
    may jump gaps such as between pipes within the house,
    thus causing a bright flash of limited extent. After-
    image is generally formed on the retina and movements  
    of eye produce apparent movements of the illuminated
    region.)

(5) A cloud-to-ground lightning stroke with an associate,
    horizontally-directed, moving potential wave may
    possibly produce a transient horizontal potential
    gradient sufficiently intense to initiate electrical 
    discharges.
    (Such discharges would involve luminous darts moving
    at high speed and may not over irregular trajectories,
    produce in some cases at least, more-or-less hori-
    zontally directed, sinuous, ribbon-like or tubular 
    paths. If there is a heavy concentration of electrical
    charges near the earth beneath the thunderstorm the
    triggering of a discharge by the transient potential
    gradient may yield horizontal lightning; such lightning
    a relatively slow propagation rate and long duration.)

(6) A lightning discharge that strikes and runs along a
    conductor such as power or telephone lines and flashes-
    over or jumps the gaps at breaks produces a brilliant
    illumination at the gaps that may be mistaken for ball
    lightning.

(7) A piece of wire with attached light object that is car-
    ried aloft by the gusty winds and turbulence attending
    thunderstorm or tornado may serve to facilitate con-
    duction of lightning currents and yield streamers at
    its ends during discharges.

(8) Spurious cases.

        objects, such as doorknobs.
