1. The attached copy of report from the Commanding Officer, USCGC BIBB
regarding an unidentified radar target, is self-explanatory and forwarded for
your information.

2. Also enclosed are two copies of a report received from the Commanding
Officer, Coast Guard Air Station, San Diego, California with reference to the
sighting of vapor trails. This report was apparently submitted by Coast Guard
aviation personnel because of the local attention they attracted and to throw
light on subsequent wild reports that might be received from unqualified observers
from that area.

By direction of the Commandant.
