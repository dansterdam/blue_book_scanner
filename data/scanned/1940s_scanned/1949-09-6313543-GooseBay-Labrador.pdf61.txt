Large maps of each State and of Alaska showing
the areas covered by topographic and geologic atlas folios
issued by the United States Geological Survey may be obtained
free. Copies of the standard topographic maps may be purchased
for 10 cents each; some special maps are sold at different prices.
A discount of 40 percent is allowed on an order amounting to
$5 or more at the retail price. The discount is allowed on an
order for maps alone, either of one kind or in any assortment,
or for maps together with geologic folios. The geologic folios
are sold for 25 cents or more each, the price depending on the
size of the folio. A circular describing the folios will be sent
on request.

Applications for maps or folios should be accompanied by
cash, draft, or money order (not postage stamps) and should be
addressed to

THE DIRECTOR,
United States Geological Survey,
Washington, D. C.
November 1937.

The remaining part of the document shows various symbols used on maps and are labeled according to their representation, such as "Water" (printed in blue), various types of roads, tunnels, power transmission lines, and others. The labels are too small and blurry to be read accurately through OCR capabilities.
