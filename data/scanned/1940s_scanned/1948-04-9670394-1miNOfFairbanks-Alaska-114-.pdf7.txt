Incident #14 -- Fairbanks, Alaska -- 16 April 1948

There is nothing astronomical in this incident.

The description answers that of a manouvering plane re-
flecting sunlight. The moonstation is noted; report states,
"weather clear and visibility unrestricted," whereas weather so-
quence shows partial cloud coverage. This would not, of course,
necessarily have prevented sun reflection from aircraft.
