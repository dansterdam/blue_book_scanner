The image appears to be a hand-drawn black and white sketch, not a photograph. It depicts a street view of buildings with roofs and chimneys, with a representation of a UFO in the sky. On the left side of the sketch, there are two circular inserts providing closer views of the UFO from different angles, labeled "SEEN CLOSE" and "SIDE VIEW".

The text on the drawing is as follows:
SEEN CLOSE
ANGL. AS BELOW

SIDE VIEW

At the bottom right corner, there is a small piece of text that seems to be a reference or filing note:
2-4-7J
