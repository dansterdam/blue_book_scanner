The image contains what appears to be a photo of a page with a photograph or illustration. In the photograph or illustration, there is an object that could be interpreted as a classic "flying saucer" shapeâ€”a horizontally elongated, somewhat cylindrical or disk-like object with a smaller dome on top. There are various annotations on the paper; however, the quality and resolution of the image may prevent accurate text recognition.

As for acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition), due to the quality of the scan, the text is not legible enough to accurately transcribe. Any attempt to do so would likely lead to significant errors. If you can provide a clearer image or additional context, I may be able to offer more assistance.
