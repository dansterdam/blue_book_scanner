Incident #228 - near Vaughn, New Mexico - latter part of 1947
3 or 4 November 1947
22 November 1947

It is difficult to ascertain whether the objects described 
in this report belong to the general group of "flying discs" or 
"flashes," or not. The description here is sufficiently different 
from the "variety to indicate that they do not" the characteristic 
this green color is not mentioned.

It is probable, however, that these engines/aircraft, 
all occurring at approximately 2200 hours and in the same locality,
can be explained as astronomical phenomena. Furthermore, this stated
altitude and distance are entirely out of keeping; this fact might
be dismissed as an illusion, common in the observation of fireballs,
if the instance were isolated. The weight of the evidence, however,
inclines to the conclusion that the objects were man-made devices
and part of some scientific experiment, so common in that section 
of the country.
