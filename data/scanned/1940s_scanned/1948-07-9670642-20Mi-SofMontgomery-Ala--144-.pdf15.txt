DETAILS (Cont'd)

Q. 15. Did you read the newspaper account of the two civilian pilots
who saw this strange object about the same time and did the
paper's description seem to refer to the object you saw?

A. 15. I read the write up about the rate of speed. I don't see how
they could tell if it had square or round windows but the
description seemed to fit my impressions.

Q. 17. Was there anyone with you when you saw this object?

A. 17. No Sir. I was standing in front of No. 2 engine and I tried
to call the co-pilot's attention to the object in the sky. He
had already put his headgear on before I could get his attention
and the object was gone.

Q. 18. With whom did you first discuss this matter?

A. 18. I called the tower and asked them if they saw it. They didn't.

Q. 19. What was their reaction regarding this object?

A. 19. They thought I was drunk or seeing things.

Q. 20. Were you unusually fatigued at this time?

A. 20. No Sir, I had been merely reading Air Force magazines prior to
this time.

Q. 21. Have you ever had occasion to read much or study Air Force
magazines, experiments with guided missiles, objects, or similar
material?

A. 21. No Sir, only what I could get out of Air Force and Aviation
magazines.

Q. 22. Were you in the Air Force during the war?

A. 22. Yes Sir, I was an Aircraft Engine Mechanic with a rating of
Buck Sergeant in the Ninth Air Force.

Q. 23. Is there anyone else on the Base who saw this particular object
that you know of?

A. 23. No Sir.

Q. 24. What type of construction, color, size, and material did this
object appear to resemble?
