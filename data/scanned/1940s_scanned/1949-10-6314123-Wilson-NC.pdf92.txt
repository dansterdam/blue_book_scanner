DETAILS                                   UNCLASSIFIED

1. This investigation was requested by District Commander,
1st OSI District.

AT MANCHESTER. NEW HAMPSHIRE

2. This is a joint investigation of Special Agent ROOS: S.
MACDONALD and the writer.

3. On 20 October 1949, at approximately 1750 hours, an un-
identified, unconventional aircraft was sighted by ****** ****** at
the intersection of Tanjert, N. H., while sitting in an automobile at
N. H. Only one unidentified object was observed, and no celestial
phenomena were known to have taken place at that time. Object was
sighted over an area about 15 miles west of Hooksett, New Hampshire
according to ******. This attention was first drawn to the object
by an apparent explosion and a visible ball of flame.

4. ****** stated that the object was approximately 15 to
20 miles northwest from his point of observation. At the time he
noticed it, the missile had just burst into flames of a white color
and was at an altitude of about 3500 to 4000 feet. The object seemed
to be diving straight down and was in ********** sight for about 15 or
20 seconds.

5. ****** could not describe the shape or color of the
object since it was in flames when he first saw it. There were no
identifiable protrusions, and nothing else was visible except the
above mentioned flames.

6. ****** stated that he would estimate the speed of the
diving object to be equal or in excess of that of a jet aircraft.

7. ****** could give no information as to sound, stating
that because of his distance from the object he did not believe he
could have heard it. The object disappeared out of view behind a
hill, but a bright red glow could be seen from the approximate loca-
tion where the object landed. The red glow seemed to come from a
localized area and expanded upward into a large area.

8. ****** is at present employed as an electric motor winder, working
for his father at ****** Motor Company, Manchester, New Hamp-
shire, and likes to work on scientific problems. During the
war ****** was assigned to a radar outfit in the Pacific as a radar
technician.
