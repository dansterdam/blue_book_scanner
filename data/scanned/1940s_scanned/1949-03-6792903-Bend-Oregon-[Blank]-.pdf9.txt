DETAILS:

1. This is a joint investigation by S/A THOMAS H.
KEELLY and the writer:

AF LOFFETT FIELD, CALIFORNIA

2. On 2 August 1949, Mr. ******  ***loffett Field,
California, signed the following statement:

"On 24 May 1949, at approximately 5:00 p.m., while
fishing with several friends about two and a half
miles up the Rogus River from Gold Beach, Oregon, my
attention was drawn to an object in the sky by Mr. *****
*******, one of the members of the party. To the naked
eye, this object appeared circular and standing on edge.
I then focused a pair of 8-power Navy type binoculars and
saw that it was indeed circular and that we appeared
to be looking upward at the bottom side of it, as
nearly as was possible to tell, the object appeared
about 5000 feet in altitude and not more than a mile
away. When I first observed it, object was moving very
slowly. As I put the glasses on, it made a turn to the
South, with no bankings or leansings, and picked up speed.
I then handed the glasses to ****** ******, in order that
he might see the object. Observed through the glasses, 
the object appeared to be made of silvery metal, either
completely circular or somewhat oval. It was thin near
the edges and thicker in the center. A triangular fin 
appeared to project sideward and extended to the trailing
edge of the object and had a sort of head. There were no 
openings visible and no sound was heard. There appeared 
to be no engines or motors, no landing gear, no other
protruding parts other than the fin already described.
The object was in sight for approximately one (1)
minute. Sun was at our backs and there were no clouds."
