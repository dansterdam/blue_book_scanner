1. On the night of 27 April 1949, Staff Sgt. D., Capt. G. J. Zimmerly,
received a long distance phone call from a Mr. L., saying that he had
observed "objects shaped like a balloon at that time (26 April) at 1600
hours, traveling at a speed of 300-400 m.p.h. over Indianapolis,
Indiana, at an altitude varying between 1000-2000 ft."

2. This is all the information available. An effort was made to trace
the phone call to find out where the civilian lived, but the call was paid
for by him, and since no record of incoming paid calls is maintained at
Chanute, there was no way to find his name or his address.

3. Captain Zimmerly said he believed if. appeared an ex-Army Sgt., lived
10-15 miles north of Indianapolis.
