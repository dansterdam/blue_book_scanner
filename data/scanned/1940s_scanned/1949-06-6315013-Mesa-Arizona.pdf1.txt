Initially, the four discs observed together were approximately 85 deg above the horizon. Objects appeared to hover around
as small cloud, estimated to be at an extremely high altitude. The fifth disc, which moved from W to E, was a lower altitude than the other four but was also extremely high. Observation was sustained for about 30 minutes. The discs were metallic in composition, steel gray in color, varied in form depending on position at which viewed. Seven power binoculars were used for part of the time.
