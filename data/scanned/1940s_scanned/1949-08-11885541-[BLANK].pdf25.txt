Incident #33 -- Hackensack, New Jersey -- 3 August 1947

It seems clear that no astronomical interpretation can be given to this incident.

Information is so meager that little else can be said. If the object observed was only 200 yards away, it would seem that witnesses could have furnished much more detailed information.
