Incident #39 -- Grand Falls, Newfoundland -- 9 July 1947

It is extremely unlikely that those objects were meteors, although their speed would argue for such interpretation. Had they been, however, one would expect much more brilliant light, a trail, and perhaps even detonation. Furthermore, their flight in formation argues against their being meteors.

The meager description suggests a light phenomenon rather than material objects. Was any auroral activity reported in the region at the time? The description answers more closely to a detached auroral streamer than to anything else, but this explanation is perhaps also far fetched.
