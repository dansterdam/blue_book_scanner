4. Speed. About half judged that the speed was less than 500
miles an hour. The other half of the judgments varied from 500 miles
an hour all the way to "terrific", "tremendous", "inconceivable" and
"blue blazes".

5. Background against which viewed. The great majority of
observers saw the object against a clear day or night sky.

6. Time of day sighted. About two-thirds as many observations
were reported at night as in the day. There are, of course, many more
opportunities for observing things during the day. The most popular
hours were from 12 noon to 5:00 PM; and from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM
at night. Very few (6 only) observations were made from 5:00 to
7:00 PM., the usual hours of sunset.

7. Color. Observers almost universally reported seeing a light-
colored object. Thirty observers reported "white" and twenty-five
said "silver". Over 70 percent described glittering, shiny, liminescent,
flame-like
mirror-like, or other very bright objects. Only six individuals said
black or dark.

8. Shape. Over half described the object as either "round",
"disc-shaped", "spherica" or "circular". Other descriptions were
similar. Very few observers saw any distinctive shape.

9. Size. The majority of observers did not specify the objects'
size. Of those who did over half said it was less than 10 feet in its
largest dimension. Many compared it with a dime, a lamp, a dot, a
weather balloon, a baseball, etc.

Interpretation of the Common Points of All Reports

The words used by observers to describe the appearances of the
unidentified objects fall into a surprisingly uniform pattern. The
objects were usually reported as being far away, small, bright and
without a distinctive shape. They were usually seen against a clear sky
