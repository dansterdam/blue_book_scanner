Northern Lights Are Seen Here

For nearly six hours last night Bermudians were treated to the unusual sight of Northern Lights. Entries in the Hamilton Meteorological Station's log indicate that the Northern Lights -- otherwise known as the aurora borealis -- were visible from about 5:30 P.M. to 2 A.M., appearing to the north-northwest, they began with a reddish hue and changed throughout the evening to a powerful violet, which spread like a curtain.

The lights which are seen frequently in the far north are rarely visible this far South. When they are seen in these latitudes the weather is exceptionally fine, the Met Station said. Last night conditions here were still and fine.

John Jefferies, branch engineer for Cable and Wireless, Ltd., in Bermuda, said the service was abnormal from about 11 P.M. to 5 A.M. As expected an explained the station experienced fading on the wireless circuits.

This was the first time interference due to the aurora had been noticed in Bermuda, he said, although in some other parts of the world it is not uncommon.
