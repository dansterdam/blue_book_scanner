Incident #56 -- Lewes Beach, Delaware -- September 1947
                                    October 1947
                                    2 June 1947

This incident contains nothing astronomical.

It is entirely possible that the objects observed on
these three separate dates were "Gorgon" target missiles,
as fired from fort Miles by the Applied Physics Laboratory of
Johns Hopkins University. Since the flight or trajectory of the
various sightings (and the exact day of the first two) is not 
given in material submitted to this investigator, positive iden-
tification cannot be made; but if these facts are known, inquiry
at the above-mentioned laboratory (address: 8621 Georgia
Avenue, Silver Spring, Maryland) might bring forth definite iden-
tification.
