"Hdiscf" with a silver dollar slightly turned from a flat position, flying at a disc-shape, and held at an arms length at a forty-five (45) degree angle above the eye level. Major DRUM stated further that he did not observe any exhaust smoke, flame, vapor trails, or accompanying noises. The informant indicated that he was certain that the object was not a conventional type aircraft. At 1610 hours, on 19 October 1948, this Agent..and a SA RIDE set began a visual search of the sky areas pointed out by Major DRUM. This search from the lawn of Major DRUM's residence, occasionally employing field glasses, was constant until 1800 hours, when solid, low, cumulus clouds made further observation of the sky area impossible. During this period, nothing that steht even resemble an airplane or "discf" was observed by these Agents.

No other information concerning this incident appears in files examined.
