UFO SIGHTING
MT RAINIER, WASHINGTON
24 JUNE 1947

On 24 June 1947 at 1400 hr. ************ took off from the Chehalis, Washington
Airport In his personal plane and headed for Yakima, Washington. He needed to 
was delayed for an hour in search of a large marine transport that supposedly went 
down near or around the southern side of Mt. Rainier. After takeoff Mr. ************
flew directly toward Mt. Rainier at an altitude of approximately 9,500 feet, which 
is the approximate elevation of the high plateau from which Mr. ************ later 
made one sweep of his high plateau to the westward, searching all of the various 
ridges for the warning ship end flew to the west near the ridge side of the canyon 
where Ashford, Washington is located. Unable to see anything that looked like the 
lost plane, Mr. ************ made a 360 degree turn to the right above the town of 
Mineral, starting again toward Mt. Rainier and climbing to an altitude of 9,200 feet. 

Mr. ************ reported that the air was so smooth that it was a real pleasure flying, 
and, as most pilots do when the air is smooth and they are at a higher altitude,
he trimmed out the aircraft and simply sat in his plane observing the sky and terrain.

Mr. *********** reported that there was a DC-4 to his left and rear at approximately 
14,000 feet. The sky was reported to be as clear as crystal. He hadn't flown more 
than two or three minutes on his course when a bright flash reflected on his airplane 
plane. He couldn't find where the reflection came from, but to the left and north 
of Mt. Rainier he did observe a chain of nine peculiar looking objects flying from 
north to south at approximately 9,500 feet. They were approaching Mt. Rainier very 
rapidly, and he assumed that they were jet aircraft. Every few seconds two or three 
of the objects would dip or change course slightly, just enough for the sun to strike 
them at an angle and reflect brightly. The objects being quite far away, he was unable 
to make out their shape or formation as they approached Mr. Rainier he observed their 
outline quite clearly. Mr. ************ stated that he found it very peculiar that he 
couldn't find their tails but assumed that they were some type of jet aircraft. The object 
were on the fringe of his observation range, none flying directly south so he 
estimated they to pass south a medium of Mt. Rainier elevation, or about two sums 
estimated to have varied approximately one thousand feet one way or another but 
remained very near the horizon, which would indicate that they were near the same 
elevation as the witness. Mr. ************ stated that the objects flew like geese, in a 
rather diagonal chaln-like line as if they were linked together. They seemed to hold 
a definite direction but swerved in and out of the high mountain peaks. The witness 
estimated the distance between him and the objects to be approximately 25 miles. Using 
a Texas Instruments, or conic slopeed, he estimated the speed of the objects tot be appro- 
mately two thirds that of a DC-4. He observed the UFOâ€™s passing a high snow covered 
ridge in between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams and reported that as the first object passed 
passing the south crest of this ridge the last one was entering the northern crest of 
the ridge. Later measurement of length of this particular ridge revealed It was 
approximately five miles, so it was estimated the chain of objects was five miles ions, 
processed the timed the objects between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams and determined they 
crossed this 47 miles in one minute and forty-two seconds. This is equivalent to 
1656.71 miles per hour.

In a subsequent interview Mr. ************ described the objects as appearing like 
saucer skipping on water. This description was shortened to "Flying Saucers" by 
newspaper men and resulted in the popular use of this term.

It is the Air Force conclusion that the objects of this sighting were due to a 
mirage. Mr. ************'s statement concerning how smooth and crystal clear the air 
was is an indication of very stable conditions which are associated with inversions, 
and increase the refraction index of the atmosphere.
