The image appears to contain a portion of a document with text and some markings or redactions. There's no clear photograph in the traditional sense within the image; however, there is a partially obscured object at the top that might be an attempt to depict something, although it's not discernible as a photograph due to the quality and presentation. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the output of all the text in the document:

Incident #1, lo, ld, le -- Maroo, California -- 3 July 1947

No astronomical explanation for this incident is possible.

It is tempting to explain the objects as ordinary aircraft
observed under unusual light conditions, but the evidence of the
"tight circle" maneuvers, if substantial, is strongly contradictory.
This incident must be judged with reference to other similar inci-
dents, which probably have a common explanation.
