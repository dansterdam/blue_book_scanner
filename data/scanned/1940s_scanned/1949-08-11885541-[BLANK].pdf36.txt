Incident #3 -- Houston, Texas -- 2 November 1947

The information given here indicates strongly that the
object observed was a Fireball. There is nothing to suggest that
it was not. As far as "Falling into a nearby field" is concerned,
that is perhaps the best-attested illusion with respect to these
phenomena. Very frequently a fireball is reported to have fallen
in a "nearby field" all alone; its track across two or three states.
