The image does not contain a photograph; instead, it features hand-drawn sketches and annotations. There are three sketches: one of a cylindrical object labeled as being 60 feet long with a side view and a rear view, an outline of a geographical region with annotations such as "HAWKINS FIELD (MUNICIPAL AIRPORT)", "PEARL RIVER", "JACKSON", and "HIGHWAY 80", and a labeled path with arrows indicating "LINE OF SIGHT" and "PATH OF OBJECT". There are also notations indicating directions such as "N" for north.
