The document contains two photographs, one at the top and one at the bottom of the page. The top photograph shows what looks like a small, blurry, dark object with a lighter background, while the bottom photograph shows an elongated, dark, and blurry shape against a lighter background. Both images are indistinct and it's unclear what they depict, though they are possibly related to the UFO sighting described in the document.

Incident #5 -- Portland, Oregon -- 4 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this, incident,
nor for numerous others (#6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) which
occurred in and near Portland on the Fourth of July, 1947.

Besides being observed in the same vicinity and most of them
at the same time, the objects seen have in common a round shape, "ter-
rific" speed, abrupt tactics, and quick disappearance. Abrupt tactics
certainly suggest that the objects were of a very light weight.

This investigator can offer no definite hypothesis, but in
passing would like to note that these incidents occurred on the fourth
of July, and that if relatively small pieces of aluminum foil had
been dropped from a plane over that area, then any one object would
become visible at a relatively short distance. Even moderate wind 
velocities could give the illusion that fluttering, gyrating discs 
had gone by at great velocities. Various observers would now, of 
course, in this case have seen the same objects.

The above is not to be regarded as a very likely explana-
tion but only as a possibility the occurrence of these incidents 
on July 4 may have been more than a coincidence. Some prankster 
might have tossed such objects out of an airplane as part of an 
Independence Day celebration.

If these were aircraft of either known or unknown type,
