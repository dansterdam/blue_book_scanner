The image contains diagrams, not photographs. The diagrams appear to be related to a report on a UFO sighting, typically providing details such as the path of an object, observations points, and possibly geographical mapping of the incident. Due to the image quality, it is difficult to describe the diagrams in detail, but I will provide the text that is legible as you requested:

1. Path of lighted weather balloon showing time, altitude and wind velocity
2. Point of observation of "Flying Disc"
3. Direction of observation by witness(es)
4. Location of lighted airways beacon

Note: Due to the resolution and quality of the image, it is challenging to transcribe all the text accurately. The text listed above represents what is clearly readable from the provided image.
