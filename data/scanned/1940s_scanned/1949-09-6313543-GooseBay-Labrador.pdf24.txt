The image contains a hand-drawn sketch, not a photograph. The sketch appears to resemble some sort of object, possibly a flying craft, with a more slender upper part and a circular lower part.

There is faint text at the bottom of the page, which seems to say "NEGATIVE OKAY," but due to the low contrast and faintness, it is not very clear. There is no other text displayed in the document image provided.
