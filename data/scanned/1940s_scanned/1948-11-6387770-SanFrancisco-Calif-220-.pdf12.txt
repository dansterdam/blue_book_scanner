Incident #220 -- San Francisco, California -- 23 November 1948

There is good reason to believe that the object observed
in this incident was a bolide. The fact that the observer, although
a common soldier, conducted his own experiment with vapor is strong
evidence that he is well-endowed with those phenomena a correct ap-
praisal stationery in the sky over a relatively long period of time.
While the evidence is insufficient to establish with any certainty
that the object was a bolide, it appears to this investigator, none
the less, to be the most probable explanation.
