Incident 3 Aug 49 - Miamisburg, Ohio - 30 July 1949

No astronomical explanation is suggested by the descrip-
tion of this incident.

This investigator wonders whether an advertising "blimp"
might not have been in the neighborhood. The time of observation
was just after sunset, and a blimp, would probably have given the
appearance described.

It should be noted that the size of the object and
distance are not stated.
