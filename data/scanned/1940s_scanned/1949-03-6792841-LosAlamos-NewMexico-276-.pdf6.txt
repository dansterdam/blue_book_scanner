STATEMENT OF OBSERVER: I was sitting in the tower at my station, and glanced
out the northwest window just as a bright white object
went by on the western horizon. I jumped up and ran
outside just in time to see the object either go out
or disappear into the cloud cover. I checked the time
which was 1836 hrs. The object was traveling from
south to north, roughly parallel to the range of
mountains and at approximately the same height as the
top of the peaks.
