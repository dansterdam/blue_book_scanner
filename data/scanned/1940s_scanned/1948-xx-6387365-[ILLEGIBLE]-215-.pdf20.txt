The image provided does not contain a photograph. Instead, it appears to be a schematic or blueprint of an area with labeled structures. Due to the quality of the image, some text is illegible, but I will transcribe what is clear:

```
RADIO RANGE

AIRFIELD

LOCATION OF DIVERSION DAM
HYDRO WELL & RADIO STA.
```

The text seems to relate to an airfield, with a reference to radio range, a diversion dam, hydro well, and a radio station. The rest of the details in the image are not very clear due to the resolution and quality of the scan.
