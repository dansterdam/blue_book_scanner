AT DES MOINES, IOWA

1. Mrs. LOIS M. WALTON, 2910 Rutland, Das Moines, Iowa, house-
wife and private nurse, was interviewed on 20 June 1949. Mrs. WALTON
stated that she has known Mr. W. L. AHERN for three years as a neighbor,
and that from her observation of him, he (AHERN) appears and acts odd.
Mrs. WALTON also stated that Mr. AHERN has caused trouble in the neighbor-
hood and that she would not put it past AHERN to think up something un-
usual for a bit of publicity.

2. Miss OSSIE TAYLOR, 2926 Rutland, Das Moines, Iowa, saleslady,
was interviewed on 20 June 1949. Miss TAYLOR stated that she has known
Mr. AHERN for nine years as a neighbor and has found him to be odd and
eccentric. Informant also stated that she stays away from AHERN because
he has caused trouble in the neighborhood. Informant stated that AHERN
has a feeling that some of his property may be taken away from him, as
some of the neighbors had their lots surveyed and in the surveying it was
determined that the lot stakes were not exactly right. The neighbors were
entitled to a few more feet of land. This caused AHERN a great deal of
concern as he felt that this would revert down the line until he would
be the last and that some of his land would be taken away from him. AHERN
is hot headed and is capable of giving information that does not exist.

Mr. AHERN for eight years as a member of the community, and believes that
he is capable of giving information which is not substantiated by facts.

anything to do with him.

could see shadows in his back yard, especially the eave from the garage

to the rear of his house. ******** then went to the window
on the west and watched the light until it disappeared behind the neighbor's
house and chimney. ******** stated that he awakened no one in the house be-
cause they have two roomers who have to go to work early, and also a young
grandchild who, if awakened, will not go to sleep again. ******** stated
