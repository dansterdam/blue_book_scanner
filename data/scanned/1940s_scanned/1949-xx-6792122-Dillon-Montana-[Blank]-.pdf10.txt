U.N. HEADQUARTERS, Frankfort â€“ Z42 (UP) Four mysterious projectiles - apparently rocket or jet-propelled - have landed in the U. S. Zone of Germany since October 1946 American authorities disclosed today.

The last one shot over the northeastern corner of the state of Bavaria last Jan 31 and American technical experts have obtained fragments of it. But their investigations have left them mystified as to the origin of the missiles.

American officials explained all four landed in the same general area, just east of Schweinfurt, some 55 miles from the Russian zone.

The experts said they were mystified because if the projectiles were fired from the Russian zone they possessed almost uncanny accuracy since all four landed in so small an area.

The first missile was reported in October 1946 according to Germany police records quoted by American authorities.

The others followed in May and July 1947.

The fourth arrived between 4 and 5 A. M. last Jan 31.

A German policeman who saw its flaming tail streak through the early morning sky and then plummet into the earth said it traveled from northeast to southwest coming from the direction of Russian-occupied territory.

It tore a hole seven feet wide and 10 inches deep in the ground and had a flaming tail 20 feet long, authorities said.
