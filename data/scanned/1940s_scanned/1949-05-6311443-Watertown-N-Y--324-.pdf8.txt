The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned copy of an old document with text and numerical data. Here is the text from the document where legible:

```
U.S. ARMY WEATHE[R] S[ERVICE] GROUP
WINDS ALOFT COMPUTATION SHEET
(FIXED STATION TYPE)
```

Unfortunately, the majority of the text and figures on the document are either too faint or blurred to accurately transcribe. The legible header suggests that the document pertains to wind measurements or calculations possibly used in meteorological analysis during the time of Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force.
