NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
AT LOGAN, UTAH

On 5 April 1949, ------, owner of ------ Flower Shop, Logan, Utah, was interviewed and stated that he was on the #2 tee of the Logan Golf Course when he happened to observe a very brilliant, fiery object in the sky to the southwest. ------ stated that the object reminded him of a tracer bullet and that it definitely moved much faster than any plane he had ever seen. The object, as further described by ------, made no sound in its descent, was funnel-shaped, and disappeared in a bright orange flash at what seemed to be 11,000 feet MSL. ------ stated that the object left a bluish-white smoke or vapor trail which lasted for approximately fifteen minutes. His observation was made about 0915 hours MST. After walking from the #2 tee of the Logan Golf Course to the club house, ------ stated, he heard the sound of an explosion in what he estimated to be the same direction from Logan that he had seen the object disappear. This latter occurred at approximately 0955 hours MST according to ------. The incident was reported to the Logan City Police Department by ------ at 1000 hours MST.
