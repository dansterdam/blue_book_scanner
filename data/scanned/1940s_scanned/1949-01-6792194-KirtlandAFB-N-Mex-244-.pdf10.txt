The duration of the sound as determined by a stop-watch measurement of relay motions in going outside, returning to the communication tent, and again going outside, was 45 seconds. However, Inspector ------ reports this was heard the sound probably for a minute or more after he went outdoors the second time. According to Wyrss, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2100-2105 was 420 00' and the elevation 10° to 15°.

4. At Station 350 statements were obtained from ABSS Inspectors ------, ------, and ------. According to Inspector ------ the initial approxi-mately 2010 and December 30, he heard a noise in the air which he believed to be the motor noise of a 140 HP., Cub.

According to Inspector Holloman, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2010 was 190°, and the elevation 220 30'; the azimuth of the sound heard at 2020 was 300° the azimuth 2100 220 0° and the elevation 20°.
