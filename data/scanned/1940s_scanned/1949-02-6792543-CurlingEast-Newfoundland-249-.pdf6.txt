UNCLASSIFIED

I [redacted] do hereby make the following true statement to Captain Wm. H. Smith of the United States Air Force.

At about 5 minutes to 7 on February 11th 1949 while I was waiting on the bus at Curling East, to go to work [redacted] a friend of mine called my attention to a red ball of fire in the sky. We were just looking down the river at the time and saw it, it was dull red not bright and over Frenchmans Head. I didn't notice whether it moved or not, the reddish ball was about like the morning sun in size, and then it faded out, and then flamed long with little flickers of flame on it like oil burning. It looked very long when it flamed about 10 or 50 feet as I would measure right here, I'd say it was 10 mile on the other side of Frenchmans Head.

When it flamed long it seemed wider in the middle than at thq ends. I watched it for maybe a total of two or three minutes then it seemed to just go out slowly. Mr. [redacted] said he was going to report it. The Bus Driver said he saw it too, I don't remember who he was, if I can find out I will let you know.

Witnessed.
S/ N. Merrigan
