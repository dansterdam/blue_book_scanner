The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a textured surface with many white speckles, possibly due to the age or condition of the photograph, or it may be depicting the actual texture on the surface that was photographed. The photograph is incomplete, as it is cut off at the top right corner, giving it a roughly triangular shape overall. There is no clear indication of what the substance or material in the photograph might be.

There are two scales in the image, indicating the measurement in inches. The bottom scale ranges from 6 inches to just over 12 inches, and near each end of this scale are tabs labeled "UNIDENTIFIED MATERIAL". No additional text or context is visible in the image.
