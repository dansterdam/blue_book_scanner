The photograph shows a night scene of a cityscape with numerous lights visible, probably a representation of a city's skyline. Above the cityscape, there's an anomalously shaped luminous cloud or object with a relatively smooth underside and a dispersed or misty upper portion. The scene is dark, and the specific details of the background are indiscernible due to the nighttime setting.
