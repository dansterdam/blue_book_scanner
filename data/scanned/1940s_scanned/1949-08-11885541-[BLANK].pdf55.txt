Incident #33 – Norway, Lommark, Sweden – 20-25 February 1948

Information given here is too limited for any conclusions to be drawn. The stated heights, the occurrences at the same time each night, and their specific direction makes explanation of the objects as meteors unlikely. The green tails are also not characteristic of typical meteors, but would fit into a description of rockets or flares.
