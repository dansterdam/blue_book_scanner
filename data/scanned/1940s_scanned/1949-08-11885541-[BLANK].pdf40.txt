Incident #101 -- Moscow, Kansas -- 10 February 1948

This now-celebrated case of an unusual fireball has been adequately reported in astronomical literature; (for details, see Sky and Telescope, April, 1948, page 154, and October, 1948, p.293). Positive identification has been made by the recovery of Fragments. The origin of this object Is, therefore, definitely astronomical, and the incident need not be considered further.
