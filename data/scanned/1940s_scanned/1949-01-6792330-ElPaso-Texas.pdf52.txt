AT GANADO, ARIZONA

5. En route to Ganado, several members of the Franciscan Order were 
interviewed at St. Michaels Mission. No positive results were obtained, but
it was arranged that the writer would be notified in the event that any of
the brothers heard any reports from the Indians.

AT GANADO MISSION (Presbyterian), I.M.

6. At Ganado Mission by the writer, stated that about 15:30 
on 15 February 1949, he and his wife, were returning from Gallup, 
they crossed the long ridge about two miles due east of Ganado, as they 
came up with hill west of the bridge, where the road heads south, a brilliant 
white light was observed in the sky directly in front of the car and some-
what above the horizon. The object appeared to hang stationary, then fall in 
a slight curve to the west. Mrs. _______ said that the object had a slightly
greenish color. Both agreed that the object had an orange tinge as it fell,
and that sparks appeared to trail off the object, both while stationary and
as it fell. Mr. _____ said that his first reaction was that it was an air
plane on fire, and that he had so reported to the Arizona State Police.

7. Mr. _____ informed the writer that one _______ Indian trader at 
Marateen, Arizona, had told him that two Indians said that they saw parts of
Sheep Springs when a ball of fire appeared "to have a hog" story them. The 
object disappeared over a hill, and then they heard a big explosion. These 
Indians are reported to have come in separately to Marateen, to have made 
separate observations, and to have told identical stories. This was ascer-
tained to be "born", 1330 on 12 February 1949.
