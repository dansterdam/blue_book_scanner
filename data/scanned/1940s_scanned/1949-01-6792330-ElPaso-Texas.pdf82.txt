Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

_______________________: On 3 February 1949, the writer, accompanied by Mrs. _________________________ Street, Alamogordo, New Mexico and Mrs. _________________________ Michigan Avenue, Alamogordo, New Mexico, attempted to locate in the White Sands National Monument the spots from which the objects had been sighted on 30 January at approximately 1755 hours. Because of the many crisscrossing tire tracks, no normal an approximate location could be established. Through the use of a transit, the following readings were obtained: Location 53° 19' North and 106° 15' West.

    A. Mrs. _________________________:
       First sighted object: 55° Magnetic North and 12° elevation
       Last sighted object: 60° Magnetic North and 10° elevation

    B. Mrs. _________________________:
       First sighted object: 65° Magnetic North and 20° elevation
       Last sighted object: 60° Magnetic North and 19° elevation

    C. Mrs. _________________________:
       First sighted object: 55° Magnetic North and 11° elevation
       Last sighted object: 72° Magnetic North and 9° elevation

All of the above concurred in the description of the object as being single, bright burning object, which was in view approximately 3 seconds. Body had a gentle downward glide and seemed to fizzle out with the light becoming less intense and finally disappearing altogether. Angle of elevation was estimated above the transit and one would venture a guess as to the distance of the object. Original statements were to the effect that object appeared to be between the ______ and the White Sands, located to the West of the Base.
