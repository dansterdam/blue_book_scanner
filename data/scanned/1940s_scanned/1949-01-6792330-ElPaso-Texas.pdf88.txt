______________________ WHAT IS HIS ABILITY?

Mr. ________________ was interviewed early in February by J ________________, since he discovered that Marshall was on duty in the CAA Control Tower at Meacham Field, Fort Worth, Texas, during the time of the occurrence of the phenomena and had observed it. His observations were rehearsed in the control tower and from it is was determined that the indicated beginning point was approximately North 6 degrees West, the at an altitude of about 13 degrees and that the end point was approxiÂ­mately due West but no altitude was determined due to extraneous lights in the vicinity of the air field.
