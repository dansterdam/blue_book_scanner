Gentlemen,

Enclosed please find a sketch
of an event that happened here a few days
ago. While walking to my place of em-
ployment about 5 oclock in the morning
of August 18th, suddenly there appeared
in the eastern sky a formation of about
12 Disc., Moved North-South to the West,
Speed about 700 M.P.H. Altitude 5,000 Feet.
Elevation here is about 2250 Feet. Terrain is
very mountainous, 50 Mi. North of Donner Summit,
Mount Rose and Lake Tahoe, heart of the
Sierra & Mother Lode Country.

The most unusual behavior of these objects
as a group was when Altitude was changing,
do to the rugged terrain, the opposite Side
of the half Circle formation were furiously
bobbing up and down for 30 or 40 Seconds,
