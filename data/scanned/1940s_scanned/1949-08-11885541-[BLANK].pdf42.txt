Incident #21 -- Cartersville, Georgia -- 8 January 1948

While the possibility of this object's being a meteor is not ruled out, it seems unlikely. Meteors are not known to be "light sky blue," nor to travel so slowly as indicated. Moreover, report also states that color was an "intense blue," and, if speed were underestimated (or if object had a large radial velocity component -- coming largely "head-on"), it might possibly be interpreted as a fireball.
