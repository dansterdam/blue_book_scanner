PROJECT "GRUDGE"

as it got further away from the observer, it appeared to change from a 
round shape to a sausage shape. The object passed through a cloud, made a 
steep climb, came to a halt and reversed its course, traveling northwest
at a higher altitude. The object was in sight for approximately forty five
seconds. The object took approximately twenty seconds from the time of its
appearance to the top of its climb, and took approximately fifteen seconds
to make a direct reverse of its course and disappear from sight beyond the
horizon. [Redacted] could not tell whether the object made any sound for airplanes
from the [redacted] Airport, Cincinnati, Ohio, were in the air at a much lower
altitude; approximately 1500 to 2000 feet. The object did not leave any
trail, have any projections or have any effect on the cloud it passed through.
There were a few clouds at a high altitude and a light wind from the southwest;
otherwise the weather was very clear.
