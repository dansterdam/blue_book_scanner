Incident #855 - Harmon Field, Newfoundland - 25 July 1947

If proper allowance is made for the reporting of untrained
observers, it is possible that the objects observed in this incident
were a minor meteor shower.  The "reddish flashes of light" and
"abrupt darts" would tend to this interpretation. The hypothesis
flashes were observed for three minutes." If this means independent
flashes, it lends support to the meteoric interpretation. If it
means that the same objects flashed intermittently for three minutes,
that theory is ruled out. It seems more probable in view of the
statement about "abrupt darts of light" that this former meaning is
correct.

There is somewhat more evidence in this incident than in
#857 (which is similar, and occurred just three days earlier) favoring
meteors, but probably the events of these two incidents are related,
and it is very unlikely that meteors could explain both of them.

According to the report of the U. S. Weather Bureau on
ball lightning, it would appear that this phenomenon sometimes takes
the form of luminous darts and can be red. Perhaps this could offer
an alternate explanation for the incident.
