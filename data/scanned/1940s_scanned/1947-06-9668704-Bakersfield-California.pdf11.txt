UNCLASSIFIED

at approximately 1200 noon on the 1st of June I was lying in the front
yard of my home. There was a lad mowing the lawn at the time. I looked
into the sky and saw ten articles flying from the South to the North and
what I would judge to be 3500 ft. The objects were flying at approximately
what I would judge to be 500 miles per hour. I distinctly recognized what
at the time I saw the articles I mentioned it to the lad who was mowing the
lawn at the time. I told the lad that the objects were all probablility
some sort of Air or Naval test planes from the nearby test centers on that
day's sort of hazy on California. The objects seemed to be a dull but there
number was sort of hazy.\[------\], these so called "flying flapjack" that the navy
is testing. At approximately 1145 I went back into the yard to sit and lie
in the shade. At this time the objects reappeared going from West to South,
although this time there were only seven of the articles. When I first saw
the original ten objects they were flying in a "V" formation with one object
seemingly straggling in the rear of the formation. When the objects appeared
the second time they were still in some formation although there was
only seven of the objects at this time. I remember at this time that I told
the lad, who was still mowing on the lawn, that probably three of the objects
had proceeded back to the base on a different course. I actually thought that
what brings me to the case, that the other three objects had probably come back
to their base on the other side of the mountain from Bakersfield. I am
firmly convinced that the articles I saw were actually some sort of Flying
machines although I cannot say from where they came or to where they were going.
