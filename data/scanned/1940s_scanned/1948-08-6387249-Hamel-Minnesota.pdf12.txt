Incident No. 162 -- 11 August 1945, 1200 Hours, Hamel, Minnesota,
Two children, ages ten and eight, described a dull gray object two
feet in diameter and one foot thick, shaped like two platters face to face
which settled gently to the ground. It emitted no sound when it hovered. 
On the ground it emitted a whistling noise when it "swiftly flew"
where it hesitated, whistled once more, "shot" up to thirty feet, then 
"shot" off in a northeast direction.

ATIC Opinion: This apparent bit of fantasy is hardly worth further
consideration.
