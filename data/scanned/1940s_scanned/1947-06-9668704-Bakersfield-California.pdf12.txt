The image you provided is a scan of a typewritten page that appears to be part of a report from Project Blue Book, an investigation into UFO sightings conducted by the United States Air Force. It includes the heading "UNCLASSIFIED" and has some handwritten markings. The text includes a personal account of a UFO sighting. Unfortunately, due to the poor quality of the scan and some of the words being cut off, I may not be able to transcribe every word accurately, but I will provide as much of the text as possible:
