UNCLASSIFIED

TO:
Lt. S. D. Hightower, Protective Force Headquarters

FROM:
Inspector, W. E. Patterson, Section III

TIME:
1335

DATE:
8 March 1949

DIRECTIONS:
Appeared to be over installation traveling North and approaching the earth at about a 45 degree angle.

SPEED:
Seemed to be drifting toward the earth at less than flying speed of a modern twin engine plane.

COLOR:
Intense white light.

ALTITUDE:
Lower than the clouds obscuring the peaks to the West of the installation.

POINT OF OBSERVATION:
From Station 103 in Bryce Canyon
(106⁰ 14' 54" W - 35⁰ 53' 09" N)

SOUND:
None heard.

OBSERVER:
W. E. Patterson

STATEMENT BY OBSERVER:
This Inspector was extremely startled by this object as the first impression was that it was a plane on fire and about to crash nearby. As the eye became adjusted to the distance this Inspector had the distinct impression of seeing a silver or aluminum colored body inside the flame or glow that resembled that part of the fuselage of a two-wing German type plane from just behind the wing to a foot in front of the tail assembly. This Inspector further had the impression that the object was actually flaming and that the flames were quite visible. The overall shape of the object including the flame or light was much like the ace of spades from the observer. The object appeared less than 1 mile from the observer and the outlines were very distinct.
