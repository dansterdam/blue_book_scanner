NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At about 1530 P.M. on the night of 23 April 1949, I noted an object in the
sky northeast of where I reside, which traveled in a southwesterly direction, and
eventually turned to the southwest and disappeared from sight. I would judge this
object to be at an angle of 50 degrees and from 4 to 5 miles high.

This object seemed oval in shape and when it caught the sun's rays, it was
a brilliant silvery color. When I first observed this object, it seemed to turn over
and disappeared for awhile. I noticed it again a few minutes later much farther
south of my first observations.

I noted no exhaust or vapor trails. It made no noise. I could see no lights,
wings or tail surfaces. I have noticed B-29's flying high overhead, but this seemed
to travel much faster.

Looking at this object as I did for at least a half hour, it seemed to be 5
or 6 feet long, and I would say it would be 20 to 25 feet long if it was on the ground.

When I observed this object, I was in company with a man named ____ and
another named ____ who I believe works _______________________________ east edge.
