The document contains a very light and faint sketch at the bottom that seems to depict flying saucer-like objects over a landscape. It is difficult to discern details due to the quality of the reproduction.

Here is the text as it appears on the document:

---
[REDACTED] had sent his son to the river for some tops from his boat. As they were overdue he went to look for them, when he noticed some 300 feet over some 75 feet in the air a sky-blue object elongated against the sky, while at the city on the Snake river, (which was approximately 4 miles, in a
(1200 ft. across at that place), 600 feet below the ground line of the rim (300 ft below the rim of the canyon) and so was clearly visible. [REDACTED] states that the sky-blue color would probably not be noticed against the sky, He states that "it did not spin like a top." However, he did say that the trees over which it passed almost directly did not just bend with the
wind as if a plane had gone by but that they spun around on top as if they were in a "Vacuum."

Keith [REDACTED], a son, eight years of age said he saw the machine coming down the canyon heading from east to west and following the contour of the ground. Billy, age ten, another son, saw it almost immediately. Both watched it fly out of sight behind a tree in a matter of moments.

AGENT'S NOTES: [REDACTED] seemed completely sincere about the incident and 
appeared to be a sober, middle-aged man.
The boys stated that they had never before seen one of the 
discs.
