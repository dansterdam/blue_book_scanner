The document does not contain any photographs. It appears to have a section where an image might have been provided, as it refers to "The attached drawing," but the area where the drawing would presumably be is redacted with a black marker, obscuring any image or detail that might have been there.

Here is the text from the document:

```
CONFIDENTIAL

As soon as we had lost it to sight we agreed not to describe it
to each other in order not to influence each other's opinion. The
only things we discussed and agreed on were its course which was 2200
to 2300 and its speed which we estimated was 7 to 800 miles per hour.
The time of observation by both our watches was 2217. We agreed
that I would make the initial report and ________ would make any
additional report that would be desired.

The attached drawing is my impression at the time I recorded
this.

Sworn and subscribed to before me this 6th day of September 1949.

     [Signature Redacted]
     W. J. B____ Jr.
     1st LT., USAF
     Assistant Adjutant
