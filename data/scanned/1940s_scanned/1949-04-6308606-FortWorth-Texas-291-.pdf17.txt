The image does not contain a photograph. It's a scanned page of a document. Here is the text contained in the document:

There's also a circular stamp at the bottom left of the page that is not fully legible. The text inside the circular stamp appears to be mostly administrative details, such as "OFFICIAL BUSINESS" and the date which seems to say "JUN 1 1949", along with other text that isn't fully readable.
