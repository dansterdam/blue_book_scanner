The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document that is largely illegible due to the poor quality of the scan.

The document's text is degraded and hard to decipher. I can attempt to reproduce bits of text, but due to the nature of the image, this is prone to inaccuracy and substantial portions of text may be missing:

```
[bunch of illegible text]
circular in [ILLEGIBLE] a terrific speed 
first one then [ILLEGIBLE] or 3 seconds [ILLEGIBLE]
appeared directly [ILLEGIBLE]
[bunch of illegible text]
```

Please note that the portions in brackets indicate illegible parts of the text, and the reconstructed text is both incomplete and might not accurately reflect the content of the original document due to its poor quality. It is recommended to seek a better-quality copy or an expert evaluation for accurate text extraction.
