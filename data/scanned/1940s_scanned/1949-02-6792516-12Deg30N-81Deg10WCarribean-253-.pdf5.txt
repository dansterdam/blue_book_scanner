1. In accordance with Restricted letter, Hq USAF, subject, "Report-
ing of Informations on Flying Discs", 26 February 1948, the following
report is submitted.

2. At 2030 hours on 8 February 1949, Captain *** of the S.S.
Antigua, a United Fruit vessel, berthed at Cristobal Pier area, Canal
Zone was interviewed regarding three aerial objects sighted by officers
of his ship on voyage to Canal Zone from New Orleans, Louisiana.

3. Captain *** stated that the first object, which appeared to
be a disc, was sighted at 1630 on 6 February 1949 at latitude 12 degrees 30
minutes north latitude, 81 degrees 10 minutes west longitude, in the close
vicinity of the San Andres Islands. The S.S. Antigua's course was 152.3
degrees at 16 knots. When sighted, the object was at an altitude of 60
degrees from the horizon as determined by ast ships sextant in the direc-
tion of 122 degrees. As it passed directly over the ship, several officers
described it as a round, silver-colored sphere. Although *** had
difficulty in determining its height, he estimated the diameter as 12 to
14 inches. As it passed overhead, bearing 310 degrees, it changed in
color from silver to yellow to red and went out of sight in the dusk at
an altitude of 22 degrees. The wind at the time was estimated at Force
Four; approximately 29.

4. At 1700 hours on the same date two more objects were sighted,
one off the port bow at an altitude between 50 and 60 degrees, and the
other, off the starboard bow bearing 201 degrees at an altitude of 47 de-
grees. Both disappeared again in the dusk. None showed any luminosity
or motivating power.

5. The circumstances described suggests a strong possibility that
these objects are some type of weather balloon. However, it is improb-
able that any weather balloons released from central or South American
ties to this position due to the prevailing winds on these dates. The
