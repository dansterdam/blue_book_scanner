This image appears to be a scanned page with a handwritten drawing. The drawing looks somewhat like a cylindrical or canister-shaped object with two layers or levels, and there's some sort of pattern or markings on the upper level. There are handwritten annotations around the drawing. Unfortunately, there's no photograph in this image.

The text on the document is a little bit unclear due to the handwriting and quality of the scan, but here's my best transcription of the text around the drawing:

Upper layer of topside southwest side of object
Bottom layer
Red or Dark Red
Yellow
Green lights showered out of 
angled openings that I don't know 
which one.
