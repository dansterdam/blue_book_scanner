Incident #61, Gila -- Logan, Utah -- 8 September 1947

        This incident, and incident #62, which clearly refer to 
the same objects (witnesses were together at the time of observa-
tion) do not have an astronomical explanation.

        Since it was dark, any judgment of distance can be greatly
misleading, and extremely fast motion might be ascribed to close-
ness rather than to true linear distance.
