NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 30 Jan 1949 at 1755 hours, a blue-green light resembling a flare was observed travelling on a horizontal line. This light came out of the North headed South at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet, moving slowly, and disappeared in the vicinity of SW Walker Air Force Base. To some observers this phenomena disappeared in its entirety while other statements mentioned a disappearance as a disintegration into a shower of smaller lighted fragments such as a shower of sparks. The only sound accompanying this object was heard by Sgt McCrary, a tower control operator of Walker AFB, who described it as a high pitched whining noise similar to that of a blown torch. All of the observers sighted this light from a position West of it while facing east.

Obtaining the services of an engineer's transit, the following information was secured by making a reading from points of observation:

First observed at 52° magnetic
lasts observed at 57-1/2° magnetic
Elevation of 22°

The following grid coordinates were secured:

    a. Center of Walker AFB:     104° 31-1/2' W    33° 18' N

    b. Control Tower (reading from center of WAFB): 75' W  5470' W

    c. Tennis Courts: 1125' N  5650' W

    d. Base Theater:  1925' N  5600' W
