NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
In complying with your request for reports on the mysterious object observed
in the skies over Roanoke, Va., and other sections of this State., about eight o'clock
P.M., on May 12th 1949.

I was sitting on the porch at my home and saw the light of this object appear
from the east at about 4000 ft high, I first thought it a star but looked too large
for that for a while it seemed to be standing still., In two or three minutes I
could tell it was slowly moving., I watched it closely and the nearer it came to
me it appeared and looked like an air plane with tho landing lights on a rather
amber color., and about time it was well entering the Roanoke City limits the
lights wore out off and I did not see any other lights about it.

After the lights were cut off it came nearer and I could tell the motor or
motors which sounded very much like the drone of the B 29 motors when just cruising
along with the motors out way back and I could hear plain enough that one motor was
not running proper it sounded like it was about half way missing, and as far as
being able to see the object it was too dark., There are reports from other sections
that it was seen after passing over Roanoke., My idea about this object is it must
have been a air Ship of some size having some motor trouble and the sparks that
were seen trailing it were coming from the exhaust port.

In order to identify my self I am a Postal Employee at the Roanoke, Va.,
Post Office and have been employed there for nearly Twenty Eight Years.
