The visible text in the document is as follows:

"I did see one of the so called "flying disks" or other objects on
10 July at approximately 1700. we were coming back from a fishing trip, and
saw what I had between two cumulus clouds. This occurred over
a space between Walla Walla and the "trestro"/"trestle" over snake river.
The river was behind, it was very clear and the clouds were very scattered.
I did say the approximately altutude of the clouds was from 3000 to 10,000 feet.
The object appeared to be a translucent disk-like wheel traveling at a
terrific rate of speed and opened the clouds as it went through the air. The
disk was travelling horizontial. It appeared to be about the size of a 50 or
Centieilation. It cleared the clouds out abvout half mile. It cut a clear notch
right through one cloud. It left a trail dusky bluish in color similar to old
power lights. The trail was approximately 15 to 20 miles long."

Please note that certain words were difficult to decipher due to the scan quality, hence the uncertainty in transcription for words like "trestro"/"trestle".
