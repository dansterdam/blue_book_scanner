11 May 1949

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: Commanding General
          Air Materiel Command
          Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
          Dayton, Ohio
          ATTN: MCIXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, "MCIAIS,
   dated 6 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
   indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents' numbers 173 through 233 have been checked
   against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
   and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are included.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigators of Uni-
   dentified Arial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
   of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
   zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and that not too much
   weight be given to "Initial movements when the object appears to move."
   specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
   "Relative to Radar Settings" should include a statement of the type of
   radar employed.

FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
