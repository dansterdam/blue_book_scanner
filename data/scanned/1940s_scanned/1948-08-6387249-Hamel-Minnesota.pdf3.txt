ACTION TAKEN ON HAMEL, MINN, INCIDENT

Reference letter 17 Aug 1948 from Eq 5th Army, received MCIA(X)2-3 on
20 August 1948, pertaining to incident in Hamel, Minnesota, the following
action has been taken:

On 20 Aug 48 a call was placed to Hq, 5th Army, contacting Lt Col
William B. Allison, Executive Officer, G-2. Colonel Allison informed
this Headquarters that action would be taken to resurvey the incident
and to accomplish photographic and earth-sample investigations of
the area in which the incident occurred.

On 21 August (Saturday) a call was received by Capt Gordon from a
Major Morgan of Gq, 5th Army, informing Capt Gordon (MCIA(X)-3) that
the incident occasioned by the missile had been covered since the
indication. Unfortunately, however, since the occurrence there had been
two or three heavy rainfalls and the depression in the ground previously
ly noted was found to be 1/3 full of water. Photographic coverage was
made, however, and samples of rocks and earth in the depression were
extracted. This evidence was being forwarded to 5th Army HQ Area as
of Tuesday the 24th and will be forwarded this office (MCIA(X)-3)
immediately upon receipt, and should arrive t/is Hq by the end of the 
week.
