Dear Sir,

    With regard to your letter of September 19, 1949, I should
like to give an account of two strange occurrences.

    The first occurred in 1944, and you probably have
information on it already. It was in the spring or early
summer. I was in the army at Camp Breckinridge, Ky; when
at least fifty of us soldiers observed in the sky overhead,
a dirigible shaped flying north at high speed (about 900 m.p.h)
It was noon. The Chicago Tribune carried some articles that
week about reports of the craft. It seemed to have come from
the direction of Tennessee, thru Kentucky, Illinois and was
last seen heading out over Lake Michigan.

    The other was this summer Sept. 1., 10 p.m. on U.S. 16
10 miles west of L______ Lake, In in the sky to the South. I
and I sighted momentarily in the sky a sudden flash of light
and a red and green cone of flames shooting across the sky.
There are no airports, searchlights, etc, and there were no planes
in the vicinity. The trail of flame seemed to be from 2½ to
4½ sec. and originated near the moon which was high in the
sky at this time.

    I have heard many reports of objects and green curtains
of flame as seen by many of my friends, who were very serious
and reliable in their reports.

    Two weeks ago the report came over the radio that
a craft of the type I mention in my first paragraph had been
seen flying across Alaska at speeds faster than credited to
any of our planes. This news never got any further.

    I am glad to be of service whenever possible in the
investigation of these phenomena which have intrigued me.

                                    Sincerely yours, 

                                    [signature]
                                    [rank and name], Michigan
