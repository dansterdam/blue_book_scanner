DETAILS:

   1. This investigation was requested by Colonel JOHN C. SHARP,
District Commander, DO #19, Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California, and
predicated upon receipt of an Intelligence Report from the 374th
Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California,
dated 5 August 1949, reporting the sighting of an unusual aerial
phenomenom at 1729 hours, 2 August 1949, by 1st LT GLEN D. HULL, AO-
936481, 1st LT JOHN HATT, AO-769696 and 1st PHILLIP C. KNAPP, AO-814090,

   2. On 27 August 1949 1st LT GLEN D. HULL, AO-936481, Aircraft
Commander, 374th Recon Sq (VLR) Weather, Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California,
was interviewed and stated in substance: On Tuesday 2 August 1949 "Lark
Dog" weather mission took off from Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California at
1330 hours MWT and started on the 1st leg of its weather flight to the
prescribed course and altitude, a true bearing of 300 degrees at fifteen
hundred (1500) feet, at their position number six (6) 44 degrees 15
minutes North and 132 degrees 57 minutes west his attention was directed
by the navigator, 1st LT JOHN MATT, to what appeared to be an unusual
cloud formation in the eastern sky. The object or streaks which appeared
to be clouds was first observed to be up at a great distance above the
clouds at fifteen hundred (1500) feet and second at a shallow angle,
approximately 37 degrees to the horizon, to be about fifteen thousand(15,000)
feet and then, continued at an angle of approximately 17-1/2 degrees to an
altitude of approximately seventeen thousand (17,000) feet. The formation
thin, wide in color, was approximately seventy-five (75) miles distant
from the point of observation. No unusual sounds were heard and HULL
stated that he did not see the streaks form and he could not
estimate the speed of formation. MATT rather stated that his first
impression of the visual moment on was that it might have been a
contrail, possibly formed by an unseen object. After the second segment
had been formed and the two had joined into a continuous streak HULL
turns his aircraft off course and took a photograph with a K-20 Aerial
Camera. The photograph is attached as inclosure to this report. No
object of any type was sighted during the period of observation, approxi-
mately 15 minutes, and the formation was lost to view after the "Lark Dog"
mission returned to course and continued on the scheduled flight. HULL
advised that three members of the crew observed the unusual aerial
phenomenon. Crew members participating in the "Lark Dog" weather mission
of 2 August 1949 were:
