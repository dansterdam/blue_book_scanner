"Vapor trail" was at an angle of approximately fifty degrees from the horizon when first observed. The source was not visible from the ground due to the altitude of the trail. The speed, in Mr. ------------ estimation, based on time required to traverse horizon to horizon, was greater than a gasoline propelled craft, and he automatically thought the trail was formed by an Army or Navy jet propelled craft, Mr. ------------ stated that he was familiar with "vapor trails" from both the air and ground and he had seen innumerable such trails during his service as a B-29 Pilot in the European Theater. Mr. ------------ further stated that he is presently employed as Manager of the Paris Airport. Specific answers to essential elements of information, furnished by Mr. ------------ are attached hereto as Exhibit "D". Attached hereto as Exhibit "E" is an unsworn statement furnished by Mr. ------------ in support of the above interview.
