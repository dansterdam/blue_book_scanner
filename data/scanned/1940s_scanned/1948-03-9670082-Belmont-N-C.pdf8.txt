Incident #205 -- Belmont, North Carolina -- 8 March 1948

The speed of 600 M.P.H., the lack of an exhaust trail, and 
the reported "exactly horizontal course" make it extremely improba-
ble that the object seen in this incident was a meteor. The 
"steady red light which did not flicker" also argues against that
possibility. Since the observer was a technical man, it does not
seem likely that his observations can be considered subjective
enough to fit them into an astronomical hypothesis.
