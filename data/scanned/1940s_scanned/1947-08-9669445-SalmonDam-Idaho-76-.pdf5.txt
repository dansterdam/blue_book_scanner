The image in the document appears to be a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch seems to illustrate a landscape with something in the sky, which might be an interpretation of the objects mentioned in the text. It is a simple line drawing, with the upper part of the image having some scribbled lines, likely representing the trajectory or motion of the UFOs described. The lower part of the image shows a curved line with several circles or dots on it, which might represent the horizon and possibly trees or other landmarks.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Agent could not locate ******************** but ***************** who
accompanied ********* at the time stated that he and ********* could hear a
roar. They looked up and saw 2 objects flying at great height which
might have been between 1,000 and 10,000 ft. He could give no estimate as to
size and said they could have been several miles away. He and ***********
were satisfied that had seen something and were very doubtful if the objects
were planes.

From a newspaper account (Times News, Twin Falls, Idaho, Friday Aug 15, 1947)
**************** said he had seen an unusual object in the air on
the same day as *********'s experience (Incident 75) and that a sound resembling
the echo of a motor caused him to look upward and there he saw two circular
objects which reflected light. They were traveling at a great speed and at
higher altitude than most planes.
