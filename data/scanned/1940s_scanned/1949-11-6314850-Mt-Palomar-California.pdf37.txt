Attention: Lt. Col. P. M. Butman

Dear Col. Butman:

As you undoubtedly know, this Laboratory holds a bi-weekly colloquium for its staff members, one purpose of which is to keep us in touch with technical and scientific developments in parts of the country other than Los Alamos. To this end I thought that perhaps the Air Force might care to give us a talk on the technical and scientific aspects of their studies concerning so-called "flying saucers". If you think they might, would you be good enough to make inquiry through appropriate channels in Washington?

I wish to make it perfectly clear that the Laboratory claims no official cognizance in this field of activity; but it is my belief that our staff members would be extremely interested in a discussion of the serious and scientific aspects of the Air Force's studies of the "flying saucer" phenomena. I do not suggest that anyone be asked to make a special trip for the purpose of addressing our Colloquium; but would hope that someone engaged in this work might be passing through Albuquerque and could stop off at Los Alamos for this purpose.

Any approach which you may initiate will be greatly appreciated.

Very sincerely yours,

William H. Crew
Assistant Director for
Scientific Personnel
