Incident #5 -- Josie, Idaho -- Date unknown (probably November 1947)

Very little can be said of this incident, inasmuch as the 
date and exact time of observation, speed, altitude and size of 
object, and length of time in sight are not stated. The speed and 
time in sight are particularly important in forming a judgment. 
In the absence of this information, no more than can be said is
that the object might have been a fireball.
