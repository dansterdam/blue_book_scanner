UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #63 -- Silver Springs, Ohio -- 7 Aug 1947

From all evidence, it appears that the object seen here
was a bright meteor. Slow-moving meteors occur before midnight,
and, while their paths are almost never "absolutely horizontal,"
it is quite possible that two observers could have judged this im-
pression, since the object was in sight for only three or four
seconds. Furthermore, an observer, surprised by an unusual occur-
rence, often tends to overestimate the actual duration of time;
thus, "three or four seconds" might mean not much more than a second.

There is nothing at all in the evidence that cannot be
explained under the assumption that the object was a meteor.
