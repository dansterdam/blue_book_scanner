SUBJECT: FLYING OBJECT REPORTED OVER PHILADELPHIA
AUGUST 6, 1947
SABOTAGE

Rymtel August 7 last.

Miss [REDACTED], Philadelphia, who is employed by the [REDACTED] MANUFACTURING COMPANY, 1524 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, advised as follows:

Between 10:30 and 10:45 p.m. on August 6, 1947, DEERRED RECORDING she was in the bedroom of her home with [REDACTED]. She was facing north and observed a large white object traveling at a very fast rate of speed to the south. There was a buzzing sound, not too loud but plainly audible, just after this object passed through the air. This white object left in its trail a thin streak of smoke, which was grayish in color.

Miss [REDACTED], Philadelphia, who is employed by the PRESSMAN & GUTMAN COMPANY, INC., 1700 Market Street Building, Philadelphia, stated she was sitting on the steps of 1119 Pine Street with [REDACTED] the morning of August 6, 1947, around 10:45 p.m. engaging in conversation with Miss [REDACTED]. Miss [REDACTED] abruptly stopped in the middle of her conversation and appeared to be frightened by something she saw in the sky in the direction in which she was facing south. She did not give any description of a sky object nor noting Miss [REDACTED] change of expression, but she did hear a slight buzzing sound.

[REDACTED], Philadelphia, an insurance agent, who was a former pilot of B-24's in the Army Air Corps, advised as follows:

He was sitting on the steps of his home around 10:45 p.m. on August 6, 1947, with his wife, and his neighbors, the [REDACTED] Family, were sitting on their steps next door to the residence of [REDACTED]. All of the above persons were facing east. [REDACTED] noticed at this time an object, emitting a bluish-white flame, passing quickly through the air. The object was traveling from northeast to southwest. Using his experience in the Army Air Corps as a guide, [REDACTED] estimated the above object was between 1000 and 3000 feet in the air and traveling at a rate of between 400 to 500 miles an hour. This object did not leave a trail as in a vapor trail, such as is left by either smoke or a condensation trail with its normal position in the air. For about two seconds, a hissing sound accompanied the passing of this object. This sound was a kind not nearly as loud as the noise accompanying the passing of a rocket ship.
