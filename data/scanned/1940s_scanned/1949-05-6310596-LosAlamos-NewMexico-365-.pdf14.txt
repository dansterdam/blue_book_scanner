Incident no. _____

1. Date of Observation 3 May 1949 Date of interview 12 May 1949

2. Exact time of observation (local) 2125 and 2140

3. Place of Observation: 2125 = Station 3JQ, Los Alamos, New Mexico               
                           2140 = M-6 & M-7 and new access road, Los Alamos
                           (Map Coordinates)

4. Position of observer (air, car, bldg, location of - give details):

5. What attracted attention to object: Light

6. Number of objects and sketch of formation or grouping: One each time.

7. Apparent size (compare to known object, e.g., moon, thumb or
   fist at arms length): 2125 = size of baseball diamond lights   
                           2140 = slightly larger than fire box lights

8. Color of object: 2125 = White
                    2140 = Red

9. Shape (give graphic description - compare with known object):

10. Altitude (Angle of elevation above horizon - 0ยบ at horizon, 90ยบ
    overhead):  2125 = approx 10 degrees above horizon
                 2140 = approx 10 to 15 degrees above horizon

11. Direction from observer (angle clockwise from north):
    East

12. Distance from observer (Distance to town, bldg., etc., over which obje
    appeared to be):

13. Direction of flight of object (s): S.E. to N.W.

14. Time in sight: 2125 = 5 seconds
                   2140 = 2 seconds

15. Speed (time to cover given angular distance): approximately same
    speed as aircraft landing
