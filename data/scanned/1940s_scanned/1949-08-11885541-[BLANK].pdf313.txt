Incident No. 17 - 21, June 1947, afternoon, Mt. Rainier, Washington.
One witness viewed nine, “saucer-like discs” from the air calculated to be
20 to 25 miles distant and 45 - 50 feet in length, (about 2 times as long as
wide) which traveled 47 miles in 102 seconds (1700 MPH). Dr. Hynek calculated
mathematically (see Appendix B) that assuming the estimate of distance to be
accurate, in order to see such detail, the objects would need to have been at
least 100 feet thick, therefore, 2000 feet long. If the estimated size is
more nearly correct, then to have been seen as described, the objects would
have been roughly six miles distant. At this distance they would have traveled 
only 1½ miles in 102 seconds, or approximately 1000 MPH. The entire report of 
this incident is replete with inconsistencies. It is to be noted that the ob-
server has profited from this story by selling it to Fate magazine.

AIC Opinion: The report cannot bear even superficial examination, there-
fore, must be disregarded. There are strong indications that this report and
its attendant publicity is largely responsible for subsequent reports.
