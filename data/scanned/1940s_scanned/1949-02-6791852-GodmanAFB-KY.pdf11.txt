STATEMENT

I Cpl. Richard G. Dumphy AR11179389_1913-__AAFS Det, Godman Field, Fort Knox, Kentucky, was on duty on the night of 7 February 1949, When an unidentified object appeared in the South Westerly Skies. Sgt. Ledbetter had first noticed the object and brought my attention to it. The object at that time appeared to be about the size of a soft ball, with flashes of red, green and yellow. The position of the object was taken and logged on the form 13.

The object appeared to be traveling in a straight line, away from our position, and getting dimmer from the time it was first sighted until the time it disappeared, which was exactly 20 minutes.
