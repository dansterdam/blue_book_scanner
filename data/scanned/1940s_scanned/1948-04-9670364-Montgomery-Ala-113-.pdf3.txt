The image appears to be a scanned document with significant degradation, dark spots, and noise, making it difficult to read the text. No clear photographs can be discerned apart from text and markings indicating its former classified status. However, I will try to transcribe the visible text from the document as best as I can:

```
CONFIDENTIAL

[...] (R40ME[...]251/[...]) with: Report of Information [...]
[...] E[...] 48-0[...]and comments.

1. Two to three thousand feet below [...] about twenty degrees [...] to
most powerful horizontal plane [...] clear [...].

2. Three to four hundred feet [...].

[...] checked in comparison [...] having the shape of a [...]
parachute.

FOR THE COMMANDING GENERAL

[Signature]
S/A F. GUTHRIE

The actual text may differ due to the poor quality of the document and the inability to clearly discern all characters.
