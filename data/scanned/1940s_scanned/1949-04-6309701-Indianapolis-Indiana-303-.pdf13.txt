The image does not contain a photograph. It is a scanned image of a document that is marked "UNCLASSIFIED". The document is not clear and the text is very faint. Based on the visible information, I will now attempt to replicate the text as an OCR system:

```
UNCLASSIFIED

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS
DOD DIR 5200.10

UNCLASSIFIED
```

The rest of the document's contents are illegible in the image provided.
