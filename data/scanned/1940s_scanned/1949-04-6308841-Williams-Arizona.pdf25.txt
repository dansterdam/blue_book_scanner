FIREBALL traveled a straight course in north westerly direction. No sound was heard; no smoke or exhaust was evident and informant did not notice the effects on clouds. Considering FIREBALL as a meteoroid, would be traveling 22.62 miles per second. FIREBALL probably fell to earth south and east of Las Vegas, Nevada. Informant knows of no one who has ever seen a FIREBALL except one said to be employed by Dr. [name redacted] for 13 years and has been a museum for 2 and 3 years as guide and lecturer.
