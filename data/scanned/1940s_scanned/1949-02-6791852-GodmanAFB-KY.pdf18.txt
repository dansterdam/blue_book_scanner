STATEMENT

I Richard E. Peterman was called to the tower on the night of 7 February 1949. Sgt Ledbetter was there and pointed out a bright object in the sky, which appeared to me to be about the size of a golf ball. The object was changing color from red, green to yellow. The elevation was 03.6 degrees. The object was observed in the southwest. I could not determine the distance, but it appeared to be great. The object was followed for twenty minutes. I was unable to tell what speed the object was traveling, and could not hear any noise or sense any odor; there was no trail left behind. There was no projections from this object, it was just turning around in a small space and changing colors. It changed color once and disappeared. There were no clouds, the weather was clear with approximately ten miles visibility.
