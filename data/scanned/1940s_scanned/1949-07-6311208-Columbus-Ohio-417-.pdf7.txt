NARRATIVE SUMMARY

On 1 August 1949, ________ motor oiler, _________ Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed, concerning a space ship which he saw in the sky, and stated ir substance:

On 31 July, 1949, at approximately 1915 hours, I saw an object in the sky, very high, at an altitude of about five thousand feet. The object was due west and was traveling in a westerly direction. The sky was generally clear, but there wore small fleecy clouds in the vicinity of the object. The object was oval-shaped, greyish-blue in color and about five times the size of the United States Navy airship, the "Constitution." I did not see an exaust trail and I heard no sounds when I first saw the object, I called to a ____________

takin; I called the to his sister, _________ who was also on his property at ________ and asised them if they could see the object. As I pointed duo west into the sky they sai& that they could see the object, as they spoie, two flares appeared to drop from the object. These were circular, and their color was similar to that which heat from a blast furnace. The flares wore approximately the size of an average search or floodlight, and they were illuminated for about one minute. The flares remained stationary, one near the lower right and tho other near the lower left of the object. They then rose very slow and rose extinguisha, first the right and then to the left. While the flares haj remained stationary under the object the light had forroa a haze around the phenomenon, making it difficult to see it clearly. When the flares were extinguished a sphere dropped from the object and settled directly underneath it. This sphere was a brillant white area about one-fifth the size of the setting sun. The object and sphere then appeared to rise and both disappeared into the clouds. I can call nothing further concerning this incident. (C-3)
