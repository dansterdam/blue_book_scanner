Synopsis
None, this is an initial report

Investigation initiated by District Commander, 13th OSI District. 
On 26 July 1949, Dr. ███████ and one witness saw an unidentified spinning object approximately four miles away at an altitude of 5,000 to 7,000 feet maintaining a straight course towards the southwest. Object was traveling at an estimated 400 - 500 MPH.
The object emitted a bright light which closer inspection revealed to be the sun shining off the upper surfaces of the object which looked like an upside down saucer about 25 feet in diameter and three or four feet thick. The object was in view about three minutes and finally disappeared behind a line of hills. The weather was clear with light scattered clouds at 10,000 - 15,000 feet in the southwest, with a visibility of 40 miles.
