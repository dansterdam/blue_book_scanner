On 4 July 48 at approx. 2115 P. M., CST, witness and his wife thought
they saw a star moving. There was a light in the sky the same color and
size of a star which was moving. They thought it was a plane but
it made no noise. The object moved across the sky, then descended its course
a bit and went straight and stopped again for about 5 seconds, changed its
course a bit and went straight for awhile and stopped again this time for a
last 15 seconds, then it went across the sky a little ways and dispersed
completely. When the object stopped in the sky, it resembled a star and only
by following its course could the difference be noticed.

NOTE: Witness states that he lives some 2-1/2 miles from two woman
(McKeesport, Pa.) who reported seeing a big silver plate zooming
noiselessly overhead in the direction of Kennywood Park. See Inc.
