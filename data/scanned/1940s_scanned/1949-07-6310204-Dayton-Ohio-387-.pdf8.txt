SUBJECT Report of Investigation

TO: AC/1 FROM: _____ DATE: 14July 49 COMMENT NO. 1

1. In compliance with telephone conversation of 11 July 1949 between ___
of ACI and Mr. _____ of ACI/NXS the following information regarding the sighting of an
unidentified aerial phenomena, by Mr. ______ ______, Dayton, Ohio is
submitted.

2. _____ was interviewed at his office (ACKNOWLEDGED) _____ stated that while standing
in his yard at approximately 1915 hours, 10 July 1949 his attention was attracted to a
yellowish object in the N.E. sky at a 30-45 degree elevation. As first the object
appeared disc shaped but upon closer examination thru binoculars it appeared to be two
objects connected together. The front or foremost object appeared as a yellow diamond
with a black spot in the center. This in turn was connected by cable or rope to a t with
yellow disc or oval object in the rear. The length to Width ratio appeared to be 5:1 or
roughly the size of the first two joints of the index finger held at arms length. In
the absence of any known aerial objects on which to base a comparison the observer was
unable to make a reliable estimate as to size, altitude or or [sic] distance from observer,
however, a guess was offered that this object may have been slightly larger than an F80 at an
altitude of 1000 feet and at a distance of three miles. The object was under observation
for a period of 15 minutes and was still in view when observer left scene. During this
period no movement of object was noticed.

3. The observer also mentioned reporting this matter to the airdrome office, Area
"B." A check of the log at the office of the airdrome officer indicates this report
was received at 1915 and what a check with the control tower to determine if they had
witnessed this object yielded a negative reply.

4. Interview of other witness to this incident are being conducted by other intelli-
gence agencies and their reports will be submitted upon receipt.

5. Project Grudge is unable to offer a logical explanation for this incident on the
basis of information submitted to date.
