                               Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Re radars now operating on ground

   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size
      of target:

   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (130Â°), etc.,
      and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable,
      how long did the target stay in the turn and what was
      its speed?

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into
      several targets upon approach:

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent
      with size of object; faint; fading, pulsating at regular rate:

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted

   a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits:

   b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.:

                       GENERAL

1. Teletype sequences of local weather conditions:
