(1) On 1 August 1949, the following article concerning the
sighting of unconventional aircraft was published in the Ohio State
Journal, Columbus, Ohio:

"Strange Ship Soars Over East Side"

"The sky over the east side of Columbus was full of strange
stuff last night, according to reports to police, who investigated
thoroughly but sufficiently to start investigation."

An east side call: "Police we saw a flying ship with red
striped portholes lowering over head between 7:15 and 7:25 p.m.

"Later, _____ told police ha had
seen it to[o] then hit[s] in the sky. Pretty soon one light blinked
out, then the other he said. The time? Between 7:15 and 7:30
p.m."

(2) On 1 August 1949, at another location, a garage at Fifth
Avenue, Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed, concerning a huge ship
which he saw in the sky. This informant said, and stated thus:

On 31 July 1949, at approximately 1815 hours, I saw an
object in the sky, very high, at an altitude of about five thousand
feet. It's color was dull metal - was traveling in a westerly
direction - was very round and clear cut, twice as tall
closer circles in the vicinity of the object. The object was oval-
shaped, provided with clear and about five times the size of the
United States Navy airplane, the "Constitution." I did not see an
exhaust trail, and I heard no sound. When I first saw the ob-
ject, I called to a ________ who was standing on his
property at ______________ talking, to his sister.
__________ Columbus, Ohio, and asked them if they could see the
object. As I pointed out they into the sky, they said that they
could see the object. As we stood, two strangers appeared to drop
from the object. These were circular, and their color was similar
to that of the object.
