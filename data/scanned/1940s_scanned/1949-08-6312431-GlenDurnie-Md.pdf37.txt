Honorable Robert E. Clapp, Jr.,
Assistant Attorney General
1901 Baltimore Trust Building
Baltimore, Maryland.

Dear Sir:-

As attorney for the Rotor-Planes, Inc., I wish to advise you that I am now in the process of gathering the necessary information which you requested in your letter of May 27, 1939. I will have this information in your office not later than Friday, August 4, 1939.

The matter of Rotor-Planes, Inc. has been taken up by the Securities Exchange Commission, and I am now in the process of furnishing information to the Washington Field Office. Mr. Duncan, the attorney in charge of the matter, has been dealing with me on this question.

Rotor-Planes, Inc. is a Maryland corporation and has taken over all the assets and assumed all of the liabilities of the Gray Goose, Inc., a Nevada corporation, under a contract of merger. I am now securing the approval of the Securities Exchange Commission on this merger agreement.

The information which you desire has been delayed being sent due to the fact that I have been out of my office a great deal during the last two months.

Thanking you for this courtesy, I am

Yours very truly,

/s/ Martin F. O'Donoghue
