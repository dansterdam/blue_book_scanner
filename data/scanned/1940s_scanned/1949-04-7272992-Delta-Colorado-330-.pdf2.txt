The photograph on the right side of the image appears to show a nighttime scene with a lit object, which could possibly be a light source or a reflection. The shape of the object is curved, possibly due to motion blur or the angle of the photograph. There is not enough detail to clearly identify the contents of the photo beyond this lit, curved feature.

The text on the document reads:
"rose, Colo., shown with
radio on Uncompahgre Plateau."
