Fact: the limit of binocular depth-perception is reached at a distance of
about 400 meters. Therefore precautions in the method and means to 
estimate the distance of unknown objects has the observer would have
no distance then any assumption as to linear speed and/or elevation is
without reason.

5. In a like manner it can be assumed that when film is shifted the elevation
of the object was 25°, the-subtended angle over (½ 12x12) and the angular
velocity 5°/sec., it is further assumed length of the object 25 feet
and 50 feet: to determine if object's speed and altitude would be explained
by present day aircraft.

a. Assuming length of 25 Feet
1. Distance from Observer 71,400’
2. Altitude of object 30,216’
3. Linear Velocity 4954 FT/SEC

b. Assuming length of 50 Feet
1. Distance from observer 142,800’
2. Altitude of object 60,372’
3. Linear Velocity 5,521

6. In view of the above no identification is offered.

7. If further research on this incident is desired an independent 
study by each involved agency will be requested.
