Memorandum for Record                                                              15 December 1952

SUBJECT: Call to Los Alamos, New Mexico

1. On the evening of 15 Dec 52, Capt E. J. Ruppelt called Mr. Homer T. Gittings, Jr., of 1537B Wlst Street, Los Alamos, New Mexico (Tele: 24850). The purpose of the call was to contact Mr. ******* in regard to some previous data that Capt Ruppelt had obtained about a correlation between the visual sightings of UFO and radiation from unknown sources. Previous to this, Capt Ruppelt sent Mr. ******** a registered letter requesting the data, but the letter was returned as unclaimed. Mr. ******** explained that when the letter arrived, he had been out of town and the post office had gotten mixed up on his instructions to hold any mail and had returned the letter.

2. Although not too much data could be obtained over the telephone, Mr. ****** did shed some light on some of the questions that had been asked in regard to the correlations. In the first place, a Mr. *********** of Los Alamos, New Mexico, phone 22663, was the person who knew people at Mt. Palomar who had also seen unidentified aerial objects at the same time they had detected some radiation. Contrary to previous beliefs, Mr. ****** was not there at the time and only heard of the incident through personal letters from these people at Mt. Palomar. Mr. ************ stated that he was sure that Mr. ****** could give us the names of the people at Palomar and there is a possibility that they are still there. The other gentleman involved in the sightings at Los Alamos is a Mr. ***************. Mr. *********** stated that between 1 Oct 51 and 1 Oct 52 he had picked three or four definite indications of radiation from unknown sources and that several of them had correlated with newspaper articles within two hours. He was not sure how many Mr. ****** obtained.

3. In describing the nature of the radiation which had been picked up, Mr. ********* stated that "they picked up a vertical component - a particle that penetrated three thin walled tubes and the roof of the building". The tubes are 5/8 inches in diameter and 2 inches on center. He stated that they had checked all sources of radiation from the laboratory and that this type of radiation was far out of line for any cosmic activity.

4. Mr. ******** was asked to obtain more information on the type of equipment that was used to get the radiation, the exact dates and time of all indicated radiation, and a little bit of background on each of the people. He was also told that personnel from Blue Book would try to contact him personally within the next two or three weeks to obtain all of this information.
