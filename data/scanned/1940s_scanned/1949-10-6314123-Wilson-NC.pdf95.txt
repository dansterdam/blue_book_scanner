I, ________________________________, Manchester, N. H., prior
to making the statement contained in the following paragraphs have
been told by HAROLD H. BURNEY, who has identified himself to me as
a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, USAF, that
I do not have to make any statement, and in any statement I may
make may be used against me in a court of law. I have also been in-
formed of my right to have an attorney. With such understanding, I
make the following statement of my own free will and accord, without
threat or fear of punishment and without inducement or promise of
immunity or reward.

On 20 October 1949, at approximately 1750 hours, while sitting
in an automobile at the intersection of Zagerdt Street and Gorefastown
Road, Manchester, New Hampshire, I happened to look in a Northwest
direction and saw an object explode in flames. The color of the flames
was white. I did not know what direction the object had been going in
until I saw this ball of flame. It then appeared to be falling straight
down, although at the distance that I was from it, which was about 15 to
20 miles, it could have been falling at an angle. I have seen jet air-
craft from time to time and this object seemed to be falling at about
the same speed or a little faster than a jet plane would go. I could
not distinguish any smoke or exhaust about the object when it was fall-
ing. When the object hit the ground, which was out of my visden, I
noticed a bright red flame come from the area where it had fallen. This
flame burned for about 20 to 25 minutes. I did not notice any protrus-
ions on the object nor did I see any lights. or small any odor or hear
any noise from it.

I had been working about eight hours on this day but was not tired
or felt any undue fatigue. I had a full night's sleep the night before
and I do not drink intoxicating liquors.

My father, ___________________, Manchester, N. H.,
did not see the object burst into flames but when I called him out of
the house he did see the bright red glow of the object burning on the
ground.

I have read this statement consisting of one page and it has been
read to me. I have signed and initialled all corrections. This state-
ment is the truth to the best of my knowledge and belief and I have
given it freely and voluntarily.
