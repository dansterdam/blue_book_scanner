RADAR

1. Rb radars now operating on ground

   a. Range - approximately 3 3/4 miles from the station.
      Speed - estimated at 60 MPH.
      Altitude - could not be determined.
      Size - at first observation the object appeared to 
             be the same size as an aircraft. When it 
             disappeared from the 75 mile scope it appear-
             ed too small to be an aircraft and too large
             to be a bird.

   b. Object did not turn.
