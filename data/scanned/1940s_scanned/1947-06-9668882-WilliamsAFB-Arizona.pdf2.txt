Forwarded herein. ***** and ******** deny, however, that they actually started
the Flying disc story, and their actual part in the story. United Airlines pilot, 
********, states that ******** and ********* on July 31, 1947, both related their
original Flying disc fragment story. Information gathered would indicate that
the anonymous phone calls were possibly made by these ********* in order to build
up the Flying disc story to the point where they could make a profitable sale
of the story to ***** or *****., Chicago, Illinois. No facts have been developed
which would definitely prove that ********* made these calls. However, from all
data and information gathered, it appears it is probably that these ****** likely to

and was on a Sunday evening. He believed it was the early part of June. ******* 
stated that ***** took him in the kitchen and proceeded to talk about this Flying
disc story in low muffled tones. He then stated ********** asked ******* suspicions,
and ****** shortly his wife came into the kitchen and was in a considerable rage,
telling ***** to admit that the Flying disc story was a plain fart boyish hoax and
admitted it. ****** stated that at this **** **** then went into the story
transpire, that **** then admitted that there was nothing whatever to his story
and it was an entire hoax. **** stated that in view of the enraged condition of ***** wife, he immediately left and reported to the Seattle Post Intelligencer that the entire story was a hoax and that they should not print it in any way.
