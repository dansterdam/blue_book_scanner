Incident #229 -- South Bay, Florida -- 13 November 1948
#228a -- Riviera Beach, Florida -- 14 November 1948

There seem to be two separate occurrences reported in
this incident, but the information given for each is entirely
insufficient for adequate analysis.

In #229, the location of the object in the sky is not
given, nor is the hour of observation. The moon and Jupiter were
visible in the early evening, the moon quite high, and Jupiter
setting in the west. One might hazard a guess that Jupiter seen
through a variable mist or hig thin cloud coverage appeared to
blink on and die out. The larger planets often become temporarily
spectacular when they are low, near to the horizon and the weather
conditions are right.

#228a occurred at dusk, with the observers looking out
over the ocean. The nearly-full moon was fairly high in the
southeastern sky at that time; there might possibly be some
connection between it and the object observed, if weather condi-
tions were unusual.
