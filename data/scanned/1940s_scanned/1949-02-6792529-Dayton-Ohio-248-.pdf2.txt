Incident No. 2 UU

Relative to Radar Sightings

1. Radars now operating on ground:

   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude, and size
      of target:

   b. Did targets execute any turns? If so, what angle (>90Â°), etc.,
      and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable,
      how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed:

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several
      targets upon approach:

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent with
      size of object; faint; fading, pulsating at regular rate:

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted

   a. Were there any radar indications or erraticness on radio circuits:

   b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.

ATMOSPHERE

1. Give sequence of local weather conditions.

2. Winds aloft report:
