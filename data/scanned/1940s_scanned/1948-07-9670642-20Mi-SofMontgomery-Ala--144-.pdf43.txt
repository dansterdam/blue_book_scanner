The image appears to depict a hand-drawn illustration rather than a photograph. It shows a sketch that resembles a balloon-shaped object with a pattern of vertical stripes and a structure hanging below it. There is also a rough sketch of a less-defined object to the upper right side of this drawing that could also be interpreted as a flying object.
