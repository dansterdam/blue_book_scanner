The image appears to be a scanned page with two circular shapes on it. The left circular shape is smaller with a mottled texture featuring dots across its surface, while the right circular shape is larger with a rough, speckled texture that's denser towards the middle. Both shapes look like they have been either drawn or stamped on the paper with a rough, non-uniform texture and there's no clear context or detail beyond these shapes that can be distinguished.

The image quality is quite poor and the text is mostly illegible. The text on the right side seems to be badly smudged and the text at the bottom is faint, making it near impossible to accurately transcribe the words. If you need a precise transcription of the document, you might want to find a better-quality version of the image or the original document for clearer examination.
