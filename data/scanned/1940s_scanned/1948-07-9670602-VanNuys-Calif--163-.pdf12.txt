UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #163 -- VanNuys, California -- 21 July 1948

Since a complete description of this incident is given
in numerous reports from Mt. Wilson Observatory and Griffith Planetarium, since the observations there were made with telescopes by astronomical observers, and since their descriptions agree that the object was in all respects balloon-like, there is nothing that this investigator can add. The object was evidently an unidentified balloon.
