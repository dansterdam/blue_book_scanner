Time 3:00 Date 30 Aug 49

FROM International News Service Representative—Denver, Colo.

MESSAGE

In Captain Datchkojnakdy's absence, representative asked to talk to secretary.

INS Rep: What is this story on the radio about some flying saucers at White Sands Proving Ground? It is put out by a Mr. Clyde Roberts from Los Angeles—I believe.

Mrs. D. We have not released any information of such a nature from this office, however Mr. Roberts was a guest of the Navy last week, and if he has made a release, they will be able to give you the information on same. Shall I switch you to the Navy headquarters where you may confirm his source of information, if any?

INS Rep: Then you do not know anything about such a story?

Mrs. D. We have no such information, nor have we made any releases, in this office. However, I will switch you to Captain Gorry, and he will be able to answer your questions—since Mr. Roberts visited their headquarters recently.

Switched call to Captain Gorry's extension.
