The image provided appears to be a page from a document, but due to the poor quality and lack of detail, no photograph is discernible within the image. As for the text, there is some text visible, including names of some locations on a map such as Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Washington. However, the text is faint, and not all content can be accurately transcribed due to the low contrast and resolution.

From the discernible parts, I can attempt to reproduce the text as follows:

CLEVELAND
NEW YORK
PITTSBURGH
WASHINGTON

Due to the image quality and my current capabilities, I'm unable to provide a precise textual reproduction of the entire page. If you need the entire content, it would be better to refer to the original source or a higher quality reproduction.
