At approximately 1320 Sgt Cook from the CIC's office notified the observer
(T/Sgt Quinton A Blackwell) that according to Ft Knox Military Police &
FBI "some State Police, a large circular object about 250 to 300 ft in
diameter was over Mansville, Ky. Advised him to check with Army Flight
Svc. They advised negative but shortly thereafter reported object over
Irvington, Ky, then Owensboro, Ky. Object first sighted by Blackwell about
1345 to 1350 over south Godman Fld.

Verification: Is Lt Orner (Detachment Commander)
Capt Carter (Operations Officer)
Col Hix (CO) sighted it about 1420

At approximately 1430 to 1440, four F-51's approached Godman f/south
enroute f/Marietta, O, to Standiford Fld, Ky. or Blackwell asked
Flight leader NG 669 to attempt to identify object. Accompanied by two
other planes he proceeded south f/Godman. Fourth plane proceeded to
Standiford Fld alone.

About 1445, flight leader (NG 669) reported sighting object "ahead and
above - still climbing" At 15,000 ft he reported "Object directly ahead
and above and moving about half my speed." Again "it appears metallic
or tremendous size." Still later it "I'm still climbing - object is above and
ahead moving about my speed or faster - I'm trying to close in for better
look." This was about 1515. Five minutes later the other two ships turned
back. NG 800 reported "it appeared like the reflection of sunlight on an
airplane canopy." Shortly afterward this same pilot, (NG 800) resumed search
going to 33,000 ft, 100 miles south but did not sight anything.
