Incident #200, a, b, c -- Crescent City, California -- 17 October 1948

This incident has no astronomical explanation.

Although the four observers had no technical training, their reports are remarkably consistent. The object was in sight several minutes, too long to be a meteor; it made a banking turn of 45Â° and appeared to reflect sunlight very strongly. The speed was great but not excessive.

The object seen could have been an advertising blimp, a balloon, or an aircraft. The banking turn appears to rule out the balloon, unless this was a subjective impression caused by the turning of the balloon in the wind.
