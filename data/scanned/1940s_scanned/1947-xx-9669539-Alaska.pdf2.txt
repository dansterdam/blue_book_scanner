Incident #72 -- Alaska -- 1947 (exact date not known)

From the scanty information available, it appears im-
probable that this object was astronomical, unless the report
represents a highly garbled and subjective account of a daylight
meteor. (The time of the sighting is not given, but it is assumed
from the description of the incident that it occurred during day-
light hours.)

It should be noted as a matter of general record that some
of the reports received at observatories of recognized fireballs
falls are so highly colored and garbled that if the astronomer did
not have independent evidence of the identity of the object, it
would be impossible to determine from these reports.
