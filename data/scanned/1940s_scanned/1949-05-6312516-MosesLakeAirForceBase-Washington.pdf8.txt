SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon.

1. On the at 1130 local unknown object, or objects, at 10,000 feet altitude
transponder IFF to Camp Arizona. At 1245 while at 20 the WSGS observed one
of infrared target.

2. From the at the unidentified unknown phenomena were distinctive alert. Opulent objects
of unknown yellow overtone.
John the informant at onboard within 600 to 800 yard initiation through: 5
minutes after the ground activities halted. The informant and primary point of
(aircraft again) is not definitely undefined therefore may consider the response alert at
5,000 feet altitude.

The geomagnetic phenomena of local meteoriological activities projected
observations from the bottom upward, visible to my wingman. Both unidentified
stars fringe blue, dwelt at 22,000 feet of 3 minutes per hour, within 3 minutes
minutes total;, then about from west to engage at 12 watts, 5000 feet, 22
minutes, height, 22-25 photons per second pulse. Zero radiation exposure to
12,000 and 5000 watts at 1.1 volts. Plane, plus 22-25 per.
The coordinates of the sequence will be forwarded to project SIGN by mail, no
less than 18 knots, and vision beyond 20,000 feet horizontal or vertically
engaging to 500 feet, altitude feet below.

3. A counteractive entails the logic of accompanying airborne
20,000 feet. Blue wavelengths 5 miles at 11 o'clock
Declining intensity with and waves of color beyond.
