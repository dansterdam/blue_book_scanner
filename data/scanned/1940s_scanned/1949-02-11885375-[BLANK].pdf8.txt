In addition, manned aircraft would require an excessive
percent weight of shielding for human protection, unless configura-
tions of extremely large size were used. If unshielded craft
were in operation, existing detection means would probably have
indicated their presence.

Metallurgical limitations to date, limit the rate of con-
verting the heat energy of the atomic source to useful propulsive
work to such an ineffective order of magnitude that such a power
system is quite unlikely from the standpoint of size and weight.

Stability

Aerodynamic (both static and dynamic through the use of
aerodynamic surfaces and weight distribution).

Servo-mechanism (gyro or accelerometer - servomotor system)

Control

Movable surfaces in airflow or jet

Jet (flow control or swiveling types).

Possible Spaceships

World knowledge, techniques, and resources are considered
to be presently adequate for the development of spaceships.

Distinguishing design and performance parameters are ex-
pected to be supplied as a special study by the Rand Project.

Probable Natural Phenomena

Astrophysical (meteors, comets, planetoids, etc.)
Astrophysical analysis is expected to be performed by
personnel of Ohio State University Research Foundation.

Electromagnetic (ball lightning, St. Elmo's Fire, Phos-
phorescence, corona, etc.).

Ordnance Items

While this analysis considers the reported objects largely
from the standpoint of aircraft with requirements for speed and
substantial duration of flight and range; it is entirely possible
that the configurations reported in small sizes could serve as
very useful ordnance items to take the place of (or supplement)
such short-range weapons of ground (infantry) warfare as the trench
mortar, hand grenades, etc. The small saucer-like, spinning,
