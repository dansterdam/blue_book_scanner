STATEMENT OF OBSERVER: At approximately 0010, 2 March 1949, while making a
foot patrol at Station 103, I observed a light low
in the sky. It appeared quite dim and constant in
intensity. It was traveling, rapidly in a horizontal
plane from north to south. I saw it for about two
seconds when the trees cut off my view. It appeared
to be traveling very fast as it crossed one half my
line of vision during the time I observed it.
