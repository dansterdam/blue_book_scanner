Incident No. 79 -- April 1947, Richmond, Virginia
A weather bureau observer at the Richmond Station observed on three dif-
ferent occasions, during the six-month period prior to April 1947, a
disc-like metal chrome object. All sightings were made through a theo-
dolite while making pilot observations. On the last reported sighting,
the balloon was at 15,000 feet altitude, the disc followed for fifteen
seconds. It was shaped like an ellipse with a flat level bottom and a
dome-like top. The altitude and speed were not estimated, but the ob-
ject, allegedly through the instrument, appeared larger than the bal-
loon. Another observer at the same station saw a similar object under
corresponding circumstances, with the exception that her balloon was
at an altitude of 27,000 feet and possessed a dull metallic luster.
There was good visibility on day of observation. Report of this
sighting was not submitted until 22 July 1947.

AMC Opinion: There is no readily apparent explanation. If there
were only one such object, it seems amazingly coincidental that it
would be seen four times near the pbibal of this station only. On the
other hand, there would have to have been a great number of these ob-
jects to rule out coincidence, and as the number of objects increases
so do the chances of sightings by other witnesses.
