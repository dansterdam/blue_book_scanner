HONOLULU AIRPORT., BALLOON WITH RADIOSONDS ATTACHED WILL BE RELEASED FROM

HONOLULU AIRPORT AT 1635Z. EXPECTED TO REACH 10000 FEET AT 1545H

6. Mr. ROBERT L. WOLFF, Meteorological Aide, US Weather Bureau, Honolulu
Airport Station, reported, 30 September 1949, that a radiosonde balloon had
been released by that facility at 1636 hours, Hawaiian time, 30 September 1949
(0236Z 1 October 49) and was in flight for forty-eight (48) minutes until the
tarninium was burst of balloon. WOLFF reported that the balloon involved was a
natural filled, white color, pure gum rubber sphere which was inflated to a dia-
meter of 7 feet. Suspended 50 feet from the balloon was a radiosonde transmitter
in a box approximately 4" x 10" x 10". Attached to the radiosonde transmitter
was an aerial three (3) feet in length. Mcuay between the transmitter and
balloon was a paper parachute, three (3) feet in diameter, so contrived that
when the balloon burst, the parachute persisted on the transmitter to glide, rather
than plummet, to the earth. The balloon and its entire data was white in color,
so selected because of the clear day and the color compliments the sunlight, en-
abling its dight to be followed with ease through an optical instrument, TEM
as the theodolite. The (3) color of balloons are employed by the Local Weather
Bureau according to WOLFF, white for use on bright clear sky days low use on
in case they and black for use on a cloudy day. The rate of ascent of balloon if dependant
winds; however, the average rate is roughly 1000 feet per minute. As the balloon rises,
it expands and in atmospheric pressure, reaching dilation of 12 to 18 feet, accord-
ing to WOLFF. WOLFF further advises that if atmospheric conditions are favorable,
it is possible to pick out and follow a balloon at a height of 45,000 feet. After
consulting a Winds Aloft Computation Sheet prepared from the flight of this balloon,
Mr. WOLFF expressed the opinion that the unidentified flying object observed could
well have been the balloon released by the Weather Bureau, as this balloon was in
flight during the time and followed the path described. Mr. WOLFF further advised
that the balloon was tracked by Mr. W.A. TRUEBLOOD, Meteorological Aide, US
Weather Bureau, Honolulu Airport Station.

Mr. WOLFF for the local times indicated on 30 September 1949
