The image contains a drawing or illustration rather than a photograph. The drawing depicts multiple circular shapes arranged in a loose group, with several small circles and one larger circle. The arrangement is somewhat reminiscent of a cluster or formation seen from below, perhaps intended to depict objects witnessed in the sky, such as the UFOs mentioned in the text. There are two groupings of these circles, with one group consisting of tightly packed circles and the other showing a looser arrangement.

The document text is as follows:

color and numbering about 20. They were plainly visible and either spheroid or disc shaped. They appeared to be jockeying back and forth in the group formation which gave the overall impression of a shotgun blast pattern. The objects were thought to be moving in excess of 500 at approximately 5,000 ft (immediately below the clouds) from NW to SE and were definitely climbing and at great volume. Just before they were sighted a loud roaring sound was heard which w-s attributed to a strong wind blowing through the surrounding woods. However, as the objects approached and passed, the sound sharpened into a buzz much like that made by a group of jet aircraft. No exhaust trails were visible. There were no photographs available.
