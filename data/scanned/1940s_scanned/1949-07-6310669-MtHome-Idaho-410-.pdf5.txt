NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
          _______verbal account of his sighting was as follows: On 24 July 1949, _______,
was flying his Piper Clipper aircraft (N5622H), from Ogden, Utah en route to ______, Idaho.
was 270 about 1205 hours (MST), was flying at 10,000 feet MSL altitude, with
a heading of about 270 degrees, ten (10) miles from ______, Idaho, when he sighted seven (7)
flying objects at about 7 o'clock, (nose of his plane used as 12 o'clock for this
reference), flying the parallel course, but about 500 feet lower. For an instant as
he had his plane at his left shoulder (he was flying alone in a single cockpit Piper
aircraft), and the objects turned out to be about 25-26 feet across. _____ also
knew that they were right; that he had over 4000 hours. The objects overtook his
aircraft, passing on his left (south side) at about 500 feet distance, at approximately
500 feet lower, or 9500 feet MSL altitude. The objects were flying perfect formation,
to - rows of three (line abreast) and the seventh slightly to the rear about
slightly above the rest. The distance that the formation was vy tight, being about
one-third of the object's span extended from tip of one object to tip of the other
(approximately 15 feet). The same distance was maintained from trailing edge of lead
objects to nose of objects in second line. When the objects had passed
craft, they made a turn to the right, passing about 1500 feet in front of, and 500
feet below ______ the objects again turned to the right, and passed on the right
(north) side of _______banked or skidded. The objects made perfect formation turns, and
in so doing they neither gained or did the objects disturbed that when the objects first
turned, he thought they meant to ram him. As soon as the objects passed to his right,

speed was estimated between 450 and 550 miles an hour.
the objects suddenly disappear at approximately ten (10) miles distance from him.

        In describing the objects, _____ said they were delta shaped flying wings to
estimated their span as being between that of an F-51 and an A-26 aircraft (35. 55
feet), & their length (nose to trailing edge) at about 20 to 30 feet, and their
thickness from 2 to 5 feet. _____said that the objects were light color except
for a circle or dark color or approximately 12 feet in diameter which was placed
midway between th tips of the object, and which extended to the trailing edge of the
object (see sketch). _____said that he could not describe the colors---they were
