The last line of the document contains characters that seem to be individually placed, rather than forming a coherent sentence or phrase. They read: "A T U B E W I T H A N A N T E N N A O N T O P." This could possibly represent an attempt to describe the shape of the observed UFO as a tube with an antenna on top, expressed in a disjointed manner.
