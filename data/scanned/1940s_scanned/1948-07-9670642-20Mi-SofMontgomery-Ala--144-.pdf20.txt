Dear Sir:

Enclosed is an article concerning a mysterious silvery tubular
flame-belching object that climbed through Western Alaska skies late
Sunday. I feel sure that this is the same type object that 
almost collided with an Eastern Airlines DC-3 in 1948.

I would like to take this time to review this case for I think
it is outstanding.

For on the evening of July 24, 1948...an Eastern Airlines DC-3
took off from Houston, Texas, & was on a southeast-to-northeast 
****** intercepting stops between. The pilots were Clarence S. Chiles
and John B. Whitted. At about 2:45 a.m.; when the flight was 20 miles
southwest of Montgomery, the captain, Chiles, saw a light dead ahead
and closing fast. His first reaction, he later reported to an ATIC
investigation team, was that it was a jet, but in an instant he realized
that even a jet couldn't close as fast as this light was closing.
Chiles gave the co-pilot, John B. Whitted, the latter on top of which
tap on the arm, and whetted (sic) two with his night pilot on top of signal
Chiles racked the DC-3 up into a tight, left t(em) + us the UFO
flaming jet by about 700 feet by the DC-3's left turbules (sic). And
Whitted looked back just as the UFO pulled up in a steep climb.

Both of the pilots had gotten a good look at the UFO and were
able to give a good description to the Air Force intelligence people.
It was a B-29 fuselage. The windows had in particular a ***** were
"two rows of windows from which bright lights glowed," and a
"50-foot trail of orange-red flame" shot out the back.

By now, does ATIC know what this object was? If so, does ATIC
also know where this object came from?

One thing for sure when you take a object traveling at tremendous
speed about 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the earth, that is bathtub-shaped
would most certainly also be a B-29 unless the object would have *****  
birds had trailing flames shot from ***** go make my
said **** with *****

I will be looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

(REDACTED)
