or a device or thought wave before achieving such sufficing to explain such devices. It is doubtful whether a potential enemy would arouse our curiosity in such idle fashions.

CLASSIFICATION OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL OBJECTS.

1) Meteors: It is noteworthy that the British physicist Lovell writing "Physics Today" mentions the rapid discovery of new daytime meteorologs which followed the maneuvers during 1947. The reported objects lose little of their interest however if they are of meteoritic origin.

2) Animals: although the objects as described seem less animal than anything else, there are few reliable reports on extraterrestrial animals.

3) Space Ships. The following considerations pertain:

a) If there is an extra terre trial civilization which has made such objects as reported or it is most probably that its development is far in advance of ours. This argument on by a most orderly probability arguments sans without recourse of astronomical hypotheses.

b) Such civilization might observe us on earth we may have atomic bombs and even fast developing rockets. In view of the past history of mankind they should be alarmed. We should therefore expect at this time above all to behold such visitations.

Since the acts of mankind most easily observed from a distance are A-bomb explosions we should expect some relation to obtain between the time of A-bomb explosion, the times at which the space ships are seen, and the time required for such ship to arrive from and return to home-base.

2) A meteorologist should compute the approximate error required to
