Attention-
Major M. W. Tankh

Recived a wire to-day from The Analysis Diviram - requesting a personal
interview regarding incident stated in a 
letter of January 06-â€™48.

The wire was not delivered to me but 
came thru the mail -- It is so vague as 
to date time or place of interview of 
question I ams

Also since the 14th of ----- is a month
since I called attention to important
errata occurring here, and as attempt to
contact me is left until now -- I am sure
this is not serious is only a routine follow up of
an every day occurrence.
