Package received from Sheriff Merle T. Wilmeth, Watseka, Ill. His letter states the instrument in the package was found by a farmer at Danforth, Ill. It landed in the middle of a section of his farm land and burned weeds 20 feet tall to fine ash an area of 12 feet in diam. around where the object dropped.

The Instrument consists of:

(a) Plaster of paris body having an oval cavity thru it.

(b) A power microphone which screws over one end of the oval cavity. The power microphone carried the name, "Nathaniel Baldwin Inc." Salt Lake City, Utah. Pat May 10 1910 & Jept. 1, 1916. Pat 103 957403 (second number not readable)

(c) A small "Polymat" filter condenser.

(d) Two bakelite cylinders to which is attached a net work of fine copper wires. These were obviously coils and the impact has torn the wires from the cores. (Our radio section definitely states that this is old stuff, or the coils were used quite some time ago, since having been replaced by smaller more efficient coils)

(e) A piece of metal having magnetic properties obviously broken off the power microphone as a result of the impact.

The plaster of paris body was broken up by the impact but some of the pieces were held together by wire reinforcement inside the plaster of paris.
