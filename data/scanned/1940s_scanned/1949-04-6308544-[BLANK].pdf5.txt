of daylight sightings should have been of dark objects.. It is possible, 
of course, that they may have thought the objects were bright because
they expected all aerial objects to be bright. 

On the basis of the evidence thus far considered, the most guess
as to the nature of a visual stimulus the would old old reports of 
unidentified flying objects is that in the daytime it would be the 

reflection o: the sun front an aircraft, a wind-blown object, etc,, 
and at night some direct light source, such as an engine exhaust, the 
11 ht on a weather balloon, a running, light on an aircraft, a meteor, 
etc, or light from the ground or the moon reflected back by birds or 
other objects in the air. 

Discussion of Sow ral Specific 1eports 

DI ocussion of a few specific reports will serve to Illustrate sume 
of tho points brought up earlier, particularly some of the factors that 
make observations of aerial phenomena inaccurate. 

Incidents Ifo. 51 and 163. 

In one case (Investigation No, 51) a civilian employee at Muroc 
Field at 0900 observed what looked like a balloon with a bright object 
suspended below it. It was estimated to by at abeut 6,000 Ft. The 
bright object appeared to reflect the sun's rays at times. After a 
few minutes he looked away and then could not find the object ag"n. 

In another case (Inc. 163) a reserve officer at Van Nuys, California, 
about an hour before dark saw an object that looked somewhat like a 
weather balloon at about 2000 Ft. He kept it in sight for about an 
hour. He later concluded that it was at a great height. At first it 
had the color of a fluorescent electric light but became orange as the 
sun went down and then rather suddenly bekame invisible. 

Both of these objects could well have been just what they appeared 
to resemble most--balloons. The sun was low in the sky in both cases.
