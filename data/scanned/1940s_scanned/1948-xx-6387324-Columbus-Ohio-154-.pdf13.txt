On 24 Aug at approx. 1645 a round object which appeared to be about 20 to
30 ft in diameter was observed moving in southerly direction from the
north over center of Columbus. Had constant grey-bluish perimeter with a 
transparent center. The blue sky could be observed through this grey-black 
perimeter while it moved at a constant, slaw speed of about 15 MPH. It
made no noise if any kind. Once it hesitated in its movement and a thin
trail of smoke issued from the opposite direction of travel. The smoke 
soon dissipated and was not seen again during the 10 to 15 minute object
was visible to the observer. The object changed position - but not direction
of travel - three times. When first seen, (1) it evidently presented a side
view which was paddle long in the back. Several times to its original
and it became circular in form only to revert after a time to its original
form. The altitude was judged to be some 1500 to 2000 ft above ground.

Agent's note: [Redacted] drew the following sketches

Fourth       Third         Second                                 First

The above drawings constitute four positions of one phase. The
object passed thru three of these phases during the 15 minute period.
