SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO     Commanding General
       Air Materiel Command
       Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
       Dayton, Ohio
       Attn: MCIAKXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAKX,
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2.  The Incident Summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against route line weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Army
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3.  It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Sighting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

                                                       FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
