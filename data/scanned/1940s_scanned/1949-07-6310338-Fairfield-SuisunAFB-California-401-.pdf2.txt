AIRWAYS AND AIR COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE
1901ST AACS SQUADRON
Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base, California

SUBJECT: Unusual object observed in the sky. 18 July 1949

TO: S-2, 1901st AACS Squadron.

I saw a small round object and very high 0500 hours 16 July 1949. It
gave off a glitter or gleam as the reflection of the sun rays hit it.

It was not moving but just lying in the same position constantly. Its
reflection gave it a metallic look.
