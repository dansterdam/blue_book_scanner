The image provided displays a document that is heavily blurred and faded, making it virtually impossible to decipher any photographs or text with clarity. Due to the poor quality, an accurate reproduction of text like an OCR system would not be feasible as text recognition depends on the distinction between characters and the background. Since the image does not meet the necessary clarity for text extraction and processing, I'm unable to fulfil the request to output all text found in the document.
