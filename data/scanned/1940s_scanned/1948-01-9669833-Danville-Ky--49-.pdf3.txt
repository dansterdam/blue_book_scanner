The image provided appears to contain a poorly preserved black-and-white photograph at the bottom, which is heavily distorted and unclear. It seems to be a long, dark smudge or streak which is not sufficient in detail to confidently describe what the subject matter might be.

Below is the transcribed text from the document:

According to WHIO news Broadcast at 2100-2115, 9 Jan 48, relayed from 
Danville, Kentucky, Mr. & Mrs. ( ) were driving in their car on 
Lebanon Pike, 5 miles NW, when they saw a pencil-like object flying very 
high which left a long trail of smoke or exhaust. The object afterwards 
turned into a beautiful fireworks display of sparks, etc. The object appeared 
to be traveling a straight course.
