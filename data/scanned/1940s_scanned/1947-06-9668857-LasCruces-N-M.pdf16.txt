WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

28 July 1947

Dear Sir:

SUBJECT: Flying Saucers

Commander Chief of Air Staff-22
Collection Branch, AF
Washington 25, D.C.

Supplemental to the com nicat'in I submit to your office,
dated 10 July 1947, I now desire to reo--t on additional
date hereafter obtained by other sources. It has been reported
that large numbers of people in this locality, a more detailed
number of whom was obtained on 24 July from _____ who mentioned
it in a letter written to me, have also been the observers.

The report she objects to have been either a silvery
sphere or kite which she would have taken to be a meteorological balloon
except for the fact that it did not rise into the air but remained
higher than the automobile and moved always at the same level. The auto-
mobile was moving about [50 mph -"Mach I" is written in the margin]. When in Las Vegas, N.M.
June 24 at 5 A.M.

There before was it in a location of 2 about ____ ft. It appeared some of
the time as if it could be a ball. There was nothing above the level of the
city. It might look or compare.

It darted or toward the east, then again, west and so on. The
circular motion was generally elliptically horizontal. Its speed did not change
so far as could be observed during the time of observation. He thought
it disappeared by simply becoming too thin to see.
