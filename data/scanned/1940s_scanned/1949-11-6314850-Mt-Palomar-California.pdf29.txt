The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a chart or graph with handwritten annotations and several circles labeled with letters A, B, C, and an unlabelled circle.

Since the document is partially faded and handwritten, the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) result might not be perfect, but I will reproduce it to the best of my ability:

```
                               UP
                               ⬆️

                   etc. 2x-.

At the bottom right, it reads:

It's important to note that the accuracy of this OCR output is limited by the clarity of the handwriting and the resolution of the image provided.
