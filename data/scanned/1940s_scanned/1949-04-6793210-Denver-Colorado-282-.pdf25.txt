1. AF Form 112 on the above project was compiled by this office
on 17 April 1949, but waiting on your copy of the 14th District OSI Re-
port, the consolidated report with OSI Investigation Report was not for-
warded your office until 13 April 1949. Due to the delay in receiving
the OSI Report, a letter was forwarded to your command dated 13 April
1949, with information that the case was completed and positive identi-
fication made of alleged unconventional aircraft. Object was identified
as being the U.S. weather balloon released at the U.S. Weather Station,
Stapleton Airport, at 2003 hours MST, 5 April 1949. Our incident num-
ber is LAAP 0000.9-2.

2. We beg the fact that your inclosed Form is a duplicaton of
AF Form 112, which has been forwarded. We are extrating your Special
Form as no information copy of this office. If after reviewing our
completed form 112, it is still desired to have us compile your special
form, please advise us.
