File No. 24-185 /

18. Control and stability:

    (a) Fins - None noted. UNCLA... ("T")
    
    (b) Stabilizers - Conceivably the flanges or extensions from the
        disc could have served as stabilizers.
        
19. Air ducts:

    The only aperture reported was an opening between the flanges and
    disc which permitted a view directly through the object at certain positions.

20. Speed:

    Speeds varied during the 45 minutes of observation. A maximum of
    400 miles per hour was estimated.

21. Sound:

    No sound emanating from the object was heard.

22. Manner of disappearance:

    Faded from view.

23. Relative to the observer:

    Name: [Redacted]
    Address: [Redacted], Los Angeles, California
    Permanent mailing address: [Redacted], Arizona.
    Occupation: Owner of Old Gold Bond Mine at Goldfield, Arizona.
    
    Reliability:

    [Redacted] manner during the two hour interview was direct and
    businesslike. In personal appearance he was well dressed and neat. His
    descriptions were precise; his statements were coherent and consistent. The
    agent did notice, however, that [Redacted] was inclined to be emotional, and his
    face moved nervously on occasions. [Redacted] claims his vision is good, although
    he wears glasses to correct minor defects due to advancing age. He is about
    50 years of age.
    
    A check of the records at the University of Southern California
    reveals that [Redacted] took courses in education, Sociology and Psychology at
    that University in the summers of 1923 and 1924. No degree was obtained.
    These same records also reflect that he later attended the Lawton Business
    College at Mesa, Arizona. This information confirms [Redacted] statements
    concerning his education.
    
    [Redacted] claims to be an amateur astronomer, and to
    have his own telescope with 9-inch reflector.
