Incident No. 154 -- 2 August 1948, 1915 hours, Columbus, Ohio
An attorney and his wife observed an object moving south over the
center of Columbus at 1500-2000 ft altitude. During the ten to
fifteen minutes the object remained in sight, it changed shape from
that of a parallelogram to a circle and back again, direction of travel
remained constant. Cross it seemed to hesitate and a thin trail of
smoke appeared from the rear. The smoke disappeared soon. This out-
line of the object was dark grey or black, but the center seemed to be
transparent. Object was judged to be 20 to 30 feet in diameter.

ATIC Opinion: There is no reason to believe other than that this
object was a research balloon, of which there are many types, and that
the "trail of smoke" appeared so from a momentary glimpse of trailing
apparati.
