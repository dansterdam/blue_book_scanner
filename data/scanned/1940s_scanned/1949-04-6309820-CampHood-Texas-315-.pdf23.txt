                                                            Relative to Radar Sightings

1.  RoRadars now operating on ground
    a.  Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size
        of target:
                     Not applicable
    b.  Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180 degrees),
         etc., and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not
         observable, how long did the target stay in the turn and
         what was its speed:
                     Not applicable
    c.  Note particularly any separation of distant target into

                     Not applicable
    d.  Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent
        with size of object; faint; fading; pulsating at regular rate:
                     Not applicable
    e.  Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually:
                     Not applicable
2.  If airborne, when object was sighted
    a.  Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits:
                     Not applicable
    b.  Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.;
                     Not applicable

                                   GENERAL

    Weather Station reports are not available
2.  Winds aloft report:
                     Not available
    a.  Adiabatic chart for period in question:
                     Not available

                                                                3

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
