Incident 207-3

Statement of S/Sgt John J. Kushner corroborates account of 2d Lt 
Kenwood N. Jackeon and 2d Lt Henry G. Combs. Sgt Kushner was on
ground duty when he heard a noise. Turning his head in the direction 
of the sound, he saw a shining object coming across the sky. It 
made a sound similar to a P-47 only twice as loud. It seemed to
him to be coming from the direction of the 2239th Engineering Hangar 
across the field toward Hanger #1. It wasn't very high. It couldn't 
have been a P-47 and witness did not see an exhaust. Shortly after-
wards, he heard the same noise only higher up over the field. He 
stated the object did not resemble an aircraft.
