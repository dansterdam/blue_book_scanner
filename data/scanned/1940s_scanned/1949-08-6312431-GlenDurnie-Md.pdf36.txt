Judge William C. Walsh,
Attorney General of Maryland
Baltimore Trust Bldg.,
Baltimore, Md.

Dear Judge:

Re: Gray Goose Airways

Mr. William A. Driggers, of 1530 Olive St., N.E., Wash.,
D. C., was in my office on April 3, and informed that J. E.
Caldwell, the prime mover and secretary-treasurer, and general
manager of the subject is located at Old Frederick Road and Ingleside
Avenue, lately from which place he is attempting to sell stock to
the citizens of Maryland. According to Mr. Driggers' statement, he
has already sold some shares to Sergt. Johnson, initials not given,
who is stationed at the Aviation Base at Aberdeen, Md.

He also stated that a Carl H. Davis, who is a brother of
Mrs. Caldwell, is selling stock. As we understand it, this has been
a stock jobbing proposition for a number of years, and I find in my
files on November 25, 1936, we wrote to Mr. O'Conor, the then Attorney-
General, copy of which letter is probably in your file; but received
no reply.

We find from our records that this matter might bear a
little investigation under our Blue Sky Act.

The writer will be glad to assist in any way.

Very truly yours

/s/ R. W. Test
Managing Director
