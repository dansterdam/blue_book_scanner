The image shows a very grainy and low-quality photograph or reproduction of an object with an irregular, somewhat elliptical shape. There are some dark spots or irregularities on the surface. The photo is predominantly white with a dark, uneven outline. It is not clear what the object is from this image alone.

The text in the document states:

"UNCLASSIFIED" at the top right and "UNCLASSIFIED" at the bottom right of the page. There appears to be some other text or markings below "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top right, but it is not readable.
