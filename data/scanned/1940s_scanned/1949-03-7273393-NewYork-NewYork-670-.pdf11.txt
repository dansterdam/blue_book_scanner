The photograph shows a night scene where a cityscape can be seen along the bottom of the image, with numerous points of light from the buildings and perhaps street lights. Above the cityscape, dominating the upper half of the image, is a large, cloud-like formation. This formation is illuminated from behind or from within, giving it a soft glow against the dark sky. There are no distinct or recognizable objects such as aircraft or explicitly UFO-like forms within the cloud itself.
