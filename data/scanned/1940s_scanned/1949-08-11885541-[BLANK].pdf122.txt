...miles away -- near Red Liver, Oregon -- an [ILLEGIBLE] or live
The last of this incident is that a flash of light was
seen and a detaching sound or explosion heard at about 1715 on
a rainy evening. Clearly this description does apply to any
type of projector, such as a "flak" or an illumination dump or flasher;
rather, it is true that when a bolide explodes a blinding flash
or light is seen, and tremendous sounds are sometimes heard for
many seconds. Since this is, was obvious at the time of this in-
cident, and a light rain was falling, the earlier part of the
trail of the fireball (if that is what it was) was, of course,
not visible; only the flash from the final explosion, which
could have appeared essentially stationary, was seen.
In the absence of positive evidence of any other type
of explosion occurring in that vicinity at the time, it is the
opinion of this investigator that a bolide explosion was observed.
