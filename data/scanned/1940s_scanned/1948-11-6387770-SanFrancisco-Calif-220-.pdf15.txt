2130 Hours, 29 November 1948.

Mr. [REDACTED], an Air Force Veteran, now a Science teacher 
at the Francisco Junior High School, called and said that at 
2113 hours he observed a yellow light flashing across the sky 
headed due North, then turning North-to-Northwest and disappeared. 
The light lasted about seven seconds and appeared to be travelling 
too fast for a plane. However, it did not appear to be a comet 
or shooting star.

No Home Address: [REDACTED], San Francisco, Calif.
