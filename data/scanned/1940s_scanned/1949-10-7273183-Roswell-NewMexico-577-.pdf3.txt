The image appears to contain three photographs, each displaying a predominantly dark background which makes it difficult to discern any details. The middle photograph has a slightly visible circular or dot-like light source or object in the center. Unfortunately, due to the poor lighting and the quality of the copies, specific details of the photographs cannot be clearly made out.

The visible text on the document reads:

UNCLASSIFIED

Below each photograph, the word "UNCLASSIFIED" is stamped or printed, which indicates their classification level.
