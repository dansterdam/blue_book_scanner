With 701 incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation. This statement is true only under the assumption that the evidence is real and not noise (true anomalous physical, optical and physiological facts as into the instruments). When physical noise (noise that is explained accidentally as pointed out by Trainor C. Meade in "Types of A-E Harbor and Anchored Aircraft Local Environment Noise and Noise").

Analysis of optical propagation laboratory (T-2718)
212-1 was conducted.

These include sufficient psychological explanations for the
propensity to "live" objects to provide plausible explanation of
how UFO could move in space. The other two incidents are not
peculiar result chiefly from inability to obtain good, discemable size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail on the
reports. All these incidents fell into pattern in regard to the subjects type of object, or manner of performance. There are indications, however, of one enduring type of "cross" by flying objects. It is possible this may have been considered "transient" or "projected" crash in mentality.

VII. Summary & Evaluation of Scientific Reports

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix III) exhibited a
pattern of characteristics. Two of them, by statement of the reporters
did not have been in the U.S. the other two cases of the 34, four incidents (Incident No. 17), less were distributed without a pattern throughout the United States. A few were observed the U.S. The two descriptions of appearance or performance were exactly alike. The reported objects occurred at various times of day and year.

In the following section of this report, each remaining unexplained
incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to necessarily
answer each incident, but each case lends invaluable assistance in
doing to change our views on numerical designation is merely an identifier of the incident in the project files.
