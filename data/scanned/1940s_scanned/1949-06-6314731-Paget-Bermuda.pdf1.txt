Object was spherical in shape and brilliantly silver in color, and approximately 45-50 deg off the horizon due north of point of observation when first sighted and traveled due south. The original size was about that of a medium size star and as it proceeded south its size increase slightly. Object described in velocity and when at a position about 80 deg off the horizon in a line due south, it disappeared straight upward in a matter of seconds.
According to the latter, observation of the balloon from Paget would have been impossible. It is noted that the account given therein concerning the path of the weather balloon differs from that plotted.
