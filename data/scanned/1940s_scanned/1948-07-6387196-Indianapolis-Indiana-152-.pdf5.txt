Incident No. 152 - 31 July 1948, 0425 hours, Indianapolis, Indiana.
A man and his wife saw an object shaped like a cymbal, lusterless white in color, at an altitude of 2000 ft. The object moved across the sky to the east at approximately 1000 MPH on a level course and then rising into the sun, giving the appearance of spinning. It was steady fast in diameter and six to eight feet high in the center. There was no sound or exhaust.

A/C Opinion; This object could conceivably be the same as different analysis as that seen in Incident 151, although all the remaining evidence is widely divergent. No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.
