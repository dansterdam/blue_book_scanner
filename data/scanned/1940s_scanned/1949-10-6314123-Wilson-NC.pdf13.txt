Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.
12 October 1949

On 12 October 1949, about 11:15 o'clock, I was sitting behind a B-29 which was parked on the Main Alert Parking Ramp and I was facing approximately South East, when I saw a white looking round object that had the appearance of a balloon about 6" in diameter, coming from a Southward direction at an enormous rate of speed and, compared to the size of a B-29, it seemed to be about 35,000 feet in altitude. It seemed to curve slightly and disappear in a North East direction within approximately 45 seconds. I called to S/Sgt Boggs and S/Sgt Denning to look at it. Both boys said that they saw it and I called to about three other crew men, that were under the wing, to come look at it and due to the fast disappearance they were unable to see it.

This object was of a silver color but I did not notice any bright reflections from it and it appeared to have no external configurations nor vapor trails. The disappearance was sudden and there seemed to be no noise. The object seemed to pass between here and Alamogordo.
