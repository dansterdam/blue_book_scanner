PROJECT "SIGN"                                            DATE SUBMITTED: 16 Aug 1948
                                                                           
REPORT OF FINDINGS:

1. On 12 August 1948,  ███████████, Observer, Atlanta Naval Air Base,
Chamblee Georgia was interviewed. ███████████ stated that he was on duty in the
observation tower on 26 July 1948. About 2100 hours he sighted a blue white
light traveling southeast from northwest. He declined to estimate the altitude
of the light. However, the light was very high, traveling very fast, and
maintained a uniform altitude and speed. The light looked very much like a
shooting star except for the fact that it maintained a uniform altitude. Avery
stated he watched the light for a few seconds and then turned to get his field
glasses. The light appeared to gain altitude and then turned sharply to the south
and disappeared from his glasses, The weather was clear and still at the time
the light was sighted. █████████████ stated that he heard no sound and could furnish no
additional information concerning the aerial phenomena. He said that shortly
after he sighted the light, several residents of the area called the observation
tower and reported seeing the same thing. ███████████ stated that no flights of or
arrived at the station after 1910 hours on 26 July 1948                        [?-*]

AGENT’S NOTE: ███████████ considered a qualified observer, he served as an observer
in the U.S. Navy during the war and has performed tower duty at the Atlanta Naval
Air Base for the past four months.

2. On 12 August 1948, the following persons were interviewed and made
statements substantially the same: On 20 July 1948 they were seated on the
lawn of the Georgia School of Technology Housing Project at Chamblee, Georgia.
About 2045 hours Mrs █████████ noticed the strange light, and immediately called
it to the attention of her companion. A minute later appeared to be the size of a
football and was traveling southeast in a steady course. It was green and faded
into a silver colored tail. The light appeared to fade away in flight as if it
extinguished. The light was absolutely silent. Informants could furnish no
additional information.
