STATEMENT:
In compliance with instructions given me by Captain [redacted], I wish to report the following incident. This report is not to be construed as giving my personal opinion as to the possibility of the existence of interplanetary space ships, nor do I wish to appear as a "crackpot." I would not have given the information voluntarily. However, when asked the questions concerning the UFO's by Captain [redacted], my reply was that there had been many pilots who believed in interplanetary ships. I further stated that these same pilots do not wish to make their names public for obvious reasons. I further stated, that these statements by this (sic) pilots were always off the record, and I could not divulge my informants. The following is my statement:

1. [redacted]: I personally saw a flying object on March 8, 1950 at [redacted], England, about 01710 pm. This was a very clear day with no clouds around. A silvery object was observed through binoculars, and it was observed by the entire crew of the [redacted], of which I was a member. The object remained stationary for approximately five minutes and then suddenly disappeared at a very high rate of speed.

2. [redacted]: During the period of [redacted], England by [redacted] stationed at [redacted] AFB, NH, on [redacted], we all observed an unidentifiable object for a period in excess of three hours. This object was multi-colored and hovered, changing colors and noise powered, with no evidence of any physical evidence on earth putting it in a category of UFO.
