---
No. 219. Time of sighting coincides within a few minutes of the release time of the USAF rawlinsonde at Newburgh and a pilot balloon sounding at New York. Very little description given that can be interpreted as other being a burning balloon or an aerostar. No negative reasons was that the object moved from East to West, an impossible situation for a balloon since winds at all levels were westerly.
