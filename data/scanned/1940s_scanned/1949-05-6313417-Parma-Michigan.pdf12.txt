5. While questioning _____________, it was learned that a Mr.____
___________, who lives about 2 miles west and 3 miles south of ___________, 
Michigan, which is about two and a half miles west and north of __________, 
had seen in the vicinity of ___________. Upon questioning,_________
established that on 24 April 47 at about 1730 hours, he too 
had been in the company of ___________. Upon stopping the car to 
watch, ________ saw an object about 1-1/2 miles away, travelling 
in an east to west direction. The object moved in intervals and ____________
_______________removed to ____________ and __________
gun. ___________Jackson, Michigan, and was told at one of these 
service stations. She described this object as "shining much like on the 
end of a polished aluminum sucker-rod, or as if painted by a no-drat oleic 
flying saucer", and seemed surprised when questioned by this agent, as 
___________ and her husband live alone, operate the Chevrolet Sales 
and Service Agency at ____________, and both are Rotary Clubbies. 
Their manner of answering all questions was quite direct and sincere; 
no reason to doubt the veracity of this information was found.

AT ____________MICHIGAN
6. On 6 June 1949, Mr. ________________, one mile north 
of Parma, Michigan, on County at about 1000 was interviewed. Mr. ______, 
stated that "On 31 January at Rolland Townsend's land and my 70 acres 
were cultivating corn in the east field. I noticed a shiny piece of 
metal sticking in the ground about 100 feet from the east side of 
County Road, and in the middle of a row of corn. The reason I was 
curious about it was the fact that I had been picking up sickness from 
that area a few days before, and there had been no such object there 
at that time. I walked over and saw this metal disc stuck in the ground 
about 3 inches above and hadn't even driven those by, otherwise to crowd 
force. I pulled the disc from the ground and looked it over. It seemed 
to be about 9 inches in diameter and there was a piece of purple colored 
plastic sticking to one side of it. I did not think too much about 
it at the time, but carried it to the house at the end of the day and 
showed it to my wife. A short time later succeeding one of my neighbors 
came over, and I showed him the disc... This evening I will call the 
Citizen Patriot (a daily newspaper printed and circulated from the city 
of Jackson, Michigan). I finally reported the object to this newspaper 
on Friday, 3 June 49. Then one of their reporters came out and took 
the disc into Jackson. I haven't seen it since. I do not have any idea 
of what the disc is, and do not want anyone to think I am trying to 
cause trouble, but if there is any way that this can help anyone, then I 
want to do what is right."

7. AT JACKSON, MICHIGAN
After talking to Mr. __________, this agent proceeded to Jackson, 
Michigan, to locate the reporter from the aforementioned newspaper, and 
if possible to obtain the disc for study by the A.I.R.
