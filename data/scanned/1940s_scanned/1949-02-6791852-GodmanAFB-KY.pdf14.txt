STATEMENT

I, Sergeant Donald E. Ledbetter, was on duty in the
Control Tower, on the 7th of February 1949, from 0001C to 0700C,
at Godman Air Force Base.

At 0500C, I saw a bright object southwest of this field
resembling a star except it seemed much brighter, so much that it
caught my eye the second I saw it.

When using the binoculars, the object seemed to be rotat-
ing and the colors, red, yellow and green were very distinguishable.

At 0210C, the object disappeared completely with a series
of flashes. Lt. Clay, who was the Officer of the Day, at the time,
was called and advised of all pertinent information.

All of the above information was given to the Military
Flight Service Supervisor at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton,
Ohio, who's [sic] initials were M.K.

The Position of the object was determined by a theodolite
from the top of the hangar to be 242.5° horizontal and a vertical angle
of 23°.6.
