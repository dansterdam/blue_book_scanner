August 1949, in which request is made for results of investigation
of an alleged crash of an unidentified aerial object ten miles east
of Rodeo, New Mexico on 31 March 1949.

(1) mile away at the time of the explosion, that there were five
B-29 type aircraft over head. Air force Base, Las Vegas, Nevada,
through Survey Operations, has advised that the fragments and fuse of the exploded bomb were from a 100 or 150 pound bomb,
similar to the practice bombs used by the United States Air Force.

3. Inasmuch as the preliminary investigation by both this
office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed the explosion to have been caused by the detonation of a practice type bomb,
used by the United States Air Force, no further investigation was
conducted.
