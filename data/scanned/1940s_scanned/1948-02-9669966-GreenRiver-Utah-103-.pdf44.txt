UNCLASSIFIED

5. Mr. Morning exhibited a series of four photographs taken of a meteorite
dust cloud or "train" taken on 20 May 1944 by Cpl. A. L. Annis, ASN 52790171,
c/o Photo Section, PAAF, Pampa, Texas. The present address of the corporal is
unknown, but his photographs are copyrighted. Acquisition of these and other
photographs of similar nature would be valuable for Project "SIGN" for com-
parative purposes. Mr. Morning requested that if the copyright owner of these
photographs is located, he be informed so that he may obtain additional copies.

6. Mr. Morning quoted the book, "The Book of the Damned" by Charles Fort
as an interesting collection of unexplained aerial phenomena. He said that
the incidents are authentic, but Mr. Fort's conclusions and interpretations
are fantastic.

7. Mr. Morning said that he will keep this office informed of his opinions
on any future sightings of aerial phenomena that come to his knowledge.
