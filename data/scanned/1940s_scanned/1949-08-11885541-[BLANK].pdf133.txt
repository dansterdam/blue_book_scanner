or a device or techniques never before achieved could suffice to explain such devices. It is doubtful whether a potential enemy would arouse our curiosity in so idle a fashion.

CLASSIFICATION OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL OBJECTS.

1) Meteors: it is noteworthy that the British physicist Lovell writing in “Physics Today” mentions the easier discovery of a new daytime meteorology, which Lovell raised awareness during the 1947. The reported objects loom little of their trust; however, if they are of meteoritic origin.

2) Animals: although the objects as described, seem less animal than anything else, there are few reliable reports on extraterrestrial animals.

3) Space Ships. The following considerations are fair:

a) If th...re is an extra terre trial civilization which owns such objects as...re reported or let us most probably, that its development is far in advance of ours. this argument out by onverted or probability arguments alone without recourse to astronomical hypotheses.

b) Such a civilization might observe that on earth we now have atomic bombs and even fast developing rockets. in view of the past history of mankind they should be alarmed. We should therefore expect at this time above all to behold such visitations.

Aside the acts of mankind most easily observed from a distance are A-bomb explosions we should expect some relation to obtain between the time of A-bomb explosions, the time at which the space ships are seen, and the time required for such ships to arrive from and return to homebase.

PART III. RECOMMENDATIONS.

1) The file should be continued.

2) A meteorologist should compute the approximate error required to
