The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a photocopy or a scanned image of a map. Due to the quality of the image, the text is not very clear, which makes it hard to read the fine details. However, the following text can be deciphered from the document with some degree of confidence:

- DAKOTA
- MARSHALL
- ROBERTS
- GRANT
- CLARK
- COD
- DEUEL
- SD/PER
- WIND 3 MAY

The image also includes grid lines, county boundaries or jurisdiction divisions within a region, and it seems to have directional notation indicating north. The text "SD/PER WIND 3 MAY" might suggest a record linked to weather or wind conditions on May 3rd in South Dakota ("SD"), but this interpretation is speculative due to the limited legibility of the document.
