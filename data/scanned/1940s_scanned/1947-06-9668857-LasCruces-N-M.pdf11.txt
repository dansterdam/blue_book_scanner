The image provided is a scanned document page, but it does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a textual report with some parts redacted with black marker. I will provide the OCR text output of the document below:

---
Incident #30 -- between Las Cruses, New Mexico & White Sands V-2
firing grounds -- 29 June 1947

   The information given here is insufficient for any definite
conclusion to be drawn, but it is not i...,ossible that the object ob-
served was meteoric. The estimated ti... in si... is quite lon...;
however, and, if a meteor, this object should have had a preao..ced
vapor trail. The "solar specular reflection which seemed to change
in intensity" could, of course, have co... ilt jet from the meteor it-
self, blembed with, daylight.

   Once again, it is unfortunate that more detailed observa-
tions were not made.

Please note that due to the quality of the scan and the redactions, some parts of the text could not be accurately transcribed and are therefore represented with ellipses or incomplete phrases.
