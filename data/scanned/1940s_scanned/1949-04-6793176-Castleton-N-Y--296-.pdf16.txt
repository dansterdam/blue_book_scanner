Flying Saucers Seen
In Castleton Vicinity

Get a firm grip on your imagi-
nation for those shiny little ob-
jects that seem to disappear into
a "blue yonder."

The "flying saucers" yesterday
were reported over the Capitol Dis-
trict by an East Greenbush bus
driver.

Roy Wilkings, school bus driver
for the Columbia Central High
School, was about a mile north of
Castleton on his normal route,
when three objects, flying high,
caught his eye.

"SAUCERS, OR whatever you
call them, were about three miles
away and high up in the sky," he
said. "They seemed to be flying
in somewhat of a 'V' formation.

"They were spinning rapidly
and were about 20 times in dia-
meter," he added, "and were go-
ing towards the northeast."

According to Wilkings, they were
invisible only in the sunlight and
when a cloud came over, they
seemed to disappear.
