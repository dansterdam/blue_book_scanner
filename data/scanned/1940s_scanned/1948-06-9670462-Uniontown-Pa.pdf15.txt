22 August 1948

To whom it may concern:

at approximately eleven P.M.
on the evening of June fourthis
year 1948. - I witnessed what called
my attention to a luminous gliding object 
sailing through the air. Rather rapid
excluding the idea of it being a falling
body from a morite.
I would classify the same thing
today as a Round object, round 
airship it was, football like or oval
in shape rather moving ship on its way.
it moved fast. Was long in view,
because it disappeared below the point to 
view or scope, from the curve of 
earth's surface.
Figure, seems to have a soft
white element rather a trail or ex-
haust a yard or so in depth.
Loaded with a luminous pale azure-
ish soft lighting. Reason of it's slow-
ness in movement towards
                _____
