The image depicts a page from a document with several fields of typed data and a hand-drawn illustration. The illustration in the document appears to be a simple line drawing of a waveform-like shape with two humps, perhaps intended to represent the motion or shape of an object referred to in the report. Below the drawing, the text "Probable Aircraft" is written, presumably as a conclusion or interpretation of the observation.
