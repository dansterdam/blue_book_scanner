SUBJECT: Report of Observation of Unidentified Object
in Skies Above Godman Field

TO: Commanding General
Eleventh Air Force
1612 South Cameron street
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
ATTENTION: Lt. Col. Chandler PIO section

1. The inclosed certifications are of personnel from
Godman Field who witnessed the object in the southwestern sky
from Godman Field on 8 January 1948, with additional inform-
ation concerning the loss of a P-51, (N6899).

2. Standiford Tower, Standiford Field, Louisville,Ky.,
reported that two aircraft of unspecified type were,taking
off from Standiford at approximately 1500 hrs. and would be
directed to proceed to Godman to assist in determining the
definite status of the reported object. These aircraft did
not appear. another flight composed of four P-51's flew directly
over Godman Tower at approximately 1500 hrs. at which time
they were asked their identification. Upon being informed that
they were National Guard aircraft from Standiford Field and
upon their replying in the affirmative that sufficient gas was
available, they were asked if they would deviate from their
course to assist in determining the nature of the object. Their
ETA for the flight to Standiford was changed at that time.

3. The object, as it appeared to the undersigned, was
circular in shape and, if it was a great distance away, was
1/10th the size of a full moon. If it was an earthly object,
the size, as compared to the diminishing size of the P-51's
flying toward it, seemed to be at least several hundred feet
in diameter.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
