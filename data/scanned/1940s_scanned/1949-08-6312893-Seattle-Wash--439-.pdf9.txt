TCII 452 SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects 23 August 1949

(6) Altitude: Object was estimated four (4) to five (5) thousand feet.

(9) Sound: No sound was heard.

(10) Exhaust trail or not: No exhaust trail was noted.

G. Mr. ———, an Air Route Traffic Controller, was on duty at the Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport and noticed what appeared to be a jet aircraft in the direction of the Olympic Mountains at an estimated distance of twenty (20) to thirty (30) miles away. He brought this to the attention of Mr. ——— who was the senior controller on duty. Since they were aware that no jet units were stationed within this area they notified the McChord Flight Service Center. Mr. ——— on duty at the McChord Flight Service Center did not have a flight plan on any jet aircraft or fighter type aircraft in this area and made a check of all the military bases within the area to determine if any jet or fighter type aircraft were flying locally from their bases. A negative report was received. Mr. ——— and Mr. ——— both reported that they were definite that the object sighted displayed visual characteristics of a jet fighter and that its speed was such to lead them to believe it was a jet aircraft.
