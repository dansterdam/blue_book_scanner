estimate the distance, size or speed of such objects, and it would be 
easy to fail to recognize them.

Conclusions

​ It is concluded by the writer that there are sufficient psychological 
explanations for the reports of unidentified flying objects to 
provide plausible explanations for reports not otherwise explainable.

These errors in identifying real stimuli result chiefly from inability 
to estimate speed, distance and size.

Recommendations

​ The following recommendations are offered:

1. Test the ability of pilots to estimate the course of a small 
lighted balloon while doing aerobatics with it at night. It is suggested 
that several pilots try to fly pursuit curves and collision courses 
on such targets at night and report accurately their sensations. It 
would be desirable, but probably impossible, to keep them from knowing 
the nature of the light source.

2. In all future reports of unidentified objects specify the 
location of the object with reference to polar coordinates (direction 
and cu, above the horizon) rather than asking individuals to estimate 
distance. If possible, obtain an estimate of size in terms of the 
visual angle subtended by the object.

3. In all future investigations determine the angular position 
of the sun with respect to the unidentified object and the observer.
Also determine the approximate time during which the object was in 
sight (this information was not available for more than half the 
reports).
