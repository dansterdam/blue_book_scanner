Incident #93 -- Hartford, Connecticut -- 11 January 1943

Despite the absence of a trail and of sound, identifi-
cation of this object as a fireball at the very end of its tra-
jectory seems possible. It is described as "shooting toward
earth at 45Â°," as resembling a "shooting star," and as having a
very high velocity.
