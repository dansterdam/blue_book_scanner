The image does not contain a photograph. It is a scan of a page with handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and provide you with the text from the document:

```
Augusta, Ky, July 26,

Sir: Would be glad if the
"lightning in the sky"
last evening were natural
lights; maybe it was a-
tall weeping willow
of light, the hebst kind of
bomb Wright field.
We are 45 miles
up the Ohio river from
Cincinnati.
               --
Augusta
Kentucky
``` 

Please note that due to the handwritten nature of the text and any potential quality issues with the scan, there might be slight inaccuracies.
