The image appears to be a highly faded or degraded document, with a partial photograph of a curved object. The details of the photograph are difficult to discern due to the quality of the image. The object has a series of regular indentations or protrusions along its edge. The image's quality prohibits a precise description or identification of the object in the photograph.

As for the text, it is extremely faint and nearly illegible in most parts. From what can be made out, there is a word "UNCLASSIFIED" visible at the bottom right of the image. Due to the image's poor quality and faded text, extracting the full text from the document is unfortunately not feasible. It seems that some text runs along the top and bottom edges of the image, but it is not clear enough to be read accurately.
