The text of the document reads:

I have a suggestion, 1 out of many before, saw saucer in the sky as the same
time but never saw any behave such as
these or last as long as they did. It might
be altogether possible for falling star fragments
becoming the same path to repeat and almost
erase there such as these did but if they
do, I never hear of it. I hope that
is the explanation of what we saw because
I rather don't want to believe in the so
called flying discs!

I would appreciate any explanation
which you might give because I've puzzled
plenty over the thing since I saw it.
Incidentally, my wife never did see the
thing nor my other daughter, age two, and
the wife still thinks we're goofing to.

Trusting the above might be of some interest
to you and you might offer some explanation,
I remain

Yours Truly
