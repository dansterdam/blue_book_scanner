WHAT â€” ET JUL. 427:

On 4 April 1949, [Redacted], Associate Professor of Mathematics,
University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah was interviewed and stated that he was
driving north from the south side of Salt Lake City when he observed a flash-
ing object about thirty degrees above the horizon to the north. He
estimated the object to be traveling at an angle of sixty degrees with the
horizon and stated that the object was pouring off a short smoke or vapor
trail. [Redacted] placed the time of his observation as near 1000 hours MST and
indicated quite definitely that he believed the phenomena he had witnessed
to be a meteor. From reports he had received, [Redacted] estimated that the
object was at least twenty-five miles in the air at the time he first ob-
served it. The phenomena lasted no more than three quarters of a second by
[Redacted] account.
