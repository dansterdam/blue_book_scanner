The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document with mostly redacted or illegible text. However, I will transcribe the visible elements from the image:

```
179

(        ) Oct 1948

(        ) Redacted, Calif

(        ) Civilian

(        ) Report by(         ) Dudar(ry)
```

Please note that the text in parentheses represents areas where the content is not visible or is redacted, and the word "Dudar(ry)" might be an incorrect reading of an unclear or partially visible word due to the quality of the scan. The page number at the top right corner is "179".
