Incident No. 144. -- 23 May 1949, 1300 hours, Monroe, Michigan.
One passenger in a C-47 at 5000 ft observed three disc-like objects
and later two more (another observer saw only two two). The objects
appeared to disappear from above, level off at altitude of C-47 and
travel in the opposite direction at terrific speed. They left no trail,
were disc shaped and were "silvery-cold" or "shiny brass" in color.
One observer said they were 300-400 feet across with well rounded
contours, the other said they were four feet in size. The first ob-
server later said all had a hazy or fuzzy outline. There was an over-
cast at 15,000 feet and a thin, broken stratus layer at 5000 feet, the
level of the aircraft.

AF Opinion: Dr. Hynek suggests those individuals could have seen
successive flashes of sunlight through breaks in the high overcast il-
luminating portions of the lower cloud stratus. Apparent speed could
be a combination of projected motion of the break in the overcast and
the velocity of the C-47. This explanation partially fits the contra-
dictory evidence.
