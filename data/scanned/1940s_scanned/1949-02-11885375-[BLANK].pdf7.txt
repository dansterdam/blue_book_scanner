Considerations Affecting Analysis and Evaluation

OPERATIONAL

Inasmuch as there is a distinct possibility that a number of the reported incidents represent domestic projects of a secur- ity-classified nature, the list of incidents has been submitted to higher echelons for review.

Since weather balloons, blimps, airplanes of unusual size or configuration, and guided missiles test vehicles may represent some of the observed objects, all branchles[s] have to submit information to one of the vehicles and flights of such craft from the appropriate agencies.

In connection with the psychological studies being performed, extensive investigations, concerning the character and reliability of the reporting witnesses have been made.

TECHNICAL

A certain proportion of incidents appear to be real aircraft, though of unconventional configuration. In order to investigate the credibility of their existence the following factors must be considered in any technical analysis.

Aircraft

Method of Support (Lift)

Wings Fuselage Lift (Wingless) Rotor Vertical Jet Magnus Effect (rotating cylinder, cone or sphere, subjected to relative translational air velocity) Aerostatic (lighter-than-air craft)

Method of Propulsion (Thrust)

Propeller-reciprocating engine combination Jet, rocket, ramjet (utilizing conventional fuels and oxidants or possibly atomic energy) Aerodynamic (Katzmayr Effect - oscillating airfoils developing negative drag (thrust)

If an atomic energy powered engine were available, a small mass flow at a large velocity could accomplish the required lift and propulsive forces and the large energy expenditure would be of small importance.

However, the heat exchange requirements for the atomic powered engine appear to demand physical dimensions of inordinate size that presently would preclude the use of this powerplant for aircraft.
