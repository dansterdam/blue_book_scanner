be given a small acceleration - a theorem well understood by helicopter
designers.

The beams or rays mentioned do the contrary - a small mass is given
a very high velocity - consequently enormous powers - greater than the total
world's power capacity - would be needed to support even the smallest object
by such means.

METHOD II. Direct use of Earth's Magnetic Field.

One observer (incident 66) noticed a violent motion of a hand-held
compass. If we assume from this that the objects produced a magnetic
field, comparable with the Earth's field, namely 0.1 gauss, and that the
observer found that the object subtended an angle α at his position, then
the ampereturns of the required electromagnet is given by

ni = 30 R
α²

For instance, if R is one kilometer and the object is 40 meters in diameter, 
then ni ≈ 1 billion ampereturns.

Now if the object were actually only 10 meters away and were correspond-
ingly smaller, namely 10 cm in diameter, it would still require 10 million
ampereturns.

These figures are a little in excess of what can be conveniently done
on the ground. They make it seem unlikely that the effect was actually
observed.

Now the Earth's magnetic field would react on such a magnet to produce
not only a torque but also a force. This force depends not directly on
the Earth's field intensity but on its irregularity or gradient. This
force is obviously minute since the change in field over a distance of
10 meters (assumed diameter of the object) is scarcely measurable - more-
over the gradient is not predictable but changes due to local ore deposits.
