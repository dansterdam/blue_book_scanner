TITLE
Sighting of Aerial Phenomena on
20 August 1949 at Llano, Texas, by
Mr. [REDACTED]

REFERENCE
SPECIAL INQUIRY - UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT

SYNOPSIS
None, this is an initial report.

Investigation predicated upon information from Air Provost Marshal, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas and instructions from District Commander, District Office #10, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, in accordance with AFRSI Letter No. 85. On 22 August 1949, Mr. [REDACTED] telephoned Randolph Air Force Base that he had seen a "flying saucer" between 0300 and 0530 hours, Central Standard Time, on 20 August 1949. Mr. [REDACTED] contacted at Llano, Texas, stated he had seen an object flyin (15) feet high and three (3) or four (4) feet wide, containing eleven (11) quarter moons, six (6) inches in diameter. Object first sighted rising over edge of mountain, one and two-tenths (1.2) miles NE of observer's house. Object was copper colored and gave off sufficient light to cast shadows. Object rose straight up to height of 250 feet in two (2) minutes, stayed at this height about two South 1500 feet in two (2) hours. There were no clouds. Object made no sounds. Observer had no information on method of support, propulsion, air ducts, exhaust or manner of disappearance. Only other witness was Mrs. [REDACTED] who stated she saw object, but thought it was moon. Mr. [REDACTED] rancher, 54, is apparently sound in health except for cataract over left eye. Observer appeared somewhat eccentric due to claims that Milky Way, Big and Little Dipper are currently out of position, and that his ranch contains extensive deposits of uranium, diamond dust, graphite and iron. Mr. [REDACTED] had article on flying saucers in newspaper day before reporting incident.
