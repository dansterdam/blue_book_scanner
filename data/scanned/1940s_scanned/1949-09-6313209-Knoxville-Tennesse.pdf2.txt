SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

On 4 September 1949, ██████ ████████ ████████ and ███████ ████████
on a camping trip, both of Knoxville, Tenn., were interviewed and stated that while
sighted an unidentified flying object which was flying at very high altitude and at
a great rate of speed. The object was sighted by ███████ five miles north of Knoxville, they
1730 hrs., 1 Sept. 1949. ███████ first sighted the object while looking up into a
tree, at which time he called ███████ attention to it. Both were on the ground,
and the object, when sighted, was directly overhead at an altitude which they esti-
mated to be between 40,000 and 50,000 ft., and was flying at a high rate of speed
from the northeast (45 degrees) to the southwest (225 degrees). This object was in
level flight and in sight for from 2½ to 3 minutes from time of sighting. Object
appeared to be disc shaped and flat, and from the reflection appeared to be con-
structed of metal similar to that used in airplanes. There was no evidence of ex-
haust or vapor trails, nor was there any sound from the object. Both stated that
there was no surface wind, that the sky was void of clouds, and that the object
faded from view about three minutes after being sighted.
