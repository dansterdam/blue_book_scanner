b. It is doubtful that Venus could be observed by the unaided eye from the
ground or 15,000 feet as it would probably be hidden by the high degree of sky brightness
due to its proximity to the Sun.

c. Jupiter is the only other planet within ±90° of the sun during this period and
its magnitude of brightness is only -1.4 as compared with -3.4 of Venus, making it im-
possible to observe with the unaided eye. However, the following figures on the moon
are submitted for your information:

Time Local Altitude Azimuth
10:00 28° 00' 197°
10:30 26° 00' 201°
11:00 23° 00' 211°
11:30 20° 00' 220°
12:00 17° 00' 223°
12:30 13° 00' 229°

4. The evidence obtained from [BLACKED OUT] conclusively proves that this object was
not the planet Venus.

5. Sighting of 19 Aug 1948: Reference is now made to Incident No. 187 and to
an inclosed copy of a report received 2 November 1948 referring to another sighting
of an unidentified object at Godman Air Force Base on 19 August 1948, Enclosure [BLACKED OUT],
this present sighting seems to establish this object as being the planet Venus.
