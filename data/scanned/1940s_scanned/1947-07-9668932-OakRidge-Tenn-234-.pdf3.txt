The image contains a sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch appears to be an interpretation of a reported unidentified flying object (UFO). The image features a series of vertical lines or shapes with a horizontal base, suggesting a structured object with a flat bottom and protruding elements.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I'll transcribe the handwritten text found in the document:

---

Oak Ridge Tennessee Submit july 1947

actually
a development
plan, but
Submitted as

Please note that handwriting recognition can be less accurate than printed text recognition. The transcription provided is my best attempt at interpreting the handwritten text in the image.
