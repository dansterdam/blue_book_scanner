MYSTERIOUS FLYING BODY IS SEEN AT WILMINGTON

WILMINGTON, May 31 - Wilmington residents today reported another mystery sky object, but it was not
another flying saucer. An object which emitted smoke, was about as big as your hat and about three feet 
long which traveled at an "awfully high altitude, and not fast not fast" and made a sound like a scream,
of Bluesthen street at 1:20 a.m., back towards Green-
ville, than veered at a low speed, NW. by the Cape Fear
villa, a little to the west," Mrs. H. D. Alsobrook,
who lives at 709 South Sixth Street, said

Mrs. Alsobrook said that her sister who lives near,
called her to look at the strange object. Mrs.
Charles Colvin is the sister and is said to have seen
the object first. Mrs. S. P. Huffman, another neighbor
said she saw it too.

The local office of the Civil Aeronautics administration
discredited a suggestion by Bluesthenfield field's station manager James Flora, that the that could have been a F-80 plane in flight. "No comment, did it have wings? much place in
the sky here at the time.
