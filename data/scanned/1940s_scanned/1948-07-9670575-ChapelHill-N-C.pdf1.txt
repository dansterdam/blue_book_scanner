The image provided appears to be a scan of a document that is part of Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. There are no photographs present in this page of the document.

Due to the poor image quality, it's challenging to decipher all the information, but I'll transcribe as much readable text as I can:

"TEMPORARY AFR FORM 329 (2 Jan 52)
[Redacted]"

Several parts of the document are redacted or otherwise obscured, making it difficult to provide a complete transcription. It seems to be a report about an observation, including information such as date, time, location, a brief description of the sighting (including the number of objects and the duration), and remarks indicating that the objects were not observed but found on film.
