Incident #214 -- West Rindge, New Hampshire -- 7 July 1948

Inasmuch as the metallic particles concerned in this inci-
dent have been independently identified at MIT as parts of a cast-iron
cylinder, an astronomical explanation of the incident is precluded.
However, as a matter of general interest, it should be noted that iron
meteorites could have produced the same effect. It is assumed, of
course, that the MIT examination excluded the possibility of these
particular particles being meteorites.
