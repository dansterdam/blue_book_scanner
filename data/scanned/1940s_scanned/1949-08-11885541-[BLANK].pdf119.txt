Incident 337 -- Conour County, ....tana July 1 [Redacted] 1949

...tion is some conflict as to whether the object or
the smoke trail it created was visible for fif-
-teen minutes. If the object itself was, it could not have been
a meteor, but the gist of the report seems to indicate that only
the trail was visible for any length of time. In that case, it
could have been either the trail from a meteor or from an object
from an aircraft. The description is not sufficient to distin-
guish the two. Other observers in [those or other] the neigh-
borhood that the object was a high, flying plane with a vapor
trail, but this does not necessarily exclude the meteor's hypo-
thesis, because of the general unfamiliarity of the public with
such phenomena.
