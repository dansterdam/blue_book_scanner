The photograph present on the document appears to depict a classical "flying saucer"-type UFO. It seems to be an oval or disk-shaped object with a central dome, located in the sky, possibly exhibiting a degree of luminosity or reflective surface. The image is quite grainy and lacks detail, typical for many purported UFO photographs from the era.
