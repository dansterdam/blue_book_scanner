11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers sighted numerous silvery white objects. A noise which sounded like a group of ducks drew the attention of the observers. They were flying in formation. Several other groups followed this first group. All of them were in some sort of formation. Three objects were in sight during a one hour period, but no group was in sight form more than a few seconds.
