The image shows a black and white photocopy of a page with a roughly oval-shaped object that appears to be hand-drawn or a very grainy photograph. There are no discernible details within the oval shape that would allow for a more precise description.

Text on the document reads:
- "CONFIDENTIAL" is stamped diagonally across the lower left part of the image.
- "UNCLASSIFIED" is stamped on the bottom right, and also near the top right of the page, denoting that the document's classification has likely changed from confidential to unclassified.
