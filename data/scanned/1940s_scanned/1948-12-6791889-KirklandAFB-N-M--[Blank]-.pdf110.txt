The document contains two photographs at the top of the page. The photographs appear to be aerial, possibly taken from high above the ground. Both are circular in shape and look like they were taken through some sort of lens or circular aperture. One photograph is positioned slightly above and to the left of the other. They both show a clear sky with an object or a point of light near the center of each image.

Subject: Anomalous luminous phenomena (Third Report)

In the second report of this series, a description was given of the path,
path through the atmosphere of the green fireball, of 1948, December 12, 2342
(Mountain War Time), on the basis of observations made from one
station near Bernalillo Peak, New Mexico, and a second station near Los Alamos,
New Mexico, this fireball was found to have traversed part of its path with the
coordinates: latitude 35° 50' N., longitude 106° 30' W., and to have disappeared
at a point with the coordinates: latitude 35° 50' N., longitude 106° 30' W., and
traversing an almost horizontal path 5° N., on an elevation of about 10 miles above
sea level, with a length or orbit of roughly 32 miles, at a velocity of approximately
30 miles per second, (the minimum and maximum readings consistent with the observations
would tend to be about 114 miles, ranging roughly between Valle Caldera
3 and 6 miles per second, depending on the disputed subjects).

On the basis of corresponding observations of the much-remarked fireball
of 1948, December 20, 6h 52m P.M. only two pairs of Los Alamos observances,
it has now become possible to rule out as improbable total error. As will
be apparent from the original accounts of the Los Alamos retina by AEC
Inspector ███████████████ and Mrs. ██████ on 1948, December 20 was
observed under less favorable conditions why reason could can have
assurance of the night of December 20.
Accounts of the observers named supra, certified by their ███████████
and this on Diagnosis 21 and its exhibits discussing at Page Yellow (10 account-
ed out) unremarked on the other stands on reasoning of the public (viz., ███████
██ ███████, 1950 75 on for site assuance name, in 50 35' lat 106 30' W. for
but ███████, it has been practicable to arrive at considerable guidance from the
precise points on the Earth's surface for the presumed place of disappearance
of the object was quite central to █████ ████████ of the phenomenon.

The facts of this new fireball ███████████ is not official █████████ the divided than the
December 20 WJ Greenwood, it is my opinion that the two balls have been based
on the 20 observations disclosed above or the result, than the real differences
then the December 12 observations.
