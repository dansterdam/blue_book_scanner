The image contains two black and white illustrations (or depictions) positioned at different angles of the same elongated object with what appears to be fins or wings at one end. The object seems to resemble a classic illustration of some sort of flying craft or missile. There are no photographs contained in the image. 

Here is the text from the document:

Incident #242 -- Cartersville, Georgia -- 9 January 1948

While the possibility of this object's being a meteor
is not ruled out, it seems unlikely. Meteors are not known to
be "light sky blue," nor to travel so slowly as indicated. Moreover, report also states that color was an "intense blue," and,
if speed were underestimated (or if object had a large radial
velocity component --- coming largely "head-on"), it might possibly be interpreted as a fireball.
