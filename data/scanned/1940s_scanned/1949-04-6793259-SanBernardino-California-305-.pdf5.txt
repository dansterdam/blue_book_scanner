which is usually associated with jets. However, the first object which I 
saw answered quite well to all this talk of discs which has been going
around. It was definitely tumbling, and was smaller than our F-80s.
Our movement was relative however, I won't say in which direction it was
moving other than it was northerly. I might add here that on one of the
news programs of the following day, a reporter announced that three wore
ers in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, had seen a disc.
