26 November 1948

From: Commander W. J. Young, USNR

TO: District Intelligence Officer, 13ND

SUBJECT: Flying Disks, Report on,

1. Reporting officer has had occasion to do considerable
flying as passenger in connection with his duties. On several occasions he has witness d a phenomenon which could easily have been mis-
taken for flying disks. This phenomenon has been observed in the vast
plains of the Willamette Valley and the plains of Eastern Washington and
Oregon. One striking example was on the trip over the Willamette Valley
on a clear sunny day when the blue haze, always present, seemed somewhat
thicker than usual. Fine aircraft flying at 3,000 ft, appeared to be in
company with several planes flying to altitudes from approximately 1,000
to 5,000 feet. Some appeared on the beam of the airplane, others on the
bows or dead ahead. The objects would disappear from time to time and
new ones would appear. It was finally determined that what looked to be
aircraft at various altitudes were reflections of the sun from aluminum
roofs or barns and other farm buildings at great distances from the air-
craft. This was caused by the respective of land converging with sky
on the horizon, and the reflection of the roofs and the limited ground
visibility make it appear as though these objects were actually airborn
at various altitudes in the haze.

2. This report is not meant to discount the possibility of
"flying disks" but may be helpful in the evaluation of the many reports
which will be received from sincere sources once a cycle of such reports
has started.
