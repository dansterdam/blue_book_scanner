II. Appearance

(a) Forms

Spherical, roughly globular, egg-shaped, or pear-shaped;
many times with projecting streamers of flame-like ir-
regular "masses of light." Appearance of outer boundary
is generally hazy or ill-defined. Photographs of the
phenomenon may show one or several sinuous, tubular pro-
pagation paths (trajectories taken by luminous darts), which
may have associated with them broader luminous spaces of
irregular configuration. (These latter spaces probably
are regions where the sinuosities of path became involved
and tortuous or are areas of major discharge where darts
originated or terminated). Some paths show a beaded struc-
ture (alternate luminous and dark spaces).

(b) Color

Luminous in appearance, described in individual cases by
different colors but mostly reported as deep red or often
as glaring white. One scientist described the color as in a
certain case as similar to that he has noted in the labo-
ratory on observing active nitrogen, or possibly slightly
darker. Another observed one of yellow and still another
of lavendor or rose color. Others have reported some of
blue appearance. The luminous mass is occasionally stated
to be surrounded by a border, hazily but differently-
colored than the main body.

(c) Degrees of Brilliance

Brilliance not glaring; white and incandescent. Mini-
mum brilliance equal to that of feeble St. Elmo's Fire.

(d) Movement through Space

1. Possible directions.

Generally downward, inclined or horizontal, in straight,
curved, or tortuous paths. Mostly observed near the
surface, but may originate in thunderclouds, and so take
a trajectory from cloud to earth.

2. Manoeuvrability

May appear stationary, or moving. Range of speed is
zero to values of the order of 10‚Å∑ cm./sec. In the
