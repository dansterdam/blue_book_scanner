ENCLOSURE #3

TO: Captain J. P. Shea
FROM: Inspector
SUBJECT: Observations

1. This report is being made in writing at the request of

It will be divided into three parts: 1. Observations,
2. Recommendations, 3. A map indicating the point of my observations.
The third part of this report will not be submitted now, but will be
given later when a map is available to make this map accurate.

Inspectors ______ and myself, being on patrol for
the Reconnaissance Section A3335, arrived at Point Eagla 2050, December
20, 1948. We had driven up the road as far as it extended and was safe
under the circumstances and were sitting in the jeep with it headed
in the general direction of the road at this point. The direction in
which we were headed as well as all directions in this report will be
referred to with some degree of accuracy from the map which will be
submitted later to make this report complete.

As I was sitting in the jeep I observed a falling light in
the sky at approximately 2054. At first it appeared to be a white light
moving at about 45 degree cutch. As it continued to descent at [sic] angle
of sink rate was decreasing to the earth, it seem sinking to be an angle
until it went out of my vision at about a twenty degree angle behind
Point Eagla. I called the attention of Inspector ______ to this falling
light and he too observed it and has also been requested to make a report
on his observations. I continued to observe this phenomenon.
According to my first observations it appeared to be a white light,
clear and unbroken, falling very visibly through the night. However,
as I observed this light more closely it changed in appearance. It seemed
now to be broken instead of a clear stream. Its color was goldy [sic] and also
its nose seemed to have a red color, its back portion there changed.
Its stream of light left seemed [sic] however to be white. Its form seemed
to grow more concrete and seemed to be something besides just a white,
unbroken moving light. It seemed to have a Flat base, leaving a broken
red trail on each side. There it had appeared at a great height it was
now near the earth. Where its angle of glide had been 15 degrees, it
now appeared to have an angle of twenty degrees glide, and reminded me
very much of an airplane in flight. It seemed to fly through the air
object normally and not to fall straight to the earth as an uncontrolled
object controlled would. It was moving very very swiftly. It finally
disappeared behind Point Eagla.

The Headquarters was notified of our observations
and the angle movements. Upon this report I called ______ of the
laleer [sic] to 1-22 Headquarters and returned to Station 20 to make the
call, Found there ______ of the Armed Forces Physical Security
who had also observed the same things we did from a different point.
He observed there also. We made a report to them as well as
to you. We returned to Headquarters to find a suitable map to make
this report.
