3. On 9 November 1949, Miss [redacted] a student at the University of Washington, [redacted] Seattle, Washington, was interviewed at her home and stated in substance: A few months ago, during the morning hours, she had stepped off a bus and was walking along 15th Avenue Northeast toward her house when she noticed a small plane flying overhead. Immediately thereafter the mailman, whose route she is on and who had also gotten off the bus, called to her to look at the "flying discs". A tree blocked her view in the direction she was supposed to look and she was unable to see anything. She walked as far as her house with the mailman, who did not appear to be overly excited, but seemed to have a profound veneration for the preceding episode.
