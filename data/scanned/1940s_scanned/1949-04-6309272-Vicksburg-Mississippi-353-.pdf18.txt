see Captain GORYZ since the release had been made to newspapers covering the Navy
rocket firing. DICHECHENDY recalling the content of the articles, stated that it did
not mention any specific branch of the Armed Forces as having been the source of
information but stated it mentioned that two high ranking officers had discussed 
the information. The Sunday after the appearance of the story, DICHECHENDY met
Capt. GORYZ and asked him about the release of the story regarding flying discs
at White Sands Proving Ground. GORJYZ told DICHECHENDY, that this story did thing
of the Navy branching of discs in the Spring and that he (GORJYZ) got a whiff of same
(the story). DICHECHENDY judged from Captain GORYZ's manner and attitude that he did
not consider the release of the story to the news as anything very serious. It is 
DICHECHENDY's opinion that GORYZ does not believe the tracking of 50-called flying
discs as anything unusual.

DICHECHENDY revealed that from 7 April 1949, to 30 May 1949, he was in
attendance at the Radiological Defense School at Biloxi, Mississippi. Upon his
return to the White Sands Proving Ground as a result of the curious as Philip's information,
DICHECHENDY while reviewing the activities of White Sands during his absence, Sgt. 
PELAIA verbally informed DICHECHENDY that he had heard of the actual tracking by 
telemeter group at White Sands Proving Ground of what was believed to be a flying disc.
DICHECHENDY stated he followed this information up and interviewed Mr. CLYDES TOMBAUGH,
Chief, Optical section adjustment Section, White Sands Proving Ground, who informed him 
that the information in question had been prepared by the Technical Information
Division and said no official report had been made of this by the Public Information
Officer of the White Sands Proving Ground and he saw nothing in the news release on 
ceriring it.

On or about 5 July 1949, Mr. SCHULIN, Public Information Officer, 
National Advisory Committee, Washington, D. C., made a one day visit to White
Sands Proving Ground in a general orientation tour. Major LAMMERS, Third Army 
Information Officer on duty as aid for that release, arranged and conducted his tour
and travel on possible land terminal for ranges. SCHOLIN arrived and discovered that 
the Naval Operations Office and there met Commander McLAUGHLIN, who, during the 
visit revealed to SCHOLIN and in his (DICHECHENDY) presence, information regarding 
the tracking of the flying discs in the Spring by Naval White Sands Proving Ground 
personnel. DICHECHENDY said he interpreted McLAUGHLIN and raised the question
Public Information Officer at White Sands considered the information classified.
DICHECHENDY did this to protect the classification of the material and to call the
attention of SCHOLIN that the position of the Army in the matter. McLAUGHLIN replied
to DICHECHENDY that this was all know information by newsmen. It at that he 
did not know what McLAUGHLIN intended to imply by that statement. Nevertheless 
McLAUGHLIN proceeded to go into the details for SCHOLIN of the tracking accomplished 
by his personnel. DICHECHENDY again took occasion to interrupt McLAUGHLIN and
reiterated to him the position of the Army and the manner it treated the subjects.
After leaving McLAUGHLIN's office, DICHECHENDY told SCHOLIN that the White Sands
Proving Ground's Public Information Officer considered all information gathered 
on Flying Discs classified and any release regarding them would stem from official
information channels in Washington.
