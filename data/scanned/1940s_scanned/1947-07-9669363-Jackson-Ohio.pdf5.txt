cord similar to fragments attached to the bottom of what was apparently a rubber balloon and the bottom of a small parachute both of which were found at the same location as the instrument described above. Not enough remains of the balloon to enable this agent to estimate its size when inflated. The parachute which is made of crepe paper, bears a stomp reading: "Japanese 16-32 J. M. Apmn". It is composed of eight triangular sections measuring 15" x 32". Eight 20" red lines from the chute are attached to a wooden ring which measures about 17 1/2" in diameter. Eight lines extend from this ring a distance of 15 inches where they are laced together. A small piece of wire 12-1/2" in length with a 3/8" circular boss at one end was also found with the items described above. This wire resembles a small aerial.
