AT SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

1. On 29 September 1949, Mr. [Redacted], [Redacted] Street, San Francisco, California, signed the following statement:

These objects were oval in shape, a from 100 to 25,000 feet in altitude, at a distance laterally of approximately eight (8) miles, and at an angle of elevation from the horizon of approximately 55Â°. Sighting time was approximately 35 to 40 seconds and the objects appeared to be silvery in color, having oval shapes, and apparently of solid construction. Size of the objects, as they appeared from my view, were approximately 40 feet in diameter. The objects were going due North, and made no exhaust or effervescent.

There was no sound, no fins or stabilizers were visible, and nothing was seen of any means of propulsion. No slots or duct openings were noticed and the speed of objects was estimated at from one to one and one-half times faster than jet aircraft. The objects disappeared behind fog bank. I called the attention of the other members of the boat to these objects which appeared to be in formation, and after they had disappeared from view, several minutes later, I spotted approximately seven (7)
