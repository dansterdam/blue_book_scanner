The object when first sighted appeared white then it turned red. Its
real shape could not be distinguished until it descended. It then took
the form of some cy[n]lindrical object extending, (See Sketch "A")

Sketch "A"

When it shifted it was right side up (Sketch "B")

On ascending and descending it appeared to have a green mist following it
See Sketch "C" --- green mist

Speed could not be determined in miles per hour for it appeared to hover at
spots, then, when it moved, it moved with great speed. After making a
vertical descent and ascent it headed due SW at great speed and disappeared
at approx 1955 EST. Distance from the field when first sighted was some
5 to 20 miles. There was no sound. The trail, maybe from exhaust, was green (at least there the field glasses expired oxygen) During the
time it was under observation a cloud passed under it and the light shown thru.

According to this observer the object was not a balloon, a comet, a star or
any known aircraft. The light did not come from an aircraft's running lights.
The whole object appeared surrounded with burning gas or something which
emitted a light.
