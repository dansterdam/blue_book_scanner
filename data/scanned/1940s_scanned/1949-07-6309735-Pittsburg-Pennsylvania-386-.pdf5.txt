The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO, described as "STRANGE AIRCRAFT." The drawing shows a craft with an outlined, hazy appearance, featuring very bright windows. It's a side view, as seen by the observer.

The text in the document reads:

```
DRAWING OF STRANGE
AIRCRAFT.
OUTLINE HAZY
WINDOWS VERY BRIGHT
SIDE VIEW AS SEEN

Horizon in the distance about 10 seconds,
This Craft was not a flying saucer
but from its speed and shape it is not
based on the clay models which we
call Earth.
I have reported this craft to Mr. J Hapen
of the Buhl Planetarium NS.PBH Pa.
and he didnâ€™t have any reports of the obj.
I got your address in the saturday Evening
post yesterday from installment 11 of The
Arch. on Bogey Saucers. this is the first
time I saw anything about them in any
magazine.
I didn't get any point of my sanity or
meet as you suggest.
This is an honest and truthful statement.
I do not crave any publicity in the matter,
but correspondence is welcome.
Yours Truly,

[Signature redacted]
