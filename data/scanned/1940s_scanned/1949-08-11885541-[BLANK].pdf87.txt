Incident #52 -- near Moorhead, Minnesota -- 24 October 1949

Despite this observer's statement that the object seen
could not have been a meteor, the possibility is not ruled out.
Early evening is the most propitious time for the observation of
slow, bright meteors. This is the time of day when a meteor in-
bound to the sun and caught by the earth's gravitational field
would appear to travel from east to west, and could appear to rise
slightly. Most people identify meteors with sharp, fast flashes
of light, which are not at all characteristic of slow fireballs.
The observed turn is difficult but not impossible to explain;
this investigator would prefer, however, to think that it was an
illusion caused by perspective.
