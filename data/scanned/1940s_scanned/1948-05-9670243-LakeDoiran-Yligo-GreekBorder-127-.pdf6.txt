The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, and it does not contain any photographs. The text is challenging to read due to the quality of the scan. From what is visible, here is my attempt to transcribe the text:

Please note that many portions of the text are not legible due to the poor quality of the scan, and some words are obscured by redaction. The document appears to reference a sighting of a flying object and an attempt to measure its speed, as well as the mention of radar, binoculars, and jets. It seems to be associated with a military or government record, consistent with the historical Project Blue Book investigation into UFOs.
