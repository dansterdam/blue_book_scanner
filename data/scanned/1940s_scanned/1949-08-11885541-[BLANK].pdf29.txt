Incident #2 -- Manitou Springs, Colorado -- 13 July 1947

There is no astronomical ex,lanation for this incident;
the reversal of direction of flit-t and the naneuver_s executed
by the object precludes this.

The speed is not ctated with any exactness, but if it
was not too grebt, the ob.ject m.!_ht have been a balloon, or air-
craft seen under unusual conditions. Otherwise, there _ppears to
be no plausible explanation.
