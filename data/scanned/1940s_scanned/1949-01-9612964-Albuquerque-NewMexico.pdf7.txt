The image provided appears to be a black-and-white map or diagram, not a photograph. There are various lines representing roads or boundaries, and some text labels indicating places. Specifically, the labels "PITKIN," "DIDO," and "STATE HWY 22" are visible, as well as notations for "CR" along some lines which may stand for county roads. The map portion is overlaid with a grid, suggesting it may have been used for reference or navigation.

No text outside the context of the map is visible, so there is no additional document text to transcribe. If there were any surrounding text in the document not included in this image, it would not be available for OCR processing.
