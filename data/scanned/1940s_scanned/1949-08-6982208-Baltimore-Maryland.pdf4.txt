The page includes three black and white photographs on the left side. They appear to be old and show parts of an aircraft and its assembly.

Top photograph: This image seems to show the tail assembly of an aircraft with parts of a circular object referred to in the text as a "disc."

Middle photograph: This image appears to show an aircraft cockpit with parts of the same circular disc visible through the cockpit window.

Bottom photograph: This is an image of a large circular disc-like object that seems to be mounted on a tripod, with what is described as a "brake drum" part visible.

Here is the text present in the document:
