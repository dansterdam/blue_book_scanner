1. At approximately 1205 AST 9 July 1948, lst Lt. [Redacted]
and [Redacted], both of the 72nd Rc̱n Squadron (VLR) Photo,

4. The objects were estimated to be at 5,000 feet or more above
the terrain, and were thought to be moving at a speed in excess of
500 MPH. (This figure was reached in view of the fact that the objects
were out of sight in five seconds or less. The group seemed to be
immediately below the clouds. Direction of flight was from NNW to ESE,

Aircraft. Its exhaust trails were barely visible.

5. Photographs of these objects were available. The following
