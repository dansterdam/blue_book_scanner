Lewiston, Idaho
July 25, 1949

Base Intelligence Officer
Spokane Air Force Base
Spokane, Washington

Dear Sir:

This letter is to inform you of possible aircraft over Lewiston last night. It is probably useless information but after reading the Associated Press report of a Boise pilot seeing "flying objects" over southern Idaho yesterday, I decided to send you this report anyway.

I am a weather observer at the Weather Bureau Office at the Lewiston Municipal Airport. Was on duty yesterday from 1600P to 2400P. About 2310P I went outside to see if there were any clouds in the sky. The sky was clear. As I was about to go back inside I heard a faint noise. It sounded like a formation of several aircraft at high altitude west of the airport. The noise increased and decreased in volume intermittently, as if they were circling. After about five minutes of this the noise faded gradually and I returned to the office. While listening I was also looking for aircraft lights but saw none. If there were any it probably would have been easy to miss them against the background of bright stars, and as I said before, the noises seemed to come from a high altitude.

I have told nobody, except in this letter, about what I heard and do not intend to tell anybody. Also I will not tell anybody about this letter.

In case you are interested, here is my military experience: Served with the AAF from Feb. 12, 1942 to March 1, 1946. Was a Weather Forecaster, A.I.O.S. 787, T/Sgt., A.S.N.

If you have any questions about this, I will be glad to cooperate with you in any way possible.

Yours very truly,

[Signature or name has been redacted]
