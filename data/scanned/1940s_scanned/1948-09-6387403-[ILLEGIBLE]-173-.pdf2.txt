Incident #173 -- Spencer, Iowa -- 13 September 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.

It appears probable that a balloon was under observation.

[There is a partially visible word at the bottom of the page, likely part of a classification marking such as "UNCLASSIFIED," but it is not fully readable.]
