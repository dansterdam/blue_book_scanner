CONFIDENTIAL

Object appeared elliptical in shape and had a diameter of 20-30 feet. When
first seen it was at about 5,000 ft and traveling from 400 to 600 MPH. Its grey
color rendered it difficult to perceive at a distance as it blended with the
clouds. Although a jet-like noise was heard prior to the object's appearance
no audible sound was produced while it remained in view. The tail of the object
had two points on the outside area, visible as it made its two left-to-right
circles which had an approximate radius of 1/4 to 1/2 miles. Two object had
what appeared to be a cockpit canopy in the center which extended toward the
back end beneath the object. The "cockpit" did not protrude from the surface
but was clearly visible with the naked eye. The object did not revolve on its
own axis. It had no discernible landing gears nor propellers. It appeared to
have an excellent air foil (tapered from wing tip to wing tip). Mr. ____
thought that the 10-15 MPH wind velocity which caused a rustling of tree leaves
might have made it impossible for him to hear any noise connected with the object.
He also stated that he thought the object was the Navy's new "Flapjack Plane"
but altered his opinion since the object seemed to have no landing gears and no
propellers. (The Navy ship is illustrated as having both).
take one photograph of the object at its lowest point (about 2000 ft) and
another as it turned out of its second spiral and started upward.
