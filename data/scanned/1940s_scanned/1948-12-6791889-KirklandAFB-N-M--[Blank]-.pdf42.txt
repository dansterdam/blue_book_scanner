CASE #19 (cont'd)

Incident: #224 -- near Las Vegas, New Mexico -- 8 December 1948

See report on Incident #223 for detailed statement.

The present incident, if it were an isolated one, would be suggestive of a fireball,
but, in view of significant differences and the general pattern of other related incidents,
that explanation is improbable.
