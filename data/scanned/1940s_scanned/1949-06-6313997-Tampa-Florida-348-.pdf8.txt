SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significant facts as one-sentence paragraphs. Use Addendum if necessary for longer reports. List individuals or gear in reports at AP Form 112—Part III.)

1. 19:45 hours 5 June 1949 at Tampa, Fla an unidentified object traveling from S. 30th to N. 80th at a very high rate of speed was observed by Aircrew personnel of the 307th Bm Gp. This object was emitting smoke and/or vapor trail which indicated its flight path was horizontal but very erratic in direction. It made a large “E” turn on course and then faded from view. The trail was visible for about 30 minutes.

2. It is the opinion of this officer that this object was not a meteor due to its erratic course.

3. All of the information contained in this report is endorsed by the ten (10) eyewitnesses interviewed. All ten (10) witnesses are Aircrew members of the 307th Bm Gp.

4. The significance of this report is unknown.
