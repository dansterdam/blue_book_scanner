Incident #204 -- Rabaul -- 3 November 1953

It seems entirely probable that the object sighted in this 
incident was the comet I43L, which had been discovered two days
earlier in Australia. The comet was suitably placed for observation
near the equator and in the Southern Hemisphere. The time of obser-
vation also agrees closely with the time of visibility. There is no
single statement in this limited report that contradicts this comet
hypothesis. If the observer had given the usual bearing of the ob-
ject, these would have eliminated the matter.
