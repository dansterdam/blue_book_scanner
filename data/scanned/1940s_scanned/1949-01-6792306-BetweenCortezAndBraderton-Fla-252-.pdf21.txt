Relative to Radar Sightings

    Rc radars now operating on ground

    a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size
       of target;

    b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180Â°), etc.,
       and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable,
       how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed:

    c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several
       targets upon approach:

    d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent with
       size of object; faint; fading; pulsating at regular rate:

    e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, where object was sighted

    a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits:

    b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.:

                   GENERAL

1. Plot-type sequences of local weather conditions:

2. Winds aloft report:
