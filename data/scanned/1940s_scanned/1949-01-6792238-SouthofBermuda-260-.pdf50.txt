(Kindley AFB, Bermuda)

373D WEA 330.05                                                         FEB 9 1949

SUBJECT: Semi-Monthly Intelligence Report

TO: Commanding Officer
     2108th Air Weather Group
     Westover Air Force Base
     Westover Field, Mass.

1. In compliance with 308th Reconnaissance Group (Weather) letter,
   subject: "Semi-Monthly Intelligence Summary," File 308th WEA 330.05,
   dated 29 July 1947, the following report is submitted for the period
   ending 31 January 1949.

2. On 2h January 1949 crew of B-29 aircraft, number 44-87750, re-
   turning from a special search mission for BOAC Tudor IV, Star Aerial,
   observed the following described atmospheric phenomena:

   a. At 2100Z, 21 January, from position 29°30'N 62°00'W an 
      unusual course of 050° at altitude 19,500 ft. Captain [REDACTED], 
      Aircraft Commander, first saw a red glow off the left wing which at first
      resembled the moon rising and which the crew later believed to be a burn-
      ing ship.

   b. At 02052Z the pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the 
      light, 350° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so
      close to the red light's object that a sharp bank was executed in order to
      avoid flying into the red light mass.

   c. On approaching the redlight it was observed as a dark red 
      glow, 1 to 1½ miles wide, based on the water, and resembling burning 
      oil with a phosphorescent red light rising to 2,500 to 3,000 ft. alti-
      tude. Also from headings of 350° and 160° two columns of white light,
      bore a 15° approx., resembling search light beams and extending upward
      through elliptical 3/5 of a the red light mass. The beams were at a
      slight angle toward each other. Capt. [REDACTED] estimates that if the
      white light beams had extended above the red light mass to an altitude
      of 10,000 ft. they would have intersected. It was also observed that
      the red light mass gave off enough light to illuminate the surface of
      the water and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (see
      inclosure #5).
