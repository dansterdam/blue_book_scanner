6. Mrs. Myrtis DICKENS, RD #5, Trumansburg, New York was interviewed and
stated that on 28 December 1949 she was at her home all day and did not see the
objects described by Mrs. [REDACTED] and her children, nor did she hear any airplanes
flying overhead that day. She further states that later that evening, Mrs. [REDACTED]
called her and asked whether or not she had seen the objects which were seen near
her home. She stated that she did not know of anyone in that vicinity who had seen
the objects except Mrs. [REDACTED] and her children.

7. Mrs. [REDACTED] Trumansburg, stated upon interview, that
on 28 December 1949 she was at home doing her housework and did not see the objects
described by Mrs. [REDACTED] although she had read about it in the newspaper. It had
been determined by Mrs. [REDACTED] that the object was the closest to the
spot in the road where they stopped to observe the objects in the sky. Mrs. [REDACTED]
stated that she did not see or hear anything unusual and did not know anything
about it until she read about it in the newspaper.

8. Mr. [REDACTED] whose farm borders the strip of woods over which Mrs.
[REDACTED] saw the objects flying, stated that on 28 December 1949 he was at home and
had been out on the farm with his tractor and had been out in the car also but that
he had not seen the objects described by Mrs. [REDACTED]. He stated that he was well
acquainted with Mrs. [REDACTED] and remembered her calling him on the phone the evening
after she had observed the flying objects, to inquire whether he had seen these
objects in the sky.

9. This Agent interviewed Mrs. [REDACTED] school teacher, Trumansburg,
New York and she stated that she was at home on 28 December 1949 as this was during
the Christmas vacation period. She stated that she had been going in and out of
the house a great deal that afternoon as she was helping her mother and father to
pack their trailer prior to their leaving for Florida. She stated that she did
not see any objects in the sky nor did she hear any airplanes. She stated further
that since the Christmas vacation she had talked to a great number of her students
and fellow teachers but no one had seen the objects described by Mrs. [REDACTED]. Most
of the students and teachers live in the vicinity of the location where Mrs. [REDACTED]
and her children saw the objects in the sky.

the Perry City section and who had seen the objects in the sky. A check of the

the weather that day. He added that to the best of his knowledge, 28 December 1949
was a warm, clear December day with no snow and excellent visibility.
