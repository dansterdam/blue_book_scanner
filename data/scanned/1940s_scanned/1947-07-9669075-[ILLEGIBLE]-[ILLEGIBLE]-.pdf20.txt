Incident #757 — between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland — 20 July 1947

This incident and #765, which occurred in the same vicinity just three days apart, do not fit into the usual description pattern. In both cases, information about is poor, and in both cases the meteoric hypothesis cannot be completely ruled out, yet the objects could have been rockets or even freak natural streamers or brush discharge from ionized dust clouds. In any event, it seems unlikely, although it is not impossible, that the objects seen in this incident were meteors. The even spacing of the flashes argues strongly against the meteoric hypothesis.
