The image does not contain a photograph, but instead presents a heavily deteriorated or low-quality scan of a document. The visible text and markings, although not entirely clear, seem to indicate a classification status and some administrative information. Below is the text present in the document to the best of my understanding:

UNC LASSIFIED
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS
DOD DIR 5200.10
