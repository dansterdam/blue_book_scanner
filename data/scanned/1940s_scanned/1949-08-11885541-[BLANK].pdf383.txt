Incident #82 - over Columbus, Ohio - 7 January 1948

The evidence given in this incident fits the hypothesis that the object observed was the planet Venus, and, considered with Incidents #50, 33, and 49, it is incredible that it could have been anything else.

See report on #33 for detailed discussion of sightings of 7 January 1948.
