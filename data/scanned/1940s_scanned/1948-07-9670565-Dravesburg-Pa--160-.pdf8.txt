To whom it may concern:

Dear Sirs:

On the fourth of July (July 4, 1948) my wife and I were sitting on a bench on our lawn and we were watching the stars, planes, etc. At 11:15 P. M., O. S. T., we saw something very strange.

We thought we saw a star moving. There was a light in the sky the same color and size of a star and It was moving. We decided it was a plane but it made no noise. We soon changed our minds because this "thing" moved across the sky then changed its course a bit and went straight and stopped again for about 5 seconds, changed its course a bit and went straight for awhile and stopped again this time for at least 15 seconds then it went across the sky a little ways and disappeared completely. When this thing stopped in the sky, if you didn't know where it was at you would not tell it from a star as the resemblance was identical to a star.

After reding in the paper on July 3, 1948 about two women seeing "flying saucers" in the daylight July 3, I believe I saw a "flying saucer" or something in the night July 4, because I know it was no star or an airplane because neither can travel and stop in the air like this "thing" did. I live above 2-1/2 miles from these women who saw the "discs" in the daylight.

Has the War Department any comments on these strange "discs"? They are now reported in the heart of the steal industry.

Yours
