Incident #23 – Boise, Idaho – 30 June 1947

It seems exceedingly probable that the object observed
in this incident was a sunlit lenticularis cloud effect. The altitude
of the sun was 36°, azimuth 230°. At that time of the afternoon,
the sun's position was such that it could easily have illuminated
a background cloud which was perhaps almost entirely covered by a
foreground cloud. (Local weather reports indicate an entirely
clear sky, with the report of the incident itself states that the
object "seemed to be clinging to a high cloud.") This investigator
himself has observed such effects.
