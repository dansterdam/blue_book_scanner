Incident #170 -- Adapazari, Turkey -- c. 5 May 1948

It is extremely unlikely that there is any astronomical explanation for this incident. The information given is very limited, but it points definitely to the probability that the object or objects sighted were rockets. The report indicates that one rocket-like object was recovered.
