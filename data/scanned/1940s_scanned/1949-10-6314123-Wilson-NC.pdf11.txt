```
Hotel ROOSEVELT
AN ALBERT PICK HOTEL PITTSBURGH 22, PA.
Nov. 27, 1950

General Vandenberg
Washington D.C.

Dear Sir;

I'm taking time out while on-route around
on a diversion short to write you concerning an
odd subject.

In Oct. 1949 I asked you to investigate an
object in that traveled over Cincinnati.
You sent a (Capt. James) of Army Stuart I still
Dist at C.S.I. to investigate. Old gent he was very
interested - seemed to be. We tried to show him
said object personally but could never contact him
at the right time. After a few weeks he told us not
to bother him further. This object perhaps he does
desired it to be a secret A.S. project.

Note: The text in parentheses "(Capt. James)" may represent an uncertainty about the handwriting and is my best approximation based on the visual evidence provided.
