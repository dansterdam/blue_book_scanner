The image appears to be a photocopy of an old report page with two hand-drawn illustrations at the top. These are simple line drawings that appear to depict two aerial objects, one looks like a classic "flying saucer" shape, and the other is less distinct. There are arrows and notations next to these illustrations. Now, as requested, I will replicate the text from the document:

---
(4)     o    In approximately 2 minutes objects had disappeared

          o     Objects began moving in a NNE direction and rapidly accelerating
                   and climbing.

(3)     o     When first seen objects were in a semi-stationary position.

(2)     o     When first seen objects were in a semi-stationary position.

(1)     o     First one object was sighted, next, another one appeared.
