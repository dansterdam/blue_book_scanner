it is a fair guess, from the dust cloud, that the
item involved was instinctively friable and crumbly, and
it did not sift through the hands and fingers—a notably small sand.
Else its components would be larger than wheat or peanuts.
A man with an astronomical telescope, knowingly located in
the right place, might be able to find with his sun detecting apparatus,
something that crashed only a few miles away within a few
hours—probably are lost forever.

A photograph of the cloud was taken by an amateur
in Central Utah and sent to A.P. I have a copy of the picture
onaria.

It is barely possible that I will make a trip soon
out to the location. I know of no one who has retrieved
a meteor that they have actually seen descending while they
were logically equipped. All of this is unprecedented, and
almost fantastic, but I would like to have a piece less loosely
held by the hands on things scientific and technical, and it would be
appropriate for me to interfere in this search with a
meteor. I would be standing in the sun for maybe a couple
of hours. (Perhaps that is his reason for his reluctance.)
I have been on the other side of the fence; if you do a
railroad investigation work on a threadbare, you can't hide
the evidence or cling to it and hide the tangible results away
for when they materialize.

Yours sincerely,
