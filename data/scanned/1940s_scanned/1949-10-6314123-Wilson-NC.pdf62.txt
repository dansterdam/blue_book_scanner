FLYING DISCS ARE CLAIMED SIGHTED
IN DOWNS VICINITY

DOWNS - Two Downs men, and , have joined the ranks
of those who claim to have seen flying
discs.
The men were working in a field at
the Verhage farm when they heard a B-29
pass overhead. The big bomber was head-
ing almost due west at a height Verhage
and Latham estimate at 6000 to 7000 feet.
    They say that as they watched the
plane a huge bright disc suddenly appeared,
sailing from southwest to northwest and
directly in the path of the plane but about
500 feet below it.
    Verhage and Latham say the speed of the
shining disc was terrific. They think it was
15 to 20 feet in circumference and resembled,
as much as anything else, a huge piece of
bright aluminum.
