SOME CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE INTERPRETATION OF REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

By

The writer has studied summary abstracts and comments pertaining to unidentified flying objects, which were forwarded by Air Force Intelligence. These summaries are divided into three main parts; The first part is a short summary of the reports; the second part consists of a general survey of various possibilities of accounting for the reports; the third part contains certain recommendations for future action.

PART I SHORT SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS.

The reports can be grouped as follows:

Group 1. The most numerous reports indicate the daytime observation of metallic disk-like objects, roughly in diameter ten times their thickness. There is some suggestion that the cross section is asymmetrical and rather like a turtle shell. Reports agree that these objects are capable of high acceleration and velocity; they often are sighted in groups, sometimes in formation. Somethings they flutter.

Group 2. The second group consists of reports of lights observed at night. These are also capable of high speed and acceleration. They are less commonly seen in groups. They usually appear to be sharply defined luminous objects.

Group 3. The third group consists of reports of various kinds of rockets, in general appearing somewhat like V-2 rockets.

Group 4. The fourth group contains reports of various devices which, in the writer's opinion, are sounding balloons of unusual shape such as are made by the General Mills Company to Navy Contract.
