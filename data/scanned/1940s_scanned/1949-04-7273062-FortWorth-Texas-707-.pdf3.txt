The photograph shows a view of the sky with clouds and some silhouetted objects such as the roof of a house and trees. There are power lines visible in the upper part of the image. A white label with text overlaying the photo reads "REPORTED HEADING 15° TO 20°→". There is writing scribbled in black ink on the top and bottom margins of the photo, but it is mostly illegible due to redactions and the quality of the image.

Due to the condition and quality of the document, accurate OCR text output is challenging. However, I will provide the discernible text from the document:

REPORTED HEADING
15° TO 20°→
