Case File #24-26
DO #20, McChord AFB

15. ***** appeared to this agent to be of above average intelligence. As noted above, there was no indication, through law enforcement agencies, that he had ever been involved in any type of civil or criminal court action. He appeared to be extremely concerned and cautious as to whom he discussed the incident, and required complete identification of the interrogator. He stated that he did not use any type of dope and that he did not drink excessively, which points were verified by his employer, the Editor in Chief of the Lewiston Tribune, who stated that, although he had only known ***** for a short period of time, he appeared to be of above average intelligence and was considered a trustworthy and honorable employee. Photographs of ***** were taken and are attached as Exhibits "D", "E", and "F".
