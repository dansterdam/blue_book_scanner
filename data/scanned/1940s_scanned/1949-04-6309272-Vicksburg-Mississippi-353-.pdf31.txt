- Satellite measurements of carbon monoxide and other gases reveal industrial processes, agricultural burning, forest fires and other sources of air pollution. Most of the time, levels of these gases are within natural variability. Sometimes they can lead to an increase in the amount of ozone near the surface of the Earth, which can cause health problems for people with respiratory develops. At other times, these gases can influence climate by changing the amount of heat that escapes from the Earth to space. Understanding these gases can help scientists to predict changes in climate and to develop strategies for mitigating their effects.

- Earthquake preparation is key to reducing losses from these natural disasters. In earthquake-prone areas, strict building codes can help to ensure that homes and other structures will withstand shaking from earthquakes. Early warning systems can give people a few seconds to a few minutes of warning before the shaking starts, allowing them to move to a safer location or to drop, cover and hold on. Scientists also study past earthquakes to understand where future ones may occur and how large they might be.

- VOLCANOES offer a window into the processes that are happening deep inside the Earth. Monitoring these mountains can provide early warning of an eruption, giving people in the nearby areas time to evacuate. The observations also help scientists to understand the chemistry of the Earth's interior and to learn more about the history of our planet. Some volcanic gases can affect the climate, so understanding volcanoes also has implications for climate science.
