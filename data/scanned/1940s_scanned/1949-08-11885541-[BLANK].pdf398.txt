Incident #40 — Phoenix, Arizona — 7 July 1947

No astronomical explanation seems possible for the unusual
object cited in this incident.

This case is especially important because of the photographic
evidences and because of the similarity of these photographs to the
drawings by Kenneth Arnold (Incident #17). The two incidents are sepa-
rated by slightly more than two weeks, and, of course, they occurred
in different localities. It is, however, perhaps more than coincidence
that these two best-attested, entirely independent cases should agree
so closely concerning the shape of the object and its maneuverability.

The present Investigator would like to suggest that this in-
cident, #40, being one of the most crucial in the history of these
objects, be reopened for investigation. The actual camera used by Mr.
Rhodes should be examined, and the original negatives preserved. Since,
from the size of the image on the photograph, we can have an accurate
estimate of the angle subtended by the object, this, in connection with
what appears to be a fairly reliable estimate of the distance, can give
us an estimate of the forces and accelerations involved in the tra-
jectory described by Mr. Rhodes. (It is unfortunate that a competent
investigator was not dispatched at once to “reenact the crime” with
Mr. Rhodes and to obtain sketches of the trajectory, etc., before de-
tails faded from his memory.) It would be important to know at what
