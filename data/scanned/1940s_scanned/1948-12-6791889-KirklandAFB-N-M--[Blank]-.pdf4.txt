        2. The Best Path of the Only Green Fireball So Far Observed at Two
Separate Stations. Among the numerous observations so far made, there is
only one pair of corresponding observations, i.e., those made simultaneously
by different groups of observers at widely separated stations. The only
such observations are those mentioned by this writer on the reverse -
that of 79 Army engineers near Sandia Peak (Central, New Mexico - see report
on incident of 1948, December 12, 9h 2m plus or minus 30s), and a second
pair of observers station within the Los Alamos reservation. By graphic
reduction of the simultaneously made observations, the following facts have
been determined: The green fireball of December 12, 9h 2m plus or minus
30" appeared very near a point with the geodetic latitude 35° 50', longi-
tude 106° 39' and disappeared near a point with the coordinates latitude
