these quantities were 750 340 90 and 430. According to the azimuth to the sound heard at 2050 was 990 430, and the elevation 430 30; according to 430, these quantities were 1010 450 and 450 30.

At Station 590 a statement was obtained from AEBB Inspector 430. also
430 (his companion on the night of December 50). Inspector 430 was not available for interrogation on January 5). According to Inspector 430, none of the sounds observed at Station 450 at 2010, 2050 and 2050 were heard at Station 390, but some 10 to 15 minutes after the boggy warning at 2050, both he and Patton heard what first sounded like the rumbling of heavy wagons on a roadway and what later sounded like a whistling noise made by some airplanes while in flight. The duration of the sound as determined by a stop-watch measurement of main actions in going outside, returning to the communications set, and again going outside, was 45 seconds. However, after reports that he listened to the sound probably for a minute or more after he went outdoors the second time; and according to 430, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2100-2105 was 400 30' and the elevation 450 15'.

At Station 330 statements were obtained from AECB Inspectors 430 and 430
430 on December 30, he heard a noise in the sky which he believed to be the motor noise of a 140 h.p. Cub. The duration of his 2100 hrs observation of this noise was estimated at about 5 minutes; about 2010 he made a second observation of the same noise, the duration this time being only about 2-3 minutes. (So faint was the impression that the observed noise originated in an airplane flying over the prohibited area that a complete blackout was in effect both during the first observation and the second in the hope that actual lights on the planes would be observable. However, no visual contact whatsoever was established with the source of the noise.) At 2050 a third observation of the same noise was made and no correction was possible that an airplane was responsible that on this occasion a boggy warning was transmitted to all stations. It is the understanding of both 430 and 430 that information transmitted by them to headquarters was responsible for issuance of the boggy warning. The duration of the third sound was estimated to have been approximately 2-3 minutes. Inspector 430 confirmed all of the statements made by Inspector 430 as to the qualification. That the first interpretation of the noise heard at 2010 was that it came from a light tank cruising on the high road coming into Station 350 from the north. The incongruity of confusing the noises of the heavier (225 h.p.) motor of a tank and the lighter (75-100 h.p.) motor of a
Camp type plane had been the subject of discussions between Inspectors 430 and 430, and they had resolved the issue by noting that even the light motor of a Cub would be laboring heavily in the high altitude carrying the bomb load. December 10 is believed to have taken place. According to Inspector 430, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2010 was 230 20'
and the elevation 230 15'; at 2050 a azimuth of the sound heard at 2050 was 330 30' and the elevation 220 50', and no azimuth or elevation was 2050 was 330 40' and the elevation 220 50'. Since Inspectors 430 and 330 performance in this type of strain, it is believed that 430 unusually keen 430 discrimination. Since it would not have been feasible to 430 bomb by 430, 430 would be deployed under 430 The sound 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 430 ALLOWED DATA GAP
