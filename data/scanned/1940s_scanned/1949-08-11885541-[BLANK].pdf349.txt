Incident No. 236 â€“ 4 Jan. 1949, 11400 hours, Hickam Field, Territory of Hawaii.
An air force pilot saw an object which appeared to be a large round piece of flat cardboard the size of a T-6. It was white underneath and dark on top. It approached from 25 mile distance at 3000 ft and circled the area at 65. The object seemed to "blink" a "whitish reflection" regularly. It departed climbing at 250 angle.

ATIC Opinion: The evidence does not lead to an explanation. It should be noted, however, that if the object were actually the size of a T-6 at 3000 feet, a greater amount of detail should have been observed.
