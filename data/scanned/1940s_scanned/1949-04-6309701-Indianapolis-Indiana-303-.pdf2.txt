The image contains a photograph at the bottom. It appears to be a black and white image of the sky with some faint marks or anomalies. The lighting and quality of the image are poor, making it difficult to discern any clear details. There are two circular or disk-shaped objects in the sky, though due to the image quality, it is hard to make out any specific features of the objects.
