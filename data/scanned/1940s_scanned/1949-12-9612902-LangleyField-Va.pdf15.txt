SUMMARY (ENTER CONCISE SUMMARY OF REPORT. GIVE SIGNIFICANCE IN FINAL ONE-
SEN LINE OR PARAGRAPH. LIST INCLUSUS AT LOWER LEFT. BEGIN TEXT OF
REPORT ON AN/ FORM 112-PART III.)
Technical Sergeant _______ observed an unidentified flying object at
120 hours, 30 December 1949 near Langley Air Force Base, Va.
The white, vertical, cone-shaped object appeared to be eight feet in diameter
at the base by twenty (20) feet in height. It was estimated to be at 5,000 feet
altitude 10,000 feet from the observer and moving slowly in a south-easterly direc-
tion. The base of the cone remained steady and the top slowly oscillated.

The report parallels press releases concerning unidentified flying objects re-
cently observed over the Carolinas and, in one case, identified in the Charleston
Observer newspaper by airport officials as being a mass of ice crystals formed in
the wake of an Air Force B-36 flying at 40,000 feet altitude.
