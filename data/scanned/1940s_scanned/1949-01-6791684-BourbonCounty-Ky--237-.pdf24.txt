15 January 1949, he was proceeding in his automobile in a southwesterly direc-
tion, towards Paris, Ky., accompanied by his wife, ________, and his
niece, ____. __________, ___________, street, Lexington, Ky. Mrs. ______
called his attention to the sunlight reflection on the clouds in the western
sky, and as he gazed in the sky, his attention was attracted by a walnut
sized ob;ect [sic] emerging from behind a cloud. Sight of this object and sub-
sequent observation revealed that it was in actual size larger than a manu-
factured man's wrist watch. Mr. _______ stated that he then and his niece,
observed through the side glass of the automobile, four exposures of the object of
light moving across the sky. Mrs. _______ insists that the course of the object
actually was not from southeast to northwest, and that object seemed to be
ginned and action through some object or film outward springing round cross its
point of vision at a great distance from the observer. The fourth and last ob-
sposure of the "tube of light" actually counted, as published in the Nicholas
