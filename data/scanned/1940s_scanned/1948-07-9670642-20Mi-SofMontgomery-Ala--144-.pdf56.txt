GADSDEN – WHITTED
INCIDENT
24 July 1948

At 2:45 in the morning, the pilot and co-pilot of an Eastern Airlines DC-3, flying at 5,000 feet between Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama, sighted a dull red exhaust some 700 feet ahead, a little above and to the right of the airliner.
Captain [REDACTED] the pilot, immediately turned to his co-pilot, [REDACTED], and remarked: "Look, here comes a new Army jet job". The object approached in a slight dive, dislocated a little to the left and passed the plane on the right, almost level and parallel to flight path, at a distance of approximately one-half mile. After passing, it pulled up sharply and disappeared into a cloud.

The object appeared to be a wingless aircraft, 100 ft. long, cigar-shaped and about twice the diameter of a B-29. It had no fins or protruding surfaces. [REDACTED] thought it had a "snout" similar to a radar pole on the front and he had the impression there was a cabin with windows above – much like a pilot compartment – except that it appeared brighter. The illumination inside the body itself approximated the brilliance of a magnesium flare. He saw no occupants nor did Whitted. Visible from the side only, was an intense, fairly dark, blue glow running the entire length of the object beneath the fuselage.

The glow reminded [REDACTED] of a blue fluorescent factory light. The exhaust was described as a red-glowing flame, the lighter color (orange) [REDACTED] prominent, about the oval orifice. Throughout the time [REDACTED]
