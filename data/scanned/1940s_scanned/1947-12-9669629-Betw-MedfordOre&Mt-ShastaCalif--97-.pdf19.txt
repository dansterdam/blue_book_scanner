There are no photographs present on this page. The page seems to be a heavily faded or low-quality scan of a document, making the text difficult to decipher. However, I'll attempt to produce a text output as an OCR. Here's what can be faintly discerned:

"was metallic circular disc-shaped aircraft of approximately 200 Ft.
in diameter... Traveling at a rate of speed of approximately 700 MPH, to
3000 Ft was observing 1 object emitting a reddish glow every few seconds.
350 MPH and an altitude of 10,000 feet. Coming up to cone at top. Not more
than one minute. This aircraft was estimated to weigh 20 tons..."

The text is fragmentary and difficult to read, and this transcription may not be precise due to the low quality of the scan.

Note: This transcription is based on the visible elements in the provided document which are partially legible, but the accuracy of the transcription cannot be guaranteed due to the poor quality of the image.
