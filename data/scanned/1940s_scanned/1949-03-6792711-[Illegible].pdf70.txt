The image provided appears to be a scanned page with a photograph on the right half. The photograph seems to depict a small, dark object in the sky. Due to the quality of the image, details are not clear, but the object appears somewhat elongated or oval-shaped and is seen in contrast against a lighter background that seems to be the sky.

The text on the page reads:
