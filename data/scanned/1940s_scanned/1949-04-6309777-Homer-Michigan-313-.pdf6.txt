HOWELL, Mich.â€”William Sackett and Warren Gibson, employees of the Pet Milk Co., reported they sighted six flying discs over Howell about 9:15 p.m. Thursday.

They said they pursued them in an automobile for about five miles on U.S-16 before they lost sight of the low flying objects.

The men said the discs appeared to be about 10 inches in diameter, moving in wide circles, following a course which closely paralleled the highway.
