Incident #19 -- Dayton, Ohio -- 28 October 1947

Information given here is insufficient to exclude posi-
tively the possibility that the objects observed were a close pair 
of fireballs, but this seems extremely unlikely since the length 
of time in sight is not stated nor the speed estimated, it is impos-
sible to draw any definite conclusions. Assuming these to be appro-
priate, if one were to stretch the description to its very limits and
make allowances for the errors of an untrained observer, one could say
that the "cigar-like shape" might have been an illusion caused by rapid
motion and that the bright sunlight might have made both the objects
and the trails nearly invisible.

This investigator does not prefer that interpretation, and it
should be resorted to only if all other possible explanations fail.
In short, while it is not out of the realm of possibility that the ob-
jects seen were an unusual double fireball, it is most unlikely.
