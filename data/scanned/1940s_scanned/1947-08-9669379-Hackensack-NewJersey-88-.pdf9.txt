b. The second and third articles are bakelite coil forms wrapped with ordinary thin enamel copper wire. These coils indicate that they were skillfully made at one time but were crudely rewrapped by one not familiar with the act of winding a coil. These coils also have no connection with any AMC project.

c. The fourth article is a metallic box which is the remains of an electrostatic filter condenser made by the Polymerics Manufacturing Co. of New York, N.Y. This article also has no connection with any AMC project.

d. The fifth article is the remains of a metallic magnetic ring that could not be identified as any part of any device used at this Command.

4. This information and attached photograph may be transmitted to the FBI to inform various agencies throughout the United States as to what action they deem necessary to take in the event of other similar specimens brought to their attention.
