Incidents 942 -- Los Alamos, New Mexico -- 6 January 1949

The information offered concerning this incident is 
brief, and there was only one observer. According to the descrip-
tion, a brilliant point light-approach it was seen low on the
horizon for about two seconds, enough was "lit up" showing that
that of a meteor. In view of this survey (study), no definite
conclusion can be drawn.

It was not for the fact that this incident appears to
belong in the fall of new-explode "green fireballs," the ob-
jects could be considered to have been a slow meteor, even though the
time of night or day shift does not favor that hypothesis.
It is much more probable, however, that this incident falls into
the pattern of those dealt with in detail in the OJ report on inci-
dent #926. See that report for further discussion.
