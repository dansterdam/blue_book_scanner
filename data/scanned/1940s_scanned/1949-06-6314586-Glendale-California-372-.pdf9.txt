SUBJECT


A week or so ago a Lockheed employee called ███████ to de-
scribe to him his observations of two flying discs over the San 
Fernando Valley, which he swears he saw June 17th of this year.

As you know, I have been very interested in the probability of
such things existing, and my discussions with certain people
in the Air Force, as well as late newspaper reports indicate there
is something to flying discs.

This individual, Mr. ███████, ███████ Avenue,
Los Angeles 26, California, was very anxious that no publicity be 
given his remarks. ███████ knows of my interest in flying discs and 
went down to see Mr. ███████ who was formerly an animator at one 
of the studios. He prepared the enclosed sketch.

I wonder if you would check around at Wright Field and see whether
the Air Force is interested in checking up on reports of this
nature. This man is definitely not a crack-pot, and he has offered 
to anime exactly what he saw if he is given the facilities by 
Lockheed. He is not asking anything for the job; and I don't know
quite what to do about it.

How about seeing if AMC wants to have one of their local repre-
sentatives interview Whitton.
