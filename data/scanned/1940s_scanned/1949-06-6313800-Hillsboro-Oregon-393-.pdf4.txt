SYNOPSIS

Investigation initiated by the Acting District Commander after being
advised of an unknown object, which was sighted over the Hillsboro
Airport, Hillsboro, Oregon. Investigation revealed that the object
was sighted on 4 June 1949, at 1105 hours (PST) by Mr.
*****, Portland 1, Oregon; and Mr.
***** Cornell Road, Portland 1, Oregon, while sitting on a hilltop about
seven miles West of the Hillsboro Airport. Position of observers at
time of sighting was 45° 30' 54" North Latitude and 122° 48' 02" West Longitude. According to the observers, this object appeared to
be metallic in color, rather large and round in shape, and comparable
to the size of an object 3/8" in diameter held at arm's length. It
appeared to wobble slightly, but remained in a fixed position. There
was no sound nor exhaust trail associated with the object. After remaining in view for approximately three minutes, it then appeared to move
in a Southwesterly direction at a very rapid rate of speed.
