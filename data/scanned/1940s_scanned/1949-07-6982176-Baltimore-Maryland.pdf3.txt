The image shows a pencil or charcoal sketch, not a photograph. The sketch depicts a nighttime scene with buildings and a street. In the upper left corner, there are two circular insets that represent a close-up view of an object in the sky. 

The top circular inset has an angular geometric shape, labeled "SEEN CLOSE." The bottom circular inset seems to provide a side view, titled "SIDE VIEW," highlighting the object's angle as compared to the horizon, shown with a reference line and angle indicator.

There is no text within the body of the image itself, other than labels for the circular insets. However, in the bottom right corner, there is handwritten text, which appears to be "2-4-7/4 EXHIBIT 'A'".
