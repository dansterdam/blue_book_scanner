The Base Intelligence Officer was notified at approx 15:00 hours, 29 September 1949 that a number of "Unconventional Aircraft" had been sighted six (6) miles west of Enid, Oklahoma. A B-25 type aircraft was immediately dispatched to the area. The A-25 crew was Lt. [REDACTED], Flying Safety Officer and Capt. [REDACTED], Nichols' Base Intelligence Officer. The area was searched carefully with negative results. A large number of seagulls were sighted from altitudes of 1,000 to 4,000 ft. The seagulls were first sighted, because of sun's ray reflecting from their bodies as they wheeled and turned.

During the Interrogation, the observers attention was called to the seagulls flying in the area. She expressed surprise upon learning that the birds flew as high as 4,000 ft. Using her cheap binoculars, the Interrogator found that it could be very easy to mistake the seagulls for "Unconventional Aircraft".
