An Incident Reported In Cincinnati
Summary

A letter dated 19 June 1950 was received from a 
Mr.__________ reporting a flying contraption
which, according to his letter, was found in his back
yard. Photographs enclosed indicated the incident was
a hoax. However, since it could not be explained,
based on the evidence available, the matter was refer-
red to OSI.

Upon checking, it was found the originator was no
longer in Cincinnati, After a search half around the
country it was finally determined that the object re-
ported was built of scrap materials and reported as a
joke.
