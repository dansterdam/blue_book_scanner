The image you've provided appears to be a map, not a photograph. Therefore, I can describe the map but not provide any details about photographs, as there are none present.

As for acting as an OCR to produce the output of the text found in the document, here it is:

Compiled and printed at Washington, D.C. by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey
under authority of the Secretary of Commerce
EASE: Edition of September 1947

(It should be noted that due to the low resolution and quality of the image, there could be additional text that is not clearly legible or visible in the provided image. The names of the places marked on the map are too small and blurred to be accurately transcribed.)
