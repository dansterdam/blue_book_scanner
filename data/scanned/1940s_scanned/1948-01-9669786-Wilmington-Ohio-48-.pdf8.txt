Ltr, subj: Report of Unusual Circumstance (13 Jan 48) cont'd

At first it was very white and did not appear to be moving though when it flashed on and off it appeared as in fast descent. With the naked eye I could at no time make out any shape other than the lights being oval shaped as though looking directly at a large spot light.

4. This object was too large and too sharp a light to be a reflection from the ground. It was not a heavenly body of any type in that the sky was solid overcast in the Lockbourne area and the object's movement outstrips such a thought. I heard no noise in connection with this object. I estimate at the first observation that it was 4-5 miles Southwest of the Base. At the second appearance it was 6-7 miles West and moved Easterly in a hovering manner but moving away. The winds at this time were West Southwest averaging 6 miles per hour.
