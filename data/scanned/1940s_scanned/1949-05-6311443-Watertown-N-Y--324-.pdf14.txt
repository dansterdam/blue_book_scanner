NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
The writer also interviewed Mrs. [REDACTED] of 
Route 
2, Watertown, New York, a housewife living on a farm, concerning her alleged ob-
servation of an object seen while driving, alone; a rural area near Watertown, New 
York. The geographic location of the point of observation is the Lawrence River 
area, (263), Longitude 75 degrees 1st; Latitude 44 degrees. Upon being interviewed 
by the writer, Mrs. [REDACTED] stated that while driving along a rural area near 
Watertown, New York on 11 May 1949, she observed an object soaring through the sky.
She stated that at first she thought she was "seeing things" so she immediately 
called the attention of the other passengers, [REDACTED] who said [REDACTED]
[REDACTED] her daughter, [REDACTED] the object. After alerting [REDACTED] from the 
vehicle, [REDACTED] looked further that she observed an object in the air 
resembling an automobile hub cap at a distance, and upon closer scrutiny it seemed
to be a silver ball, similar to an artificial "moon". She stated that the object 
seemed to appear over a nearby hill about one-half mile away to the southeast, was 
visible at it moved slowly for her for fifteen minutes, gaining altitude for two 
three minutes, then leveling off, leaving a forty foot gray smoke trail which 
gradually diminished. She said that as the object moved from southeast to north-
east the smoke gradually disappeared and the object seemed to dissolve gradually.
She continued that the visibility that day was excellent as there were no clouds 
present to obstruct the view but, therefore she could see the object was not 
illuminated by its own source but seemed to reflect the rays of the sun, much 
like the fuselage of a conventional aircraft. The writer made checks at the 
Police Department and Sheriff's Office, Watertown, New York and they proved nega-
tive. It was disclosed to this writer that Mrs. [REDACTED] is between sixty and 
sixty-five years of age and he found that she lives in a poor locality and does 
not seem to be very well educated. The writer asked this observer about her 
vision in order to determine its accuracy and she stated that she is far-sighted 
and wears glasses but that her vision was not obstructed in any way at the time 
of the observation.
