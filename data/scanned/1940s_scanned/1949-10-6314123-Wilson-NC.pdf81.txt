The image appears to contain clippings from a newspaper. Unfortunately, the text in these clippings is not clear enough to read, and it's not possible for me to perform OCR on it due to the poor quality of the image. Here's the legible text:

Top clipping:
```
Omaha World Herald
18 Oct 49
UNCLASSIFIED
```

Bottom clipping:
```
Omaha World Herald
19 Oct 49
```

At the bottom of the page, there are markings related to the classification status of the document:
```

DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
