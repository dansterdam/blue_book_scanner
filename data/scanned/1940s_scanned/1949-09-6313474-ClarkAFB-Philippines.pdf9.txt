The document is not very clear, but here is the text as best as I can discern:

The rest of the document below the transmittal header is extremely faded and blurry, making it impossible to read the remaining content accurately. The document appears to be a standard form used for transmitting information, likely within a military or government agency context. The references to "CLASSIFICATION" and "ENCLOSURES" suggest it relates to the handling of classified documents or information. The form number and replacement note imply it is from a specific set of documentation protocols (ATSC FORM NO. 70-105B replacing FORM NO. 10-354). Given the poor quality of the image, it's not feasible to provide more details.
