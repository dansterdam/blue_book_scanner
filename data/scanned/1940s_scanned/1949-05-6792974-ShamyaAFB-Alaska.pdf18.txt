Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
      1st Sighting
"Altitude b-29 2500 feet indicated on pressure altimeter. Light approximately 100 feet below. Approximately heading of B-29 45 degrees true.
Approximate apparent heading of light 245 degrees true. Intensity estimated as that of a 10 watt bulb at 200 feet. Weather clear over the island at the time. 3/10 to 5/10 strato cumulus clouds in the vicinity of the island. Visibility unlimited at 2500 feet."
      2nd Sighting
"Altitude B-29 5000 feet indicated and actual radar height. Light estimated 1000 feet above. Sounding of B-29 southerly on north leg of range. Heading of light northerly. Same intensity as first sighting. Weather 3/10 to 5/10 strato cumulus clouds tops to 5100 MSL. B-29 in the clear at the time. Visibility unlimited.
Base weather sent up an upper wind balloon shortly after the sightings. It was of the panlight cell type. We were on a south heading at the time and I picked out this light when approximately 15 miles out, yet I did not see the light until we were no more than 300 yards from it. There was no resemblance between the two lights. The pilot balloon light was bright and hardly more than a pinpoint and the other light was dull and of a yellowish tinge and fairly large.

The pilot balloon was released from base operations and went up in a slightly south easterly direction over the water and directly ahead at our altitude while we were flying in the north leg of the beam. Yet the "light" was north east of base operations by at least 500 yards on the first sighting.

At both sightings the light appeared to be moving toward us at a high speed."
