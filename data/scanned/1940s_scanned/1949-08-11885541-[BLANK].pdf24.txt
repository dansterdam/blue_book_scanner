Incident: #87 -- Germany -- date not given

As this incident is reported, it is very unlikely that
any astronomical interpretation can be offered. The description
is probably of a low order of reliability; however, and it is not
beyond reason that a spiral smoke trail ("First thought it was a
cloud") from a meteor was observed. Unfortunately, no definite
conclusion can be drawn.
