Incident #119, 119a-b == Asuncion, Paraguay -- 20 February 1948

While some of the reports of this incident are contra-
dictory, the major portion support the hypothesis that the object
observed was a slow-moving meteor or fireball. The speed and
color concur in this. The fact that the object was seen over so
wide an area implies that the observer who stated that it was only
1000 feet away was in error in his estimate.
