Incident #101 — Norton, Kansas — 18 February 1948

     This now-celebrated case of an unusual fireball has
been adequately reported in astronomical literature; (for de-
tails, see Sky and Telescope, April, 1948, page 154, and Octo-
ber, 1948, page 293). Positive identification has been made
by the recovery of fragments. The origin of this object is,
therefore, definitively astronomical, and the incident need not
be considered further.
