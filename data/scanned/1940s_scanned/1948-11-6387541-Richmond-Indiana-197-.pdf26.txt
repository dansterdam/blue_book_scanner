THE PALLADIUM-ITEM
RICHMOND, INDIANA

Saturday, Nov. 6, 1948

To: Commanding General
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
Attn: TLO/AFO-3

In compliance with verbal request from representatives of your
command Herewith is my statement of events as they occurred on or
about the 5th of November, 1948 at 0435 hours, central standard time.

I was working in office after hours and answered the phone
at approximately 0435 a.m. A lady asked if I had noticed the light
in the east, which she said resembled a flare hanging pending from
a parachute. I said I would check on it. Immediately after she hung
up a call called with a similar statement.

I looked out the window and saw a brilliant white light to
the east, a bit north. It seemed to be altering a great deal and
was much larger than a star so I discounted the possibility of it
being a heavenly body.

I lined it up with a corner of a building in the alley to
see if it was moving and saw a couple of minutes <illegible text>
movement, I called the police to check on it then and they knew nothing
of it.

I went to the upper floor or it a total of 4 or about 10 minutes,
then came down at a ^ past 5 to write a story of it.

By the time I returned to the roof for the picture, the light
was a bit dimmer.

Within even more minutes the sky was overcast from lower clouds
