At approximately 11 P. M. on the 22 nd. of June saw
a luminous oval-shaped object similar to a meat plaster rolling
along on its edge. It appeared to be going very fast since it
disappeared in about 5 to 10 seconds. It was without sound or
tail; seemed to have a tail which extended about 3/4 of the
bubble later, was the same as a second object and after another five
minute interval a third object was observed. They appeared in the
Southwest and flew to the Northeast. The weather was cloudy with
lightning and rolling thunder. The object flew over the Oakland St.
area or just to the side of it (East of Oakland St.) They traveled
about 1,000 ft and then disappeared behind the houses accross the
street from the witnesses.
