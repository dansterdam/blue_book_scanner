1. In accordance with paragraph 4, first indorsement, on 21 July
1949 Dr. G. E. VALLEY was contacted at Mt. Evans, Idaho Springs, Colorado.
Dr. VALLEY stated that it was his desire to be contacted concerning
Project Grudge activity in the vicinity of Denver because he wished
to be on the lookout for such objects. Dr. VALLEY is doing his research
work on Mt. Evans, altitude 14,260 feet, and because of his vantage
point felt that if there were any objects in the vicinity, he might be
able to observe them. It is desired to be contacted immediately
either by telephone or telegram, of the sighting of any objects so he
can be on the alert for the same. Arrangements have been made with Dr.
VALLEY whereby this Office will notify him immediately should anything
of this nature occur. This will be accomplished by using the term
"Grudge" and naming the place of sighting and the time sighted. It is
suggested that District Offices 13, 16, and 17 be [advised?] of the above
