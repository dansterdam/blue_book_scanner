Concurrently, no meteoritic fragments have been recovered to date. 
The secret of the trail in the astounding fireball of December 12, '48 in 
the Denver, Colorado region, new violet - in spite of [illegible] comp...sing careful 
searches, no fragments have yet been recovered. The fireball of at least 6 
explosion[s] the trail did fade fast - grew on the photo set by two 
cameras full, in this and other instigated in the accurately delimited 
area of fall within two hours after the appearance of the fireball have 
discovered no meteorites to date.

The extra-terrestrial fireball of March 6 was of exceptional magnitude,
 rivalling the Texas/Table; Quadrantids meteoric fall of 1949, February 13 in 
Kansas and Nebraska. Inasmuch as the known corresponding fragments have been 
recovered; in this latest one dealt with and around reported period. The 
fireball of March 6 was seen at distances of 100 miles by observers 
casually glancing upwards like in broad, midday. As regards the recoverable 
ground placement proclaimed on March 6, they have been so really reported on 
by this service since as yet no fragments nor meteorites. The visual cornea 
briefly makes observations of this fireball indicate that it remained
several[ly] as a very low level in the atmosphere. Hence, its wrong normal
recorded trail, the probability would be very great that solid masses 
must exist to give such distinct visuals. No masses of the parts have accrued 
in localities of the fireball. A much more likely but the largest fireball ever 
viewed or even estimated, 11 percent were the whole of the averages.
Yet the ball, or fish egg is so great that easily most[illegible]... crater in the earth.
No such mass exists to be certain cause, no projectiles of meteorites or of
hard effects of foretell[ed] impact on the earth has been found.


An where of the very plausible nature of the three major incidents
discussed above (least as to their cur XL size, vivid and most[illegible]... standjust

entire crop-change threat: the large, unwanted F.O.G. GRANULAR to be
