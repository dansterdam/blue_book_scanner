1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters; AC/IAS, dated 19 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The Incident Summaries 173 through 233 have been checked against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigations of Unidentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows:  Item 13, "Division of Flight of Objects," should be clarified so that vertical and horizontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move. "Relative to Radar Spotting" should include a statement of the type of radar set used.

FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
