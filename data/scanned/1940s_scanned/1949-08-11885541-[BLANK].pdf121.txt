Incident #250 -- [REDACTED], Arizona -- 16 October 1948

This incident as described is not amenable to any aero-
nautical explanation. The object took 75 minutes to cross 45Â°;
the witness apparently is not a very critical observer.

(2) There still is no possible visual correlation between the
object's brightness and its apparent distance from a star.

The object could have been a lightened balloon, gondola and
traverse stage.
