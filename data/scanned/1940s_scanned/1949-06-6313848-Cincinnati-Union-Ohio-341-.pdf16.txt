elicited from us, who is one of the island right.

I observed what looked like a very huge Object [... and unreadable text]
to west, at approximately loud 75'0" over my residence, it was like a
Venus, a diamond Airheel.

 A strong, thin hissed from this object. It traveled at the
speed of the approx nation wing travel nor north. It had to be 
only litely, since my view was only at a 6000-feet alt. It became 
from my view over the house and was not visible west. Terrifica 
west window.

 I would also add that I received this impression back it was still,
that is similar than a conventional jetliner but, to this individual,
there was no sound.

This is a true recording of my impression of the object.
