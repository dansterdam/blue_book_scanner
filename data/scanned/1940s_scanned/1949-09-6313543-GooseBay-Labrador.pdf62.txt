areas in the United States. By the use of stereoscopic plotting
apparatus, aerial photographs are utilized also in the making of
the regular topographic maps, which show relief as well as
drainage and culture.

A topographic survey of Alaska has been in progress since
1948, and nearly 44 percent of its area has now been mapped.
About 15 percent of the Territory has been covered by maps
on a scale of 1 (1 inch = nearly 8 miles). For most of the
remainder of the area surveyed the maps published are on a
scale of 1 (1 inch = nearly 4 miles). For some areas of particular economic importance, covering about 4,300 square miles,
the maps published are on a scale of 1 (1 inch = nearly 1 mile)
or larger. In addition to the area covered by topographic maps,
about 11,300 square miles of southeastern Alaska has been
covered by planimetric maps on scales of 1 and 1.
The Hawaiian Islands have been surveyed, and the resulting
maps are published on a scale of 1.
