Incident 175aa - Santa Fe, New Mexico -- 22 September 1948

The evidence here is so contradictory that it is very
difficult or not to attempt any identification. For example, one
observer states that the object was stationary; the observer that
it was moving at a speed of 700-800 mph. One says the elevation
was 45°; the other says 70°. It is hard to imagine that the;
were looking at the same object, even though it is so stated.

Considering all the statements) alone, it is
possible that the object observed was a planet; Venus. The
location is is given as southwest and the elevation as 70°, which
correspond approximately with the position of Venus at the time.
The magnitude of the planet was -3.3; it could have been visible
in the daylight sky. It would have appeared, however, more like a
pinpoint of light rather than like a "disc in the sky." It seems
unlikely that it would have been noticed at all, but since the ob-
server was looking closely at the sky ("watching" a government plane
come in), he might have chanced upon it.

Considering the vast discrepancies in the two reports, it
may not be amiss to suggest another, far fetched, explanation or
one or both. The moon at that time was in the odious phase, and was a
little of the horizon north of west. It is possible that he would be
thinking of the moon in that position as the object that he saw.
