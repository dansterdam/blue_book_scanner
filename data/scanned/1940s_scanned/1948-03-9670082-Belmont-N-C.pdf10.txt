Note: The text contains typos, such as "SIGH" instead of "SIGN," and "ICM/AXO-3" might be an error in transcription. These discrepancies might be due to artifacts in the document or OCR inaccuracies. The bottom of the document contains the text "2-c -ducl-1" which appears to be a part of a stamped or handwritten notation, possibly related to document handling or cataloging.
