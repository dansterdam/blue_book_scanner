On August 10, 11, 12, 1949, investigation revealed that only one (1) individual actually saw the "flying discs", Mr. ---------------- employed as a "guide" by --------------. A pro-longed search was instituted for the two discs that crashed in the immediate area with negative results. Interrogation of the only witness revealed him to be indefinite as to the physical characteristics of "objects" sighted, witness further declined to make any signed sworn statement regarding the sighting of the discs. Inquiries revealed Mr. -------------- to have a good reputation in all respects in the surrounding community. However, discussion with Mr. -------------- indicated to this AGENT that witness had a decided tendency to exaggerate. Mr. -------------- was informed by this AGENT that if he found either of the tro "objects" which crashed, he was to immediately contact the 15th OSI District (IG) USAF, Great Falls AFB, Montana.
