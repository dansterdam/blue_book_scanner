has the limit of binocular depth-perception is reached at a distance of about 300 meters. it thereafter continues the observer could not estimate the distance of the object; hence, the estimate of an object's distance by the observer would be less accurate the higher the object is in the sky than any assumption as to linear speed and/or elevation without range.

5. Let us for a moment assume that when first sighted the elevation of the object was 25ยบ, the sub-tended angle 1ยบ2' and the angular velocity 5'/second. Let us further investigate if the object is 25 and 50 feet to determine if objects speed and altitude could be explained by present day aircraft.

a. Assuming length of 25 feet

1. Distance from observer 71,500'

2. Altitude of object 36,650'

3. Linear Velocity 1,986 MPH

b. Assuming length of 50 feet

1. Distance from observer 2,300'

2. Altitude of object 60,374'

3. Linear Velocity 3,321

6. In view of the above no identification is offered.

7. If further research on this incident is desired an independent study by such project produce consultants will be requested.
