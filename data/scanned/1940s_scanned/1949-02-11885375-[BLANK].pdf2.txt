RECOMMENDATIONS

Future activity on this project should be carried on at the
minimum level necessary to record, summarize, and evaluate the
data received on future reports and to complete the specialized 
investigations now in progress. When and if a sufficient number
of incidents are solved to indicate that these sightings do not
represent a threat to the security of the nation, the assignment 
of special project status to the activity could be terminated. 
Future investigations of reports would then be handled on a routine 
basis like any other intelligence work.

Reporting agencies should be impressed with the necessity 
for getting more factual evidence on sightings, such as photographs,
physical evidence, radar sightings, and data on size and shape. 
Personnel sighting such objects should engage the assailant stance of
others, when possible, to get more defining data. For example,
military pilots should notify neighboring bases by radio of the 
presence and direction of flight of an unidentified object so 
that other observers, in flight or on the ground, could assist 
in its identification.
