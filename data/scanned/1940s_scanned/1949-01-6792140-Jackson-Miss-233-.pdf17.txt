At first, I thought the object was a large tow 
target about 60 feet long and about 10 feet in diameter 
at one end and about 4 feet at the trailing end. The 
tail end was illuminated by a light that was nothing 
twinkling and it seemed to have a greater speed than tow 
targets I've seen before.

When we landed about five minutes later, we called 
the CAA Control Tower to see if this thing had landed 
at the Municipal Airport and were informed that nothing 
had landed there recently. The Control Tower then
notified the Air Corps.

Although I was not flying at the time, I have 
approximately 1,000 hours of military and civilian pilot 
time and know my aircraft identification pretty good---
except in this case.

Attached to this letter is a drawing of this 
object and a rough sketch of where the object was sighted. 
If I can be of further assistance to you, I will be glad 
to help.

Very truly yours
