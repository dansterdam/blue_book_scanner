The photograph is very faded and the details are unclear, but there doesn't appear to be any photograph present in this image. What seems to be present is a rectangular box, possibly representing the space where a photograph or image could be attached or is supposed to be, but it is empty.

The text present in the document is mostly illegible due to the poor quality and faded nature of the scan. There are some words and numbers that might be partly distinguishable, but not enough to confidently recreate the entire content of the document. Due to the quality of the image, it is not possible to accurately perform an OCR output of the document's text.
