UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #134, 134a -- Monroe, Michigan -- 28 May 1948

There is no direct astronomical explanation for this

incident.

This investigator wishes to call attention to the fact

that the objects observed were seen at essentially the same level

as the lower cloud stratum and that there was a high overcast.

Could it be that those officers saw successive shafts of sunlight,

through breaks in the high overcast. illuminating small portions

of the lower cloud stratum? Apparent speed of the objects could

then have been a combination of the relative velocity of the C-47

and the projected motion of the break in the overcast.
