REPORT NO.
63

DATE OF OBSERVATION
7 May 1949

PLACE OF OBSERVATION
Limona, Florida

At 0600Z, 7 May 1949 Miss [Redacted], 60, witnessed from the front porch of her home in Limona, Florida, a bright shining and flaming object in the sky. This object was estimated to be anywhere from one-half mile to five mile away when first sighted. (Not knowing the size of the object she was unable to make a good estimate of the distance.) The first sighted of the object was shining through the trees but later rose to an angle of about 70 degrees above the horizon before dropping again to disappear behind the horizon.
It was in bright for approximately fifteen minutes and had the appearance of extremely light from within a glass globe or bulb and was not bright so as to blind the observer. The flaming border seemed to droop at the bottom, forming a short ragged tail-like effect. When first seen it appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate. When last seen, after it had moved some distance away, it appeared to be about the size of a teacup.
The object was first sighted to the west of the observer behind tree tops but then rose with a swirling motion to about the height of a fourteen-story building. Then it quivered very slowly back and forth, up and down, from side to side with an irregular quivering motion, working its way toward the west to eventually disappear below the horizon. The movements were not rapid.
There was no evidence of a trail or exhaust. No smoke and no odor. There were no clouds, no, or some reported by the observer.
The object shone with a steady light for the entire period of observation.
There were no apparent means of support, propulsion, or control. There were no estimated speeds, or manner.
The est. must, speed was similar to that of an airship, perhaps from twenty to forty miles per hour. It made no sound.
It disappeared from sight by dropping below the horizon.
The following information is on file at the base: [Redaction]
Miss [Redaction] age 60, Postal Clerk; resides at [Redaction], near Tampa, Occupation: Graduate Public Health Nurse, employed by the City of Tampa. Self taught on Gram, Tam, Florida. Miss [Redaction] has no pertinent color perception defects, however, her daytime distance and near sites only fair and perhaps below average, her reliability as an observer should be excellent. No other observations of a similar nature have been made by her. Her attention was drawn to this sighting by her two dogs barking loudly in the yard toward where she at out of bed to investigate the disturbance the light of the object attracted her attention. The dogs stopped barking after Miss [Redaction] came out into the yard. She was not able to establish what had aroused the dogs as everything outside in the yard seemed in order.
There were no other reported witnesses of this event, however an unconfirmed report reveals that several school children and one adult witnessed a similar object a few days previously.
Miss [Redaction], a report alleged completely reliable and she seemed a person of high integrity, average intelligence, and good character.
Officer who interviewed Miss [Redaction] and prepared original report upon which intelligence is based, 1st Lieutenant Reuben K. Norman, AO-6906887, Group Intelligence Officer, 307th Bombardment Group, 307th Bombardment Wing Medium, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida.
