Mr. █████████

Dear █████████:

Receipt of your communication, dated 26 July 1949, is respectfully acknowledged by this Headquarters.

While the information submitted does not contain sufficient detail to enable a positive identification, a marked similarity exists between the appearance of a searchlight beam and the phenomenon reported. Searchlights capable of projecting a beam in the manner described are often employed at carnivals, fairs, and other public gatherings.

Your action in writing this Headquarters regarding this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

W. R. CLINGMAN
Colonel, USAF
