Incident #168 -- The Hague -- 20 July 1948

This information herein is too limited even for
guesswork. It is extremely difficult to take at face value the
report of an aircraft with two decks using no wings, travelling,
with supersonic speed, even if "seen four times through clouds"
by the chief of the fleet of KLM and his daughter. It seems
much more probable that the observers had a subjective impression
of ordinary aircraft or a fireball. Even though those two items
are at opposite ends of the scale, there is nothing in the evi-
dence to favor one or the other.

In passing, it is interesting to note that this inci-
dent occurred just four days before the famous "Chiles-Whitted
ship". Maybe our 'visitors' from Mars were cruising around!
