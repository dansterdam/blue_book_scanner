The possibility that some of the incidents may represent 
technical developments far in advance of knowledge available to 
engineers and scientists of this country has been considered.
No facts are available to personnel at this Command that will
permit an objective assessment of this possibility. All infor-
mation so far presented on the possible existence of space ships
from another planet or of aircraft propelled by an advanced type
of atomic power plant have been largely conjecture. Based on
experience with nuclear power plant research in this country, the
existence on Earth of such engines of small enough size and weight
to have powered the objects described is highly improbable.

Reports of unidentified flying objects are not peculiar to
the present time. In, "The Books of Charles Fort," by Tiffany Tay-
lor, published in 1941 by Henry Holt & Co., New York, similar
phenomena are described as having been sighted during past cen-
turies. In the last war, numerous si[ghtings] of "balls of fire"
in the air were reported by bomber crews.
