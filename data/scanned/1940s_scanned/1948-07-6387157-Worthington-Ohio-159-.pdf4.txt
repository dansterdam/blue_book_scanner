Incident #159 -- Worthington, Ohio -- 23 July 1948

No astronomical explanation is suggested by the descrip-
tion of this incident.

This investigator wonders whether an advertising "blimp"
might not have been in the not-observed, due time of observation
was just after sunset, and a blimp would probably have given the
appearance described.

It should be noted that no size of the object and
distance are not stated.
