SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

The following article appeared in the BIRMINGHAM AGE-HERALD, Birmingham,
Alabama, 25 October 1949:

"STRANGE OBJECT IN SKY SHUFFLES TO BUFFALO BY WAY OF TALLADEGA

"It was the strangest sight over soon over Talladega, Ala., and Buffalo, N.Y.

"It was moon-shaped and silvery looking. And it had twin tails that seemed
to shoot off a trail of vapor as it traveled eastward over Talladega.

"The astronomical phenomenon was sighted shortly before noon in Talladega
yesterday. Radio bulletins got most of the citizens there to scanning the sky.

"Nobody could explain it. Guesses were that it was a meteor. Scientists
in Birmingham shrugged and said maybe it was the moon.

"Only a moon doesn't have a tail. Much less two of them, pointed and spouting.

"Whether it was the same thing or another body, folks in Buffalo, N. Y. last
night were agog over a 'mysterious something in the sky.'

"Humorous sky gazers saw the 'something' in Buffalo, according to an
Associated Press dispatch.

"Most agreed that it gave off a bright light. But beyond that, it was hard
to get two descriptions exactly alike.

"Some folks in Buffalo said it looked light a big spot of blue.

"Richard DAVIS, Buffalo Science Museum astronaut, said it might have been a
shower of meteors. Other folks called it a 'green ball of fire.'

"Some said it was 'an immense skyrocket.' That's not at all the way things
looked over Talladega. But maybe it didn't glow because of the daylight.

"Whatever it was, it was the fourth sky phenomenon reported this month.

"On Oct. 14, residents in Northern Ontario, Toronto and Buffalo reported
seeing a 'blinding, bluish white blaze of light' and/or a 'big ball of fire with
a long trail'.
