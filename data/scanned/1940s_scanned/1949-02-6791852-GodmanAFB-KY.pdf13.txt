STATEMENT

I Richard E. Patterson was called to the tower on the night of 7 February 1949. Sgt Ledbetter was there and pointed out a bright object in the sky, which appeared to me to be about the size of a golf ball. The object was changing color from red, to blue to yellow. The elevation was 33.0.6 degrees. The object was observed in the southwest. I could not determine the distance, but it appeared to be great. The object was followed for twenty minutes. I was unable to tell what speed the object was traveling, and could not hear any noise or sense any oder, there was no trail left behind. There were no projections from this object, it was just turning around in a small space and changing colors. It changed color once and disappeared. There were no clouds, the weather was clear with approximately ten miles visibility.
