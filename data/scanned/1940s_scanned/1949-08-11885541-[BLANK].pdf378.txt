Incident #28 -- Idaho -- 24 June 1947

Any probable astronomical explanation for this incident
is dependent upon the hour of observation, which is not stated in
the information given with the summary.

An unconfirmed statement (by Dr. Archam, quoted in material
submitted relative to incident #101) that this observation was made
at 3:30 P. M. allows for no possible astronomical explanation other
than that a persistent meteor train may have been observed. Such a
phenomenon might have given the general impression suggested by the
limited description of the incident.

If, however, the observation occurred during the early
evening hours, shortly after sunset, which occurred that day at
about 9:00 P. M. local time, then it is extremely likely that Lt. Gov.
Whitehead saw either the planet Saturn or Mercury. Mercury set al-
most exactly an hour after the sun and was of stellar magnitude +1.
Saturn, of magnitude 0.0 and hence about once again as bright as
Mercury, set two hours after the sun. A bright planet shining through
thin cirrus clouds could give the impression of a "rocket-like object."
