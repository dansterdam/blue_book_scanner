18 NOV 4P

With 703b indications thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation. This statement is true only under the assumption that the evidence is 
considered as reliable and accurate. When psychological, and physio-
logical factors are taken into consideration, all of these 
might and invariably are, accounted for by General AAF Weather 
Service in Weather Command norms in the SWORM (5211 and 5031).

(Investigation and analytical methods by Weather 
Services concluded)

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the 
majority of these upsets to provide plausible contradiction - 
psychological origins explain these phenomena in distracting 
attention results chiefly from inability to establish speed, distance, 
size. 

All of the remaining 34 incidents are resolved in detail in the
report, Chapter 4, in this form: No pattern is found in the 34
types of objects or lights for all the experienced aeronauts are 
witness evidence reports were overlooked by the earlier project 
reports or the incidents were completely individual or sporadic

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix F) are 
so current characteristics so widely various statements of the more 
than 1000 weather responses were just not read out of place.

(incident incidents No. 77). Most remain unresolved without pattern
throughout the United States. A few more outside the U.S. No two
descriptions or appearance or performance were exactly alike. The re-
ported sightings occurred at various times of day and years.

In the following section of this report, each remaining unidentified
incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to generally
disprove character as observers; in each case is undisputable discrets as
they may be viewed. The present dispensation is merely the same 
as for this incident in the project files.
