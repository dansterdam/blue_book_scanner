Gentlemen:

It is my understanding that your company bought the copyright to a photograph taken on 10 February 1948 by [redacted] of Morton, Kansas. The subject of this picture was a meteorite trail appearing over Kansas.

I am interested in securing a print, and would therefore appreciate an early reply giving size and cost of such a print.

Very truly yours,

JAMES C. BARN
Lt Colonel, USAF
