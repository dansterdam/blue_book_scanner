The photograph present in the document appears to show a series of trails or lines in the sky, which may be consistent with a meteor's vapor trail as described in the text. The image is monochrome and rather faint. It seems to depict several nearly vertical lines diverging from a common point at the bottom of the image, suggesting an explosion or burst in the sky.

Now, as per your request, I will transcribe the text from the document:

---
of February 12 over Northern Kansas was just that, a meteor. No fragments
have been recovered from it. There were found, beginning April 21, over
several small fragments up to one of 4 1/2 pounds. Then a buried
spot in a clover field led to the digging up of a piece of some 100 pounds
embedded about two feet in the soil. The stone is what is termed as an
"achondrite", a technical name for an unusual type of stony meteorite.
It is reported to be of a type which will deteriorate rapidly.

A photograph of the trail of the meteor, made by amateur photographer
Duane E. Korey of Norton, shows the vapor trail left in the sky by the
explosion of a meteor which was seen in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado,
Kansas, and Nebraska. It was made at Korey's home, nine miles north of
Norton, just four minutes after the meteor exploded. A smudge of blue-
white smoke remained in the sky for an hour February 18th. This photo-
graph is in file under Incident #101.

Further remarks are contained in supplement.
