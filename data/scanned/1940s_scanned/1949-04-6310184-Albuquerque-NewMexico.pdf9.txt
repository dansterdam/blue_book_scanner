The image contains a map but it is partially obscured and there is some kind of textured dark area at the bottom which could possibly be a poorly scanned or damaged photograph, although it's not distinguishable as an image with discernable content. The text on the document appears as follows:

The topography is an elaborate mimic of Los Alamos with mesas somewhat exaggerated for presentation. The actual clues if there are any are at the scale of the pueblos P2 & P3 for the north side of town, and P6 and P2 and P6 right bottom to show streets which meet at P6 on the north side of town
