Incident #75 -- near Twin Falls, Idaho -- 13 August 1947

There is clearly nothing astronomical in this incident. 
Apparently it must be classed with the other bona fide disc
sightings.

Two points stand out, however: the "sky blue" color,
and the fact that the trees "spun around on top as if they were
in a vacuum." Could this, then, have boon a rapidly travelling
atmospheric oddity?
