The image contains a sketch, not a photograph. The sketch appears to be a visual aid for reporting the observation of an unspecified flying object. It shows two arced scales representing elevation angles from the observer's point of view. The left scale has angles marked from 15° to 90°, and the right scale is in the form of a compass showing cardinal directions. On the left arced scale, two points "A" and "B" are marked, indicating the initial and final elevation angles of the object's observed path. On the compass scale, point "A" is marked on the "N" indicating North, and point "B" is marked between "NE" and "E" which indicates the Northeast and East directions.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

A
15° 30° 45° 60° 75° 90°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A
B

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
____
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
