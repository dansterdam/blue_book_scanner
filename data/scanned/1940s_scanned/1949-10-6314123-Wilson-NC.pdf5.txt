Here is the text from the document:

Unknown object without any type of angle and
with a twenty mile base the described phenomena
inferred is fantastic.

My first thought was of some refraction trick
caused by various layers of clouds or ice
particles causing a lens effect, or a special
atmosphere' condition causing a refraction.
This was disproved by noting the contrasting
surrounding conditions. It was seen between towering
thunderheads just after a storm, although there
were fast moving layers of stratus clouds
in bunch, clear cold stardust nights and hot
hazy nights.

I can't think of any condition which would
a refraction, would not move if you move the
source of light.

We could move an automobile 10 or 15 degrees
to the right or left and still see the ufoject
dimly in the same spot. Or we could shine the
light in the eastern tip of the street object
or cut it in half. None of these things would
be done if it were a refraction of the light
itself.
