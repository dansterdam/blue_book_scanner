1 May 1948

Memo for Lt Col. Thomas

The undersigned officer was participating as pilot on a local
flight on: Friday, 30 April 1948, in Navy aircraft SNJ BuNo 07731. At
approximately 1205 local time, at an altitude of about 5500 feet, on a
magnetic heading of about 120 degrees, just south of Anacostia Naval Air
Station, an object was sighted ahead to the left and about 1100 feet below
at a distance of about 1 mile. The object resembled a yellow sphere estimated
at 25-40 feet in diameter. The flight path of the object was in approximately
a south to north direction (exact opposite winds from North Northwest) and
apparently followed a constant altitude. Pilot did not pursue object
further because it was entering the prohibited flying area, W.S. Capitol, White
House area.

The object appeared to pilot to be a yellow, (or light colored)
balloon but attracted attention principally because of its flight path. No
external rigid structure can be observed on the object. The speed of
the object was estimated at about 100 MPH.
