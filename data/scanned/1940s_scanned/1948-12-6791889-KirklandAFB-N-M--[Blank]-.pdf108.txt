ENCLOSURE #4

OFFICE MEMORANDUM           UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO:     Captain Shea

FROM:   Inspector █████████

SUBJECT: Object seen on 105 Patrol

Date:  20 December 1948

From 2050 to 2100 this date Inspector █████████ and myself were
at Pt. Eagle in the regular performance of the 105 patrol.

At 2054 we saw the object described below making a path thru the
sky. The direction of travel was from West to East, possibly a trifle
Southerly. The object was travelling in an almost flat trajectory and its
decline formed an angle with the horizon of approximately twenty degrees.
The angle of elevation from our point of observation was approximately thirty
degrees. The object was moving at a very fast rate of speed and disappeared
behind the mountain directly to the northeast of Pt. Eagle. Total time of
visibility was about one and one-half seconds.

Description:

An intense blue-white light about the size of a basket-
ball. As the object traversed the sky, there was a faint trail
of light behind it, and two objects the size of a baseball
separated from the main body. These objects were of the same
color and intensity as the main body, and trailed behind it
directly in its path at even intervals of distance equal to
approximately three times the diameter of the main body. The
size of the main body was approximately one quarter the size
of the moon.
