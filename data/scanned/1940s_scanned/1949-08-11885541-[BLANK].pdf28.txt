Incident #90 -- between Las Cruces, N.M. & Jupeter & White Sands V-2
firing grounds -- 22 Jul 48 1230Z

The information given here is insufficient for any definite
conclusion to be drawn, but it is not impossible that the object ob-
served was meteoric. The estimated timing in sight is quite long;
however, and, if a meteor, the object should have had a pronounced
vapor trail. The "solar spoular reflection which seemed to shine
in intensity" could, of course, have been light from the meteor it-
self, blended with daylight.

Once again, it is unfortunate that more detailed observa-
tions were not made.
