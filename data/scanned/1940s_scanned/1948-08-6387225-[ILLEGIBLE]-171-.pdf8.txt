PROBABLY FROM NEARBY CUMULUS. NO
WINGS COULD BE SEEN AND NO SOUND WAS
HEARD. IT LOOKED LIKE A FLUID METEOR,
AND WAS SO IDENTIFIED BY A RUSSIAN
ACQUAINTANCE WHO SAW IT AT THE SAME TIME.
THE REPORTER, HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE
APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT, WAS OF THE
OPINION THAT IT WAS NOT A RIGID METEOR,
DUE PRINCIPALLY TO ITS HIGH SPEED. HE HAD
NO THEORY TO OFFER, AND COULD ONLY
SAY THAT IT WAS A MYSTERY, LIKE THE
AMERICAN "FLYING SAUCERS‚Äù.

NO COMMENT. "THIS OBJECT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN ANYTHING. ITS SPEED SEEMS
INSUFFICIENT FOR A GUIDED MISSILE,
BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN EITHER A MET-
OR CONVENTIONAL AIRPLANE, AS UNUSUAL
LIGHT CONDITIONS AND FORESHORTENED
FREQUENCY GIVE AIRCRAFT A FREAKISH
APPEARANCE, THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT
WAS A DIRIGIBLE, AS SUGGESTED IN THE
REFERENCE (A), SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED, 

??????
REFERENCE (A), SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED,
OBTAINING ITS APPARENT SPEED FROM HIGH
WINDS. THE UPPER WINDS IN THIS AREA ARE
NOT AVAILABLE, BUT IT IS VAGUELY STATED
ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE THAT THE
HIGH SPEEDS EXISTS THERE ON THE
PROPOSITION.
