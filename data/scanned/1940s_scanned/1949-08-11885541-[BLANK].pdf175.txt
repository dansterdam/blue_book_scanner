ABSTRACT

A Technical Intelligence Report covering the method of investiga-
tion of unidentified flying objects and results obtained to date is
presented.

The report discusses in full the history of the project, the
problems encountered, and the procedures followed in the investigation
and evaluation of reports of unidentified flying objects. Since the
project is continuous in nature, this report comprehensively treats
reports of sightings only up to January 1949. Work is continuing on
later reports.
