The page contains two black and white photographs:

The top photograph appears to show an aircraft that is partially dismantled or damaged, resting on the ground outdoor with a building in the background. It is a side view that emphasizes the fuselage and an engine mount.

The bottom photograph displays what seems to be a close-up view of an aircraft's rotor plane. This image is taken from above and looking down onto the rotor, which is predominantly in the frame, with some clutter and possibly parts of the aircraft visible in the surrounding area.

The text accompanying these images is as follows:
