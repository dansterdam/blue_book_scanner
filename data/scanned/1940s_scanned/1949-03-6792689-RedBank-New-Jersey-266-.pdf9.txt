4 March 1949

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On 4 March 1949 at 1240 I spotted an object northeast of Watson Laboratories. I was standing in the west side of the parking lot.

To me this object appeared disc-shape and travelling at a very high rate of speed from northeast to north. This appeared of a very bright or shiny look. It did not appear to change shape while it changed its course.
