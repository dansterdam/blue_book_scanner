Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

   Objects followed a straight course. When first seen, the object on the left was
an apparent distance of five feet behind the first, and with an increase of speed over-
took the first object in about 2 seconds and flew in close formation with the first
object. This fact seems to preclude the possibility that these objects were meteors.

   Object was first sighted by M/Sgt Lorbcek, who was watching a B-25 pass over the
Field, and observed the objects passing above the B-25, going in the opposite direction,
and called them to the attention of Major Bullock and Majst Fink, who were standing near
by and remarked, "Are those airplanes? Boy! They are sure fast."
