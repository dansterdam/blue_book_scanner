IN accordance with your request, this present report has been prepared in order to summarize results obtained by investigations carried out in this interval, December 13-20.

1. The Observational Data. As far as can be determined, the first incident of the sort reported by many observers on December 5 occurred as early as 1948, January 1. (see copy of ------'s letter, under date of January 7, to Mr. A. Schrader), the second such incident, and one presenting much more striking resemblance to the December 5 - December 13 incidents, occurred on August 13, 1948, (as testified to before me this morning by Master Sergeant J. E. ----, Regional Director for the American Rocket Society, University of Toledo). Beginning on December 5 there was a sudden outburst of anomalous luminous appearances. The table given below lists date, hour of observation, names of observers, and, in general, points of observations for each of the occurrences so far uncovered by investigations carried out under the general supervision of your office and the Institute of Meteoritics.
