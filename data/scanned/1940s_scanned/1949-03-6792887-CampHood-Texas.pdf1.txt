The document includes a black and white photograph in the lower half. The photograph seems to be an image of the sky with a dark background and a few ambiguous shapes that could be interpreted as light sources or reflections. There appears to be a vertical sequence of lights or reflections, and the general image quality is quite poor, making it difficult to discern specific details.
