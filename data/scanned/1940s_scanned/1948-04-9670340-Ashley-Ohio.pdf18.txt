Here is the text from the document:

---

It was thought the local plane which reported to be flying low and making
an unusual amount of noise. Ground observer could not locate the plane but did see an
object coming in high and slow. It did not leave the sharp, clear-cut outline of a 
conventionally propelled airliner but instead moved with the appearance of a
silver streak. It was clearly outlined and moved slowly and steadily in a
cruisewise[r] direction parallel to the ground and without changing direction.
Altitude and size were not estimated.

Note: See location #12 in which the plane was perceived flying low.

The text appears to be a description of a sighting report, possibly of an unidentified object, and is part of a larger collection of reports from Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force.
