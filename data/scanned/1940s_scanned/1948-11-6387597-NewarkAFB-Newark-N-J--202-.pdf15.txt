STATEMENT 

At 1850 hours, 3 November, 1948, I was standing just outside hangar 
#7 at Newark Air Force Base, on the south side of the hangar. 'T was a per-
fectly clear night. I looked up toward the moon and noticed a pale luminous 
object race across the sky. It was about 1/3 the brightness of the moon, 
round like a disk, with little or no depth(thickness) to it. It appeared to 
be about the same relative dime to us the moon. I viewed the object north-
northwest, in an arc, towards the south-southeast in about two and one halts 
passing out of sight over another hangar. I heard no sound from the object. 
I estimate the speed of the object at 600 miles per hour, and its altitude at 
five to six thousand feet. I have seen jet aircraft make tactical approaches 
at this field at approximately 600 miles per hour, and judging from them, the 
speed of the object I sighted was at least 200 miles an hour faster. From 
where I stood, I would approximate my angle of the path of the object, The 
peak of its are was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon to the west-
southwest of my position.
