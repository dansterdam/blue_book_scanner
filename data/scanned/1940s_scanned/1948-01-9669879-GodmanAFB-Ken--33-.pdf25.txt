REPORT OF UNUSUAL INCIDENT

At approximately 1100E, 7 January 1948, Kentucky State Police reported
to Ft Knox Military Police they had sighted an unusual aircraft or object
flying through air, circular in appearance approximately 250 - 300 feet in
diameter, moving westward at "a pretty good clip." This in turn was report-
ed to the Commanding Officer, Godman Field, Ft Knox, Kentucky, who called
Godman Tower and asked them to have Flight Service check with Wright Test
at Wright Field to see if they had any experimental aircraft in that area.

Captain Hopper at Flight Test Operations stated, "We have no experi-
mental aircraft in that area, however we do have a B-29 and an A-26 on photo
missions in that area." This information was relayed to Godman Tower by
telephone on duty and a verification on report was asked for.

Godman Tower later called back and stated first report was by radio to
Ft Knox Military Police and followed by telephone call to same from State
Police.

Information on P-51's and further reports are reported as follows by
Captain Arthur T. Jehli, Supervisor of the 1600E - 2100E shift.

"When the 1600E - 2100E shift reported for duty we were advised that a
"disc", or balloon, or some strange object was seen hovering in the vicin-
ity of Godman Field. This object was seen by the Commanding Officer and
Operations Officer of Godman Field who advised that they would attempt to
send aircraft to ascertain the size and shape of the object.

"At this time there was a flight of F-51's enroute from Marietta,
Georgia to Standiford Field, Louisville, Kentucky. The lead ship was NG 3869,
pilot Mantell. The Commanding Officer, Godman Field contacted this pilot
and requested that he investigate the object overhead.

"One of the ships of the formation, NG 555 pilot Hendrichs, landed at
Standiford Field. The 3 other aircraft started to climb toward the object.
"At 22,000 feet pilot Hammond, NG 777, advised Clements, NG 800, that
he had no oxygen equipment. Both pilots then returned to Standiford Field;
pilot Mantell, NG 3869, continued climbing.
"Pilot Clements, NG 800, refueled and went back up to 32,000 feet but
did not see either the strange object or the aircraft, NG 3869 again, and so
returned to Standiford Field.

"At 1750E, Standiford Field advised that NG 3869, pilot Mantell, crash-
ed 5 miles SW Franklin, Kentucky approximately 1645E.

"We then sent an arrival of 1500C for the 3 aircraft, NG 555, NG 777,
and NG 800, also notified Maxwell Flt, in savings can't say that NG 3869 had
crashed,
