[Redacted] California
Incident #42 -- Portland, Oregon -- 14 June 1947

There is nothing whatever in this incident to suggest that the objects observed were of astronomical origin. Their maneuvers and the relatively low; time they were in sight definitely precludes any possible astronomical interpretation. 

It is of interest to note that in this locality and at this season other possibly-similar non-astronomical incidents were reported -- see #17 and #68.
