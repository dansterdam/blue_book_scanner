NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
     Light moving "lights" appeared in the atmosphere over or in the vicinity of the "R" area, AFSWP, Camp Hood, Texas, on the evening of 17 March 1949. At the time of these sightings, the alert guard of the 2nd Armored Division, under the Assistant AC of S, G-2 of Camp Hood, was in the area concerned and prepared to fire flares and record instrument readings of elevation and azimuth. The purpose was to check the powers of observation of observers who had previously reported the phenomena observ- ed on 7-8 March 1949 and heretofore reported in Summary of Information, this head- quarters, dated 17 March 1949, subject "Unusual Lights." However, before this ob- servation could be begun, the series of 8 unusual "lights" appeared.

Coordinates of lights and time of sighting follow:
Coordinates                                         Time
1. 910.40 = 855.4lh                                 1952
2. 910.39 = 860.13                                  1956
3. 910.42 = 860.16                                  1958
4. 910.34 = 860.15                                  2000
5. 910.32 = 855.20                                  2002
6. 910.30 = 855.17                                  2010

8. 910.37 = 855.35                                  2152

Coordinates were based on dual sightings of each light by sights on tanks or by observers. Time was clocked at instant of sighting. Captain McCullogh, the Assista- ant G-2, personally observed three of the lights. Physical characteristics of the "lights" were no parallax was "lights different" from those reported on 7-8- March 1949. No burst into 5 (five) lights during 00:00 watch light, on watch observed obser- vations similar to a star similar to Very Pistol flares. While this phenomena was oc- curring, a security detachment from the Mq" area arrived in the vicinity of the cr- ew from the 2nd Armored Division.
