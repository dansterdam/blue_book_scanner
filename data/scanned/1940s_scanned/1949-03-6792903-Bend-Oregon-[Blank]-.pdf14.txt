Flying Saucers
Sighted at Bend

Bend, March 25 (Special)â€”Bend residents Friday were still talking about two "flying saucers" that cavorted in the Deschutes sky, mirrored the rays of the March sun and dipped through vernal clouds.

Dozens of local residents spotted the "saucers," which some saw more than half an hour Thursday, but few could agree on their size or heights.

One veteran aviator, Vernon Lewry, estimated their height well over 10,000 feet; estimated size of the objects ranged from that of kites to large tubes.

First sighted from a barber shop window, the objects soon attracted a crowd that blocked sidewalks to traffic. Before disappearing, the objects changed courses and headed west.
