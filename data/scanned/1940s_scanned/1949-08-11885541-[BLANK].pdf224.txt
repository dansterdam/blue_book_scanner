SUMMARY OF RESULTS
  
What, in particular, was gathered from the evidence con-
cerning the astronomical character of the objects observed?
  
Of the 244 incidents submitted, 7 are excluded from all
statistical reckoning: 1 is identified (in the subject report) as
a hoax, 3 are duplicates, and 3 contain no information. In sum-
marizing the findings in the remaining 237, two systems of classi-
fication are possible:
  
First, all incidents can be placed in one of two classes:
  
1) those which under no stretch of the imagination can be regarded
as astronomical or extra-terrestrial (extra-terrestrial throughout
this investigation refers solely to natural objects not originating
on earth; it does not include "space ships from other planets"),
and 2) those which either are definitely astronomical or can by
suitable manipulation of the evidence be construed as such. The
object here is to segregate all cases in which any vestige of astro-
nomical origin is indicated. When this division is made, 111, or
47%, fall into the definitely non-astronomical category, or, con-
versely stated, 126, or 55%, might conceivably be considered (al-
though the likelihood of their being so is very very small) as
extra-terrestrial or astronomical in origin. The exact percentage
is not important. The significant thing is that over 50% of the
incidents might possibly be explained astronomically, if wide enough
tolerances were allowed.
