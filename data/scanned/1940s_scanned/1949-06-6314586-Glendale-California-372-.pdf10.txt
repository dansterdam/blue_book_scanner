The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph.

As per your request, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, here is the output of the text found in the document:

Two sections of the text appear to have been redacted with black bars, obscuring any writing that may have been underneath. These redactions prevent the OCR function from reading those sections.
