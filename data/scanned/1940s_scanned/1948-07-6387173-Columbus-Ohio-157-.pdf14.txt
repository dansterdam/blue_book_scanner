radio tower and was about half the height of the tower from the ground. As
it passed overhead traveling east, it was pointedly black smoke from the top
and at the bottom on the left side there was a dull enclosed light like a
lamp. The object did not change its course or altitude but continued on to
the east with black smoke trailing behind. The object was black and did not
make any noise. It did not leave any vapor or was visible and we could
not see any openings or markings. No attempt was made to observe this object
and no other car stopped near us. There was a boy and a girl in this and they
both said they never saw anything like this object before. We did not noti-
ze it until the noise called the Columbus Dispatch (newspaper) when we got home
and the editor took our story but no airplanned the "hots in the news
paper." We did not see any "sliverering discs" or "flittering discs" as stated
as stated in the paper. To say only one object.

On 2 August 1948, *****, telephone operator, State Highway
Patrol Radio Station *****, Ackerman Road, Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed
and stated in substance:

On Saturday evening, 31 July 1948, at approximately 8:00 P.M., I was
at the equipment stand of the Ohio Driving Range which is located on
Dodge Street across from Union Cemetery, when I saw an object floating
in the sky. It was coming from the east over the Ohio State University 
Field and it was approximately 100 feet or the ground in a direct heading 
toward me. It was getting lower all the time and I saw it land in a field nearby.
Three small boys ran toward it and I went over to investigate. The object
was a paper bag affair approximately 2 foot in diameter and 3 feet long,
made of white crepe paper. It was like the old time "County Fair" hot air
balloons. It was smoking when I first observed it and I found that this was 
caused by a large ball of waste material which was fastened underneath it.
There were no marks or writing on it and I do not know where it came from.
