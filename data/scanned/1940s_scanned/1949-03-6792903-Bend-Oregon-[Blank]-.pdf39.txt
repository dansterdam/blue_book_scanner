Note: Some of the text is not entirely clear due to the quality of the photocopy and, therefore, could not be transcribed with absolute certainty. Some portions consist simply of lines to be filled out by recipients, hence the placeholder descriptors (e.g., "DATE REC'D," "HOUR") and the lines for signatures.
