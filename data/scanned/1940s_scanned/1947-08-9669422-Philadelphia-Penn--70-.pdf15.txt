There is an image which appears to be a simple sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the center of the page, just above the middle. The UFO resembles a classic "flying saucer" shape with a raised center and flattened edges. It is a very basic drawing without much detail.

Here is the text present in the document:

she observed that Miss █████ appeared frightened. As she was facing
south she did not see the object after she noticed her companion's
cause of expression but she did later - a slight buzzing sound.
