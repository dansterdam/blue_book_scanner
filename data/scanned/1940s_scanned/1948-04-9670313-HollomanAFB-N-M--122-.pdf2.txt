With 107 incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain good evidence but have no current ready explanation.
Two incidents have only one witness the assumption that the evidence
could be resulting from sources. When psychological and physio-
logical observation into consideration, all of these incidents
are explained satisfactorily. Additional study by Panel Consultant
Lewis W. Alvarez, University of California, and Laboratory (see Appendix
G 8), 

(d) Total (real and psychological, but previously unreported)
122 Incidents considered)

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the thirty-
unexplained flying objects to provide plausible explanations for
reports not obtainable explainable. The detail in identifying
stimuli results chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance,
size.

All of the remaining 24 incidents are treated in detail in the
report; there no findings of good pattern in regard to speed or other 
types of object; or certain cloud or sun effect. The Panel indicates,
with these manifestations followed by airplane interception,
probably good not have been considered vermin or reported
seen no publicity.

VII. SUMMARY AND EVALUATION OF "TEN TWELVE REPORTS

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix F) exhibit
certain characteristics. Two of them by statements of the reporters
could not have been made. Air messages not read of e.e.'s; countless
reports (Function 47). Most were distributed without pattern
throughout the United States or from routes outside the U. S. No two
descriptions of "appearance" or performances were exactly alike. The un-
covered eight in occurred in all fours of day and years.

APPENDIX I

In the following sections of this report, each responding unex-
plained in considered separately. It is not the intent to give any
one chapter any undue, but each case has undesirable clearance,
of the arguments. The substantial accumulation is narrow and cautious,
efforts in this reports of effort.
