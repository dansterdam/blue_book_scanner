TRANSMITTAL SLIP AFSN:
 
This inspector was extremely startled by this object as the first impression
was that it was a plane on fire and about to crash nearby. As the eyes became
adjusted to the distance this Inspector had the distinct impression of seeing
a silver or aluminum covered body inside the flame or glow that resembled
that part of a fuselage of a war-time German type plane from behind the wing
to just in front of the tail assembly. This inspector further had the im-
pression that the object was actually flaming and that the flames were quite
visible. The overall shape of the object including the flame or light was much
like the accompanying sketch. The object appeared less than 1/mile from the
observer and the outlines were very distinct.
