SUBJECT: (Unclassified) Reporting of Information Concerning
         Unidentified Flying Objects

TO:       Director of Intelligence, Headquarters Fifteenth Air Force,
          March Air Force Base, Riverside, California

1. On 8 August 1952 ****** and ***** ********* Street,
   Los Angeles 7, California (Phone: *********), visited this office and
   reported the following:

   a. In August, 1949, they were employed by the U. S.
      Forestry Service as fire lookouts and were stationed at Delilah Lookout,
      east of Fresno. They were qualified observers having been lookouts for
      four summers. (They are also aircraft observers and claim complete
      familiarity with all aircraft found on their aircraft observer charts.)
      Their sighting of the flying object on that day was through a standard
      set of Navy binoculars (6x30) and the object was not more than 3½ miles
      distant from their lookout tower.

   b. The object was approximately 100 feet long and
      proportionately wide; "space ship"-like in appearance; dull, silver-white
      in color; soundless; moved at about 20 miles per hour; no flame or other
      visible means of propulsion although at the rear end there was a short
      in a jet aircraft; two very small, under-proportioned wings, swept-back
      and pointed, about a third of the distance back from the nose; a long,
      narrow window on each side of the nose in the upper half; object appeared
      from behind a mountain, moved slowly down a valley in front of another
      mountain, halted and hovered where valley intersected another valley that
      went behind a mountain on their left (Mr and Mrs Bromley felt that it
      hovered there as though it were observing a dam that was being constructed
      down in the hidden valley), hovered there for fully 15 minutes, and then
      moved away from them, still at the very slow speed of 20-40 miles an
      hour, toward Fresno.

   c. Sighting occurred at about 1400 and object was under
      their view for thirty minutes while it traversed its 4 mile course at
      about 90 degrees to their line of vision. Weather was clear, bright,
      cloudless, calm.

   d.  Delilah Lookout is at approximately 36°50' N and
      119° 10' W at about 5000' altitude (See enclosed map). Sighted object was
      at eyelevel throughout. Course of object was roughly from east to west on
