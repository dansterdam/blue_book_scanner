STATEMENT

UNCLASSIFIED

At 5:15 P. M. on 28 April 1949 I sighted an object NW of Tucson, Arizona at an angle of 75 degrees from the horizontal and at an altitude of about 25,000 to 30,000 feet. I noticed this object while standing in front of the Circle W. Ranch near the corner of East Hedrick and North Campbell Avenues, at 2218 East Hedrick Drive, I first noticed it because of the reflection of the sun on the object which showed it a brilliant silver color. When I first sighted the object it was traveling in a southeastly direction and finally curved to the northwest and disappeared from view. I observed it for about 40 minutes.

This object was cigar shaped with rounded ends. Had no tail assembly or fins that I could see. It seemed to be rotating as it traveled. I would say it was traveling at a high rate of speed. There were no clouds, and the sky was very clear. Toward the front of the object I noted two circular holes which looked just likes eyes from that distance.

I did not hear any noise nor note any exhaust or vapor trails.

From its altitude I would say it would be as large as a B-29.

I was in company with two other men. One man's name was Ham and the other man was called Tex.

I called Davis-Monthan AFB and talked to the S. O. D., who was on duty that evening.
