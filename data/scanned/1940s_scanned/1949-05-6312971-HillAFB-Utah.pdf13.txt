NARRATIVE SUMMARY
On 25 May 1949, Lt. [REDACTED] (Pilot), Salvage Officer, Hill
AFB, Hill Field, Utah, was interviewed and stated that he, in the company of three other
gentlemen (names in details), were in the West Salvage Yard, HILL AFB, Hill Fld, Utah
about 1705 MDT, when the sound of an airplane attracted his attention. When located
the airplane, he said it was an F-51 traveling in a southeasterly direction, approximately
(5) miles away and about ten (10) thousand feet MSL, high. The object [REDACTED] saw was a
little below the airplane and behind it, but traveling possibly forty (40) MPH faster
object to three hundred (300) MPH. [REDACTED] then turned to his companion, Lt
[REDACTED] (Patterson and Shaughnessy were standing a short distance away) and called his
attention to the object. [REDACTED] did not see either the first object or the airplane,
but did see a second object, globular in shape, traveling in a southeasterly direction.
[REDACTED] further stated the airplane turned north and he then kept watching the second
object which he said was traveling a parallel course to the first one, but north of it,
and later at a speed of about the same (300 MPH) to thirty (30) MPH faster, the first object
and out of sight. [REDACTED] described the first object to be circular and the first; a dull
silver color and reflecting the sunlight. [REDACTED] described the second object to be cir-
cular, dark blue on one side and silver on the other, reflecting the sunlight.
