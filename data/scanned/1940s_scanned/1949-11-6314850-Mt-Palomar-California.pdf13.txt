Reference telephone call from Maj I. Herman on 1 Dec 52. After briefing by Col 
Bower and Capt Ruppelt of this Center on unidentified flying objects at Los Alamos 
on 23 Oct 52, Dr. W. H. Crew arranged a special meeting with a small group of people 
from the laboratory. Several of these people had evidence that there was a possible 
correlation between sightings of unidentified flying objects and unusual radiation 
detection. Among this group were a Mr. ------ and a Mr. -------. The 
preliminary data obtained from these people has been studied and it is now believed 
advisable to contact them again and get more details to determine whether or not ATIC 
should make a more complete study of the subject. It is requested that if it can be 
arranged, a meeting with these people be set up.for the morning of 10 Dec 52. The 
meeting will not be more than four to five hours. ATIC
