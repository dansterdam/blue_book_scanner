Subject: PHOTOGRAPHS

Dear Sir:

In compliance with your recent request, there are enclosed eight photographs and two negatives received from [redacted]. Also enclosed are four enlarged copies of the photograph and four copies of the News-Sentinel news item published in a July 1947 issue.

[redacted] when interviewed, stated that he photographed the unknown object from his home during the month of July 1947. He stated further that he forwarded a copy of the photograph to the Knoxville News Sentinel, Knoxville, Tennessee, for publication. [redacted] said he did not believe a photograph of the object to be of any interest to Security; therefore, he did make prints of the photographs a few months later, at which time he presented a number of them to his friends. [redacted] promised to recover as many prints as possible and forward them to this office. He did mention, however, that he would like, if at all possible, to have the negatives returned to him when available.

All photographs, when made available by [redacted] will be forwarded to your office.

If this office can be of any further assistance in this matter, please do not hesitate to call upon us.

Very truly yours,

G. J. Rathsman, Chief
Investigation Section
