19D OSI 24-14

DETAILS:

AT SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

1. On 17 and 18 July 1949, it was learned from the San Francisco Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) Office that there are 161 listed air carriers in the Bay Area. Only 14 of these have regularly scheduled flights and less than 1 per cent of the remaining file any kind of plan or clearance for their flights. A check with the Oakland Air Port and the San Francisco Air Port revealed that less than 1 per cent of the planes normally using these fields file any type of schedule or clearance.

2. On no occasion are more than 25% of these flights file no type of clearance and the majority of them are operating without schedule, it is learned individually to check on them in the vicinity of Gold Beach, Oregon, around 1700 hours, 24 May 1949. Such an operation does not seem feasible in view of the fact that many of the cities between the Bay Area and Gold Beach, Oregon, and north of Gold Beach could have had such a flight, and in all probability the large percentage of these had no flight plan or clearance filed.

2. On 13 July 1949, information was received from the Aerological Station and Forecast Center, U. S. Weather Bureau, San Francisco Air Port, South San Francisco, California, that weather report for the vicinity of Gold Beach, Oregon, for 24 May 1949, and this teletype sequence for same may be obtained at the Airways Communications Station, Medford, Oregon.

3. On 19 July 1949, a check with the Sixth Army and the Twelfth Naval District Intelligence revealed that those commands do not possess any radar installations in California or Oregon that are near enough or powerful enough to have recorded anything unusual at Gold Beach, Oregon, on 24 May 1949.

4. On 20 July 1949, a check of the Air Force Early Warning Radar Stations in the Bay Area revealed that these have insufficient range to have reached as far north as Gold Beach, Oregon. These stations reported nothing unidentified on 24 May 1949.
