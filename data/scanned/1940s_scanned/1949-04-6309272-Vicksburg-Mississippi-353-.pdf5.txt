of national interest will first be channeled through Public Information 
Office Headquarters, National Military Establisment[sic], prior to their being 
released, and as this policy is strictly adhered to by all PIO personnel

the article, as was Captain DE RECHTENDY, and that both had made commetary 
hur[h] determination that the article had been a Naval publicity release. FRIEDMAN
