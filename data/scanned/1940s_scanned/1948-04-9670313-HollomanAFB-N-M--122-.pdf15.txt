6. All agreed on the following: the object was very high, moved
faster than any known aircraft, possessed a rounded, indistinct form, and
disappeared suddenly rather than fading away in the distance. It was under
observation 1/2 minute or slightly less. It was definitely not a balloon
from its maneuvers of speed, judging from the violent maneuvers which were per-
formed at a high rate of speed.

7. Dr. ***** stated that he placed great credence upon these obser-
vations because all three men are trained aeronauts both optical and
radar an observation from airproximite seaillion obspyvre. He suggested
that both placed et Holloman Mr Service Branch order both optical and
radar to be on constant fixed radio and balloon observation. He also sug-
gested in the event of re-occurrence of such definite informa-
tion incidents of this type, that the station in the vicinity of this
