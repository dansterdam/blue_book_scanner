Incident #137 -- Pacific Ocean 19ยบ 03' N., 164ยบ 05' E -- 4 May 1943

The object observed here was probably an exploding fire-
ball seen head-on and seen only at the time of actual explosion.
This, with partial cloud cover, could easily explain the absence
of a trail.

It is not likely that it was situated on the water surface
or aircraft sighted later had any relation to the original object.

If the object had been a shell fired from the USS xxxxx,
it appears improbable that only one shell would have been observed.
