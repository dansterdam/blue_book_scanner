In roto photo people, 
Dlefft & Capt. Garner 
tried to show sthus rotation of sthus object 
to sthus light beam.

By sthe way, I sent sthe negs. from which 
two of sthese pictures were printed to a Col. 
B------ of Air Intell. Wash. D.C. in 1949. I 
recieved no answer and no negs in return.

The roto negation is in Cincinnati. I can't 
think of sthe mans name but if you want it 
a little inquiring can turn him up. Its also the 
movies of sthis object which may be very useful 
to you.

I feel sthis sthing was more Comm than 
befor we stumbled on it and that it is still 
there. Forward gladly, send out sthe soundlight 
and find it again for you if you so desire.

If you have any question re such othe 
information such as othe writances, and there 
are many of sthem, I will have to return to 
Cincinnati and dig sthem up â€“ For forgtten 
sthe name but can locate sthem quickly
