SYNOPSIS
Joseph, this is an initial report.

On 6 April 1949, this office received a memorandum from a reliable government agency concerning the alleged sighting of so-called "Flying Discs".  Informant says of persons reporting, alleged sighting of these objects indicated that they were alleged to have seen a so-called "Flying Disc" in the vicinity of' Dillon, Montana, at approximately 1150 hours, 3 April 1949, the object allegedly appearing at an altitude of approximately three to five thousand feet over the northern part of the City of Dillon, maneuvering about in several directions for several minutes and then rapidly disappearing over and beyond the mountains east of Dillon. The object was alleged to have been observed by four persons, whose accounts of its size, appearance and movements largely corroborated each other. The probability of the observers was regarded by responsible citizens of the community to be beyond a question of doubt.
