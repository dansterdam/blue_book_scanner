The Target Is the Moon

Most experts predict that the first pilotless guided missile will strike the moon within the next 10 years. When it does happen, the rocket may be launched as depicted in this artist's drawing. At 50,000 feet traveling 500 miles an hour, the moon-bound space ship leaves the back of its carrier plane. The Manhattan skyline is shown below.

Mystery Missiles Puzzle Far West

By Associated Press
PENDLETON, Ore., June 25—
A transport pilot's tale of nine mysterious objects, each
as bright as a new dime, whizzing
through the sky at 1,200 miles
per hour at 10,000 feet altitude, stirred much excitement today.

Kenneth Arnold, a flying Boise,
Idaho, businessman who reported
seeing the objects, also has stirred
much thinking by competent authorities on "flying saucers."

[illegible] the opinion of Edward J. Ruppelt, chief of the Air Force's project for investigation of unidentified flying objects—Project Blue Book—Arnold saw a formation of jet airplanes.

Arnold took off again today
from Pendleton on the first leg of
a hop to Boise. En route he was to
keep a watchful eye for his "nine shiny objects." When he landed here last night from Chehalis, Wash., Arnold described the objects which he said
he saw at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon for about three minutes, traveling south.

"They were bright—not silvery,
but more like highly polished silver," he said. "They didn't throw off any exhaust and had no tails. They were shaped like pieplates and were so thin I could barely see them."

Arnold related that he saw the
objects over Mineral, Wash., near Mount Rainier.

A check with the air force and
civil aeronautics authorities in
Portland, Seattle and Spokane revealed no high speed aircraft in that area at that time.
