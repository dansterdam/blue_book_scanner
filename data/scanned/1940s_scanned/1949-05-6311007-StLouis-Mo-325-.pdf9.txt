NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

It ------- stated in substance as follows: On the evening of 7 May 1949 at approximately 1900 hours CST he was sitting on the back lawn with his wife and they were watching the quails from the suspected pair when they noticed a strange object almost directly overhead. He -------- stated at first he thought it was a large bird, but closer observation disclosed to him that it was at a much higher altitude than a bird usually flies. He ------- further stated no sound emitted from the traveling object. It was some what tear-shaped in shape, and that its most outstanding attribute was the incredible co-estimate two altitude as the object at approximately nine (9) or ten (10) thousand feet. ----------- outlined an estimate on the speed, but stated it was approximately nine (9) or ten (10) seconds the object was being seen by him and the distance it went over was approximately four (4) or five (5) seconds and was faster than any airplane he has ever seen in the sky. He --------- described the object as being about the size of a rich ------ plane and had no closely resembled the shape of a Sting Ray fish the co-estimating the object had no sharp tail, and its major characteristic proved to the object as having a rail, dull mat finish color leading from blue-silver dull lead colot on the dorsal side of the object as it was oscillating. The -------- would observe this faint or reflection when the right side was higher in the -------------. He -------- stated that he first observed the object at about eleven (11) oâ€™clock, that it was at an angle of approximately eighty-five (85) degrees above the horizon, and that it was traveling in a south west direction. He ------- further stated that the object traveled in a straight path without apparently gaining or losing altitude, that it was oscillating from side to side, and that it disappeared in the atmosphere.

Mrs. --------, residence -----------, St. Louis, Mo., was interviewed regarding the sighting of a strange object in the sky on 7 May 1949. Her account substantiated the -------- version of the sighting of the object with the exception that she thought it was dull colored and thought there was reddish glow, somewhat like the glow of an iron coal stove, along the right edge of the object as it was oscillating through the sky. Both agreed that the sun had just gone down behind the trees, and that there was still quite a bit of light in the sky. Neither observed any fins, appendages, or antennas on the object.
