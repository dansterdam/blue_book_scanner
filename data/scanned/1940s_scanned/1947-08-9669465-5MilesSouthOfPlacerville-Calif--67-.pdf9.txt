Observer first noticed a wide smoke trail and while searching for its source
he saw an object a long to ft. in length 10 to 14 inches wide and of metal color
which gave off a very bright reflection like highly polished aluminum.
It was first observed at 1050 position to the automobile. Upon reaching a 1200
position it was engulfed in a puff of dark gray smoke about 10 ft in diameter.
There was a change in the color of the smoke. The object was traveling at a
terrific speed and seemed to be on a swallow dive. When the puff of smoke
appeared the object disappeared completely. No particles were observed falling
nor from it. Fire point of disappearance seemed to be about 800 yards in front
of Observer, the base was not possibly of being hidden by vegetation or terrain.
It appeared rectangular for the most part, but once it appeared to have a very
slightly curved top surface. It seemed more like a rocket than disc like.
It seemed, tilted in a semi circle.

NOTE:
Agent notes the point of observation would afford a sweeping view thru 400
of the canyon and the south side of Weber Creek.
Agent was not definite as to what part of the field of view he had seen the
object and indicated that it could have been as far as the horizon.).
No object, gas or particles therefrom visible. In the six square mile area of wooded
mountingnous terrain full of canyons and ravines.

Agent thought that witness could have seen a conventional type of air-
craft which due to the distance from which it was observed,presented no dist-
inguishing features for the short period it was observed, however agent could not
account for the smoke trail.
