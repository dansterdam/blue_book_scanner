Case #24-20

DETAILS:

1. Investigation predicated upon request of 20 #5, Wright-
Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.

TILLAMOOK, OREGON

2. On 11 April 1949, Mr. ------------------------, occupation mecha-
nic, was interviewed at his repair shop beside Hughes Grocery and Filling
Station, Pleasant Valley, Oregon; and at his home at Rt. 2, Box 188,
Tillamook, Oregon. ------- stated that at about 1100 hours, 24 January
1949, while driving south on Highway 101 below the Naval Air Station,
which is approximately 7 or more miles south of Tillamook, Oregon, his atten-
tion was attracted to a shiny object glinting in the sun. The object
seemed to be stationary, was a silver color, and seemed to have no distinct
shape. The map coordinates show the place of observation as latitude 45°
22' 17", and the longitude as 123° 41' 12". His statement may be 2 to 4
degrees in error. The object was approximately NW to the object
through the windshield (which was clean) at a 30 degree angle
from the ground. It seemed to be about 1/2 to 3/4 inch in size from his
view point, and the elapsed time that he was able to observe was 2 to
3 or possibly 4 or 5 minutes, during which time the object seemed to be
stationary. About 1 mile forward, his view was obstructed by trees
Pleasant Valley, about 7 miles away, and when last seen it appeared to
disappear over the hills to the southwest, but did not drop suddenly. The
object, when first seen, was estimated to be about 1 or 1 1/2 miles
away from the observer, and his eyesight was stated to be about 20/20.
It did not seem to move its entire size of observation, had no sound or
odor (F5 questionnaire asks this ruling), and could not have been dis-
tinguished from its motor, and had its side exposed to the sun, the effect
on him rather awe inspiring from its brilliance compared to that of his
cab light he had on. The size from the way he saw it, about 1/8 or less
of an inch in diameter, and that it resembled a balloon or soap bubble.
The weather was pleasant, no ground haze, clear, very good light;
there was not seen any clouds in the sky, the sun was setting; the
witness, wife ROSE, later confirmed that their home at Rt. 2, Box
188, Tillamook, Oregon, was about a half mile from their
It was noted that ---------- does not wear glasses, and in his work as a
mechanic he does a lot of welding with an arc welder, therefore
lost in the aged portions in the WAR, as he was deferred because of nerves.
However, he did drive, saw a million dollar insignia, or silver of brightness.

3. On 11 April 1949, ----------- father of ----, JOSEPH
--------, was interviewed at -----------------------------------;
Tillamook, Oregon; His home ---------------- Times is a small house he's
on lease or rent. Together with -------------- that a small UFO sighting
in January 1949 he was handling of fish on the little back-
yard hill, pulling up plants as disclosed in trees, he and
son was attracted to a silvery disc the size of a saucer and about
the size of the moon going, lightly over his head in a partial
