The photograph shows a landscape that includes a body of water with a landmass or hill in the distance. In the foreground, there appears to be some sort of settlement or developed area with buildings or structures indicated by silhouettes. The image is fairly dark and details are not clearly visible. The quality of the photograph suggests it may be old or may have been taken with early photographic technology.

Text present in the document is as follows:

- At the top left corner, the text "Blow-Me-Down Mtn." is handwritten and refers to the mountain in the image.
- In the top right corner, text "Blow-Me-Down Light" is handwritten, possibly indicating the name of the location or a feature in the photograph.
- Below the picture, the handwritten text reads "PETRIES N.F.L.D" which likely refers to the location Petries in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.
- Further text on the bottom of the page "2 A PR G 9 Dec 49 â†“ 282".
- The bottom right corner of the page has "UNCLASSIFIED" and "Appendix 28 A" also handwritten.

Since this is an old document and the quality of the image is quite poor, providing accurate optical character recognition of the handwritten text is challenging, yet the above are the discernible elements.
