There are two images present in the document. Both images appear to be simple, hand-drawn illustrations of objects. The top image depicts what seems to be a horizontally elongated shape with a dark shaded area on the top portion, while the bottom one has a similar shape but is completely filled in with a dark shade. Here is the text from the document:

Incident #149 - North Jutland - 15 January 1948

There is nothing in the major description of this
incident that precludes the possibility of the objects' being
meteors. The description would also allow for their being rockets.

However, the explosion of the objects favors the meteoric
hypo-
thesis.

It might be well to note the similarity of this and
other Scandinavian reports to the "green flash" objects reported
from New Mexico.
