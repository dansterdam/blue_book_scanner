dark in color. She went on to say that during the time the objects were
seen several airplanes flew across her field of vision while she ob-
served the objects, but that the presence of airplanes in the area did
not seem to have any effect on the actions of Subject objects.

Mrs. ------------------------- stated that at approximately 1900 hours she
had witnessed the black objects in the southeastern sky through field
glasses, and that they appeared to be too high to be birds, and that the
objects appeared to swoop and turn at a very high rate of speed. She
stated that the objects did not appear to maintain any set formation, but
that they did progress more in a northerly direction, disappearing into
the northeastern sky just before dark.

Mrs. ------------------------- stated that her husband called her from the porch
of her home at approximately 1845 hours and pointed out to her some objects
in the sky which he had been observing. She and her husband and a group of 
neighbors observed these objects until dark. Her -------------------- description of
the objects tallied completely with that of her husband.

Mrs. ------------------------- also stated that she observed objects in the sky
for about two hours, between 1830 and 2030. This ----------------- said her eyesight
was not good, and the objects appeared to be circling, stopping, appearing and
disappearing below a layer of strato-cumulus clouds.

first thought them to be birds. Closer observation made her realize that

clouds.

Mr. ------------------------- brother of -------------------- saw the same objects as
his sister. ---------------------------------- further stated that the next day, while on duty
on the third floor of the Accident Ward, John Hopkins Hospital, he over-
heard a conversation between three unknown doctors concerning objects they
had observed in the sky the afternoon before. ---------------------------------- stated that the
objects darted in and out of the clouds much too fast for birds, and that
it could not have been light flashes on the bottom of the clouds since he
saw a definite solid object.

------------------------- ------ -------------------- his wife ----------------------- age 12, 918 â€“ saw
groups of objects, in a triangular shape, darting in and out of the clouds
much too fast for birds. The clouds were light in color and the objects
were dark. These objects were observed for approximately two hours.

Mrs. ------------------------- ---------------------- -------------------- saw what appeared at
first to be a group of birds, but these objects were moving much too fast
in and out of the clouds. There appeared to be about -------------------- objects
In the group, at an altitude of about 200 from the horizon. -------------------
