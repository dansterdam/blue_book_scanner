The image that you've provided does not contain any photographs; it is a textual document, specifically a page likely from Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. I will now transcribe the text present in the document as if acting as an OCR system:
