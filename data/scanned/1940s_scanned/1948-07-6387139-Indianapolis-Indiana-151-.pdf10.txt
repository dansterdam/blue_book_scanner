Incident No. 151 â€“ 29 July 1948, 0955 hours, Indianapolis, In-
diana.
Two observers driving a truck saw an object shaped like a broad short
propeller traveling 25-30 MPH in a bank just above the treetops at thirty
feet altitude. It was eight foot long, two feet wide and one foot
thick, with "cups" on the upper sides of the blades. The object
glided with no spinning motion, and there was no sound or trail. The
object was thought to have fallen, but a search revealed nothing.

ATIC Opinion: No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.
