Guide to Investigation

Relative to Radar Sightings

1. No radars now operating on ground

   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size of target;
      No radar operating in this area at time object was observed.

   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180°), etc.
      and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable,
      how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed:

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several
      targets upon approach:

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent with
      size of object; faint; fading; pulsating at regular rate:

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually:

2. If airborne, when object was sighted;

   a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits:

   b. Give estimates of size, speed, manuvers, etc.:
