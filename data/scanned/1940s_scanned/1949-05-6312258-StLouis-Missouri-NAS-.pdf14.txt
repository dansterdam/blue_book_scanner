[Redacted] flying at approximately 5500 feet. Alt. [Redacted]
13 my Cariboul unloading at 1940 one of my passengers.

A cloud came overhead from the northwest at a very rapid rate about 40 degrees
When I asked a passenger point to it, he observed it at approximately 5000 Ft
aways headed approximately 170 degrees travelling at a terrific rate of speed.
The paint was dull, not shiny or leaf reflected on the body of the plane and
watched this object wondering why, if it was an airplane, it didn’t have any
running lights. I watched the object it started to suddenly shoot out
large sparks from the trailing and of same. I estimated it——-to look
and see the object seemed so disintegrated. There were no clouds in
this immediate vicinity as we were between two object from the plane back to
the North.

It seemed to appear as though it was lighted from the inside.
