AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Headquarters, Far East Air Forces              IR-266-49                             5            5

C E R T I F I C A T E

At approximatley 1530 hours on 23 August 1949, the undersigned 
observed a light or silver-colored rectangular object traveling at 
an estimated speed of 400 miles per hour.  This object did not re-
semble an aeroplane but appeared identical to a rectangular tow-
targer.

The object was traveling in a northerly direction at approximately
200 feet altitude or less and paralleling the coast line.  This
officer was about three miles from the object and observed it during
approximately five miles of travel.

This officer was in the company of Maj. _________and Capt.___________
the 49th Fighter Group Operations when this sighting was made.  Upon
my calling attention to this object, those three officers discerned 
the object immediately and all admitted a confused lack of recognition.

The object disappeared behind an R5D-1 parked on the ramp, shortly
thereafter, this officer noticed a local P-80 in the same vicinity at a
higher altitude and in the opinion of this officer there was no similarity
in appearance or lightness of color to the object in question.

                                                        /s/
                                                        1st Lt., USAF

I certify that I have read the statement of Lt. __________ and find 
the information correct and complete to the best of my knowledge.
