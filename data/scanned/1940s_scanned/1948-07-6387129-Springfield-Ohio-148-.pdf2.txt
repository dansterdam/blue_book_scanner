Incident #148 -- Springfield, Ohio -- 23 July 1948

The planet Venus seems to be the culprit in this incident.
Venus attained its greatest brilliancy in the morning sky on July 31,
and at approximately 0400 in the morning of July 23, it was a very
brilliant object slightly to the north of east. Its magnitude was -4.2,
which makes it about 100 times brighter than a first magnitude star.
Intermittent cloud coverage could easily explain the appearance and
disappearance of the object, and as to the stated size, this can be
dismissed as a purely subjective estimate. The evidence appears
convincing to this investigator that the object observed was Venus.
