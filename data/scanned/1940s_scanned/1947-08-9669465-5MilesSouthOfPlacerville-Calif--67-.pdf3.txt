Incident #67 -- near Placerville, California -- 14 August 1947

If details of the observers' statement are accurate, 
it would be difficult to assign an astronomical origin to the
object seen in this incident. There are a few statements which,
taken alone, strongly suggest that a meteor was observed: high
rate of speed, "seemed to be in a shallow dive," white smoke trail, 
"disappeared in a puff of dark gray smoke." However, unless the
description of the object (4-6 feet long and 14-14 inches wide)
and the estimated distance (less than 1000 feet)-are illusory,
this meteoric explanation will not hold.
