City Girl Sees 
Sky Phenomenon 

"Look!"

Doris Croak, 14, of 235 FIrst St. 
said just that last night at pre-
cisely 8 o'clock and she really
meant it. Doris said today she was
convinced she saw a blue tailed
comet.

A ninth grade student at North
Junior High School, Doris said
she was with two young friends
standing on the corner of Concord
St. and First St. when she looked 
into the north and saw "a ball of 
fire with a long tail. It lasted 
two seconds, shooting from east to
west, and going below the horizon.
It was as large as life. I have seen
shooting stars before but nothing
like this."

Doris also declared the astral
phenomenon was "a large red ball
speeding through the heavens."
She said her two friends Gladys
The "comet" and that a Gardiner 
town. girl friend said she, too, had 
seen it. "About 8 o'clock."
