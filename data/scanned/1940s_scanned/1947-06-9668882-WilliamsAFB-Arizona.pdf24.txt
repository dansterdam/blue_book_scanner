Incident #78 -- Grand Canyon, Arizona -- 30 June 1947

While it seems more probable that the objects sighted in this incident were freely-falling, man-made instruments, perhaps from bursted instrument balloons, the possibility of their being freely-falling meteorites is not completely ruled out. When the mass of an in-coming meteorite is of the proper order of magnitude, the meteor can come in on a non-vertical path, becomes a bright bolide, or fireball, and have its horizontal speed component reduced essentially to zero. It then falls to earth as a non-luminous, freely-falling body.
