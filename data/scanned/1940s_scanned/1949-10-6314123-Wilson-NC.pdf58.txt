UNCLASSI...

2 March 1948

Mr. Oscar Monnig
Secretary, National Meteorological Society
Fort Worth, Texas

Dear Sir:

I was acquainted with you some 16 years ago when I was a member of 
the Pentac Society under the direction of Mrs ____ of old Central High 
School. You were lecturing and holding star observation meetings at 
that time. I am writing this introductory letter as a personal note
rather than as an official piece of correspondence. I am requesting
that you keep the subject matter confidential, and assure you that any
correspondence you address to this Headquarters will be held in absolute
confidence. Please address reply to 

Commanding General
Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: Major M. W. Faulk (MCIA)

I am interested in the sighting of a supposed meteorite over Kansas
about two weeks ago. I gather from a news article that you will have
information regarding any fragments from this object. If you have knowl-
edge of the existence of these fragments, or of any technical information
concerning the meteorite, please write us and give the details. I plan
to be in Fort Worth for a visit to my home during the week end of 13 March
1948 and I will appreciate an interview with you at that time.

Remembering with pleasure your cooperation with our group of high
school students, I feel sure that you will respect my request that there
be no publicity concerning this investigation and that you will give us
whatever information is available to you.

Sincerely yours,

UNCLAS- (File 201-) 

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
