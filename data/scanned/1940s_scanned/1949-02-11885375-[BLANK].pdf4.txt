DISCUSSION

Organization of Data on Incidents

Approximately 243 domestic Incidents have been reviewed, at the present time. In each incident, the observers have been interrogated by investigators and the results have been analyzed by technical personnel.

Condensed summaries have been prepared for the list of incidents in sufficient quantity to make the basic information easily available to individuals or agencies having an authority or an interest in the project. (See Appendix A).

A detailed check list, compiled by technical personnel, indicating the basic elements of information, necessary for analysis of the individual incidents, has been prepared and distributed to appropriate government agencies.

In order to identify ordinary and conventional objects, that have probably been included in the list of reported incidents, graphical methods have been applied, so as to present the basic data in such form that overt fall facts, implicit in the grouped data, will be made apparent. (See Appendix B).

The prepared graphical data includes:

(a) Charts concerning unidentified aerial objects, to indicate:

1. Type of object observed
2. Vicinity in which particular type of object was observed
3. Direction of flight

(b) Locations of guided missiles, research and related centers

(c) Locations of airlines, airfields, both military and commercial.

(d) Locations of radio beacon stations

(e) Known or projected radar stations from which reports and assistance may be derived

(f) Meteorological stations from which balloon release data, radiosonde or theodolite readings may be obtained

(g) Past, current, and projected celestial phenomena

(h) Flight path of migratory birds
