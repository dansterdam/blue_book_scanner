UNCLASSIFIED

Object appeared to be moving up and down and from side to side. At one
time the object was covered by a cloud but the light could be seen thru the
clouds. It was the same color as a usual city very much brighter sometimes
changing to what seemed to be a green or greenish yellow. At first
it did not appear to be traveling at very wide. Then it seemed to go up and
down and sometimes changed off and go from side to side it went, seemed to be
a very great speed. It seemed pretty high in the air -- too high to be any
kind of a light from the ground. There was no beam. No sound could be
heard. A faint exhaust trail was discernible when it moved up or down or
from side to side. Finally it began to move away toward the SW at very great
speed and disappeared over the horizon at about 20:00.
