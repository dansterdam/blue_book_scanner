have produced by reflection from the overcast such apparently aerial noises
as were observed at Stations 340, 350, and 390 is uncovered, the facts set

and 2100 some sound producing source was in motion in or possibly beyond the
overcast above the Los Alamos area. Whether this could have been a conventional
airplane or not must be decided by those who have access to experience
and information not at the command of the undersigned.
