29 March 1949

Lieutenant Colonel M. J. Tarmstroth
Technical Intelligence Division
Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Field
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Colonel Tarmstroth,

In reply to your inquiry of March 24th, we had not planned to 
issue a formal report on project "sign" until or unless our 
study leads to some unusual or unexpected finding which would
throw new light on "flying saucers".

We are now working, though, to have a search of significant
correlations or other indirect pieces of evidence. It is 
expected that we shall have explored all our various avenues
of attack in about two months. To date we have found nothing
which would seriously contravert simple rational explanations
of the various phenomena in terms of balloons, conventional
aircraft, planets, meteors, bits of A.F. special illusions, 
practical jokers, psychophysiological reports, and the like.

We should like to take this opportunity to raise a few questions:
(1) Has it been decided just how this is a phenomenon, (2) apparently
unknown file to agencies. Is so what are the characteristic
or incidents like was continued from the date; why? (3) Has A.M.C
heard from a reliable source of an incident in which fisherman
observed flying objects which dropped material which slay
collected and subsequently given to official investigators. The
investigators' plane crashed but there was a survivor. We do not
seem to have a file or this incident - certainly not a complete
file. May we have one?

Sincerely yours,

/s/ A. J. Wood
