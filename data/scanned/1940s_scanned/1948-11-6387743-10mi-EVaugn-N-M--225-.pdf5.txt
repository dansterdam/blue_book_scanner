The following information has been received from the Fourth Army Intelligence 
Liaison Officer, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dated 6 December 1948.

"Colonel E.M. , Executine, New Mexico Military District
reports as follows: 

"On 3 or 4 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I observed a ball 
of light, reddish white in color, 1 foot in diameter, falling vertically. The 
ball burst 100-200 feet from the ground in a spray of reddish color with 
shower of sparks, which on touching the ground. This occurred abt 100 yards north 
of the main road which runs into Sandia from Albuquerque to a junction 
east of Vaughn, New Mexico, on Highway 60.

"On 25 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I was driving west 
on Highway 60, about 10 miles west of Vaughn, New Mexico, I observed a ball 
of light, descending vertically, which burst 100-200 feet from the ground. 
The conditions and appearance were the same as occurred on 3 - 4 November. 

"Colonel stated that he did not report was the incidents as he thought 
they might have been connected with Sandia Proving Grounds. A further 
check disclosed that no sound or saw no aircraft during either incidents, 
which is understandable as he was traveling in a closed automobile, weather 
conditions were clear."
