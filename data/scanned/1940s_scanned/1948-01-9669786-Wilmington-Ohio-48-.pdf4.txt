Around 1630 7 January, the P-51s in Kentucky were facing the object, whatever it was supposed to be. About 1635 one of them radioed up and conclusions were drawn by the men in the Lookoutama tower. This P-51 was stationed at Maldon Field and Flight Service at Patterson Field was giving Flight Service at Middletown a summary of what had taken place during the afternoon. It seems that the Observation period up again between Patterson Flight Service and Middletown Flight Service around 1945 and at this time Mr. ***** and Mr. ***** told Flight Service at Patterson Field what they had seen a few minutes earlier, i.e., around 1915 - 1930, with regard to this light and also at the same time Clinton County broke in on the conversation and told then they had seen the same thing, and by some manner of means Goodman Field got in on the conversation and told Flight Service they were observing the same phenomena - this happened at 1945.

The crack-up referred to was just something that was heard about over the inter-phone, but definite information regarding the light was given to Patterson Field Flight Service at 1945, 7 January.
