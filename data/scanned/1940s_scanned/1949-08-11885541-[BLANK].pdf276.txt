PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF REPORTS OF

UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS

The Inaccuracy of Human Observation

Psychologists have long know that human perception is fallible.
In fact, part of the science of psychology is concerned with the
measurement of errors of observation, and with the discovery of the
conditions and laws that govern such phenomena.

Errors of observation may be classified as variable or constant.
Variable errors are those in which a number of separate observations
are found to differ from one another. The distribution of such
errors often follows the normal probability curve. Constant errors
are those in which observations are consistently biased in one or
another direction. For example, individuals often are guilty of a
constant error, in the direction of underestimation, in reporting
their ages.

Errors of observation may be classified further as precision errors
and identification errors. Inaccuracy in estimating the speed of an
aircraft is an example of the former. Mistaking an aircraft for a
"flying saucer" is an example of the latter.

It is the purpose of the present report to analyze 212 reports of
observations of unidentified flying objects in order to see to what
extent these reports can be explained in terms of known psychological
facts and principles.
