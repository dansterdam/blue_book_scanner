The text of the document reads as follows:

With 12[XX] incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four 
which contain some evidence but have no apparent reasonable explanation.
This statement is true only under the assumption that the evidence is
accepted as reliable and accurate. When psychological and physio-
logical factors are taken into consideration, all of these incidents 
can be explained rationally, as pointed out by Rand Corporation and
in. Fitts of Air Materiel Command Aero-Medical Laboratory (See Appendixes
"E" and "G").

Air Material Command Aero-medical Laboratory (Dr. Paul M. Fitts
212 Incidents considered)

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the reports of 
unidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanations for re-
ports not otherwise explainable. Those errors in identifying real
stimuli result chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, and 
size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in this
report. These incidents form no pattern in regard to area of sighting,
type of object, or manner of operation. The reported details of si-ze,
color, that some sightings were influenced by earlier reports, and 
probably would not have been considered unusual or reported had there
been no publicity.

Summary of AMC Evaluation of Remaining Reports

VII. Summary of A/C Evaluation of Remaining Reports

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix "III") exhibited
few common characteristics. Two of them, by statements of the reporters,
would not have been made if the witnesses not read of the Mt. Rainier
incident (Incident No. 17). Most were distributed without pattern
throughout the United States. A few were outside the U. S. Two
descriptions of appearance or performance were exactly alike. The re-
ported sightings occurred at various times of day and year.

APPENDIX I

In the following section of this report, each remaining unexplained
incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to generally discredit
the character of observers, but the case has undesirable elements, and those
cannot be disregarded. The numerical designation is merely the categorical
order of the incident in the project files.
