SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

The following information has been received from the Fourth Army Intelligence Liaison
Officer, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dated 31 January 1949:

"1. Another unidentified lighted flying object was observed over New Mexico on
30 January 1949 at about 1755 hours.

"2. This object approached over the eastern horizon at approximately 6 degrees.
The speed was North to South. Speed has not yet been estimated. No noise was
heard groan that one observer near Roswell reports a whistling sound. Color
description vary from red changing to bluish green or wholly blue green. Some
observers stated the size as being one fourth to one half the size of the moon as
ordinarily observed in the sky.

"3. At least one hundred reports of observation have been received. Those
reports are from Los Alamog in the north to as far as T or C in the south. The
newspapers and radio have featured the observation as a news item.

"4. Dr. Lincoln Lapaz of the University of New Mexico is interviewing as many
of the observers as possible. He has interviewed 13 enlisted men at Sandia Base
today. He is also taking transit readings for direction and any azimuth.

"5. Further reports will be submitted as more information is received at this
office."
