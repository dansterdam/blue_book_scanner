SYNOPSIS
Investigation requested by Commanding General, Air Material Command,
Wright-Patherson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. An unidentified airborne lighted
object with pulsating light, bluish-green in color, round and the approximate
size of an automobile wheel was sighted in the vicinity of Orlando Air Force Base,
Orlando and Winter Park, Florida, by 5 Air Policemen and 3 Civilian Policemen
sometime between the hours of 0115 and 0200, 31 January 1949. A total of 8 points
of observation located within a radius of 7 miles report this object to be
between 2000 and 4575 above the horizon and the line of general Southwesterly direction
all aircraft departing this area, begin thier flights. On observer stated
this object was "crazy", spanking along-spanking in a manner that a boat makes bailing
in calm water. Speed of the object was reported to be less than the expected plane
aircraft approaching land, too "Extraneously fast". All observers reported that
no fire or smoke trailed the object. The color of this object was basi-
whally green in color. Two of the observers reported the object as leaving a slight
halo in approximating its end, no "Extraneously fast". All observers reported that
no fire or smoke trailed the object. The color of this object was basi-
whally green in color. Two of the observers reported the object as leaving a slight
halo in approximating its end, no "Jet Was reported to be from that of a light
aircraft. One source of the object was really fast". All observers reported that
there was no sound, odor, projectiles or trail to the object. However, one person
who did not observe this object, advised that shortly after the approximate times
the observation he smelled a peculiar odor similar to that of garbage burning in
an incinerator in the vicinity of Orlando Municipal Airport. All observers
reported that object did not appear to go below the horizon but was lost to sight
when it went behind buildings or trees in line of vision. The flight path was
described by most of the observers as generally straight and level with a slight
angle of assent. One observer reported a slight dip and curry in the flight
path and another reported an s motion. Periods of observation varied from 3 to 90
seconds. During the reported flight of this object over Orlando and vicinity the
weather was clear, stars were out, there was no moon or clouds and all observers
had good visibility. All observers are regarded as reliable, did not wear eye
glasses, and with the exception of 2, who viewed the object through automobile
windshields
