NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
AT MAPLEWOOD, OHIO

Mrs. ------      of Maplewood, Ohio was interviewed on 18 May
1949 and she stated that at approximately 1630 hours, 4 May 1949, while she
was working in the garden of her farm which is approximately three miles
northwest of Port Jefferson, Ohio and four and a half miles west of Maplewood,
Ohio, she was attracted by the sudden glare of an unidentified object. The
object reflected very bright lights when the sun hit it and it was whirling
and traveling through space at a great rate of speed. The object appeared
to be six inches diameter, a bright, silver color and had a flat round or
flat oblong shape. Mrs. ------ sighted the object at a high altitude, travel-
ing northeast. The object appeared to be between her farm and Port Jeffer-
son. The object was in sight for less than two minutes and disappeared by
fading out in the sky. The object did not make any sound or leave any
trail. The weather was clear, no wind was blowing and no planes were in
the vicinity at the time the object was in sight. No photographs were
taken of the object.
