Incident #165, a - Chamblee, Georgia - 23 July 1948

The object reported in incident #165 and USAF (which
presumably refers to this case file) can be easily explained as
having been a very bright meteor. The majority of observers
agree that the object did not maneuver, was on a steady course, 
and lost altitude slowly. 

Numerous other reports coincided with incident #165, 
from the vicinity of Augusta, which are widely divergent as to 
time, direction of motion, and color of the object, all appear
to refer to a bright meteor. It may be significant that
reports all describe the object of incident #165, it. It could
be, of course, that the state of Georgia was treated to several 
fireballs in one evening, but it seems more likely that we have
here an example of serious dispersion in the description of one 
object.
