14. A suggestion was made that persons might possibly be observing 
a split beam used for advertising by Universal Motors, Inc., 29th and 
Reisterstown Streets, Baltimore, Maryland. On 7 July 1949, Universal Motors 
was contacted telephonically and it was ascertained that the beacon had 
not been operating during this period of time.

15. On 10 July 1949, [REDACTED] Tilmont Court, was 
again interviewed and the following additional information obtained:

      [REDACTED] mentioned in the U. S. Air Force on 10 January 1942 and 
was discharged from the Fort Dix, New Jersey, Separation Center on 
5 October 1945. He was born 13 October 1922.

      The possibility of the objects seen by [REDACTED] being flashes of 
light on the bottom of the cloud was discussed. [REDACTED] again flatly de-
nounced any such theory and insisted that he had seen objects as described 
in his previous interview.

16. On 10 July 1949, an attempt was made to contact doctors in the 
Accident Ward of John Hopkins [Hospital], Monument [Street], Bal-
timore, Maryland, concerning the report made by [REDACTED] [between all 
doctors on duty in the Accident ward was this] interviewed concern-
patients, and no information concerning this investigation was revealed. 
It was suggested that this investigator, who learned through the Office of 
the Director, John Hopkins Hospital, that some information might be 
obtained through that office as to doctors on the third floor on 25 June 
1949 between the hours of 1630 and 2000.

17. On 11 July 1949, Special Agent [REDACTED] contacted [REDACTED] 
of the Aerial Insecticide Fumage Corporation, Catonsville, [Maryland]. [Mr.
[REDACTED] stated, in substance, that between the hours of 1930 and 2015 on 
29 June 1949, his company had a Steerman, [N]-1[?79V], towing a thirty-letter 
sign. The sign on the banner read, "Drink Big Boy Gunthers". This sign was 
flown from an altitude of 1,000 to 1,700 ft., and circled over the north-
east part of Baltimotre. The Steerman was accompanied by a silver aero-
coupe which maintained radio contact with the ground and 
of Radio Station W[?][?]. The Steerman was flown by [REDACTED] 
Catonsville.

18. On 12 July 1949, this Agent interviewed [REDACTED] 
Catonsville, Maryland, who stated, in substance, that he was flying a 
Steerman, [N]-1[?79V], towing a 180-foot banner on a 350-foot rope behind 
the plane. Each letter in this sign is 7' by 4'. He did not know what 
area he was flying, as he was in radio contact with a silver aerocoupe 
owned by the Atlantic Aircraft Division of the Municipal Airport. He saw 
no strange objects while in the sky and had heard nothing concerning this 
matter.
