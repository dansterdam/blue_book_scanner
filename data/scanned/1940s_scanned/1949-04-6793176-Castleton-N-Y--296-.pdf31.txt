The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a report featuring a map key or legend with symbols representing various relief features and man-made structures. Due to the quality and angle of the photo, not all the text is legible. However, I will reproduce what can be discerned:

```
RELIEF FEATURES

MACHURES
SAND AREA & SAND DUNES
SAND RIDGES
LAVA FLOW

CONTOUR & SPOT ELEVATION
APPROXIMATE CONTOUR
DEPRESSION CONTOUR

RAILROAD
RAILROAD RUNNING THROUGH CUT
RAILROAD ON FILL
TUNNEL (RAILROAD)
RAILROAD OVERPASS
RAILROAD UNDERPASS

HIGHWAY
HIGHWAY INTERCHANGE AREA
HIGHWAY INTERCHANGE RAMP
HIGHWAY ON BRIDGE STRUCTURE

``` 

The left side of the document is obscured by a dark vertical strip, making any content there illegible. The top of the document seems to contain very faint graphical symbols which are part of the legend but are not distinct enough to reproduce accurately with OCR.
