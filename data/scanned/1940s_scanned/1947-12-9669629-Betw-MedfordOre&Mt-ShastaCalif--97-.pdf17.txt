There are no photographs present on this page from the UFO report document of Project Blue Book. The page consists of text with a significant portion being unreadable due to the poor quality of the scan and some handwritten markings at the top. The text cannot be accurately transcribed due to its illegibility. However, there is a handwritten note at the top that might read "877C", and the word "UNCLASSIFIED" is visible towards the upper right corner of the page. There's also a curved line at the bottom of the page, which does not seem to be related to any photograph or text, it might be part of the document or could be a scanning artifact.
