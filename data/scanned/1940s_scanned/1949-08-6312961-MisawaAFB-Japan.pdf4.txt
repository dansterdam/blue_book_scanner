The document appears to be part of an investigation report from Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. The diagrams illustrate the sighting of an object and the flight path of an aircraft, possibly in relation to a UFO sighting observation.
