NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Mrs. ---- appeared to be a person of average intelligence and reliability.
A neighborhood check revealed that Mrs. ----is well liked in that neighborhood, 
and is considered to be an average person and not very likely to exaggerate or imagine
things. The description of the flying object by Mrs. ---- is very similar to that
made by Mrs. Flying Object." Mrs. ----- this office, dated 23 May 49, and to the
"Unidentified Flying Object" article appeared in this office, dated 25 May 49, each of her
observation until a newspaper article appeared about her --- had told him seeing a "Flying
Disc". The ---- then called Mrs. ---- and told her she too had seen a "flying
Disc". The close similarity of the two descriptions, with the exception of the dates
sighted, may have been partly caused by the two informants talking their observations
over on the telephone prior to being interviewed.
