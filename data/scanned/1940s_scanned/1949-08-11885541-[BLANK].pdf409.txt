Incident #47 -- Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California -- 3 Jul. 1947

This incident cannot be readily explained astronomically.
The object was in sight too long to be a meteor, and the variable "reflection" and absence of any statement about trail also argue against that interpretation. It is difficult; however, to rule out the hypothesis completely, because of the lack of pertinent information and the ever-present possibility that the reporting was more subjective than objective.
