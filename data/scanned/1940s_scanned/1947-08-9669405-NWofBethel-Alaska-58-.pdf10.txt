Incident 568 -- NW of Bethel, Alaska -- 4 August 1947 

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.
The time in sight (four minutes) and rate of speed (520 MPH) seem
to preclude any such possibilities.

The similarity of this incident to #10, in which several
objects were seen silhouetted against a sunset, is striking.
