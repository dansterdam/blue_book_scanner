Witness observed two bright light in the sky southwest of Clinton County Air Base which appeared to be the complete we of an aircraft on fire. When viewed thru field glasses from control tower the object would gain and lose altitude very rapidly within bounds firmly discernable thru known air backward motion. At times it changed colors (from red to green, etc) the overcast. At approximately 19:45 the object but its light penetrated thru field on a heading of 210° and disappeared over the horizon at approximately 19:53. (1st acct)

At the time of the sighting the weather was clear over the Base, with a SouthWest wind which was moderate. There was an overcast in the SE which appeared to be a layer approximately 10000 feet thick. The height of the overcast was approximately 5,000 ft. 15,000 seemed to be about 5 miles from the field at an altitude of from Object to 20,000 ft. The object which appeared to entirely up at intervals to the object were of an airplane on fire. No beam of light was projected. After observing it with the naked eye for some five minutes, we wnts under control tower and looked thru field glasses and then decided that it was not a comet or a falling star to this sense of destruction. With the aid of the glasses the object appeared to go from an altitude of 15,000 to 10,000 feet without any noticably forward or backward motion, and then back up to its original altitude very rapidly. This occurred some 3 or 4 times. When it moved a red light would dominate and change to a green light and then back to its oriđiel color. It then started to recede on a heading of 210° going behind the overcast. However, the light was discernible thru the overcast. It then moved very rapidly away, stopping momentarily for 3 or 4 minute intervals and then disięppearing over the norison at 19:55. No sound was heard. No photographs were taken (from a signed statement (second account)
