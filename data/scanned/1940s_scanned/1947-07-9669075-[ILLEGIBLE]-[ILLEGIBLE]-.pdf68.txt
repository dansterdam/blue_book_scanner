Incident #22, a -- Hamilton Field, California -- 29 July 1947

The objects observed here were almost certainly not astronomical, although their speed, size, and manner of disappearance might tend to the aircraft hypothesis. The lack of trail and the "tactics" pursued by the second object make the likelihood of that interpretation very slight; however, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out if considerable allowance is made for looseness in reporting.
