UNCLASSIFIED

a sky phenomenon which had the appearance of a flaming red cone trailing
e eeeeeous green mist appeared in the southwest skies of Wilmington, Ohio,
between 7:20 and 7:55 P.M. EST, Jan. 7, 1948.

The sky phenomena hung suspended in the air at intervals and then gained
and lost altitude at what appeared to be terrific bursts of speed. The
intense brightness of the phenomena pierced thru a heavy layer of clouds
passing intermittently over the area and obscured other celestial phenomena.
