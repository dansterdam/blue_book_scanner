Incident #5 -- Maroo, California -- 7 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation of this incident.

In this investigator's opinion, there is nothing in the
evidence offered that is basically contradictory to the hypothesis
of a weather balloon. Perhaps ascending currents of warm air over
the desert could give the illusion that the object was oscillating.
