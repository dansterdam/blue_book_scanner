STATEMENT BY OBSERVER:
               I was returning from Station 101 to Station 100.

               While on the straight strip of road adjacent to the airstrip I happened
               to glance toward the north at which time I observed a greenish colored light mov-
               ing across the northern sky toward the east. It was traveling on a course parallel to the surface of the
               earth. It was visible for approximately two seconds.
               It did not appear to travel beyond my range of vision,
               but suddenly disappeared as I was watching it. It
               did not leave a trail in the sky nor did it appear to have a tail, like a meteor.

Due to the very short time that it was visible I am unable to estimate the rate of speed or altitude of the object.
