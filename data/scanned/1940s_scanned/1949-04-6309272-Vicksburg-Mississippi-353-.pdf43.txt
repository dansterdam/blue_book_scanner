"On April 22, 1949, as well as I can remember, about 12:15, I
got out of a cab at Clay and First Streets, and I looked up and saw a
Flying Object shaped like a triangle and it was dimmed lighted, traveling
at a fast rate of speed, traveling faster than the average plane.
It looked like to be 1 ft long and it was high in the air. It was
traveling east. See drawing at bottom of this page, I couldn't esti-
mate the height or speed.
