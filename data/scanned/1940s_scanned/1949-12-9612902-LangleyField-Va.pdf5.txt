UNITED STATES AIR FORCE

1 January 1949

SUBJECT: Sighting of unfamiliar object over Andrews Air 
Base by Cpl. ██████, 113th Control Squadron,
District of Columbia Air National Guard.

TO Headquarters
   Air Material Command
   The Pentagon
   Washington, D. C.

1. On December 31, 1949 I was at Andrews Field 
observing Colonel ██████ make preparations to take off
in a jet plane. I happened to look directly overhead and
saw an object floating—it seemed—leisurely in and out among
the clouds. When it tilted toward the sun it appeared to be
a huge sheet of tinfoil. I kept my eye on it and suddenly
realized that it was travelling at a terrific rate of speed
in a southeasterly direction. I am certain that had the object
been grounded it would have been the size of the National
(Guard hangar).

2. I have hesitated to divulge this incident.
However, I can assure you that it is absolutely true; I have
never had hallucinations. I dismissed the incident from my
mind at first, thinking that it was probably an object sent up by
meteorologists. The more I thought of its size and the 
height it was from the ground, however, the more significance
I attached to it.

Very █████████ yours,
█████
Cpl. ██████
113th Aircraft Control Squadron
District of Columbia
Air National Guard
