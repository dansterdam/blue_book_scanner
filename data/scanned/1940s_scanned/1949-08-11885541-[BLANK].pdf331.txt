Incident No. III â€” 1 April 1947, 0955 Hours, Central Philippines.
An F-47 pilot leading three other aircraft at 1500 ft saw an object approximately three miles away at 1000 ft. Object appeared to be a flying wing thirty by twenty feet, silver in color. The pilot turned to intercept the object and in five seconds or more the platinum colored object turned distant into the object too. Object appeared to have a dorsal fin but from size was too great to note any other features. The report does not reveal whether any of the other pilots saw the object.

AFC Opinion: No definite explanation. However, every pilot has experienced the sensation of seeing an aircraft obliquely at nearly the limit of vision and then losing sight at the same range when the aircraft presented, in storm view, a smaller surface.
