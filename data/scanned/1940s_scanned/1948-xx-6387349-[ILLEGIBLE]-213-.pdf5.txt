5. Comparison of the spectrographic data obtained for the soil and the various portions of the residue was made. On the basis of the relative amounts present, zinc, magnesium, sodium, led., and cadmium are the elements which appear to be most significant.

6. None of the submitted exhibits gave any indication of the presence of radioactive materials when tested by means of a Geiger counter (Cyclotron Specialties Model 310A) or ionization chamber type radiation survey meter (Technical Lab SL-1).

C. CONCLUSIONS:

7. The exhibits contained zinc, magnesium, sodium, and lead which are typical constituents of flares and other exploding devices.

D. RECOMMENDATIONS:

None - data merely submitted.
