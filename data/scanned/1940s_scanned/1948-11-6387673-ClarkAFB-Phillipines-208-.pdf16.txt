Incident: 208

The object sighted by the two fighter pilots had the appearance
of a flak burst sitting still in the atmosphere and was connected
to a curved trail of corkscrew appearance (See drawing attached)
The trail was from 1 to 10 miles in length and did not have the
appearance of a vapor trail but rather that of a rocket or jet
exhaust. Altitude was judged to be 30,000 ft. The mass and trail
disappeared within approximately three minutes. The mass appeared
white in color like an exhaust trail which had a sudden burst
origin and then tapered off to nothing. Both parties remarked that
it appeared as if an aircraft had exploded and left a white smoke
column. The vapor substance dissipated in approximately 3 minutes
scattering thinly like smoke through the atmosphere. It is firmly
believed by both witnesses that the object was not a cloud because
of its shape and because the sky in the vicinity was cloudless.

Evaluation: C-3
