Thus even if the effect were large enough to use it would still be unreliable and unpredictable.
METHOD III. Support of an Electrically Charged Object by Causing it to Move Transverse to the Earth's Magnetic Field.
A positively charged body moving from West to East, or a negatively charged body moving from East to West will experience an upward force due to the Earth's magnetic field.
A sphere 10 meters diameter moving at a speed of one kilometer/second would experience an upward force of one pound at the equator if charged to a potential of 5 x 10^12 volts. This is obviously ridiculous.
METHOD IV. ANTI-GRAVITY SHIELD.
It has been proposed, by various writers, perhaps first by H. G. Wells, that it might be possible to construct a means of shielding a massive body from the influence of gravity. Such an object would then float. Recently there appeared in the press a notice that a prominent economist has offered to support research or such or otherwise.
Obviously, conservation of energy demands that considerable energy be given the supported object in order to place it on the shield. However this amount of energy is in no way prohibitive, and therefore it can be gotten back when the object lands.
Aside from the fact that we have no suggestions as to how such a device is to be made, the various theories of general relativity all agree in assuming that gravita[tional] force and force due to acceleration are indistinguishable, and from this assumption the theories predict certain effects which are in fact observed. The assumption therefore is probably correct, and a corollary of it is essentially that only by means of an acceleration can gravity be counteracted. This we can successfully do
