The document features three sketched images under the captions "First View," "Second View," and "Third View." 

The "First View" sketch appears to depict a classic flying saucer shape viewed from the side, somewhat elliptical in shape with a dome on top. 

The "Second View" sketch shows the same object from directly underneath or above, illustrating a circular shape with a center spot, possibly representing the dome.

The "Third View" sketch presents the object at an angle where both the circular bottom and the side with the dome can be seen, providing a three-dimensional perspective.

mately the size of an average score? or foom light, and they were
illuminated for about one minuts. The flare remaind stationary,
one near the lower right and the other near the lower left of the
object. Two thin larmed yellow and were horizontal. First they 
radiated their two foot? while the were extinguished, that the 
under the object the light had formed a hase ground thro phenomena,
making it difficult to see it clearly. When the flares were ex-
tinguished a sphere dropped from the object and settled directly
underneath it. This sphere was a brilliant white and about one-
fifth the size of the setting sun. The object and sphere then
apperead to rise and both disappeared into the clouds. I can re-
call nothing further concerning this incident.

Agent's Note: Soyo drew the following sketches:

[Sketches of the object in three different views]

Soyo stated that he was misquoted by the Ohio State Journal of
August 1949, in that he did not say he had seen a "Space Ship."
(See par 1.) appeared to the undersigned to be extremely 
happy that he was being questioned by a Government employee regard-
ing his alleged discovery of unidentified objects. He appears to 
be highly imaginative and while answering questions, answered in
intervals.
