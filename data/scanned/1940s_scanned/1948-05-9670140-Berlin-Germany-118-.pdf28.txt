12 January 1948

Subject: Compiled Report Concerning 
Major Accident of Capt. 
T.E. Mantell, Jr. On 7th Jan.
1948 at 15:18 CST.

TO: Whom it May Concern.

1. This report will be informal and 
fragmentary but it is accurate to the best
of my knowledge. The mission of the transport
was to fly four F-51 pilots, volunteer pilots
of the group, to Marietta Army Air Base, where 
they were to pick up four new F-51's that were
left there because of weather, 30 December 1947. 

2. Upon arrival at Marietta, the four P-51's 
were preflighted by mechanics from there on the
base under direction of the group. Capt. Kottell 
flew a P-51 airplane to Standiford Field at
Louisville. The flight he took off and watched
the formation and proceed north in formation at 
about 4:00 feet. 

3. Upon the arrival of our C-47 at Standiford
at 1515 CST on 7 January 1948 we were met by
mechanics who told us about flying objects,
and that our P-51’s were after something red 
that is all we gathered. In operations about 
1740 CST, a phone call was received asking if we
would get the Third Air Force, near Franklindale,
the pilot Kottell. 

4. At 1732 CST a crack in the clouds to the 
southeast so I ordered a green flare fired to get
the pilots to return from the chase. 
5. At 1750 [unreadable line]

not followed so Capt. Hixson and I too [rest of text is unreadable]
