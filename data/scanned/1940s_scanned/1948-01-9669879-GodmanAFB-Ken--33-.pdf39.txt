STATEMENT OF LT PAUL I ORNER (cont'd)

NG300 gassed up and got more oxygen and flew a second mission on
the same heading of 210째 to a position of about 100 miles south of
Godman Field to an altitude of 33 thousand feet and did not sight the
object. At about 1545 CST when NG300 reported, not seeing the object I
left the Control Tower.

At about 1735 CST I returned to the Control Tower and a bright light
different than a star at a position of about 240째 azimuth and 0째 elevation
from the Control Tower. This was a round object. It seemed to have a
dark spot in the center and the object moved north and disappeared from
the horizon at a point 250째 from the Tower. The unusual fact about this
object was the fact that it remained visible and glared through the haze
near the Earth when no other stars were visible and did not disappear
until it went below the level of the Earth in a manner similar to the
sun or moon setting. This object was viewed and tracked with the Weather
Station theodolite from the hangar roof.
