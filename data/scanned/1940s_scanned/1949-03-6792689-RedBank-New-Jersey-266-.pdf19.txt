NARRATIVE REPORT
  On Friday, 4 March 1949, at about 2:30 P.M., I and three other employ of Watson Laboratories were looking skyward at an approaching B-29, when my attention was attracted to a snow white disc-like object whlch appeared at that moment to be under the port wind of a B-29. I called it to the attention of th other fellows with me and they saw it, too.

  The object was moving to the left of the plant and, wheeling to the right, it disappeared into space. I had the impression that it was moving under its own power. The total time of observat'on was approximately one minute. We all agreed that it was different from anything we had ever seen in the sky before.
