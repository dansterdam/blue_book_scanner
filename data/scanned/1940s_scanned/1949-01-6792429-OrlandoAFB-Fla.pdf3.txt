The second illustration is a comic strip-like drawing located at the bottom left of the page. It depicts a figure looking up at an object in the sky with the captions "IT'S A BIRD! IT'S A PLANE..." implying surprise or confusion about the unidentified flying object.

St Petersburg Times 2 February 1949

Saucers Again
That high-speed bugaboo of the airways, the flying saucer, has now scared the bejabbers out of two town visitors . . the newest eye tale the beady after The Times reported that up-
county people had seen the saucers . . yesterday Mrs. M. C. Bonner and Mrs. Mary Jackson,
Daytona, on Missouri, staying at 
171Â½ Gulf Boulevard, w e r e 
frightened by the same thing
... encountered to early reports
they claim the disk was about
the size of a waste paper basket, seemed to be traveling very
low right past the windows.

and then it shot up into the air
over the bright green in colors
said it was Gulf . . . the ladies
and "shot fire"... both said
they saw it while in the sunroom
of their beach residence . . .
where it will all end, knows no
one... "Exhibit "F"
