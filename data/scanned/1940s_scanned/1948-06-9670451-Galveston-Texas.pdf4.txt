The image you've provided appears to contain hand-drawn sketches rather than photographs. There are two sketches that seem to represent different views of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The first sketch on the left is labeled "Top view" and it depicts a dome-shaped object with a protrusion on the top. The sketch on the right appears to show a side profile of a UFO with a more ellipsoidal shape and a line through the center, which could be representing either a division or a feature such as a ridge.

Below the sketches, there is handwritten text. Here is a transcription of the text:

Top view

This is about all of the information 
that I could supply you. But
I still don't believe what I saw

Sincerely yours,

[Redacted]
Beaumont, Texas.
