UNKNOWN SUBJECT 24-1121

approximately that of the diameter of the nearby smolo stack; color was
thought to have been silver. During period of observation, estimated to
have been one minute, the objects were thought to have been moving away
from the observer until they faded into the distance. ****** thought
the objects had a thin stream of flame one-half its vertical magnitude,
and one times its horizontal length, extending from its top. No projections
of any sort were noted; no accompanying sounds were heard. Weather was
evaluated as relatively clear with slight haze.

5.  On 2 Oct 1949 the site of the Hamilton Helicopter Assembly Shop,
BOAC Terminal, Baltimore Municipal Airport, was visited, but observance
suggested the Hamilton Company no longer existed in that location. Sub-
sequent inquiry in the area suggested this concern had moved to a downtown
location several months ago; that the nearest helicopter concern, actively
engaged in flying, was in Delaware. No knowledge of the Hamilton Heli-
copter having flown in this area recently was known.

6.  On 3 October 1949 *****, **** Center, 
Camp Holabird, Md, was interviewed and stated in substance:

             Upon leaving the post in his car at about 1525 hours, 30
September 1949, when the JP on duty called his attention to two (2) objects
hovering to the right of the smoke stack of the Chevrolet Assembly Plant,
approximately one thousand (1,000) yards S!' the Main Gate Guard House
on Holabird, Ave. **** described the objects as being about 36 inches in
diameter, circular in shape, which appeared to be directed toward him at
an angle of about 30 degrees from the horizontal; slightly convex and having
concentric circles impressed upon the surface facing him. They appeared
to be made of a vapor or gas of a silvery color, translucent and reflected
light. The source of light (sun) was to the left (south) of the objects.
The objects were not moving and there was no indication of smoke, flame,
or locomotive power. They hung in a stationery manner during the two
minutes period of **** observation. The weather was clear with no
noteable haze or industrial smoke.

7.  On 3 Oct 1949 the records of the Civil Aeronautic Authority
Patrol, Municipal Airport, Baltimore, Md. were examined and the record of
the airport traffic controller (tower-operator) for the period, 0800 to
1600 hours, 30 Sept 1940 read as follows: "....UFR weather entire period.
Operations normal."

8.  Investigation in the immediate area of this reported activity
failed to reveal any apparent cause or source for this phenomenon.
