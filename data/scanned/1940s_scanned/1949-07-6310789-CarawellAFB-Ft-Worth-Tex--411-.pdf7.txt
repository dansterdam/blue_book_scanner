STATEMENT

On 24 July 1949 at approximately 2030 hours, I saw what 
appeared to be seven dull lighted objects in a type "V"
formation slightly to the West moving very rapidly from South
to North. The distance between lights apparently did not
change during the time they were visible, which indicated that
they might have all been on a single object. This formation
of lights was visible for only four or five seconds and finally
faded away into the Northern sky.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to 
the best of my knowledge:
