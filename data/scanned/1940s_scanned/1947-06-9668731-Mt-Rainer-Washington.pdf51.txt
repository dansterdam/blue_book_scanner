U - Persons in 7 states including the Lieutenant Governor of Idaho
today reported they had seen the mysterious "flying saucer".

The projectiles variously described as "too fast for an airplane not
fast enough for a falling star," "not moving at all" and "traveling at great
speed", were reported seen last night streaking over Denver.

It was the first report of the saucers in almost a week. Persons in
Oregon, California, New Mexico, and Idaho reported seeing various versions
of the unexplained projectiles.

Lt. Governor ---------- of Idaho --------- said today that he saw a
strange "coute-like object hanging in the western sky June 24. That was the
day newspapers of Boise, Idaho first reported seeing the projectiles
over southeast Washington. ---------- said the object he and 3 other witnesses
saw "didn't move but just seemed to go below the horizon with the rotation
of the earth."

At Denver, ----------- and ---------------- said they caught a brief
glimpse of a group of "bright objects" flying at about 5,000 ft. last night.

WASHINGTON - Army research experts can't explain the flying saucers
but they are investigating, they said.

At first, army officers laughed off the reports, now they are beginning
to take them seriously. At any rate, the air research center at Wright Field,
Ohio is looking into the reports and all service intelligence agencies are
at work on them.
