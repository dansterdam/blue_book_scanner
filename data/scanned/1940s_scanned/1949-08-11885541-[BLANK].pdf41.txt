Incident #102 -- air near Green River, Utah -- 19 February 1949

It seems entirely probable tiist the object observed in
this incident and in #103 was the air-rorester meteorite seen at an 
earlier part of its trajectory. 

The direction of flight is stated as "southeast of 
Limon, Colorado." If this means that the object was heading 
southeast from Limon, it could not have been the aircoroster fire-
ball, since the direction of flight of that object was northeast; 
but if the statement merely means that the object was seen in the 
vicinity southeast of Limon, the location is consistent with the 
trajectory of that famous meteorite.

The time stated is approximate, and need not be given
too much concern,. Actually, of course, the sightings here would
have had to be made almost simultaneously with those in Kansas.
If the time had been reported as 1600 lst. instead of 1500 (a
typographical error, by any possibility?), then, allowing for
the difference of one hour in time zones, the sightings would
have been approximately simultaneous.

In any event, whether this was the same or another oh-
ject is not important. The description given -- particularly
the staterant "huge, multicolored ball of fire and dense cloud
of smoke" -- answers closely to that of a fireball.
