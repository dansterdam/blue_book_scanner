This page contains a hand-drawn sketch, not a photograph. The drawing depicts a UFO with an elongated body with what appear to be six square or rectangular windows or panels. Inside each panel, the word "light" is written, suggesting these panels were illuminated. The drawing also includes an arrow pointing to the right with the text "Direction of Travel." There is a note that reads "reddish" at the upper left corner, and the document is marked "UNCLASSIFIED" at the bottom right corner.

Below is the text as it would be produced by an OCR system:

```
reddish

light

UNCLASSIFIED

To clarify, the OCR output corresponds to the handwritten text visible in the drawing.
