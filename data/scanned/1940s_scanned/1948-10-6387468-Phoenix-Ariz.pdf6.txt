It is found that the Fireball doubly observed by ********** *********** and the ********** appeared at a height of at least 10 miles and descended at an angle of about 45ยบ to the vertical (according to Huret's estimate) to a point C at an elevation of only 2.3 miles above the horizontal plane through the point from which Purag and Sidper observed. As this Fireball approached this point, it followed a slanted horizontal path to a point of disappearance, ************** ************ at very near sunset. ************** visibility 7.5 miles long, traveling with a velocity of between 3.75 and 7.5 miles per second, depending on the duration estimate adopted. The coordinates of the projection of C on the earth are 250 56', 166ยบ 30' W, and those of the projection of D are 310 57' N, 106ยบ 33' W. The forward extension of the Fireball's trace on the earth, as determined by the above projactions, passes some six miles to the north of the town of Los Alamos.

It should be noted that the descending branch of the path of the Fireball described by Instructor ********** **********, he was so astounded by the sight that his observation of this portion of the path was incorrect. The coordinate to adopt had no sound was heard at Z being the "time factor" from observations to Fireball. Given the Fireball in the earth could have been only 3.5 to 5.2 miles distant and have no witness in testimony that the object passing between real earth and the other peculiarities observed by ************** ************** make this very near fullling the conditions.
