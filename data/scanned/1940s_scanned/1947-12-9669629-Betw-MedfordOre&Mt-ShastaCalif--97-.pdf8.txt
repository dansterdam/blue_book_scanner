possible missile sighting was made by the Pilot (Lt. Col H T Jones, MC,
and the co-pilot (Major A Anderson, 8(?) AF) of the C-54 airplane.

flying object, brilliantly metallic discus shaped, 12 to 14 inches in
diameter, rapidly approached the airplane. No vapor trail was observed
or no speed ref[eren]ce seemed to show although apparent speed of the 
object appeared at a position of 11:00 o'clock in relation to the
airplane's path the discus very labilely fell away.

2. A report was received at this Fairfield-Suisun tower from the
McClellan Airfield tower at Sacramento stating a report had been
received from Sacramento Air Depot to C-47 #4939 flying near Vacaville,
California, to the effect, a similar object was sighted at 1225 Pacific

abruptly the object returned some miles at approximately 38° 50'N and
121° 02'W. McClellan tower asked this tower to investigate report but
1330 a pilot reported a small fire at 38° 50' 1" and 122° 53' 1" which
came considerably lower. No definite CIR pigpoints were present at
this time. Over the radio instrument there were no reported aircraft
movement and the pilots purposed over the fire at 1337 Pacific Standard
time at a position of 38° 50' 1" and 122° 53' 1". The fire was burning in
a triangular shape over a small area and went out at 2155. The
spectacular moment at this fire appeared to burn with a white-blue color
