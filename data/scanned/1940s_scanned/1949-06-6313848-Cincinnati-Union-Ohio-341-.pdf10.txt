NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At approx 0054Z hours 6 June 1949, [redacted] noticed a trail of white
smoke in the northwest quadrant of the sky from his location in the control tower
of the International Airport, Tampa, Florida. Object apparently causing smoke
appeared to be going in a westerly direction, and seemed to informant to be located
approximately over the city of Dunedin, Florida. From the design of the trail of
smoke, informant thought the smoke was caused by a falling aircraft. Direction of
trail of smoke was straight down. Actual object causing smoke trail was not seen by
this informant. Phenomenon was witnessed by informant about forty (40) minutes,
whom darkness precluded further observation. Informant expressed his opinion that
the phenomenon he observed could not have been a meteor, regardless of statements
appearing in a local Tampa newspaper, which cited certain "authorities" as identifying
the phenomenon as a meteor.
