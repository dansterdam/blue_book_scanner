HEADQUARTERS
315TH AF BASE UNIT (RES TC)
GODMAN FIELD, FORT KNOX, KENTUCKY

9 January 1948

At approximately 1300 hrs. a call came to this headquarters from State Police, reporting a flying object near Elizabethtown. Another report came in from Madisonville about ten minutes later. A third call came in from Lexington, Kentucky. (All these towns are south of Godman Field).

We alerted the tower to be on the lookout for flying objects. At 1445 hrs. the tower notified me that an object had been sighted at about 215°. I went to the tower and observed the object until 1550 hrs., when it disappeared behind the clouds.

The object observed was circular in shape with the naked eye, and appeared to be about one-quarter the size of a full moon, white in color throughout with the exception it had an occasional red border at the bottom at times, and a red border at the top at times. It remained stationary for 1 1/2 hours regardless of the fact that the wind at that time was from the north.

When I arrived in the tower, Tech Sgt. Quinton Blackwell had contacted three P-51 airplanes over the field and suggested that they have a look if they had sufficient fuel. When I arrived, they were within sight of the tower, headed on a course of 215°.

I heard one of the pilots report that he saw the object straight ahead and estimated the speed of 180 M.P.H. The pilot stated that the object was very large and very bright.
