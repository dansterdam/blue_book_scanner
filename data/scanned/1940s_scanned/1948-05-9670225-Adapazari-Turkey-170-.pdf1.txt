The image provided appears to be a scanned document and does not contain any photographs. It is a form with some typed text and handwritten notes, but the quality of the scan is quite poor, making it difficult to read accurately. Here is what I can discern, though some words are illegible due to the quality of the image:

```
ATTC NO.
PROJECT                 Incident #170
[Illegible line]
DATE OF INFO      5 May 1949
[Illegible line]
LOCATION              Adapazari, Turkey
SOURCE                 Turkish Newspaper
DATE INFO RECD
[Illegible line, possibly "TITLE" or "TYPE OF EXHIBIT"]
[Illegible content]
NO. OF EXHIBITS    1
[Illegible line]
SYM:              .
[Illegible line containing "REMARKS"]
(Circle Rocket)
OBJECT [Illegible] R. COVERED

[Illegible content at the bottom of the document]
```

Unfortunately, the limited legibility of the text means that parts of the document cannot be accurately transcribed. The document seems to be related to a UFO incident report. The handwritten note possibly refers to an object being identified as a "Circle (Rocket)" and mentions something being "R. COVERED," which could mean "Recovered." The form is dated May 5, 1949, and mentions a location in Turkey.
