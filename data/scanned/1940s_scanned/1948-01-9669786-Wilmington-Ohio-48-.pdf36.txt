To: Whom it may concern.

On the evening of 7 January 1948 at approximately 
19:30 o'clock the undersign^d witnessed a very bright 
light in the sky, in the northwest direction of C.C.A.P. 
which appea^red to be the complete wing of an aircraft
on fire with the naked eye. Then the following observation 
with the aid of field glasses from -the control tower was 
made, the object would gain and lose altitude very rapid^ly 
without much noticed forward or backward motion and at 
times changing colors of red and green, at one time it 
disappeared behind the overcast but its lights pen^trated 
through the overcast. At approximate 19:45 o'clock the 
object began to move away from the field at a heading 
of 210 degrees and disappeared over the horizon at 
approximately 19:55.
