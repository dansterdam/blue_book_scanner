UNCLASSIFIED

Mr. [REDACTED] did not estimate the size of the object, nor was he certain that the object was not much closer or further away than what he had previously estimated, explaining that at the time of observation and even now, nothing was or is certain. Complete unconcern then, and as of now, has not changed or improved Mr. [REDACTED]'s opinion. 

The object was sighted by the observers as follows: Mr. [REDACTED] called Mr. [REDACTED] attention to what he believed to be a star. Mr. [REDACTED] watched it for a few seconds and excitedly remarked that it wasn't a star so must be a ship from Murdoc. Mr. [REDACTED] turned his Transmitter (3105mc) and after a wait of five seconds relayed a running description to the Burbank Airfield Tower. This was done just as a friendly gesture, not as an exhibition.

REPORTING OFFICERS COMMENT: Mr. [REDACTED] is believed to be sincere and a competent observer. There appears to be no reasonable explanation for the phenomena.
