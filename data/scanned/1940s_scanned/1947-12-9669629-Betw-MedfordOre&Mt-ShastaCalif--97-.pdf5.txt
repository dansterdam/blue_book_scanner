In the lower part of the document, there appears to be a photograph. It shows a blurry, elongated shape with uneven, fuzzy edges. The image is very unclear, and it is difficult to discern any details or context from the photograph alone.

Here is the text output from the document:

night of 30 Dec 47, a possible rocket sighting was made by pilot

green and blue flames was viewed for a period of 2 seconds. The object

down slightly upon nearing the ground. The object appeared at a position
of 2:30 o'clock in relation to the plane and the flames were intensely bright.
