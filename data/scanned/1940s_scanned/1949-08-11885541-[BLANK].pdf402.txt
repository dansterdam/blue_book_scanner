CONCLUSIONS

1. Evaluation of reports of unidentified flying objects to date 
demonstrates that these flying objects constitute no direct threat to
the national security of the United States.

2. Reports of unidentified flying objects are the result of:

    a. Misinterpretation of various conventional objects.
    
    b. A mild form of mass hysteria or "war nerves".
    
    c. Individuals who fabricates such reports to perpetrate a 
    hoax or to seek publicity.
    
    d. Psychopathological persons.

3. Planned releases of unusual aerial objects coupled with the 
release of related psychological propaganda could cause mass hysteria.

    a. Employment of these methods by or against an enemy would
    yield similar results.
