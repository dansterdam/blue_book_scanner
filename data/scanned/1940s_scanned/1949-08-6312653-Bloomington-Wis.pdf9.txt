TT PROJECT GRUDGE FROM DAB, BOGGS

FOLLOWING REPORT RECEIVED FROM MR [REDACTED]

[REDACTED], BLOOMINGTON, WISCONSIN,
IN A LETTER TO CONGRESSMAN GARDNER R. 
WITHROW: "WHEN I SAW YOUR COLUMN YESTERDAY
AND CAME UPON THE PART ABOUT THE L-SHAPED
AIRPLANES SEEN AT BOISE, ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO
WHILE OUT RIDING WITH MY WIFE AND HER
SISTER, WE WERE DRIVING BETWEEN GEN HAVEN
AND BLOOMINGTON AND WE SAW A VERY QUEER
OBJECT. I SAW IT FIRST AND IT GLEAMED
VERY BRIGHTLY. I CALLED THEIR ATTENTION TO
IT BUT IT SOON DISAPPEARED OUT OF SIGHT. BUT
AS IT WENT ON IT BECAME MORE LIKE A BALLOON.
IT SEEMS TO BE VERY HIGH. THOUGH THIS MIGHT
BE OF INTEREST TO YOU, OR MAYBE COULD SHED SOME
LIGHT AS TO WHAT IT WAS." REQUEST A/C OPINION ON
THIS INCIDENT BY THURSDAY TELECON IN ORDER THAT REPLY MAY
BE MADE TO CONGRESSMAN WITHROW BY H.Q. USAF.

END CSAF ITEM 10/[REDACTED]
