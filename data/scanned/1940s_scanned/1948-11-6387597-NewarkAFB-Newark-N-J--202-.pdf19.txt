At 1850 hours, 8 Nov 48, █████ was standing just outside Hanger
#7, Newark AF Base, when glancing up toward the moon he perceived a pale
luminous object race across the sky. It was about 1/3 the brigh[t]ness of
the moon, round like a disc with little or no depth (thickness). It
appeared to be about the same relative diameter as the moon and was traveling
from the north northwest in an arc toward the south southeast. Ob[i]ject was
seen about one second or less. It passed out of sight over another hanger.
No sound was heard. Speed was estimated at 600 MPH. Observer states that he
had observed jet aircraft make tactical approaches at approximately 600
mph and judged the speed of the object was at least 2000 mph faster. From
where he stood █████ could see approximately 75% of the path of the object.
The peak of its arc was approximately 45° above the horizon to the west
southwest of his position. Altitude was judged to be 5,000 to 6,000 feet.

Mr. █████ is a very reliable employee, highly intelligent and of excellent
character.

There were no reports of commercial, private and military craft flying in the
vicinity at the time.

No reports were received relative to possible release of testing devices in
the vicinity.
