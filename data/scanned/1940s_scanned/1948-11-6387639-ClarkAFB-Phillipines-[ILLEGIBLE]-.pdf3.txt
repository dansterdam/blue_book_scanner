COMMENT NO. 1.
"Attached message was received from FRAP pertaining to a sighting of an unidentified aerial object at Clark AF Base, Philippines at approximately 1130 hours 7 November 1948.
2. It is requested that the configuration described in this wire be analyzed for aerodynamic feasibility. Comments should be referred to MCIA/D3.

1. The aircraft configuration described in the attached message is unusual because of its apparently continuous plate or band encircling the approximate dimensions quoted are correct, this plane's center of mass placement must be of outstanding importance to the aircraft's aerodynamic problem assuming the powerplant location approximates that normally used of this type and location of two power plants.
2. If no tail surface is present, as implied in the attached report, trim cannot in all probability be maintained without swept wings on the airplane. Even with no tail surfaces, if the wings are sufficiently swept back, the configuration is aerodynamically feasible.
3. In an evaluation of the description, it is pertinent to consider that although the distance and altitude of the aircraft could not be determined, the dimensions were estimated. With no reference object in view, such an estimation, without knowledge of the distance to the object observed, is virtually impossible.
