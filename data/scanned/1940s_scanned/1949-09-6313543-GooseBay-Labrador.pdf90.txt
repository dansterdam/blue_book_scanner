24-185                             Humboldt, Nebr
                                    Oct 5, 1949

On the morning of 29, September at 0605 I saw this object in
the sky almost directly above me -- going south. It seemed
disk shaped. It took almost 40 minutes to get across the
skie [sic] If I could have timed it from start until it went out
of site [sic]--It was high as it seemed to disappear before It [sic] went
below the horizon. It seemed to be a glowing color similar
to a Flourescent [sic] blub [sic]-- It seemed the center was brighter and
the outside and several rings stood out.
