Incident No. 62 -- 5 September 1947, 2200-2230 hours, Logan, Utah.
A man and his wife, to...er with five other unidentified people, observed two
groups each of 15-50 small objects, yellow-white in color, flying several
thousand feet in the air at a hi... rate of speed. The weather was cloudy.

ANALYSIS: From the l...ited evidence submitted, it is practically
impossible to formulate a conclusion. Fast motion could be attributed to closeness
rather than to tr... linear distance. In an atmosphere of darkness, any illu-
sion may be enormous. Glare... light reflected from moving, low-hanging,
clouds, themselves not vi...ble, could readily account for this report. Light-
colored birds are another possibility.
