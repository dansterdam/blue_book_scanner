Dr. William H. Crew
Assistant Director for Scientific Personnel
P.O. Box 1663
Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
Los Alamos, New Mexico

Dear Dr. Crew:

Reference is made to your letter of 21 August 1952 (ref: ADSP) to Lt Col P.M. Butman of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission requesting an Air Force briefing on unidentified aerial phenomena or "flying saucers."

The Air Technical Intelligence Center would be very glad to present a briefing on unidentified aerial objects to the bi-weekly colloquium held by your laboratory. Within the next few weeks, personnel from this Center will be making a trip to the west coast and will plan to stop off in Los Alamos. At the present time no definite date can be set, but as soon as plans for the trip are finalized you and Col Butman will be contacted, clearances arranged and a final date set.

It is believed that such a briefing will be of great value to ATIC in that a group of qualified scientists such as those at Los Alamos always have excellent ideas on various technical and scientific aspects of the problem of unidentified aerial objects.

Sincerely yours,

---
