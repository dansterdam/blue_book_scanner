If not, I for one am ready to believe the story of the "flying 
saucers" which up to now I have not. I would like to keep in touch 
with you if I or any of my friends happen to see any of these strange 
"things".

Hoping I have not bored you or taken up your time needlessly, I 
remain 

Sincerely yours,

[redacted]
Springer, N.M.

Mr. [redacted] is a Springer business man who has given me 
permission to use his name in connection with the appearance of these 
so called "flying saucers". He will back me in anything I have said and in 
the diagrams I have drawn, he is as eager as I am to have some light 
shod on this subject.

Dr. La Paz we haven't told many people because we are afraid they 
won't believe us. Do you blame us?

Sincerely
[redacted]
