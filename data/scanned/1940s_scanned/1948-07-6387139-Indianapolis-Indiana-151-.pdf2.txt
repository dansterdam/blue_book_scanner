and were headed West on East 56th Street. Just as the
truck started across the brige, the object was sighted
directly ahead just above the trees in a bank to the left
of approximately twenty degrees (20Â°) and appeared to be
in a slight descent. Witnesses stopped on the other
side of the bridge and jumped out for another look but the
object could not be seen. Lt. John S. Hodgkins, Base PIO
and Lt. Russell J. Carey Jr. Base Intelligence Officer
made an investigation and thoroughly searched the area but
could not find the object. However the area in which the
object was believed to have fallen was densely wooded and
had many hills and valleys. See diagram attached of the
area of sighting.
