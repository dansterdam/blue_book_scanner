The image displayed does not contain a photograph, but rather it shows a page from an old document, which appears to be a table with headers and some typed text. I'll produce the output of all the visible text found in the document as an OCR system would:

The text is challenging to read due to resolution and quality issues; thus, some words might be incomplete or inaccurately transcribed. The table itself is empty, and there are no entries filled out in the rows that would provide specifics about the actual sightings.
