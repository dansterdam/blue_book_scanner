HEADQUARTERS 
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE

Attachment to report of observation of an unidentified 
aerial object, by [CENSORED], encountered, New Mexico,
on 27 March 1949.

The object first appeared high in the sky to the northwest,
apparently headed southeast. It then dived steeply, turning
toward the west, and slowed to one third of its original horizontal height. This diving and climbing was repeated two or 
three times. There was no change in the ratio between 
the length and width during these maneuvers. At the top 
of one of its climbs, the object appeared to head back toward the east; there was a red glitter or white light
at the head of the object as it levelled off. Than it 
dived and raced back to the west.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS.
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
DOD DIR 5200.10
