Incident #20, Case# - Lockbourne AFB, Columbus, Ohio -- 7 January 1948

Considering this incident with #32, 35, and 43, one is forced to conclude that the object observed from Lockbourne Army air base on the evening of 7 January 1948 was the planet Venus.

One report of the incident gives the location of the object as 210°-220°, or approximately opposite from that stated by other observers and that of Venus. Obviously, since the time of observation was the same, this means that one witness either was looking at a different object or had his directions mixed. Since the description otherwise agrees generally with the rest, and since it is assumed throughout the reports that all observers were viewing the same object, the latter interpretation seems presumable.

Witnesses state that the object "couldn't have been a star" (of course, it wasn't), because the sky was completely overcast. However, reports from the Columbus weather bureau indicate that, although the afternoon was cloudy, the sky was clear by 1900 hours. (This does not mean, of course, that there were no clouds near the western horizon.)

For possible explanations of the "baffles" reported by observers of this object, and further discussion of the incident, see report on #33.
