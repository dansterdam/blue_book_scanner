1. In compliance with 35th Reconnaissance Group (Weather) Letter, subject: "Semi-Monthly Intelligence Summary", File 505A ZID USAF 550.05, dated 5 July 1947, the following report is submitted for the period ending 31 January 1949.

2. On 21 January 1949, crew of B-29 aircraft, number 44-87650, returning from a special search mission over DAC grid HYR 1F, Star Aerial 3, observed the following described atmospheric phenomena:

a. At 0102Z, 24 Jan 49, from position in 29° 30' N - 67° 29' W, at an course of 050°, altitude 10,500 ft., Captain [Name redacted], Aircraft Commander, first saw a red glow off the left wing which at first resembled the moon rising and which the crew later believed to be a burning ship.

b. At 0205Z the pilot turned the aircraft in direction of the light, 350° true course, and within fifteen minutes the aircraft was so close to the red light on the water that a marker was expended in order to avoid flying into the red light mass.

c. On approaching the red light it was observed as a dark red glow, 1 to 1-1/2 miles rdia., based on the water, and resembling burning oil with a phosphorescent red light extending 2,500 to 3,000 ft altitude. Also from bearing of 350° and 150° two columns of vivid light, 1/4 to 1/2 mile apart, resembling search light beams and extending upward through approximately 3/4 of the red light mass. The beams were at a slight angle toward each other. Capt [Name redacted] estimates that if both the light beams had extended above the red light mass to an altitude ot 10,000 ft. they would have intersected. It was also observed that the red light mass gave off enough light to illuminate the surface of the water and the bases of surrounding clouds with a dull red glow (see inclosure #5)

d. Aircraft position abovg the red light was 38° 5, 000 ft. altitude, at 0100Z, 25 Jan 49, was 31° 21' N - 67° 03' W

e. Wind at 5,000 ft was from 025° with velocity at 45 m.p.h..

f. Clouds 70% present, ^0 to ^2 cu.ft.Cumulus coverage, with bases at DOWNWARD 2,500 ft.
DECLASS AFTER 10 YRS. UNC. 
DECLASS AFTER 12 YRS.
