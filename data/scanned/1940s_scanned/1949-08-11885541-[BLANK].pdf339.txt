Incident No. 154-c-2 August 1945, 1915 hours, Columbus, Ohio
An attorney and his wife observed an object moving south over the 
center of Columbus at 1500-2000 ft altitude. During the ten to 
fifteen minutes the object remained in sight, it changed shape from 
that of a parallelogram to a circle and back again, direction of travel 
remained constant. Once it seemed to disappear and then all of 
smoke appeared from the rear. The smoke started as a thin trail 
line of the object was dark gray or black, but the center seemed to be 
transparent. Object was judged to be 20 to 30 feet in diameter.

AIR Opinion: There is no reason to believe other than that this 
object was a research balloon, of which there are many types, and that 
the "trail of smoke" appeared so from a momentary glimpse of trailing
apparati.
