Northern Lights Seen Here For Second Time

Northern Lights were seen last night for the second time in succession
in the sky to the north and northwest.

A red-orange glow appeared to the north-northwest shortly after 9:30,
but was partially obscured by low clouds. The Hamilton Hotel's station re-
ported a faint aurora corralis at one o'clock. Radio reception was hampered
by the phenomena.

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited reported severe currents in
their cables and complete wireless failure on wireless circuits. All cables
ways reported, the company stated, and the wireless messages received were
not for public service.

Capt. G. K. Flatcher of the Gascony was surprised as a lot of other
people when he first saw the display on Monday night. "It didn't look at first
what they were," he said this morning aboard his vessel.
     
This was the first time, Captain Flatcher said, that he had noticed
these lights so far south. In northern latitudes he had often seen them.
On these occasions he said they were more spectacular, with less red but more
blue and violet in their makeup.
