Incidents #157 -- Richmond, Indiana -- 5 November 1948

This incident very likely has an astronomical explanation;
the object sighted was probably Venus. Venus rose on November 6 at 
about 3:30 a. m. and an hour later would have been a little south of
east at an altitude of about 10Â°. Its magnitude was -3.7, or about
six times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. The photo-
graph taken of the object et head does not contradict this hypothesis.

It is unlikely that the object observed was the bright
comet (1948l) discovered one day earlier in the southern hemisphere,
for this comet at that time was very far to the south and east, almost
on the horizon, and was very much fainter than Venus. If this object
seen here had been the comet, the persons observing it could lay claim
to the first discovery; it was discovered one day later in Australia
because of much more favorable location.

Venus, of course was visible all during the autumn of 1948
in approximately the same position as that in which it was seen on
the morning of November 5.

It is also of interest to note that Mercury had its greatest
western elongation on November 6, but it rose just at the beginning of
the morning twilight and would therefore have been just rising at the
time of this incident. Furthermore, Mercury was much less brilliant
than Venus.
