11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Instrument found by a farmer near Danforth, Illinois. He said it landed in the middle of a section of his farm land and burned weeds 2 feet tall to find ash an area of 18 feet in diameter around where the object dropped.
The articles contained in the instrument was analyzed and it was found that no connection can be made between these articles and the so-called "Flying saucer." These specimens, therefore, are considered as part of a hoax that could be perpetrated by almost anyone seeking publicity or for other reasons
