The document contains two photographs at the top-right corner. Each shows a circular or oval object with a certain luminosity that could be considered unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The photo quality is not clear, and there isn't much detail discernable about the objects shown.

Now, as an OCR system, I will transcribe the visible text from the document:

----
...c. The aircraft was making a terrific noise, over increasing as it descended according to the statement of the two witnesses. (Exhibits 6 and 7)

d. According to the statements of the witnesses, the aircraft exploded in mid-air between where it started the dive and the ground. (Exhibits 6 and 7)

e. None of the witnesses observed any fire coming from the aircraft ...ing the descent (Exhibits 6, 7 and 9)

f. The aircraft crashed at approximately 1500 EST, southwest of Franklin, Kentucky. (Exhibits 6 and 7)

a. The poor judgement displayed by Captain Mantell in what he elected to climb to altitudes without oxygen equipment.

b. The effects of anoxia rendering Captain Mantell unconscious causing loss of control of the aircraft.

15. COMMENTS:

a. It is the opinion of this headquarters that the effects of anoxia on Captain Mantell was the underlying cause of this accident.
