Here is the text from the document:

---
Atlantic, Iowa.
December 30, 1949.

Air Material Command
Wright Base
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Sirs:

Being an ardent observer of the much talked of "Flying Disc", I
am enclosing a "crude" drawing of our observation of this disc which
we observed, over Atlantic, Iowa. at 1000 October 28, 1949. This object
was seen by two men.

Would you please send me some of the data which led your basis
to discontinue "Project Flying Saucer", as stated by Associated Press
in the Omaha World-Herald on December 28, 1949. We are very much interested
in hearing from you as we still believe our eyes although our failure to
locate this disc made us wonder if "seeing is believing".

I write you this information, and hope that it will be useful to
you. I do not wish any publicity nor does the other party who observed
it with me. We will be glad to give you any other information you may
ask for, although it is all contained in the enclosed drawing.

Hoping that your division will be able to furnish us with information
compiled to convince us that we didn't see anything, we remain until then,

Sincerely,

[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
Atlantic, Iowa.
