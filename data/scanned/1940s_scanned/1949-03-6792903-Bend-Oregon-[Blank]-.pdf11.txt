File No. 24-9

SUBJECT: AERIAL PHENOMENA
Flying Objects over Bend, Oregon
SPECIAL INQUIRY

27 MAY 1949

TO:
Commanding General
Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. Forwarded herewith is Closed Report of S/A JOHN T. REILLY of this
   District, dated 24 May 1949.

2. Alleged flying saucers sighted over Bend, Oregon, on 24 March 1949
   appear to be natural phenomena. It is generally agreed by observers that
   these so-called flying saucers were large pieces of paper or other articles
   of like nature rising high into the sky by whirlwinds occasioned by convo-
   tion currents. As all logical leads are exhausted in this District, the
   case is forwarded to your headquarters for necessary evaluation.

                                   FOR THE ACTING DISTRICT COMMANDER:

                                   [Signature]
