ported at a later date, that he was driving with his brother-in a car 
on the highway from [REDACTED] to Fort Worth, Texas, at approximately 1900

from North to South in the West just prior to its apparent disintegration
which occurred slightly North of due West and about 15 degrees North of

tion the color changed from green to an orange/yellow and then to a deep
red color. According to the observer the disintegration appeared similar
to a rocket burst.
