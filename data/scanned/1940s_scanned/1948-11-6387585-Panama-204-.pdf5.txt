2. The incidents' summaries 173 through 233 have been checked against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation Of Unidentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 12, "Directions of Flight of Object," should be altered so that the wind profile control notes are distinguished or if possible, omit so that motion is specified as the direction towards which the objects appears to turn. "Relativity to Radar Settings" should include a discussion of the type of radar set used.
