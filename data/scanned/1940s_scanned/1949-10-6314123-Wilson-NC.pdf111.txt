Cameraman was _______, Headquarters Squadron,
509th Air Base Group, whose duty assignment is in the Walker Air Force
Base Photography Laboratory as a photographer Laboratory technician.

_______ is a former Army Air Force Navigator who has had experi-
ence in celestial navigation. He states that in his opinion it was improb-
able that the object photographed could have been a celestial body. He felt
that possibly it was a recognition or some light mounted on some man-made
structure in the distance until he searched the entire area to the southwest
of the position of his camera the following day and could not find anything
to bear out his opinion. He states the distance from him is unknown by him
in that it could have been one-half mile, twenty miles, or many, many miles
away. The camera used was a speedgraphic camera mounted on a tripod set at
F 4.5 and infinity with an exposure of thirty seconds. The row of lights
visible to the left of the unknown object are said by _______ to have been
a car traveling from right to left before the camera, which is thought by
JONES to have been approximately two blocks in the distance. To his naked
eye the unknown object appeared brighter than the automobile headlights but
definitely much smaller. _______ states the reason no stars are visible in
the picture is that he developed the print specifically to bring out the
object in question. With reference to the slight fuzziness appearing from
eight to twelve o'clock and from two to six o'clock on the edged object,
JONES states that is tripped and camera were quite securely mounted and he
is certain no movement of the camera would account for this afore-mentioned
fuzziness on the image. Base Photo Officer feels fuzziness may be trace-
able to heat emitted by object.
