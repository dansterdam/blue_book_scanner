3. In this summary of the above interview, Dr. La Paz finds that the 
sounds were unlike normal aircraft sounds, that a B-29 could not have produced 
it, that the two associated round white had luminosities, which might indicate road-
lights, altho no road machinery of trucks had been operating, and two other 
investigators had heard similar sounds on the morning of 31 December at about 
0540.

Calculations based on the transit readings indicate that the sound 
originated on a point with coordinates 106 degrees 17 minutes, 35 degrees 52 
minutes.

5. AACS at Kirtland Air Force base was checked by the writer and so far
as their records show no aircraft were near Los Alamos during the times of 
the sound observations.

AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUND:

6. AACS at Walker Air Force Base was checked by Special Agent SHERIDAN 
W. CAVITT, and reported that no aircraft were shown near Los Alamos by their 
log during the critical times.
