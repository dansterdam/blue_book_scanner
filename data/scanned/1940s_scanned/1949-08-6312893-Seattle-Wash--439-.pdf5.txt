GGM MR. ████████, ██████████████, WAS ON DUTY AT THE SEATTLE AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER AT THE SEATTLE-TACOMA AIRPORT
AND NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A JET AIRCRAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OLYMPIC MOUNTAINS AT AN ESTIMATED DISTANCE OF 20 TO 30 MILES AWAY. HE BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF MR. ████████ WHO WAS THE SENIOR CONTROLLER ON DUTY. SINCE THEY WERE AWARE THAT NO JET UNITS WERE STATIONED WITHIN THIS AREA THEY NOTIFIED THE MCCORD FLIGHT SERVICE CENTER. THE DISPATCHER ON DUTY AT THE MCCORD FLIGHT SERVICE CENTER DID NOT HAVE A FLIGHT PLAN ON ANY JET AIRCRAFT OR FIGHTER TYPE 
AIRCRAFT IN THIS AREA AND MADE A CHECK OF ALL THE MILITARY BASES WITHIN THE AREA TO DETERMINE IF ANY JET OR FIGHTER TYPE AIRCRAFT WERE FLYING LOCALLY FROM THEIR BASES. A NEGATIVE REPORT WAS RECEIVED. MR. █████████ AND NR, █████████ BOTH REPORTED THAT THEY WERE DEFINITE THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED DISPLAYED VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A JET FIGHTER, AND THAT ITS SPEED WAS SUCH TO LEAD THEM TO BELIEVE IT WAS A JET AIRCRAFT.
