   This Inspector was extremely startled by this object as the first impression was that it was a plane on fire and about to crash nearby.
As the eyes became adjusted to the distance this Inspector had the distinct impression of seeing a silver or aluminum covered body inside the flame or glow that resembled that part. of the fuselage of a war-time German type plane from just behind the wing to just in front of the tail assembly. This Inspector further had the impression that the object was actually flaming and that the flames were quite visible. The over-all shape of the object including the flame or light was much like the accompanying sketch. The object appeared less than 2 miles from the observer and the outlines were very distinct.

                                            W.E. Patterson,
                                            Security Inspector,
