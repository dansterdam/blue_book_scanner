Flying Whatzit
Seen by Fliers,
Just Windbags

By Maxine Bartel and
Lyle Wheeler

The Flying Thing, this year's
Summer wonder, made its in-
evitable appearance in the
East yesterday, and it caused
so much harmless excitement
that it's really a pity the
mystery was so easily solved.

Startled vacationers spotted the
early on the boardwalk at As-
bury Park, N.J., and for a dozen
nervous seconds Air Drome riots at
nearby Red Bank airport, among
others, spotted it in the western
skyabout 8:15 A.M.

It seemed to be a long, silver
cylinder rather than the flame-
shooting monster reported over
Alabama early Saturday or the
gigantic silver ball sighted over
Yakima, Wash., on Sunday.

But the excied beholders dis-
continued such descriptions as
tirlting and concluded it was the
same apparatus, completing
a wing-around the country.

Two of the fliers hopped into
                                                                 (Continued on page 29, col. 9)

planes and went up to get a closet
look. The Thing was gaining alti-
tude so fast itself, however, that
they couldn't get nearer than 5,000
feet.

It looked like several balloons,
strung together like pearls. Permit-

ranged all the way from a new
Russian secret weapon to a pub-
licity stunt for Saturday's Interna-
tional Air Exposition at the New
York International Airport, Idle-
wild.

It was not until several hours
later that the apparition was finally
identified as an elaborate cosmic
ray balloon sent up by the Univer-
sity Department of Prelynthon-
physics. Confirming the inquisitive
fliers' impression, it consisted of 98
balloons, each 12 feet in diameter,
joined by a long cable and carrying
a gondola fitted with scientific
equipment and automatic radio
transmitter.

Princeton spokesmen said the
last signals received indicated the
contraption had gone down in the
Atlantic Ocean 160 miles due east
of Asbury Park a little after noon,
after having reached a maximum
altitude of 83,000 feet.

They were somewhat surprised
at all the fuss. They've been mak-
ing these experiments off and on
for more than a year and said they
thought everybody in that vicinity
was used to them.
