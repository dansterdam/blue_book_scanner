6 September 1949

I, SGT [Redacted], assigned to the 3538th Maintenance
Squadron, Mather Air Force Base, California, voluntarily make the following
statement to BERL E. PENNINGTON, who has identified himself to me as a
Special Agent, OSI, USAF.

On 5 September 1949, Sgt [Redacted] and I left San Fernando at approximately
1200 hours, headed in a northerly direction straight over Grapevine Pass.
Just before we reached the highest point of the pass, with an 8,000 foot
mountain to our left and on the right other lower mountains, we sighted an
object descending from the foothills at about an 80 or 85° angle. It was
about 3,000 feet below us when we spotted it and came right up approximately
even with us, about 1,000 feet off our right wing tip. Our elevation at this
time was approximately 6,500 feet above sea level. It seemed to rise from
the floor of the hills but we didn't actually see it leave the ground. When
it reached our altitude, it seemed to hover for a moment and then it shot off
almost directly south. It was traveling at a terrific speed, slightly ascending
at about a 5° angle. It headed south over the ocean disappearing from
our view. This object appeared to be like a sphere, slightly oval in shape,
appearing a little longer than wide. This object did not appear to have any
support of any kind, no exhaust or control surfaces whatsoever, and was of
a dull metallic substance, similar to aluminum. It appeared to be about 30
or 55 feet in diameter.
