Incident #47 -- Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California - 3 Jul, 1947

This incident cannot be readily explained astronomically.
The object was in sight too long to be a meteor, and the variable
"reflection" and absence of any statement about trail also argue
against that interpretation. It is difficult, however, to rule
out the hypothesis completely, because of the lack of pertinent
information and the ever-present possibility that the reporting
was more subjective than objective.
