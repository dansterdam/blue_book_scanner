Shortly after checking Blackstone, at approx 0230, a trail was picked up that
appeared to be a jet or rocket trail. The object leaving the trail was 
traveling at terrific speed in a southwesterly direction and as nearly as
they could estimate they calculat'd the degree of travel as 230°

They were on a heading at the time of 215°. The jet or rocket trail at no 
time crossed their flight path. It was on the distant western horizon at
approx 20° above the horizon. The trail covered an 80° to 90° arc laterally.

NO ID: There is a 15 minute difference in time if this sighting (0230) to
the rocket sighting at 0245 in some 400 to 475 miles distant.

NOTE: The above time (0230) tallies with another sighting by another pilot
in the vicinity of Blackstone, Va., who saw a very unusual meteor that
appeared to be on a bearing of about 210° from them traveling in a 
southerly direction above but close to the horizon.
