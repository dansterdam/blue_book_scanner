b. To explain irrelevant factors in a systematic manner, the 
information presented in "Exhibit "A" is presented in the order of occurrences 
and significance.

(1) Incident A

a. Object was sighted 24 July 1948 between 0140 and 
         0220 E from the airport at Robins Air Force Base, 
         Macon, Georgia.

b. Object was sighted from an altitude of 5,000 
         feet by a crew of *** while flying a C-47 some 
         20 miles south of Montgomery, Alabama. The time 
         of the sighting was 24 July 1948 at approximately 
         0225 E.

c. Both the *** sighting and that of ***
         describe the object as "cigar" or "cylindrical"
         in shape. (sic[scribe perceived only the glow emitted by it])

d. All observers agree that the object was traveling in a 
         general southerly heading and that it was trailed by 
         a flame varying in color and that it behaved like a 
         normal craft insofar as disappearing from the line 
         of sight was concerned.

NOTE: It is a known fact that atmospheric conditions 
         such as varying degrees of humidity and inci-
         dence of light reflection often influence the 
         color of the light observed. This would serve 
         to explain why many observers conflict 
         in their descriptions as to color of light 
         displayed by the object or its trail.

         Witnesses to this sighting implied, there 
         was called observers. In no instance was there any 
         indications of subversive or ulterior influences 
         involved.

         This *** account, until Point of *** 
         was not officially made within a period of 
         *** until *** until *** any source of *** remained 
         as alert was *** on *** at *** those ***
