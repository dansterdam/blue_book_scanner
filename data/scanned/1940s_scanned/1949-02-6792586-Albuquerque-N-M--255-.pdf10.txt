Comments of interrogator relative to intelligence and character of
observer(s):

27 Feb 49
1905 hours

I was returning from station L01 to station 100.
While on the straight strip of road adjacent to the airstrip I happened to
glance toward the north at which time I observed a greenish colored light
moving across the northern sky toward the east. It was traveling on a
course parallel to the surface of the earth. It was visible for approximately
two seconds. It did not appear to travel beyond my range of vision, but
suddenly disappeared as I was watching it. It did not leave a trail as in
the sky nor did it appear to have a tail like a meteor.

Due to the very short time that it was visible I am unable to estimate
the rate of speed or altitude of the object.
