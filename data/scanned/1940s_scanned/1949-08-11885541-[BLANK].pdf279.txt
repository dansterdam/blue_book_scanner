RECOMMENDATIONS

This investigator would like to offer three recommendations,
one in the general interest of the nation's airmen, and two as aids
toward more effective investigation of the problem of unidentified
aerial objects, if such work is continued.

First and foremost, it is definitely recommended that Air
Forces personnel be apprised of simple astronomical phenomena like
the recurrent brilliance of Venus and the characteristics of a typi-
cal fireball, so that much confusion and alarm and even possible tragic
consequences can be avoided. If, as seems possible, Lieutenant Mantell
met his death while attempting to chase down Venus, certainly the need
for such basic education is great.

Second, if Project GRUDGE is authorized to extend its inves-
tigations, it might be found profitable to interrogate personally
varied trained personnel concerning any untoward aerial objects which
they may have observed in the past. Many competent observers might
hesitate to take the initiative in reporting such phenomena for fear
of ridicule or criticism, yet it is only from such people that ac-
curate and meaningful descriptions can be obtained; reliance on
the general public for such observations is almost certain to prove of
little value. It would be of considerable aid to know whether (aside
from the few cases reported here) experienced pilots, weather observers,
and other "watchers of the sky" have ever found unidentified objects
there. Even negative results would prove valuable, for they would
offer evidence for the belief held by many that the unexplained
