Incident: 216

On 8 Dec 1948 at approximately 1845 hours Sergeant [REDACTED]
noticed what appeared to be either a sky rocket or meteor, and
called the object to the attention of his companion, Sergeant
[REDACTED]

Sergeant [REDACTED] stated that the object did not appear to be a star
since it was below the star limit and it was heading from the northeast to
closer than a star would be. It was entering a star and seemed
the south southwest and was moving upwards at about a 10 or 20 degree
angle. As it moved it seemed to get larger. The object left a trail.
In about two or three seconds it disappeared. The object was round,
white and moved very fast.

Sergeant [REDACTED] statement does not differ as to direction or color
or angle of ascent. States that the object never got about 2 to 3/10's
of the sky while under observation and did not appear to him to
be a falling star. He reported to the Duty Forecaster at the Base
Weather Station. Sergeant [REDACTED] statement does not mention seeing
a trail.
