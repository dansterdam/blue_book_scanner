STATEMENT

On 6 August 1949 at 2000 hours, my wife, Delo Probits and her
folks, Dr, and Mrs. C. J. Stanton and I were standing at the sea-
wall at Biloxi enjoying the gulf air. At a time while looking
out over the gulf toward the Southwest., my eye happened to catch
a bright spherical object. I turned to the East and I saw the
object which appeared as a brilliant sphere, the size of a wasps
paper basket. Its direction of travel was from over KAFB towards
a 180 degree heading, traveling at a speed of 600 to 800 miles per
hour. The course of travel was in an unusually horizontal plane.
The object stayed in view for approximately thirty (30) seconds
and then disappeared out of sight over the gulf. My wife had also 
witnessed part of this display, and immediately we all discussed 
the matter for some time. I believe the object was too large to
have been a firefly presenting an optical illusion. I also believe
that it was not a meteor fragment because of its bright glowing
nature so close to Earth. Due to the large amount of oxygen pres-
ent, I believe a meteor would have burnt itself out before ascent
to such low altitudes.
