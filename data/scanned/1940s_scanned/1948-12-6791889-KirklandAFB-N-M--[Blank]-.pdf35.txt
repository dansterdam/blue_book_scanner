Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of
observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUM:  At about 2000 hours, 5 Dec 1948 while walking
along the west side of Varsity Village, ******* saw a bright green
"meteorite". The color was a brilliant green as in a traffic signal
or neon tube.  The size of visible area was very bright; i.e., it was
not merely a point of light, but the size to the object is doubtful.  It was
was estimated at 1/3 **** of Venus when that planet is visible in the
daytime. However, ******* discounted any claim of accuracy to size.
The object appeared in the western sky vertically to about 5Â°. There was
a definite corona or halo effect but no sparks or trail were produced.
The sky was hazy and there was some cloud cover at the time of the sighting
******* did not recall the extent of the cloudiness. No stars were
visible in the part of the sky where the "meteor" was observed.

NOTE:  No other report of observation for 5 Dec gives a time element of
2000 hours. ******* will be contacted by Dr LA PAZ in an effort
to obtain precise measurement of his observational angles.
