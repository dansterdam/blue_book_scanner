Incident #53 -- 5 mi N of Helena, Montana -- 29 July 1947

...with the exception of the color ("like polished nickel") and the lack of sufficient concerning a trail, the object reported in this incident might very well have been a daylight meteor. Bright meteors have been observed to move in wavy paths. The manner of disappearance ("melted into thin air") further supports this view. Time in sight and speed also usual. In short, it is more likely that this object was a bright meteor than that it was anything else.
