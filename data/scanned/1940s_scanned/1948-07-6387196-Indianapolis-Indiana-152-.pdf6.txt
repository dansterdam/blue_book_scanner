The image features a black and white page from a document with some text and a drawn figure at the top. The figure appears to be a sketch of a long, rectangular object with an uneven lower border, possibly representing some sort of unidentified flying object (UFO).

The text of the document reads as follows:

Incident #61 -- Indianapolis, Indiana -- 23 July 1948

This incident and #62 are being considered together by this investigator, because they both occurred in Indianapolis, were separated by just two days, were observed at approximately the same time of day, and include certain similarities of description.

Both incidents are clearly non-astronomical.

Drawings are available for both objects observed, and, although they are considerably different, they might conceivably represent the same object viewed on edge and in plan. Both have approximately the same shape, although the scale given by one observer is about three times that given by the other. Both have ratios of length to width. If these objects were real, it seems to be straining coincidence too far to assume that they were entirely independent of each other.

Was there by any chance some special under-experience going on in the vicinity of Indianapolis at that time?

Barring hallucinations, these two incidents and incidents #17, 40, 75, and 84 seem to be the most tangible, from the standpoint of description, of all these reported, and the most difficult to explain away as sheer nonsense.

It should be noted that both incidents #61 and #62 had two observers.
