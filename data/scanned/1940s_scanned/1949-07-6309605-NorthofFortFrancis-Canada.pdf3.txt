MC IN                                    ACTIONS                                         19 Sept 49                                            1

1. The inclosed report of Investigation, File No. 2L-53, dated 6 September 1949,
by S/A Elbert V. Faris, 12900-CS-1, is forwarded for your comments as to the possibility
of the recent poliomyelitis epidemics having been uranium poisoning.

2. It is desired that this matter be coordinated with the appropriate .ero Medical
Laboratory office in order to satisfy the requirements as listed under Undeveloped Leads
section of referenced report.

3. This office can discern no basis for such a theory, since it has been shown
that all reports of flying objects do not refer to the same type object, and there is
no evidence of radioactivity in any case.
