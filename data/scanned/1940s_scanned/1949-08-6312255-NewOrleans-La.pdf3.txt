The photograph shows an elongated, vertical object that appears to be solid and slightly blurry, against a plain background. It looks like a common representation of a fast-moving object in the sky, usually described as a possible UFO or other unexplained aerial phenomenon. There is a ruler placed at the bottom for scale, which ranges from 6 inches to 10 inches, indicating that the object depicted in the image might be considered in comparison to this scale. 

The text in the document is not fully legible due to the quality of the image, but the visible parts appear to be as follows:

- The word "CONFIDENTIAL" is visible in the top left corner.
- The word "UNCL" is visible in the top-right corner, which could be part of the word "UNCLASSIFIED."
- The word "UNCLASSIFIED" is clearly visible at the bottom center of the page, underneath the ruler.

Please note that the image is not clear, and the interpretation of some parts of the text may not be accurate.
