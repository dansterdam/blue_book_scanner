Report of Foreign Object in Sky

Major Campbell 332d Fighter Group,

No information came out of critiques while the Fighter Group was at
Godman Field to indicate the appearance of any foreign objects in the sky.
Pilots were questioned as to whether they had seen anything unusual while 
flying in this vicinity or had contacted anyone at Godman Field, and replied 
in the negative. Maj. Campbell, personally, has not noticed anything unusual.

Capt. Watson investigated and received the following information:

Mr. _______ Tower Operator. He says he saw what he thought was a star 
but then he noticed the sky was overcast so it couldn't have been a star.
It was a glowing object with a cone-shaped streak to the right. It glowed 
from white to amber. He says he first noticed it over the Lockbourne Power 
Plant just southwest of here. The object was moving southwest and it changed 
from amber to red and then disappeared. This happened between 1915 and 1930 
EST on 7 January. The only thing he did was to talk to Capt. McJoe about it 
and ____ the DF Operator.

Mr. _______ DF Operator. He says he saw it too before he and Mr. _______ 
got together. Both observed it at the same time but didn't talk it over 
until after the thing had disappeared and said each was looking at it without
knowing it. He saw a strange light that faded out and came back again. 
This light was west southwest of the field about 15Â° above the horizon.
The light was much brighter than a star and appeared too big to be venus unless 
it was very near or in some seriously odd atmospheric condition.
Back to side. It dipped to the horizon and back again several times. It 
also made several circles and it appeared to have a streak to the right of it.

Capt. McJoe, Assistant Operations Officer, he saw the same thing about 1925 EST
he was flying at the time. he noticed a bright and unusual light southwest
of Lockbourne and at first it looked like a spotlight but then noticing it
there was no beam from the light at its source. As he turned on final approach
to land he noticed that the light disappeared as if it had been turned out.
After he landed he gave it no further concern until he walked into Operations
and the tower operator asked him if he had seen the light. Immediately 
after this conversation the Tower Operator called him outside the building 
to look again because the light had re-appeared. The light appeared further
west and much lower in the sky. His color had changed from a white color to
an orange color, as it continued to flicker and more westward and appeared to
go out.
