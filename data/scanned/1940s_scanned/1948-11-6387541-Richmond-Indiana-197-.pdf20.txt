SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO :    Commanding General
        Air Material Command
        Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
        Dayton, Ohio
        ATTN: AMC/AO-X

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, CIAXS, 
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first 
endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 235 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy 
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction 
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is 
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Plotting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

                            FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
