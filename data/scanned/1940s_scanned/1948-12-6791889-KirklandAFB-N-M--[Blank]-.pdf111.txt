UNCLASSIFIEE
Lt. Col. Doyle Rees -2- December 30, 1948

It is found that the fireball visually observed by Reeses, ______ and _______, 
______, and ________ appeared at a height of at least 120 miles and descended at
an angle of about 45° to the vertical (according to witness estimates) to a 
point C at an elevation of only 22.3 miles above the horizontal plane through 
the point C, at which it leveled off and flew C to its point of disappearance, D, 
the fireball followed a nearly horizontal path approximately 7.5 miles long mov-
ing with a velocity of between 3.75 and 7.75 miles per second, depending on the 
duration estimate adopted. The coordinates of the projection of C on the earth 
are 35° 55' N., 105° 30' W., and those of the projection of D are 35° 57' N., 
106° 23' W. The forward extension of the fireball's nexus on the earth of the 
downward flight by the above parabolas passes some miles to the northwest of the 
town of Los Alamos.

It should be noted that the ascending branch of the path of the fireball 
was observed by Inspector _______ only; but was so substantially curved that 
his observation of this portion of the path admits of no doubt. It should also be 
noted that no sound was heard, although the distance from the observer to the 
fireball and from the fireball to the earth could have been only a few miles 
at most. It may no be particularly deserving that an object possessing the real 
path and the other peculiarities thereof ___ by witness, ________, ________  
and _________ was not a falling meteorite.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS. 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
