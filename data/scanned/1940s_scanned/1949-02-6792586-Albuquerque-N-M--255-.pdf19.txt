OBSERVATION:

STATEMENT BY OBSERVER:

I was returning from Station 101 to Station 100.

While on the straight stretch of road adjacent to the
airstrip I happened to glance toward the north at
which time I observed a greenish colored light mov-
ing across the northern sky toward the east. It was
traveling on a course parallel to the surface of the
earth. It was visible for approximately two seconds.

It did not appear to travel beyond my range of vision,
but suddenly disappeared as I was watching it. It
did not leave a trail in the sky nor did it appear to
burn a tail like a meteor.

Due to the very short time that it was visible I am
unable to estimate the rate of speed or altitude of
the object.
