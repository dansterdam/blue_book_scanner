Incident #205 — cancelled — (see #129

THE OREGONIAN, THURSDAY, JULY 3, 1947 11

Pilot Recalls
Seeing Discs

Dick Rankin Tells
Of Odd Aircraft

More reports of "flying flap-
jacks" turned up Wednesday,
one from no less than Dick
Rankin, brother of the late Tex
Rankin, and himself an exper-
ienced pilot of more than 1500
hours' flying time.

Rankin, who is recovering
from an old back injury re-
ceived in an automobile acci-
dent, came to Portland over
the week end to spend the sum-
mer. He saw the "silver sauc-
ers" over Bakersfield, Cal.,
he said.

June 23, while living on the
Lilaun without her, he told The
Oregonian.

He hesitated to say much
about them. Rankin said. "un-
til I noticed all the hullaballoo
in the papers. I puzzled over
their strange appearance a while
and finally concluded that they
were the navy's new XF5U-1
flying flajacks, which are thin
and round with twin propellers
and stubby tail."

Only One XF5U-1 Built

The navy announced officia-
lly (here have and the manufac-
turer have announced definite-
ly) that only one such machine
was built and that it never left
Connecticut.

"These planes were flying
high — maybe 9000 feet, and fair-
ly fast. I first counted ten of
them, about 300 or 400 miles
an hour, about 300 feet long
them in formation coming north.
About 2:15 P. M. they headed
on the reserve course, returned
south. But there were only sev-
en, in the formation."

3 July 1947

"They were not weaving or
bobbing in formation I couldn't
make out the number-as-
tion of their propellers; and
couldn't distinguish any wings
or tail. They appeared almost
round. They looked like pic-
tures of the navy's flying flap-
jacks". Rankin said.

Rankin, who plans to spend
the summer here at 834 N. E.
Thompson street, is now able to
resume a little flying for fun,
but not commercially. He said
he now operates a string of
auto courts, spending the win-
ters at Palm Springs.

Tax Descriptions Chief

Rankin's description of the
mysterious aerial objects agrees
with that of Kenneth Arnold,
Boise, Idaho business man who
first reported them over the
state of Washington, except that
Arnold likened them at an es-
timated 1200 miles an hour,
out of proportions at Wenatchee
they from Astoria came.

Mark Hayes, patient in St.
Mary's Hospital, there, said he
saw two of the discs Monday

flying air balls".

mind, near the Solo, Fox Sa-
veil, said she saw a silver stew-

Sidney B. Gallagher of Centralia
said he set saw nine aluminum-
lustrous objects flying north at 3
P. M. June 24. He was working
11 miles southwest of Mineral,
Wash., at the time.
