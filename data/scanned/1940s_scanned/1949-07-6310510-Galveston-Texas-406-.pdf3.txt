NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

Remarks:

When object was about a 90Â° angle over Galveston, it appeared to stop. This impression may have been gained by the high altitude and angle of flight and it could have been that the object did not stop but merely reached an apex in its flight from observer's position. At this moment observer called his wife's attention to the object, and immediately thereafter the object disappeared into the west at a tremendous speed, in just a few seconds; just seemed to fade into the distance at the level of flight at which it was first observed.
