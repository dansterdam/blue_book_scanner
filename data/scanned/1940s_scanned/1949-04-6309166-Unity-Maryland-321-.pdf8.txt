The image contains three separate sketches labeled #1, #2, and #3. The sketches appear to depict unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

#1 shows a long, curved object with a shape somewhat reminiscent of a boomerang or a crescent.
#2 is a sketch of an object with a central bulge and blurred or fuzzy edges, giving an impression of motion.
#3 is a more detailed sketch of an oval-shaped object with what appears to be several portholes or lights, and lines suggesting movement or a trail behind it.
