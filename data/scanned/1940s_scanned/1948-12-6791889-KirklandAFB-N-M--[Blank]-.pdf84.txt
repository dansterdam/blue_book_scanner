Incident: 227

of these meteor showers normally produce extremely bright green fireballs 
such as those recently observed. For example, the observation mentioned by 
Mr Manning (Incident 231) occurred near the maximum of the Quadrantid shower 
of early January. More spectacular observation of August was near the time 
of the Perseid shower (Incident 230) and the December observations (223, 223a 
224, 226, 227, all fell in the interval covered by the Geminid shower. 
This relationship might indicate an attempt to render the green fireballs less 
conspicous by causing them to appear only when there is considerable meteoric 
activity. 

h. As noted in an earlier communication the remarkably vivid green 
color reported for most of the December fireballs is rarely observed in the 
case of genuine meteorites. By laboratory test, this peculiar color seems to be 
identical with that given off by copper salts in the blowpipe flame. If this 
identification is correct, the wavelength of the radiation from the green 
fireball is near Î» = 5218 A.

i. The duration estimates of between 2 and 3 seconds reported for the 
green fireballs are considerably longer than those (0.1 - 0.5 seconds) for 
the ordinarily visual meteors, but shorter than the duration estimates invar-
iable reported in the case of a genuine meteorite fall (5 to 30 seconds or 
even longer). 

j. None of the green fireballs seem to have a train of sparks or a 
dust cloud following. This contrasts sharply with the behavior noted in 
case of meteorite fireballs - particularly those that penetrate to the very 
low levels where the green fireball of December 12 was observed.

NOTE: Inquiry at Holloman AF Base, Alamogordo, N. M., revealed that 
research work at night and on Sundays does not involve the use of 
any lighting device or flares such as described in the various 
reports submitted.
