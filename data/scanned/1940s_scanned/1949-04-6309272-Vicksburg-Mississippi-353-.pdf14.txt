total time of observation of about 60 seconds.

The object was not a balloon and was some distance away. Assuming
escape velocity, a track is enclosed which figures elevation above the sta-
tion of about 300,000 feet over the observed period. If this is true, the
flight would have probably gone over the White Sands Proving Ground,
Holloman Air Force Base, and Los Alamos.
