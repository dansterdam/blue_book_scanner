UNCLASSIFIED

Moffett Field, California
2 August 1949

On 24 May 1949, at approximately 5:00 p.m., while fishing with several friends about two and a half miles up the Rogue River from Gold Beach, Oregon, one attention was drawn to an object in the sky by Mr. [Redacted]. To the naked eye this object appeared circular and standing on edge. I then focused a pair of 6-power Navy type binoculars and saw that it was indeed circular and that we appeared to be looking upward at the bottom side of it. As nearly as was possible to tell, the object appeared about 5000 feet in altitude, and not more than a mile away. When I first observed it, object was moving very slowly. As I put the glasses on, it made a turn to the South, with no banking or leaning, and picked up speed. I then handed the glasses to [Redacted] in order that he might see the object. Observed through the glasses, the object appeared to be made of a very natural, thin grey Aluminum or some somewhat oval. It was thinner to the edges and thick in the center. A transverse fin appeared to rise completely around on top to a trailing end of the object viewed as it traveled. There were no openings visible and no sounds heard. There appeared to be no engines or motors, no landing gear, no other protruding parts other than the fin vaguely described. The object was in sight for approximately three (3) minutes. Sun was at our backs and there were no clouds.
