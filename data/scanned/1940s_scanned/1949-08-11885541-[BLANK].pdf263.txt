To summarize the discussion thus far: the chan.e of spaoe
travelers existinc at olants attached to nelghborinc stars is very
much creater than the chante of space-travelinr Martian". The
one can be viewed almost as a certainty (if the assumptions are
accepted), whereas the other is very slight indeed.

In osder to estimate to relative chan.es that visitors from
Mars or star x could come to the Earth and act like "flyinc ohiects",
some discussion of characteristics of spaoe ships is necessary.

To handle the simple case first, a trip from Mars to Earth
should be feasible using a rocket-powered vehicle. One here, the
rocket would probably use more fuel in slowinc down for a landing
than it did in initial takeoff, due to Earth's higher gravitational
force.

A rough estimate of one-way performance can by found by adding
the so-called "escape velocity" of Mars to that of the Earth olus
the total energy chante (kinetic and potential) used in, transferring
from one planetary orbit to the other. These are 3.1, 7.9, and 7.0
miles per second, respectively, givinc a total required performance
of 20.0 miled per second for a one-way flight. Barring a refueling
mission, the vehicle would have to land and replenish or else carry
100% reserves for the trip home.

Let us assume the Martians have developed a nuclear, hydro-
propelled vehicle (the most efficient basic arrancement that has
been conceived here on Earth) which uses half its stages to get here
and the remainincr states to return to Mars, thus completes a round
trip without refueling but slowinc down enough in our atmosphere
to be easily visible (i.e., practically markir a landinc). Since it
is nuclear powered, gas temperatures will be limited to the maximum
operating temperatures, the materials can withstand (heat must transfer
from the pile to the gas so coolinc can't be used in the pile).
The lightest minting point material on/which we can find
uranium carbide. It has a melting point of 4050oR. Assume the Martians
are capable of realizing a gas temperature of 4500oR (= 2500oK), and
that they also have alloys which make himh motor pressures (3000
psi) eoonomical. Then the specific Impulse will be I = 1035 seconds
and the exhaust velocity will be I * g = 33,400 ft/sec (reference 5).
Calculations show that using a single state for each leg of the journey
would reauire a fuel/qross weight ratio or,96 (for each state)
too hiph to be practical. Using two states each way (four altoqether)
brings the requred fuel ratio down to .91, a value that can be
realized.

If, by the development of strong alloys, the basic weight could
be kept to 10% of the total weicht for each stage, a resulted of 9%
could be used for payload. A four stage vehicle would then have a
gross weicht (100%) 15,000 times as great as the payload: thus,
if the payload were 2,000 pounds, the cross weight would be 30 million
pounds at initial takeoff (Earth pounds).
