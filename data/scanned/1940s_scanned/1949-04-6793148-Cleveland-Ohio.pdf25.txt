United Airlines Radio and asked them to change their No. 625 Flight over to his frequency, **** contacted the plane but by this time, the plane was over Elyria, Ohio, and the pilots stated that he could not and had not seen anything unusual. ***** stated what the light appeared to be 5 to 10 miles away, 12,000 feet above sea level, and due north of the tower at about 50 degrees from the ground. An attempt was made to contact the object with regative results. At first, it was believed to be a helicopter but a helicopter couldn't maintain such a steady position. ***** stated that he had had previous experience in sighting balloon lights but saw none that he could honestly say had no balloons. ******** tells us that balloons usually change within. This light was a deep red light as an aircraft light. There was no evidence of a twinkle, or do or sound from the object. There was practically unrestricted visibility with no cloud illumination. ***** stated that he also considered the possibility that the light had been a star but dismissed this also because stars including orange in color. Also, he stated that a plane could not maintain steady position like these objects and fading away would be much more gradual. There was steady at about 5 to 15 miles from the airport. **** **** not wear glasses.

known the Aerial Phenomena from time to Gabrial Tower at the airport on 6 April [19] between 2215 and 2305 hours, it appears to be northeast from the airport, probably in the thanger lines at about 15 degrees from the ground, approximately 10 to 12 miles away, and appeared to be red in color. He stated that he would not venture to state its size but it was as big as the moon. **** Tried to establish radio contact with the object but failed to receive any reply. It was at absolutely clear night with clouds. **** that it might have been a jet plane but is not no trails or white appeared through the optical glasses with 75x to 150x and no change of circular object through this medium it seems to come to one spot for over an one spot he didn't think like an ordinary aircraft, red light had claimed to have saw a kind object looked less than a minute to move from side and going up and down and a brilliant reddish color, **** contacted both Akron and Selfridge Field to see if they had any jet planes in the Cleveland vicinity with negative results. It might have been a balloon but that was practically impossible as there was no wind and when the winds were checked it was found that they were moving in a normal circle at about 10 to 12 miles per hour. The nearest radar station is at Columbus, Ohio, **** made the observation. From the ramp around the Control Tower, **** does not **** glasses.

5. On 23 April 1949, Mr. **** **** **** ****, Control Tower Operator, Cleveland, Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in substance that at about 2255 hours on 5 April 1949, he saw a red light which seemed like a red ball about two south of the control tower, roughly about 10 to 15 miles away at about 25 to 30 degrees from the ground. Occasionally, lights are crafts come in over field with red antic and he thought this is one of these.
