`SUMMARY OF INFORMATION`

`Confirming telephoned report on this date, information is furnished that according to an Associated Press dispatch from Hamlet, N.C. dated 28 December 1949 which was published in the Charlotte Observer on 29 December 1949, a strange unidentified aircraft, resembling a balloon or blimp, was reported flying erratically over Hamlet, at approximately 1645 on 28 December 1949, apparently "out of control". According to the above dispatch several residents, including two pilots, gave various reports of the craft as "heading straight down" and "levelling off" and "turning over". One observer stated that he thought he saw something resembling a man drop from the craft and one pilot, who chased it in an airplane, said it appeared to be from 20 to 30 feet in diameter. (F-3)`

`It was first reported flying West over town at about 1645 by Dr. _, the local drapper, N.C. and overseas news correspondent, They reported the ship off the Hamlet airport where an overseas news correspondent, Air Force pilots, took to in a light plane to chase the craft. It definitely was not saucer shaped. The craft only once from the air and that it a former Air Force pilot, said he saw the craft was without any external fittings such as are ordinarily carried by free balloons. All these observers said the craft did not seem to have much speed from the ground, but the newsman reported it quickly disappeared in the sun when he drew near. The newsman said he last saw it about 12 miles Southwest of here." (F-3)`

`The weather station at Charlotte said there was some possibility that the object was a radiosonde balloon such as are released by weather stations at Greensboro and Fort Bragg, N.C. each morning about 1000. The balloons are used to transmit weather data from the atmosphere, and ordinarily burst at high altitude, the radio parachuting back to earth. However, the weather station said that the fact that it was seen over Hamlet, N.C. so late in the afternoon tended to discount this theory. _ said that he had chance from his Air Force service he was familiar with these balloons and that the strange craft did not resemble one. It was much bigger, he stated. He added that the fact that it did not change altitude for a long period of time also tended to disprove it was a balloon." (F-3)`

`According to another article in the above newspaper on 29 December 1949 several residents of Pageland, S.C. reported seeing a strange object in the sky moving westward on the afternoon of 28 December 1949. "The object, according to the reports, was not moving at a very fast rate, but persons who attempted to follow it in an automobile soon lost it in the evening sun, they reported.‚Äù (F-3)`
