DATE: 13 March 1949

OFFICE OF THE AC OF S, G-2, Headquarters Fourth Army, Fort Sam Houston, Texas

SUBJECT: UNUSUAL LIGHTS
(152.1 ALRAD)

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

   Eight moving "lights" appeared in the atmosphere over or in the vicinity
of the "Q" area, ASTP, Camp Hood, Texas, on the evening of 17 March 1949.
At the time of these sightings, the alert guard of the 2nd Armored Division,
under the Assistant AC of S, G-2 at Camp Hood, was in the area concerned and
prepared to fire at these and record subsequent readings of elevation and azimuth.
The purpose was to check the powers of observation of "B" observation and
previously reported possible phenomena observed on 6-7-8 March 1949 and heretofore
reported in Summary of Information, this headquarters, dated 17 March 1949.
Subjects "Humanoid Lights." However, before this operation could be begun,
the series of 8 unusual "lights" appeared.

of observers. Time was clocked at instant of sighting. Captain McCullough,
the Assistant G-2, personally observed three of the lights. Physical character-
istics of these "lights" were reported as "quite different" from those reported
on 6-7-8 March 1949. One burst into a green cluster. One was reddish, another
white. One observer described some of them as similar to "Very Pistol" flares.

arrived in the vicinity of the alert crew from the 2nd Armored Division.
