There are no photographs present in this image. The image contains typewritten text, which I will now transcribe:

Incident No. 215 -- 3 Dec. 1949, 2015 Hours, Fairfield-Suisun
Air Force Base, California.
The base control tower operator saw for 25 seconds a bright white
light in the air. It came into view two miles away at 500 to 1000 ft.
above the city. It LEFT at 1000 ft. it slowed for a few seconds to
200 MPH at this time, it undulated or bounced; rose vertically to
3000 ft and immediately afterwards climbed quickly to 20,000 ft and was
lost to sight.

MXC Opinion: There is no logical explanation for this incident
that fits the available evidence.
