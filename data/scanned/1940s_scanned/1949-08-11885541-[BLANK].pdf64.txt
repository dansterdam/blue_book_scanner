Incident #15 -- Columbus, Ohio -- 31 July 48

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.
If the information offered is to be given any weight at
all, the most likely explanation is that a cluster of balloons, or
a balloon with several flare-pots hanging below it, was observed.
Corroboration for this interpretation is promptly furnished by
incidents #15 and #17, which occurred a few hours later near this
location. The object reported in #17 proved to be a "county-fair"
type balloon.
