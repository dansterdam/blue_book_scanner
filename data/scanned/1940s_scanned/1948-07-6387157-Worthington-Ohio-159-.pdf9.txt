SUBJECT: Unidentified Airborne Object.

TO : Major H.M. Campbell, U.S. Air Force

1. On the evening of Friday 30 July 1948, from my home west of **** Street, Worthington, Ohio, I saw an object in the southwest sky that did not look like any of the aircraft that I am familiar with. I first saw this object at exactly 2015 hours. The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape, with no apparent wings or tall surfaces. There were no standard marker lights displayed, and no engine noises. The object did, however, emit a steady silver glow.

2. I should judge that its altitude was approximately 3000 feet and moving very slow in a southwest course. It was in my line of vision until 2030 hours. There were no other aircraft, military or civilian, in the vicinity of my hearing or vision. The sky was clear with high scattered clouds and visibility was good.

2 August 1943

Worthington, Ohio

Upon questioning, Mr. [redacted] revealed nothing more than the above, except that his wife saw the same sight.
