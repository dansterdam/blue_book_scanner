Incident #91 – Montgomery, Alabama – 28 June 1947

No astronomical object could possibly behave in the
manner described in this incident.

A small lighted balloon at the mercy of changeable
winds aloft might offer a possible explanation.

(The stated position of the moon at the time has been
checked and found to be 'correct'.)
