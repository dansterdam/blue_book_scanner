Dear Mrs. [REDACTED]

Your letter of April 23rd to Mr. [REDACTED] with its
inclosures, has been referred to this office during his
temporary absence and we wish to thank you very much for
your patriotic interest.

We assure you, Mrs. [REDACTED] that rather than being treated
lightly, your reports of information concerning unusual aerial
phenomena have in every case been studied by those persons con-
cerned with such matters.

We sincerely hope that you will continue to send any further
reports of these sightings, should they occur, to the Air Materiel
Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.

Very truly yours,

[Signature block redacted]

JOEL T. MALLOY
Colonel, USAF

From:
Wildwood, N. J.

July 17th/48

This is to inform you that there is activity in Wildwood again and after
several weeks' absence the saucers have been appearing since July 1st, the enclosed 
from a recent "Life" gives almost a perfect reproduction of what we see here.
The color is the same as a gaslight. It would be advisable to watch over Wildwood.

/s/ Sincerely 

NOTE3 This longhand note was sent on UAF ltr to McCoy
