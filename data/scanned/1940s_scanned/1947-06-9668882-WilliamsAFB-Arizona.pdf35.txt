The image contains two illustrations related to the observation of an unidentified object. The first illustration is a side profile view depicting angles of elevation against a background with buildings and clouds, suggesting a way to measure the angle of the object above the horizon. It is accompanied by an angle scale on the left, which ranges from the horizon (0°) up to the zenith (90°). The second illustration is a compass rose, labeled with cardinal and intercardinal directions, to indicate the direction where the object was seen.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you lost sight. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you lost the object.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? ________

Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
