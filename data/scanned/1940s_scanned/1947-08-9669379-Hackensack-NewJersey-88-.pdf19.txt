The image provided appears to be a scanned page of a handwritten document. The photograph portion of the document is not visible in this image, as it appears to only contain written text. Below is the text as best as I can transcribe it from the document:

The scan quality is poor and the handwriting is difficult to decipher, leading to many words being unintelligible or uncertain. Additionally, the text is partially obscured by whatever process was used to obscure the presumably classified information (This is indicated by the faded, blurry white patches and the word 'UNINTELLIGIBLE' in brackets). The document appears to be a memo or report with handwritten notes, possibly related to a sighting or UFO report, given the context provided in your question.
