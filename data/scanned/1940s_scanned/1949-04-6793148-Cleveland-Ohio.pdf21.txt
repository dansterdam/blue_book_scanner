PROJECT GRUDGE

DETAILS:

1. This phase of the investigation was conducted by Special Agents GEORGE
SIMPSON and ROBERT F. DENISON.

AT CLEVELAND, OHIO

2. On 22 April 1949 and 6 May 1949, Mr. -------, Close:
Claims Administrator Building, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio,
stated in substance that at about 2300 hours on 6 April, 1949, he was driving
from Garfield Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, to his home at ------------, Cleveland,
Ohio, when he noticed a red object about three to five miles high to the south
by southwest. It was about 45 degrees, had a swaying motion, and a variation
in brilliancy. From his home, the object appeared to be approximately 1 1/2
miles east southeast to the 1000 lights in the WAL TOWER. The object
had no flame, trail, or odor and made no noise. The object traveled eastward,
moving very slowly, and was visible about 15 to 20 minutes. The object appeared
to be about 6-7000 feet high. There were no clouds and there had been clear
visibility from 2200 hours. The night before there was some meteor outside night
after this incident, the lights on a balloon used as a studio twist at first thought
it might have been a balloon from Lakehurst. The studio twist was, it lay on
its side with no ballasted outward. On coming in on the balloon, the gadgetry
dimmer and on faded out completely. There is a projection or ceiling light
at the north by northeast edge of the airport which juts over some pipes. This
light is exactly 1176 feet from the Control Tower at the Airport and projects
a light streaming up and shines into the clouds. Some observers think the beam
of this light is what reflects causes this U-shaped glare and the whole was a
U-shape, this shows a triangular vapour arms to the shine and was taken
from Cloady Avenue to Murray Avenue, Cleveland, and the approximate location of 
the object. (See Thomas L. ____, Local Representative) Mr. ____ also enclosed
furnished copies of the official weather report for 5, 6, and 7 April 1949. (See
Inclosure 20)

3. On 22 April 1949, Mr. ________, Senior Controller, Air Traffic
Control, Cleveland Municipal Airport, Cleveland, Ohio, stated in an interview
that on the night of 5 April 1949, Mr. CAA, had come up in the
control tower for a visit. Looking to the north, they noticed a light that
looked like a passing or navigation light of a P-11, far enough and high enough
that the two lights would blend together. It appeared to be a passing light
because when they are not directly in front of you, they change intensity
from bright to dull red almost like winking its for short, and steady when
All last did not move). This later statement is for believing that it might be
a position so they opened the window and it still didn't work. They then
observed the light through binoculars with a 7x50 lens. It looked like a
blinking round ball, rather like two bright red lights from about 2255 to 2303
when it dimmed out just like turning a kerosene light out.
                                                                                        continued
