Streets. This man gave no indication that he was aware of being followed; however, it occurs to me that he took a strange route if Annapolis or that section was his ultimate destination. Will try again next week if we do not learn something in the interim.

The building they occupied in Catonsville is rented thru Chas. H. Steffey, 336 North Charles Street, Baltimore. There is a possibility Steffey knows where his late tenants have gone.

None of the stockholders in this area have any knowledge of their whereabouts. Every act of this outfit indicates that they are out to beat the public; if we catch up with them again would suggest that no leniency be shown.

Grey Goose account used to be in the Maclachlan Banking Corp., 10th and G. Streets, N.W. The airplanes, engines, tools, materials, etc. which they abandoned in the old shop at 923 Kenilworth Ave., N.E., was sold at public auction last Friday under orders of the U. S. Marshal, to apply on the rent claim of H. C. Walker and Son, owners of the building.

I shall continue my search for these people and will advise you of any facts uncovered. Meanwhile if you have any suggestions I would be pleased to have the benefit of same.

Very truly yours,
