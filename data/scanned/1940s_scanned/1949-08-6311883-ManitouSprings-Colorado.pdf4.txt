4. Description of Terrain. The place of sighting was approximately one quarter of a mile south of US Highway 24 on the ________ Highway, Manitou Springs, Colorado. The map coordinates of this location are approximately 38° 47' north latitude and 104° 59' west longitude. The terrain is extremely mountainous, being in the foothills of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The altitude at the place of sighting is approximately 6,500 feet and the region over which the object was sighted is approximately 10,500 feet. The writer was able to observe the ridge between Cameron's Cone and Mt. Arthur from the same point from which the object was sighted by Mr. ________. Despite the fact that this is extremely mountainous country, a clear view was had of this ridge.

5. The altitude of the object would be approximately 10,500 feet above sea level and the observer sighted it at an approximate 70 to 60 horizontal angle. His position was facing the object at the time of sighting.

6. Concerning the observer. Mr. ________ is presently unemployed, having been released from Civil Service on 30 June 1949, due to reduction in force. He was a pipe fitter at Camp Carson, Colorado. Prior to this employment, he was working for the Midland Railroad Company as a track gandy. This employment was terminated due to the closing down of the railroad. Mr. ________ is 57 years old. It is necessary for him to wear bi-focal glasses, and he claims to be far sighted, hence the glasses. He claims that he has never had any trouble with his ability to discern colors and objects. Interviews were held with friends, former employers and former fellow employees of Mr. ________ and they could throw no further light on his abilities for observation. The writer was unable to observe Mr. ________ to formulate any opinions of his own. In talking with his friends, it was ascertained that Mr. ________ is considered to be a very reliable person. However, it is known that he is a very talkative individual.

7. An extensive investigation was conducted by the writer in an attempt to locate other individuals who might have observed this object; however, these attempts met with negative results. Further, the writer personally observed the terrain and talked to individuals who had opportunity to observe this terrain in their everyday work with the thought in mind that the object could have possibly been weather equipment and could have gone down in this vicinity. This also met with negative results. It is known that the US Weather Bureau in Denver very frequently sends up various types of weather balloons, and inasmuch as the winds aloft at this time were from the north and northeast, the possibilities of one of those balloons entering this area are very good.

8. A check of operations at Peterson Field revealed that there were no aircraft, to their knowledge, in flight at the time of this sighting.
