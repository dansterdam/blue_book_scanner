initials: acv – near Red Liver, Oregon – 11 [REDACTED] or late

The gist of this incident is that a 'flash' of light was
seen and a terrific sound of explosion heard at about 2115 on
a rainy evening. Clearly this description could apply to any
type of explosion, such as 'unit' of a demolition dump or factory;
however, it is true that when a bolide explodes a blinding flash
or light is seen, and tremendous sounds are sometimes heard for
many seconds. Since this was observed at the time of this in-
cident, and a light rain was falling, the earlier part of the
trail of the fireball (if that is what it was) was, of course,
not visible; only the flash from the final explosion, which
would have appeared essentially stationary, was seen.

In the absence of positive evidence of any other type
of explosion occurring in that vicinity at the time, it is the
opinion of this investigator that a bolide explosion was observed.
