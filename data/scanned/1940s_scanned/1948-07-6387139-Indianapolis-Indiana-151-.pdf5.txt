The image does not contain a photograph; it is a drawing or a schematic.

The text in the document reads:

```
1-1/2' x 2'

WHITISH LIGHT AT ANGLES INDICATES
THAT OBJECT MAY POSSIBLY
HAVE BEEN SAUCER SHAPED.

Line on ground indicates
direction of travel â†’
```

The image seems to represent a side view sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO) with associated annotations or dimensions, possibly derived from a witness report.
