Subject: Investigation of Unidentified Flying Object      2 May 1949

sausage shaped in that both the forward and trailing ends resembled
a B-29 nose. The object was on a heading approximately north to
south and approached Sanders aircraft from 12 o'clock, at which time
he made his first observation. The object disappeared to the rear
of the B-29 Hill and then apparently made a 3600 turn around it as ****
made his second observation approximately fifteen (15) seconds later
when the object appeared to him right and made a 1800 turn in front of
him, again disappearing to the rear. The total length of time for
both of these observations was approximately twenty (20) seconds. The
object at the time was reported to be within the scattered clouds at
20,000 feet, by 1300 miles an estimated (86) 36, down point 34, with a
radar cone *50 by 10 at about [unreadable] 125 per hour. The *** the
width was one (1) mile, with fog ceiling due to scattered stratus.
Weather conditions were rapidly changing at the time. The object
appeared to about 20' above the observers horizon. Its size in com-
parison to the hand held at an arms length from the face was about that
of the index and third finger. The object had no definite color and
no luminosity. There were no projections observed. There appeared to
be no aircraft on clouds in the vicinity and **** asserts that the ***
ject was drawn in the object by the glow of a navigation jet from the
object. Jet Glow is a jet type of engine jet projectile that it atters
lights to jet going variable on all planes. From exactly behind the
aircraft, Jet Glow is within the upper engine this color wash that in the
object. *********** stated that the object was dissipating as vapor
back of the B-29 at the time of the observation and saw nothing of the
object. The attempts to contact *** by pilot flying the *** and *** by
vision who was approximately ten (10) minutes behind him to ask him to
start for *** *** object. Smith was answered by an unidentified voice over
the radio whom he believed to be the pilot he was calling. Upon land-
ing however, his discovery that although the other pilot had received
his message he had not been able to contact **** because of the inter-
ference created by the unidentified person answering same call. The
other pilot likewise observed nothing of the object.

page 2. It will be noted that the original report of this incident
was sent to Air Material Command from March Flight Service Center. In-
vestigation revealed that March Flight Service Center was informed of
the occurrence by a report from Los Angeles Control Center. This Con-
trol Center probably received its information from one (1) or more of
four (4) Radio Range Stations in the vicinity. These are the Baker's
Field Radio, Lancaster Radio, Tevinall Radio or Los Angeles Radio. It
is believed that it was **** operator on duty at one of these Range
Stations that answered **** call, although he did not identify himself.
and no information of a more definitive nature could be obtained.
