Extract from Weekly Intelligence Summary, AIC, 23 Jan 48

UNIDENTIFIED AIR OBJECT: The A-2, Atlantic Division, Air Transport Command
reports that while flying over Hartford, Connecticut at approximately 1630
hours, 10 January 1948, Captain Emil J. Smith, AL 730100, AC-6606 and Captain James
H. Paire, AL 800-334 of Squadron "R" at the M-20 Section, Easton Maryland observed
object shooting toward the earth at an angle of 450. The object appeared to
be a disc, had a Bluish center, was rod on its edges. and was traveling at very
high velocity. It had no tail, nor did it leave any sort of trail in the air.
Because of its high velocity and the short space of time that it was sighted,
neither observer could be certain of its size but in general, report that it
resembled a shooting star. It dropped out of sight on the north side of Mt.
Tom, which is near Holyoke, Massachusetts.
