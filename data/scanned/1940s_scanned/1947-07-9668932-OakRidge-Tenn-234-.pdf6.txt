The photograph present on the document appears to be very faded and unclear. It seems there might be a central object that could be a saucer or disk-shaped anomaly in the sky with a very faint outline. However, due to the poor quality and washed-out nature of the photograph, it's difficult to discern precise details. The rest of the photograph is mostly obscured by graininess and lacks clear features.

As for the text, there does not appear to be any text within the image frame that is provided. If there is text outside of the photograph's border within the document, it is not visible in the image you've shared. Therefore, I'm unable to provide an OCR output for any text outside of the photograph.
