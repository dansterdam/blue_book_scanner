SYNOPSIS
On 9 August 1949, this District Office was telephonically advised by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (Butte Office) of the purported sighting at 0930 A. M.,
that date, of eight (8) alleged "flying discs" in the Hebgen Lake, Yellowstone,
Montana, area. Mr. ███████ was contacted telephonically, and the essentials as previously
outlined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was confirmed by this office.
Further information was forthcoming that two of the "flying discs" had
crashed in the immediate surrounding area. On August 10, 11, 12, 1949,
investigation revealed that only one (1) individual actually saw the "flying
discs", Mr. ███████ The others employed as a "guide" by ███████ A pro-
longed search was instituted for the two discs that crashed in the immediate
area with negative results. Interrogation of the only witness revealed him
to be indefinite as to the physical characteristics of "objects" sighted.
Witness further declined to make any signed sworn statement regarding the
sighting of the discs. Inquiries revealed Mr. ███████ to have a
good reputation in all respects in the surrounding community. However, dis-
cussion with Mr. ████████ indicated to this AGENT that witness had a decided
tendency to exaggerate. Mr. ███████ was informed by this AGENT that if he
found either of the two "objects" which crashed, he was to immediately contact
the 15th OSI District (IG) USAF, Great Falls AFB, Montana.
