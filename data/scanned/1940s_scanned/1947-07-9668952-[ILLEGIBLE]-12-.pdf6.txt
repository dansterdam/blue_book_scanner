UNCLASSIFIED
Officer McDowell stated that at approximately 1230, 4 July 1947 while
he was on duty at precinct #1 and feeding the pigeons in the parking
lot back of the station he noticed that the pigeons became quite excited
over something and fluttered in the air. Officer McDowell in looking
around to see what had disturbed them saw 5 large discs in the air east
of Portland; two discs flying south and three flying in an easterly direction.
He stated he could determine no color to the discs but advised they were
dipping in an up and down oscillating motion and were traveling at great
speed. He was unable to give an estimate of the speed or altitude of the
discs as they were out of sight before any detailed observation could be
made. Officer McDowell advised that he notified the Police Radio who
immediately broadcast an alert. He saw no indication of any motivating
force nor heard any sound coming from the discs and could give no description
other than round.
