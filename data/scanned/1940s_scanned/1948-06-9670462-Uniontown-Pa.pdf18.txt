Witness saw a luminous, oval-shaped object flying at an altitude of
approx 5,000 ft which was traveling beneath the base of some scattered cloud
from southwest to northeast across the sky. The weather was stormy and
cloudy and as a second object flew across the sky a flash of lightening
could be seen thru it. It seemed to be transparent. The objects(?) 
traveled very fast and seemed to just disappear within 10 seconds. Each
observed it approximately five minute intervals. There was no odor
or sound etc from the. However, a trail of light about a yard long was
observed. The objects rolled vertically on their edges and appeared to b
spinning end end across the sky. Witnesses lost sight of the objects 
as neighboring houses obstructed their view.
