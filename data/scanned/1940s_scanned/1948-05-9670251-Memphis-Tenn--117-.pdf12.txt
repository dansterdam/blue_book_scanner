Incident #117 == Memphis, Tennessee -- 7 May 1948

It is unlikely that the objects viewed in this incident were meteors, but the possibility is not excluded.

It is unfortunate that some estimate of distance and of time in sight was not made. Objects might have been quite close, in which case large angular velocity would not imply great speed.

This investigator would like to emphasize again the need for better reporting of such incidents.
