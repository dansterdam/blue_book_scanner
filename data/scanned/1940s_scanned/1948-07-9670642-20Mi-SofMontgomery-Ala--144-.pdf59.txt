(MCIAA-3                                              MCIAF                                             7 Dec 53

1. The following comments are offered regarding conclusion number 4 of the attached report:

    a. It does not appear logical to bring in a conclusion regarding space ships when it was not discussed in the body of the report. This is not a conclusion that is based on the report so it does not belong in "Conclusions".

    b. The expression, "It is now aerodynamically feasible for subject configura-tion to fly" implies that it was not feasible until the report was written. This does not make sense.

2. It is suggested that a conclusion to replace that discussed above merely states that an aircraft of the configuration described could support itself in flight by aero-dynamic forces.
