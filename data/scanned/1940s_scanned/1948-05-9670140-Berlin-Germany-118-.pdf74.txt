The document contains two photographs. The photograph at the top shows a circular or elliptical object in the sky, possibly a depiction of a UFO sighting. It is a small, blurry object against a clear background, most likely meant to capture the reported incident. The second photograph, located at the bottom left corner, appears to be an out-of-focus image of a similar elliptical object with the edges not clearly defined, also likely related to UFO sighting reports.

evidently not made.)

It has been unofficially reported that the object was a
Navy cosmic ray balloon. If this can be established, it is to be
preferred as an explanation. However, if one accepts the assumption
that reports from various other locations in the state, prior to the
sans object, any such device must have been a good many miles — -
25 to 30 — in order to have been seen clearly, almost simultaneously,
from places 175 miles apart.

It is entirely possible, of course, that the first sightings
were of some sort of balloon or aircraft, but that when these reports
came to Godman Field, a careful scrutiny of the sky revealed Venus,
and it could by that Lieutenants Mantell did bravely give chase to the
planet, even though whatever object had been the source of the excite-
ment elsewhere had disappeared. At the altitudes that the pilot,
Mantell, Venus would have been very much more easily observed than
from the ground, and it might even be that he did not actually sight
it up until he was at a considerable altitude. The one piece of
evidence that leads this investigator to believe that at time of
Lieutenant Mantell's death he was actually trying to equal Venus is
