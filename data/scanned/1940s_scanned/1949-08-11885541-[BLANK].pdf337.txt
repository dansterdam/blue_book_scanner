Incident No. 151 â€“ 29 July 1948, 0955 hours, Indianapolis, Indiana.
The observers driving a truck saw an object shaped like a broad short propeller traveling 25-30 ft. in a bank just above the trees at thirty ft altitude. It was about 40 feet long, two feet wide and one foot thick, with "cups" on the upper sides of the blades. The object collided with no spinning action, and there was no sound or trail. The object was thought to have fallen, but a search revealed nothing.

A/C Opinion: No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.
