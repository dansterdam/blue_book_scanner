an effort will be made to get the local newspaper to print a story
on the value of simultaneous observations and I will try to get
people in the correct altitude sighting to time as many as possible might make a sighting, and thus permit
compiling speed and elevation data.

If I can be of any further assistance, do not hesitate to call on me.
