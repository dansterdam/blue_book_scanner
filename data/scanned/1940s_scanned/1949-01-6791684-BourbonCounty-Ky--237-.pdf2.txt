To.comlete of Interrogation relative to intelli,.ence end character of observer(s):
appeared to be above average in intelligence and of sound character. Due to harrassing by friends and fellow newsmen, Mr Brannon has assumed a slightly belligerent attitude with respect to his sighting. He has adopted the attitude that he knows what he saw an has not been convinced by any explanation to date.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

At approximately 1630 hours on 16 Jan 1949 while proceeding in his automobile in a southwesterly direction toward Paris, Ky, accompanied by his wife and his niece, Mrs called his attention to the sunlight reflected on the clouds in the western sky. As he gazed into the sky his attention was attracted to a warming shaped object emerging from behind a cloud. The flight of the object emerging from obscurity into reflected light was maintained for less than one minute. Attention was then focused on a "tube of light" that remained behind as the object moved across the sky. Mr made four exposures of the tube of light during its progress. Mr described the course as steady and as though some object on an outward sweeping arc had crossed his field of vision at a great distance from the earth. The fourth and last exposure of the "tube of light" fully extended as published in the Nicholas Country Star and the Kentuckian Citizen is attached as Exhibit "A". (See files)
