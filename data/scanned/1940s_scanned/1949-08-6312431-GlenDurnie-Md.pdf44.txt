Mr. Williard A. Driggers

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Driggers:

Information has come to me that the Gray Goose Airways, Inc. has vanished from their location at Ingleside Avenue and Old Frederick Road.

I am endeavoring to have my investigator locate their whereabouts.

If you have any information for me, please let me have it at once.

The $50.00 payment was the total received by me to date.

Very truly yours,
/s/ John W. Loeber
