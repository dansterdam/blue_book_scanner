The document contains a black rectangle and a black oval shape near the bottom of the page. The rectangle appears to be an area of redaction, and the oval shape does not resemble a photograph but appears more as a graphical element or possibly a redacted image. It does not provide any recognizable detail that would suggest it is a photograph of a UFO or any other identifiable object.
