Dear Mr. Monnig:

      Reference is made to your letter of 16 May 1948 to Commanding General, Air Material Command, attention Major W. A. Faulk. Major Faulk has been transferred; however, the project on which he was working is a continuing one at this Headquarters.

      Enclosed are two technical manuals on the AN/APS-1 and SCR-625 Mine Detectors. No information is available at this Command as to where surplus equipment of this type may be obtained.

      It would be appreciated if you would continue to send any information of the type Major Faulk discussed with you to this Command, attention MCIA/b-3.

                                     Yours very truly,
                                     [Signature]
                                     JAMES C. CRAM
                                     Lt. Col., USAF
                                     Technical Intel Dir.
