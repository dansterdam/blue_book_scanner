The image does not contain a photograph but appears to show two hand-drawn sketches or symbols, which are quite unclear and abstract. 

Below is the text found in the document:

---
Incident #73 -- Boston, Massachusetts -- 4 August 1947

There is nothing in the evidence given here to suggest that the object sighted was astronomical.

The description suggests further that the object may have been a highly distorted reflection image of the sun on a balloon or aircraft. The "deep gold" color ascribed to the object tends to indicate this interpretation.

The handwritten annotation at the bottom right of the document appears to be "Initials", but it is not entirely clear.
