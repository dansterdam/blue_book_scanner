The image appears to be an old, black and white map rather than a photograph. Due to the resolution and quality of the image, extracting text is challenging, particularly as it seems to include many small labels and possibly street names, parcel numbers, or building notations, typical of detailed maps.

However, some more discernible features include labeled areas like "FORT BLISS" and "AUSTIN TERRACE". There are also some larger paths or roads marked, along with a grid-like structure indicating streets and blocks, with some blank spaces that could signify undeveloped land or parks.

Please note that due to the resolution and quality of the image, the text may not be fully accurate or complete. To provide you with the document content accurately, having the actual text or a higher quality image would be necessary. If you require specific details from the document, please consider providing a clearer image or the textual content.
