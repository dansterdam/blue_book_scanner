Incident No. 76 - 13 August 1947, Salmon Dam, Idaho.

Two men reported simultaneously hearing a roar, and looking up observed two objects of undetermined size, several miles distant at about the height which they thought might have been 1000-2000 feet. The objects were "circular or reflected light", and were travelling at "great speed". Although occurring on the same day as Incident No. 75, the descriptions vary widely.

ATC Opinion: There is no information contained in this report to refute the assumption that these men saw two ordinary aircraft at too great a distance to discern details.
