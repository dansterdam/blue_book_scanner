The image provided does not contain a photograph but appears to be a scanned page of a map, possibly related to a Project Blue Book UFO report. The text and details are very faint and difficult to decipher due to the quality of the scan. However, I will output what can be read from the document:

"In Ohio"
"ADJ. GEN. OFFICE"
"[UNINTELLIGIBLE] AFB OHIO"
"Sher's Oh"

There are various other labels and annotations on the map, including contour lines suggesting topography, place names, and grid lines or bearings that were likely used in the context of the report. The text "UNINTELLIGIBLE" represents areas where the text is not clear enough to read due to the scan quality, degradation of the document, or other factors.
