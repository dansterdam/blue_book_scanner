The image provided appears to be a scan of a topographical map, not a photograph, and it seems to represent a specific geographic region with various contour lines, elevation points, place names, and grid lines. There are no obvious UFO-related images or annotations on this map, just the standard elements you'd expect to find on any topographic map.

Unfortunately, due to the low resolution and quality of the image, the text is not clearly legible for transcription. If you can provide a higher resolution image or zoom in on specific sections of the text, I would be able to offer a transcription of the clearer text.
