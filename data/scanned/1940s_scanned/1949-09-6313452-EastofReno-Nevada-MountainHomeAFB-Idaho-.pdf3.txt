6. S/Sgt. ████████ is a veteran USAF gunner with four (4) years
service. He completed 43 combat missions as a waist and
ball-turret gunner on B-17's in the 8th AF Force; is cred-
ited with one (1) FW-190; spent 10½ months as a POW. His
report, while late, is considered excellent in view of his
experience and obvious presence of mind in noting details.
S/Sgt. ████████'s wife and sister-in-law, Mrs. ████████
███████ departed Mountain Home, Idaho, on 3 September 1949
for 30 days ordinary leave to be spent in Los Angeles, Cal.
At exactly 1404 HST (by Sgt ████████ watch) on 5 September,
Sgt Cole was driving west on US 40 approximately 25 miles
East of Reno, Nevada. The day was clear sand bright with
unlimited visibility. His wife, riding in the front right
seat, noticed the disc when it was at about ten degrees
inclination to the rear and off to the right of the car.
She asked her husband, "How what is that thing?", thinking
he would be able to identify it. Sgt ████████ did not look
car but leaned forward over the steering wheel and stooped
up to see what it was. He states he first saw it at about
ten degrees inclination forward and to the right of the car.
His first impression was that its' size in diameter was about
that of a P-38 wingspan, and judging from that estimated its
altitude at around 3,000' to 5,000' and speed from 500 to
600 MPH. However, the shape was unlike any aircraft he had
ever seen before. It was perfectly round with curved sides
that came to a smooth rounded edge. Its' plane was perpen-
dicular to the earth's surface and remained so for the dur-
ation of the sighting. The object was reflecting sunlight
when he saw it and appeared silvery-metallic in color, like
an unpainted aircraft. It disappeared to the west in a timed
two (2) minutes. He heard no sound, saw no smoke, contrails
or exhaust, noticed no ports or windows. His wife, ████████.
claims she thought it was spinning on its' short axis end
could see windows evenly spaced all around the edge. Mrs.
████████ his sister-in-law, had only a glimpse of the object.
