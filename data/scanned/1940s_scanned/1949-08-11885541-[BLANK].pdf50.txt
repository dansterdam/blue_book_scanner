[REDACTED]

Incident #129 -- Wilmington, North Carolina -- 31 May 1943

Evidence in this incident is contradictory, especially concerning tactics, but from the meager description and the fact that the object emitted smoke and travelled at a high speed, the possibility of it having been a meteor is not ruled out. Apparent colors, shapes might have arisen from persistence of vision of a rapidly travelling bright object.

Is there a government testing field for guided missiles near by?
