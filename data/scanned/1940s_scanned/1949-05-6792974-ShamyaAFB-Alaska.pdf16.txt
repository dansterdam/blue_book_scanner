Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
        Statement: "Position of our aircraft was over the Island of Shemya at
approximately 2500 feet. The time was approximately 2205 local. Our
heading was 90 degrees. Visibility was good. I first noted a white
light approaching from head on. It passed under our ship with about
100 feet clearance. At the same time the left scanner reported an air-
craft passing underneath us. The top speed of the object was
fairly fast. (Approximately 200 - 300 miles per hour).

        The next sighting was made at approximately 2236 local. Our position
was just south of Shemya at approximately 1200 feet. Visibility was
good and ceiling was unlimited. We were in a turn to the right and our
ship was heading in a south wester direction when a white light was
observed to pass over the aircraft in a northerly direction at a fast
rate of speed. The object appeared to be approximately 1000 feet above
our ship.

        No further sightings were made."
