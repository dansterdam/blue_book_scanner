Incident No. 176 - 23 Sept. 1948, 1200 hours, San Pablo, Calif.
On a still hazy day, two men saw a large translucent object over a mile
overhead. It was the size of a four-engine bomber, but "gray in color,
and appeared to be made of wax." According to the first observer,
the apparent position was spherical and undulated, having appendages fore 
and aft, like an amoeba. The second observer said the object looked 
like "a vegetable crate" covered with translucent material. The in-
vestigator states one observer's description was "not too good --
due to the other. One observer was far-sighted but wore no glasses,
the other was over seventy, needed glasses to read but wore none at 
time of sighting. 

AMC Opinion: The only fact that might be accepted is that an ob-
ject was seen. Two observers, side by side, could not agree on its
appearance. The evidence is useless. A balloon or cluster of balloons,
an aircraft, or a cloud could have been the stimulus.
