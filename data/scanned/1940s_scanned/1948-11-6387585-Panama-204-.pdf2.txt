There is no photograph present in the image you provided, just text and marks handwritten on a page.

The handwritten text appears to be quite faint and is not entirely legible, but I will do my best to transcribe what can be made out:

```
(can't make out the text at the very top)
U.S.
.
.
.
(arrow pointing left with unclear text) / M.P.H.
12:00 MIDNIG...(cut off)
.
.
.
(Possibly an arrow pointing right)
```

There are also some scribbles and shapes drawn on the page that are not clearly decipherable as text. The document appears to be a rough sketch or a draft with some annotations, but most of the content is not clearly readable.
