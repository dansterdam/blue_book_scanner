Incident #135 --- Weaver, South Dakota -- between 15-20 August 1947

For the description of this incident as given, there is no astronomical explanation.
The statements of an apparently well-trained observer can scarcely be doubted, but no interpretation, either astronomical or otherwise, other than possible detached auroral streamers, suggests itself. The moon at the time was new and the night apparently very dark, the most favorable conditions for the observation of auroral phenomena.
