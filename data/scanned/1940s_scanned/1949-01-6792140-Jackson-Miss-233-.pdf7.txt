UNCLASSIFIED                       Incident: 233

Mr. [redacted] a pilot with Dixie Air Service, Jackson, Mississippi,
and his wife (private pilot), sighted an unidentified aerial object
2 miles east of Jackson, Mississippi, at 1700, 1 Jan 49 while coming
in for a landing at the Dixie Airport. Object was first described as
being cigar-shaped with short stubby wings resembling a rocket.
(Second report states there were no wings) Mr[redacted] believes 
in a signed letter "as the object made its turn, it was then that I noticed
the object didn't have wings." Object was first thought to be a large
tow target about 60 feet long and about 10 feet in diameter at one end
and about 1 ft at the trailing end. The tail even fluttered like a target
but there was no towing cord and the object moved at greater speed than
tow targets. When the object crossed in front of the plane estimated
at ≈ 500 ft above 200 MPH and on two's to 300 ft to the rear ≈ 500 feet
feet in front of them. After the turn, the object wised in plane 500
of the plane. Mr[redacted] attempted to point out the object to the pilot but
but the pilot did not understand and apparently did not see the object.
As the object turned to the southwest it accelerated its speed and flew
out of sight. Object seen for some 10 to 12 seconds, Color was dark
blue or black. Speed at first sighting - 200 miles per hour, later
thought to have accelerated to between 400 to 600 mph.

Object was sighted by the above person's who were passengers in a Stinston
civilian aircraft. No photographs were taken since a camera was not availa-
ble. The Stinson was flying and about 3,300 feet. Investigators of flight
schedules of adjacent airfields could throw no light on the incident.
