UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #153 -- Columbus, Ohio -- 31 July 1948

This incident was incident #147, which obviously refer
to two same object, must be considered together. The object fell
to earth and was retrieved; it proves to us a "county fair bal-
loon," once quite common in this part of the country. Usually
they are lighted in mid-afternoon, rise, and on more rare events
to provide the hot air. They then rise and stay aloft for several
hours before finally falling to earth.
It is highly reasonable that the object described in In-
cident #153, which was observed a few hours earlier on the same
day and near the same location, was this object, seen while it was
still high in the sky.
