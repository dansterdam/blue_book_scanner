My name [redacted] until last
December I was employed by the Army and Air Force
Motion Picture Service with Headquarters in Colorado
Springs, Colo.

At present I am with the Altec Service Corp.
of New York.

About ten months ago ( exact date in some
papers at Colorado Springs) I was coming from a
routine trip to Great Falls AFB, between Dillon,
Montana and the Montana-Idaho noticed an object in
the sky to the Northwest. It might was clear. I
stopped the car and stepped outside to be able to
observe more clearly. It appeared to be a Disc of
some sort.  Its size of a bright to be a pint of
it into a full 337Â° meter. I radius was travelling in
an arc. It made a slow turn to my right and seemed to
hesitated for a fraction of a second and what appear
to be a flash from a photographers flash-gun lighted
the ground for a Radius ten miles. Any one familiar
with this location will understand why I make this
estimation of area covered.

The Disc then completed an all but about 60 degrees
of the circle and very rapidly, in about a 30 degree climb
disappeared in the general direction from which I had first
sighted it. At the first truck stop, about-ten minutes
later, I talked to a Truck-driver that said this light was
almost above his cab.

If exact dates, location, etc., would be of any
account, don't hesitate to let me know.

Yours truly,
