Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s)

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

[redacted] Ohio Street; Sidney; Ohio was interviewed on
15 May 1949, and he stated that he observed an object at approximately 0C30 hours on
6 May 1949, in front of Cook's Spot Restaurant, located at the corner of South Ohio
and West Court Streets, Sidney, Ohio. The brightness of the object attracted his
attention. Stump was unable to determine the size of the object due to its fast, perfect
reflection, but appeared to be approximately six inches in diameter. The object
was about a half mile west and travelling south at a great altitude. The object was
in sight approximately two minutes, appeared to be travelling at a fast rate of speed,
and faded out in the sky. The object traveled in a straight line and was very brilliant 
against a clear, blue sky. The object did not make any sound or leave any trail. Stump
could not see any projections as the object was too bright and too far away. Stump is
the owner of the Census Store at the above address, but did not take any photographs
of the object.
