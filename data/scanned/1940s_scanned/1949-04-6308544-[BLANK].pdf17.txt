PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF REPORTS OF 
UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS

The Inaccuracy of Human Observation 

    Psychologists have long known that human perception is fallible. 
In fact, part of the science of psychology is concerned with the 
measurement of errors of observation, and with the discovery of the 
conditions and laws that govern such phenomena.

    Errors of observation may be classified as variable or constant. 
Variable errors are those in which a number of separate observations 
are found to differ from one another. The distribution of such 
errors often follows the normal probability curve. Constant errors 
are those in which observations are consistently biased in one or 
another direction. For example, individuals often are guilty of a
constant error, in the direction of underestimation, in reporting 
their ages.

    Errors of observation may be classified further as precision errors 
and identification errors. Inaccuracy in estimating the speed of an 
aircraft is an example of the former. Mistaking an aircraft for a 
"flyfying saucer" is an example of the latter.

    It is the purpose of the present report to analyze 212 reports of 
observations of unidentified flying objects in order to see to what 
extent these reports can be explained in terms of known psychological 
facts and principles. 

Scientific Method and a Posteriori Data

    A word of caution must be injected at the outset of this report. 
Certain conditions are necessary for drawing valid scientific conclusions.
