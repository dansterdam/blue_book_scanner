SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO : Commanding General
     Air Materiel Command
     Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
     Dayton, Ohio
     ATTN: MCIAK-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAK-3, 
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
endorsement thereto by this Headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motion are distinguished if possible, and that motion is
specified as a true direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Sighting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

FOR THE CHIEF, AIR WEATHER SERVICE
