Incident #67 -- between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland -- 20 July 1947

This incident and #66, which occurred in the same vicinity
just three days apart, do not fit into the usual description patterns.
In both cases, information is so meager, and in both cases the
meteoric hypothesis cannot be completely ruled out, but the objects
could have been rockets or even freakish auroral streamers or brush
discharge from ionized dust clouds. In any event, it seems unlikely,
although it is not impossible, that the objects seen in this inci-
dent were meteors. The even spacing of the flashes argues strongly
against the meteoric hypothesis.
