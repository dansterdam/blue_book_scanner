DETAILS

At 0945, 10 August 1948, Lt Colonel Cooper, Acting District Commander, 676th District Office of Special Investigations, interviewed Mr. [Redacted], Robins Air Force Base employee, regarding an [sic] aerial phenomena witnessed by [Redacted] while on duty at Robins Air Force Base on the night of 23 July 1948. The following is a transcript of this interrogation:

Q. 1. What is your full name, age, address, and employment?

A. 1. [Redacted]. I am 23, unmarried, and live at [Redacted], Macon, Georgia. I am a member of the Transient Maintenance Alert Crew on the midnight shift - 2400 to 0800 hours.

Q. 2. Do you recall the date and time that you saw this object?

A. 2. It appeared on Friday night, the 23d of July 1948 between 0140 and 0150 hours, Eastern Standard Time. I was standing Fire guard on a C-47, directly across from Operations, and I had to take down the take-off time which was between 0140 and 0150.

Q. 3. What was the weather condition?

A. 3. Good visibility and no clouds.

Q. 4. Were there any lights around you? Outside lights or beacons?

A. 4. I am not sure whether the flood lights on the hangar were on or OFF. I was facing the north and looking AWAY from any possible lights.

Q. 5. In what direction did you see this object?

A. 5. It was coming out of the north. I was facing the north and actually didn't see it until it got overhead, but it came out of the north and was in my view for about twenty seconds. The last I saw of it the object was fading a southwest course.

Q. 6. Describe in your own words what you actually saw from the time it appeared until it disappeared.

A. 6. The first thing I saw was a stream of fire and it was unidentified as to what it could be, but as it got overhead, it was a fairly clear outline and appeared to be 15 or 20 individual, 3 watt bulbs making a stream of Fire coming out of the tail end. I am sure it would not be a jet plane, since I have observed P-84s in flight at night on two occasions.
