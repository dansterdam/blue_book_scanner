DEARsir,
            
I just finished reading
an article by kenneth E
Arnold in Jan. 1950 issue
of true mecazine.
    
One part of this article is
about the sighting by you of
a flying saucer. Considering
the reports from many reliable
airline pilots and others
it begins to appear that there
actually are such things.
    
Regarding your report would
like to ask you to kindly
further, what you saw then.
