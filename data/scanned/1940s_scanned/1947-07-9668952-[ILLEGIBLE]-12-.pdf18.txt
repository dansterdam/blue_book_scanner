The page contains two images, both appearing to be simple line drawings or sketches, positioned at the top and bottom. The upper drawing looks like an elongated oval shape with a flatter bottom and dome on top. Three circles are sketched above it, possibly representing lights or other features. The bottom drawing depicts a similar elongated oval shape with a flatter bottom and a shadowed (shaded) dome on top, again with a singular circle above it.

Here is the text from the page:
