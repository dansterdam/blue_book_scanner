 "Flying Pies" Stir Skepticism

 Army, CAA Officials Unable to Explain Whizzing, Mysterious Objects

 Pendleton, Ore.--(AP)--Army
 and CAA spokesmen expressed
 skepticism today over a report
 of nine mysterious objects "big-
 ging big as battleships" whizzing over
 Western Washington at 1,200
 miles an hour.

 Kenneth Arnold, a flying
 Boise, Idaho, businessman, who
 reported seeing them, clung
 however, to his story of the
 shiny, flat objects, each as big
 as a DC-4 passenger plane, rac-
 ing over Washington's Cascade
 mountains with a peculiar
 weaving motion "like the tail of
 a kite."

 An Army spokesman in Wash-

ington, D. C., commented,
 as "flying discs, V-2-type rockets,
 that fast was "not their "flying
 which travels at about 3,500
 miles an hour--and that's too
 fast to be seen."

 The V-2 rockets would not re-
 semble the objects reported by
 Arnold, and the ninth high-speed
 experimental ones were being
 tried in the area where Arnold
 made the observations.

 A civil Aeronautics Administra-
 tion director in Portland,
 Ore., added, "If other doubt that
 anything would be traveling that

Arnold described the objects
 as "flat like a piepan," and so
 shiny that they reflected the
 sun like a mirror.

 He said he was flying east at
 2:30 p.m. two days ago toward
 Mt. Rainier when they appeared
 directly. In front of him 25-30
 miles away at 10,000 feet alti-
 tude.

 By his plane's clock he timed
 them at 102 miles for the 47
 miles from Mt. Rainier to Mt.
 Adams, Arnold said, adding that
 his later figured by triangulation
 that their speed was 1,200 miles
 an hour.

 "I could be wrong by 200 or

"300 miles an hour," he admitted,
, but I know I never saw anyth-
 ing so fast."

 The said at first he thought
 they were geese, but quickly saw
 they were too big--as big as a
 DC-4, that was about 2 miles
 away--he said. The DC-4 pipers
 reported them in a flight instru-
 ment. The Arnold moment
 thought of jet planes and
 started to look them, but "their
 motion was screwy or Jet job."

 "I guessâ€”I don't know what
 they were unless they were
 guided missiles," said Arnold,
 who continued here on a busi-
 ness trip.
