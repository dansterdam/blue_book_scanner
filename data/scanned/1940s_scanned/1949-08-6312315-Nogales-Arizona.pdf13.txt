Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observers:

Neighbors, Police Department and employer gave two observers high
recommendations as to intelligence, character and sobriety.  Interrogator
is of opinion that information obtained is excellent as to sincerity and
accuracy.

Did observer wear glasses, especially poloroid glasses at time of sighting,
or was object viewed through canopy, window, or other transparent material?

Neither observer wore glasses at time of sighting and both observers
were out of doors when observations were made.

NOTE: Calculations made by writer from angles of elevation and horizontal
angles from observer (all estimated by observers) would place the speed of
