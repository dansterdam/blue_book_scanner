NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

   "At 1010J 3 July 1949, ___________________________, Comdr. SA(3), USNR, 76105, sighted
what he thought to be a flying disc while standing at the airport at Longview, 
Washington. ______________is an aeronautical engineer and manager of the airport at
Longview. _________stated that while on active duty he had had experience with the 
pilotless aircraft and guided missile program.

   _________stated that when he first sighted the disc, it appeared to be at an 
altitude of approximately 30,000 feet northwest of the airport and traveling in 
a southeasterly direction at 300 miles per hour. When first sighted, the disc 
had about 30 degrees of altitude. It remained in view three minutes, traveling 
at a constant altitude in a large arc from the position of initial sighting until 
lost directly overhead in the sun. A definite, regular oscillation was observed 
and was timed at the rate of 60 oscillations per minute. He described this 
motion as a skulling or falling leaf motion rather than a movement through the 
air of the disc.

   The wind was at all times observed to be from the southwest at a definite 
angle to the line of flight of the disc. This direction was confirmed by some-
stantly rising column of smoke from an industrial plant and by smoke from a sky-
writing at 10,000 feet. Weather reported ceiling and visibility unlimited all 
times with wisps of cirrus clouds in a small fractional portion of the sky. He
described the object as the size of the head of a pin hold at arm's length. It
was metallic in color and cast a reflection upon each oscillation. He stated
it was definitely circular rather than oval or oblong in shape. He was unable
to estimate its thickness. No smoke or vapor trail was observed.

   Upon the same occasion ________ reports observing a second disc at 1013J and 
a third at 1125J. He described them as identical to the first observed. These
were initially sighted at an altitude of 45 degrees from the west at approximately
30,000 feet. They also disappeared into the sun overhead after a three minutes'
observed flight.

   A local air show was scheduled for the afternoon of this day and there were 
approximately 150 people on the field at the time. All of those present saw the
object. Lt. Henry ________an stunt pilot of Big Bear, California, agrees with and 
confirms ______observations. Arthur Robertson, Longview, Washington, an 
aeronautical engineer and an employee of ____________estimated altitude of these
