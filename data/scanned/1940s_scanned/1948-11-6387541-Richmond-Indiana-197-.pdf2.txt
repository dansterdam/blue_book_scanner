THE PALLADIUM-ITEM
RICHMOND, INDIANA

November 6, 1948

To Whom It May Concern:

When I came to work on the morning of November 5,
1948 I noted a typed memo from ---------- a sports writer on the
staff who had worked the night before.

In substance, he note told about the glow he had
seen in the sky shortly before 5 a.m. on the morning of Friday,
November 5th. His attention had been attracted to the lights, he
said, by two telephone calls that came in about 4:55 a.m. He
looked out the window, he said, and saw the light "about the size or
less than the size of a no. 2 pencil eraser" and proceeding "taking two
or three minutes to what he saw." It is not recorded along with
a glossy print (which he had made in our photo lab)

I have known ---------- for over two years as 
a member of the state news. From my observation and contact, I
know him to be a trustworthy person and an honorable citizen.
By the nature of his reporting, he is apt to get as many true
facts as possible. His alertness is evidenced by the fact that
he took two pictures of the "floating light" he saw in the eastern
sky over Richmond (at no time -- I read him say to someone he
saw no object that he considered could be the air force. And
is married, happily I believe. His habits do not include smoking
or drinking. He is a member of the local Junior Chamber of
Commerce.

I personally did not see this "light" mentioned above,
