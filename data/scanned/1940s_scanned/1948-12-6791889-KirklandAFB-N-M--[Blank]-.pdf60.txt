It is found that the fireball doubly observed by Messrs.V and M, at ----, and ---- appeared at a height of at least 10 miles and descended at an angle of about 45º to the vertical (90º being to horizontal) and disappeared at a point C at an elevation of only 23½ miles above the horizontal plane through the point C from which it leveled off and dived (C to its point of disappearance, E), the fireball followed a nearly horizontal path approximately 7.5 miles long moving with a velocity of between 3.75 and 7.5 miles per second, depending on the duration estimate adopted. The coordinates of the projection of C on the earth are 35º 55' N, 106º 30' W, and those of the projection of E are 35º 51' N, 106º 23' W. The forward extension of this fireball's path on the earth, if dotscribed by the above parabolic passage would bring it to the vicinity of the town of Los Alamos.

It should be noted that the ascending branch of the path of the fireball was observed by Inspector ---- at ----, but was considerably curved, the maximum elevation of this portion of its path was estimated. It should also be noted th and no sound was heard, although the distance from the observers to the fireball and E from the fragment to the observers should have been only a few miles at most. I have no hesitation in believing that an object possessing the real path and the other peculiar characteristics of by --------, and ----
was not a falling meteorite.
