ROCKET EXPLOSION
REPORT 'FALSE'

EL PASO, Tex., Oct. 16 (AP). -- Ten. Enrique Diaz Gonzales, who
commands the Juarez Military garrison just across the border
from El Paso, today blamed a "False report" for the Mexican War
Department's announcement that an American rocket landed south
of here last Sunday.

His statement was made as search was resumed for a mysterious
object which blazed through the sky, crashed and apparently
exploded in the mountains near the village of Caseta, Mexico,
across the Rio Grande from Fabens, Tex.

The War Department In Mexico City asserted two days ago
that investigation indicated the object was a V-2 rocket launched
from a U. S. Army experimental station in Texas.

There is also handwritten text at the bottom right of the document. However, it is partially cut off and not entirely legible. It seems to say "4716- -" followed by a check mark or similar mark. The quality and nature of the image do not permit me to provide any more accurate or complete transcription.
