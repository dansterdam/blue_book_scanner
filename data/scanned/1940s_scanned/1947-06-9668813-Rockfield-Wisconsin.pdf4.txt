The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scan of a page from a document, which is mostly illegible due to the quality of the scan. However, I will provide you with the text that is discernible:

"Pilots saw the flying saucers (about seven to ten of them) which they 
first, close enough 
 ********* said that they looked like "pie plates" and claims 
the **** saucers all then headed south.

 ***** did not report this into ATIC. It was reported by *******. 
However, the information is ********* June 24 1950.

Reported by ********* Stokes, Page 170"

Due to the poor quality of the scan and obscured text marked by asterisks, a complete and accurate transcription is not possible for the entire document.
