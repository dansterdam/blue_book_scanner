The image you've provided appears to be an extremely faded or poorly scanned page of a document. There are no clear photographs present within this image; the content seems mostly illegible due to the quality of the scan.

The legible text that can be deciphered from the fading is as follows:

The radio announcer stated that the disc had been sighted over
Illinois the "morning after" (morning of 25 June 1947).

The announcer at this program was taken from a letter published
in "Amazing Stories" dated Jan 48.

However, please note that due to the poor image quality, parts of the text might not have been transcribed accurately.
