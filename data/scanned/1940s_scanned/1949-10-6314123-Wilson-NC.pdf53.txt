and Political Science, N. C. State College, Raleigh, N. C., was interviewed rain                        DOUBTFUL;Y TRUE.......D
Brilliant Meteor that he reported to Mr. B. E. Fason, Regional Director, American               IMPROBABLE ..............E
Meteor Society, w/residence ███████████, Wilson, N. C. Mr. █████ stated in                             UNTRUE .......................F
substance as follows:
On 12 October 1949, between 11:10 and 11:15 PM, while Mr. ████████
myself were standing on the front porch of my home about 2½ miles southeast of
Garner, N. C., we saw a brilliant meteor, which was a blue-white in color, travel-
ing across the sky parallel to the earth's surface in a north-northeast direction.
I would judge its height as about between 15,000 and 18,000 feet or approximato-
ly 3-5 degree. It a/h very short trail, and did not emit any sound that we
could hear. We were facing east at the time, and just as we turned our head to
the loff to follow it, it broke into 2 distinct pieces, possibly three, and then
without describint an arc, or very small one at best, it quietly disappeared.
Except for the fact that it traveled parallel to the earth's surface, and that
it broke into pieces, I have no reason to boliove that it was other than a tell-
ing star.

On 20 October 1949, Mr. █████████████, Associate Editor, North Carolina
Education Magazine, w/office above Colonial Stores on Morgan Street, Raleigh, N.C,
was interviewed regarding aforementioned event. Mr. █████████ substantiated what
Mr. █████ said and added that he had never heard of a meteor traveling parallel
to the earth's surface.
