Text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED
In his summary of the above interviews Dr. LA PAZ finds that the
sounds were unlike normal aircraft sounds, that a Cub could not have operated
at the altitude needed to conform with the figures given by the transit read-
ings, that no heavy machinery or tanks had been operating and two other
Inspectors had heard similar sounds on the morning of 31 December at about
0540.

Calculations based on the transit readings indicate that the sound
originated at a point with coordinates 106 degrees 17 minutes, 35 degrees 52
minutes.

5. AACS at Kirtland Air Force base was checked by the writer and so far
as their records show no aircraft were near Los Alamos during the times of
the sound observations.

AT WALKER AIR FORCE BASE

6. AACS at Walker Air Force Base was checked by Special Agent BIERMAN
H. CAIVITE, and reported that no aircraft were shown near Los Alamos by their
log during the critical times.
