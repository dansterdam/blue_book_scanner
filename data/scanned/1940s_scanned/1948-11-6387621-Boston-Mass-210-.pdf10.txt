Incident #210 -- Boston, Massachusetts -- 19 November 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.
The objects seen were apparently conventional aircraft.
It is rather surprising, since, in the day light, the observer could
identify them as single-engine planes, and yet could hear no sound
from them.
