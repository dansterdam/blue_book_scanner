This is a statement of a sky phenomena observed by me on 7 January 
1948, between the approximate hours of 1920 to 1950.

It appeared to be some sort of flare. My first reaction to the 
sight was the belief that an aircraft was in trouble, and had shot a
flare to attract attention. I then requested the tower to take a look
at the object through glasses so they could attempt to determine whether 
or not it was a flare.

With the naked eye it appeared to be a very bright light with 
the color of ordinary fires. I was not able to maintain a watch continuously,
due to my duties, and see the whole pattern of movement. I did observe
it long enough at intervals to note that it lost and regained altitude in
the manner that a parachute flare would when drifting on thermals. The
intensity of the light varied. This can be attributed to clouds passing in
from of the light, however, I was able to see the light when clouds 
obscured it.

The sky condition at the time was what I would say was clear to
scattered. Stars directly above me were compared to the light of the
object and there was a decided difference. The stars were of the usual
white and the object was yellow or flame color.

The altitude evidently was very high. The object when first seen
appeared to be in the neighborhood of four thousand feet, but disappearing
over the horizon would make it much higher. It described an imaginary arc
from the points first seen to the horizon. The movement was very slow in
appearance and left no trails or tails like a meteor or comet. Place of
disappearance was approximately due west from my position.
