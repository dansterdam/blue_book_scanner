Incident No. 35 -- 14 October 1947, 1200 hours, eleven miles north,
N.E. of Cave Creek, Arizona.

Two mine operators observed one object at 8000 to 10,000 ft altitude, traveling
350 mph, S.E in a straight line for a period of 45 seconds. The object was
red against the sky, and black against a cloud. Its size appeared to be three feet
in diameter from point of observation. The OSI report of investi,gation states
that one observer thought it was a buzzard, but decided later that it was not;
the other observer said it resembled a flying wing, but was not a flying wing.
No reasons are given for these apparently superfluous and conflicting remarks.
As in many other instances, these observers cited their flying experience as
qualification for their ability to observe and report details.

AIC Opinion: From the limited data furnished in this report, it is 
difficult to arrive at any conclusion. If the object was actually 10,000 ft 
distant, and yet appeared three feet wide to the observer, it would of necessity 
been huge. This sole point of contention tends to discredit the report.
