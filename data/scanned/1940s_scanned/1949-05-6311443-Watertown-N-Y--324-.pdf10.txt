There is no photograph in the image provided; it is a textual document. However, the text in the document is nearly illegible due to the quality of the image and appears to be faded, making it difficult to transcribe accurately. What is discernible at the top of the page is:

"U.S. ARMY WEATHER SERVICE WIND ALOFT COMPUTATION SHEET"

The rest of the document contains several columns of numbers and text, which are characteristic of meteorological data or calculations, likely related to wind speed and direction at various altitudes. Due to the poor quality of the image, specific details and figures are not readable.
