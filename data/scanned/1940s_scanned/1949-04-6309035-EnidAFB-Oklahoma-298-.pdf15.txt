The image contains no photographs but appears to include hand-drawn sketches that seem to represent the path of a light or object in the sky.

The text in the document consists of handwritten annotations relating to the drawings. Here is the transcribed text:

The annotations suggest the sketches are observations of lights relative to stars in the night sky, with the observer looking to the south. There is a reference to a "bright star, (probly) Sirius," indicating the observer's interpretation of one of the points of light observed. The track of the observed object or light is noted to be more irregular than represented in the drawing.
