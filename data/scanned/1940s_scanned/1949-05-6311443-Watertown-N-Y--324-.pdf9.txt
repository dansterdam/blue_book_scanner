The image provided is a scanned document, and it does not contain any photographs. The document is quite difficult to read due to its quality, which means it's hard to transcribe the text with high accuracy. However, it appears to be a standard form with some tabular data, and one can see a header that reads:

"U.S ARMY WAC SERVICE
WIND ALOFT COMPUTATION SHEET"

There seems to be a grid filled with numbers, which likely represent recorded data, possibly related to wind speed and direction at various altitudes, given the title 'WIND ALOFT COMPUTATION SHEET.' Unfortunately, due to the low resolution and faded print, extracting specific text entries from the form is not feasible. If you require a precise transcription, I would recommend finding a higher-quality version or original of the document for accurate analysis.
