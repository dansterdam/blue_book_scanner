STATEMENT

On the 7th of February 1949, I was on duty at the Weather Station, Godman Air Force Base and at 0150C Sgt. Luebber called me from the Control Tower. He stated that he, and Pfc Dumphey had sighted a strange object in the sky and that he wanted me to come up and take a look at it, which I did. A few minutes after I arrived in the tower, Pfc Peterman also came up. The four of us saw this object which was just above the horizon to the southwest. The object seemed to be rotating red, green and yellow colors. At approximately 0200C, I went out to the theodolite and managed to locate the object in it and took readings on it. The object did not seem to move from its original spot where it was first sighted. While we were watching it, it suddenly disappeared. The object vanished at 0212C. Sgt. Luebber notified Lt. Clary, who was the Officer of the Day that night and entered the event in the log. After I went back to the weather station, I made a note of it for Lt. Hammer and Sgt. Vrankar, to see the next morning.
