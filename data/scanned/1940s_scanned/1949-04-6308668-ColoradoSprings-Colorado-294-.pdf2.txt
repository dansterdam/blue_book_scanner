Subject: Aerial Phenomena (Flying Discs)

(6) Heading: Approximately due north.

(7) Maneuverability: The objects followed a straight
course. When first sighted the objects on the left was an
apparent distance of five feet behind the first and with an
increase of speed overtook the first object in about two
seconds and continued on past the first object until they
were both out of sight.

(8) Altitude: Estimated at around 30,000 ft.

(9) Sounds: None.

(10) Exhaust trail or not: None observed.

6. General remarks: The times of observance by the witnesses
differ in that T/Sgt Morbeck observed them for about thirty seconds from
about ten o'clock until out of sight. While Maj Bullock observed them
at twelve o'clock for about fifteen seconds when he turned away to call
them to the attention of other personnel but the objects were out of sight
before this could be done. M/Sgt Pink observed them at twelve o'clock
for about twenty seconds until out of sight. All witnesses generally
agree to the above data.
