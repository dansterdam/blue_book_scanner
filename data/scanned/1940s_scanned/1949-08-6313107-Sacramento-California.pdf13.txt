The photograph in the document is a drawing rather than an actual photograph. It depicts two views of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The first drawing shows a side view of the UFO and illustrates its boomerang or crescent-like shape with the text "Direction of flight" indicating its movement. Below this image is another drawing that appears to show the same object from a different perspective, labeled "Same angle of view" with an arrow pointing upwards towards the UFO. Below that is a sketch of a conventional airplane for comparison, shown in a side view from the ground with an arrow pointing upwards.

The text available in the document as visible is as follows:

```
UNIDENTIFIED
[The rest of the text in this portion is not visible]

VIEW AS SEEN FROM OBJECT'S
LEFT FRONT BELOW

[Arrow indicating "Direction of flight"]

SAME ANGLE OF VIEW

[Symbols and marks representing the conventional airplane and the direction arrow]

UNINTELLIGIBLE TEXT AT BOTTOM
[The actual text at the bottom is redacted or obscured, making it unintelligible]

[Stamp-like text at the bottom-right corner, likely a classification or declassification mark, but the details are not clear]
```

The rest of the text in the document has been obscured, likely due to redactions, and is thus not readable.
