```
(7) Maneuverability: Most objects travelled in
straight line; some of them zig-zagged 
slightly.

(8) Altitude: Extremely high; Witnesses judged
altitude by comparing with known types of 
conventional aircraft in the air at the time. 

(9) Sound: None.

(10)Exhaust trail: Some objects seemed to have a
silvery tail, which might have been exhaust. 

f.  These objects could not have been weather balloons 
because the Memphis weather bureau released only one 
balloon in the afternoon. 

g. The undersigned is of the opinion that the objects 
seen were meteorites. 

h. Evaluation of sub-paragraph e above; B-3
