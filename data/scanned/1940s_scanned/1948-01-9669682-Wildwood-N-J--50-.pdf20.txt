Request for Travel Orders - Maj. W. J. Faulk and Mr. A. C. Loedding

MCIA                                         9 Feb 48
ATTN: Colonel Anderson

1. As a result of a letter received from Miss ***** regarding an incident
in connection with Project "SIGN", a personal interview was considered necessary. Re-
cent visits to military bases where these incidents take place and results obtained by
personal contact with witnesses indicate the necessity for this trip to **********, N.J.
This city is located in a remote part of New Jersey and is not readily accessible by
ordinary transportation means. It was decided, therefore, that travel by military air
was more expeditious.

2. A teletype was sent to Miss ***** 6 February 1948 indicating thst a visit would
be made on or about 15 February for an interview. It is necessary, therefore, to ac-
complish this mission as a result of the arrangements with Miss *****
