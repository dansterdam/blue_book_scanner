1. Reference our conversation at approximately 1100-2 hours this
date, a negative report is forwarded for time specified during conver-
stations.

2. Additional information which is authentic in nature but doubt-
ful as to value follows:

a. Control Tower reported loud squeal on Very High Frequency
radio from 2230 to 2240Z hours 6 April 1949. Also there was unusual
high noise level noticed on low frequency receivers at approximately
the same time.

b. Ground/Air reported trouble contacting aircraft at 2235Z
hours, 6 April 1949, due to high noise level on "I" "Charlie" channel-

of the equipment involved and could not necessarily be construed to
be an unusual occurrence of any particular nature.
