Incident #131 -- Belleville, Illinois -- 20 June 1948

It appears improbable that this incident has an astronomical explanation. If the evidence is correct as given, the object could not have been a fireball. The zig zag course and the relatively slow speed do not fit in with the description of a large meteor. Lack of flare and train also tend to rule out this hypothesis.

The description answers that of a lighted balloon relatively close by.
