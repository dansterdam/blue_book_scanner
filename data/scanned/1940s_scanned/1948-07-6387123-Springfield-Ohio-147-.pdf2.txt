Incident #147 -- Springfield, Ohio -- 27 July 1948

The description of this incident, although meager, is in agreement with the hypothesis that the object observed was a rare-type brill. Thus, "brill: red tail of 2 deg," "traversed in straight line," "great height," and the short time in sight all increase the probability that it was a brill. meteor. The fact that it was travelling north, at this time of night, implies that the meteor was crossing the orbit of the earth on its way toward the sun when the collision occurred.
