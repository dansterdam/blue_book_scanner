NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

[...] and [redacted], were interviewed at their place of business and stated in substance as follows: At 1115 hours on 24 June 1949, their attention was attracted to the street outside their shop by several people looking up into the sky. They stopped outside and also looked up and noticed an object which appeared to them to be metallic as it was only visible to them when it reflected light from the sun. The object did not appear to be motivated by any visible force, but seemed to be drifing with the air currents. Only one object was sighted, and it was passed off as a piece of paper being blown by the wind and air currents. No particular attention was given to the size or shape of the object because no importance was attached to it.
