HEADQUARTERS

Mr. *******
Vice President & Chief Engineer
Springfield, Illinois

Dear Mr. *******

Receipt of your letter, dated 9 June 1949, which has been for-
warded this headquarters is respectfully acknowledged.

Although the information submitted by your letter does not
contain sufficient detail to definitely establish the identity of
the object sighted, there is a marked similarity between the descrip-
tion submitted and that of several similar phenomena commonly referred
to as bodies of fire balls. Further research on this subject at the
Local Public Library should confirm or deny this hypothesis.

This explanation would not hold true for the second object
mentioned if as inferred the object was under observation for a
period of 5 to 10 minutes.

Your action in reporting this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

W. E. CLINGEMAN
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Analysis Division
Intelligence Department
