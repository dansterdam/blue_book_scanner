Dear Sir

On November 25, 1949, at approximately 2000 hours, a light yellowish-green object was observed for about two seconds, from a point on the northern part of the project, by the following members of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory: *******. The object appeared as a point of light, much brighter than any star, at about 350 degrees and 15 degrees elevation, moving from east to west, for approximately 50 degrees, and downward at about 10 degrees from the horizontal. It was first seen by *******, who yelled "there it is, there it is." The other observers turned around in time to see the latter part of the trajectory as it disappeared behind the Jemez Range. Distance from the point of observation, altitude, and speed could not be estimated, and there was no sound hard in connection with this phenomenon.

These observations are being reported for your information in coordinating such reports in this area.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Sidney Newburger, Jr.
