On 23 Feb 49, Patrolman [redacted], Police Dept., Winter Park, Florida, was
[redacted] stationed that while checking shop doors at a post on Fairbanks ave.
approximately 2000 feet South of the intersection of New York and Fairbanks avenues,
Winter Park, Florida, between the hours of 0115 and 0135, 31 Jan 49, his atten-
tion was attracted by a light in the sky which he thought to be an aircraft
about to crash. He observed a round object, blue-green in color similar in app-
earnance to navigation lights on aircraft and about the si4e of a Fiat at an arms
length as a position approximately 20° above the horizon and over a point
approximately 1 1/4 miles at 225° from his position. This object was in sight for
approximately 50 seconds. It was traveling in a slightly South-southwesterly dir-
ection at a slight angle of descent and at a speed approximating that of an air-
craft approaching Orlando Air Field. There was no sound, odor, trail or projections
in or around this object. It appeared to be very dull in color, similar to a weak
incandescent lamp and disappeared from view behind trees which were in his
line of sight. There were no clouds in the sky, no moon, the stars were out and
the weather was clear with good visibility. [redacted] reportedly has 20-20 vision
is not color blind, did not wear glasses and viewed the object through clear air.
