CALDWELL, et al - 24-93

                                         UNCLASSIFIED
"By using a V8 Ford Motor or its equivalent for a power plant, it
should have a speed around one hundred miles per hour and a four
or five passenger ship should sell for less than the lower priced
automobiles."

On 24 August 1949, Special Agent BEZL interviewed Dr. LOUIS
E. CROOKS, head of the Department of Aeronautics, Catholic University.
Professor CROOKS stated that a complete report of disk airfoils was
on file in a NACA article published in 1929 under the title "Low
Aspect Ratio Wing." An airplane very similar to CALDWELL's disk rotor
helicopter had been built in 1931 by a Mr. NEMETH, Chicago, Illinois.
This plane, powered by 125 horsepower engine, has made many successful
flights and is still flying. Professor CROOKS stated that CALDWELL's
idea was not new, that he was not an engineer in the true sense of
the word, and that he possessed no inventing knowledge. CROOKS also
further stated that he explained the above information to CALDWELL and
told him that he was working on an old idea. Professor CROOKS stated
that in exhaustive wind tunnel tests that have been conducted during
the past twenty years the lift ratio of the circular airfoil has al-
ways proved very high. However, aircraft models utilizing this type
of wing have not been able to overcome the problem of lateral control.

    Mr. JONATHAN E. CALDWELL is located at 1456 9th Street,
Manhattan Beach, California, and is believed to be actively engaged
in stock selling for aircraft building in the vicinity of Las Vegas,
Nevada. CALDWELL is not being contacted unless instructions are re-
ceived from Air Materiel Command to do so.
