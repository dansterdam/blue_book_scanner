Guide to Investigation

17. Trail (color, length, width, persistance, etc.) See previous letters.
18. Luminosity (visible by reflection, incandescence, other - degree of brilliance): Part, if not all, of luminosity due to
     its own light; although reflection from Washington may have been partly responsible.

20. Maneuvers (turns, climbs, dives, etc. - sketch of flight path): See sketches in two previous letters

22. Effect on clouds: No clouds present. Faint starlight, but a dark
     earth. Much water in atmosphere, but no mist.
