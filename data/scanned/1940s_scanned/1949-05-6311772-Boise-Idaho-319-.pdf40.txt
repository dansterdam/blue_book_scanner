The photograph shows a landscape with U.S. Highway 20, facing west toward Caldwell, Idaho. There are visible lines in the sky that appear to be contrails or some other aerial phenomena. Part of the highway is visible in the bottom right corner, and the rest of the image is a view of the sky and possibly a distant horizon.
