The image does not contain any photographs of UFOs or related phenomena. It appears to be a text document with some redacted sections. I will now transcribe the visible text as you requested:

Incident #17 -- Calif Coords 190 55' N, 140 05' E -- 29 May 1949

The object observed here was probably an exploding fire-
ball. Sound could have come only at the time of actual explosion
thus, with partial cloud coverage, could easily explain the absence
of a trail.

It is not likely that lights situated on the water surface
or aircraft situated lower had any relation to the original object.

If the object had been a shell fired from the USS John,
it appears improbable that only one shell would have been observed.
