18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
1 MATCH STICK FROM TIP TO COLLAR WOULD JUST ABOUT COVER THE OBJECT.

19. Draw a sketch that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object's motion, such as the direction from which it came, the direction in which it went, and particularly indicate the duration of the sighting by showing the distance the object moved.
