The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph visible in this image. 

The text in the document is as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE DIRECTION?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
If FLITTER, IS MOTION POSSIBLE?

ANOTHER PERSON WAS EATING HIS LUNCH IN HIS OFFICE. HE SAW THE OBJECT AND DREW OUR ATTENTION TO IT.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

I MERELY LOST SIGHT OF IT.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? 

I DO NOT KNOW.
