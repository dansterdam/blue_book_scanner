k. Comments of preparing officer:
The family appeared hospitable and cooperative, answering all questions asked with the children well informed on UFO sightings in and around this area and had read numerous books and magazines dealing with their phenomena. The children estimated that the sighting lasted longer than the former and faster than the latter. Amarillo Approach Center had higher and higher altitudes that the object being an aircraft is slight. In the opinion of the investigating officer, the object was either of large magnitude or at a considerable distance.
