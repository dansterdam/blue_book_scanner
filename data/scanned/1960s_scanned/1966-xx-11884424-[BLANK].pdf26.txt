1. Further to my letter to you on 11 October 1965, the Executive Committee of the AF Scientific Advisory Board has discussed and agreed on action to be taken on requests for a review/of our Air Force UFO program.

2. DR. Brian O'Brien, a member of the SAB, has been requested to convene a small group of scientists to review the Force Project Blue Book findings. The first meeting of this committee is scheduled to be held at Project Blue Book Headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on 3 February 1966. A report is expected shortly after that date.

3. The Wall Street Journal article on this subject, which was provided by your memorandum of 16 December has been made available to Dr. O'Brien.
