The image does not contain any photographs, only a typed letter. I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document:

Dear Mr. ____,

We are going to make this letter very ***** short so you might as well read it. We have seen flying objects like a ******* star or with some kind of red lights. PLEASE WRITE US BACK IF YOU FIND OUT WHAT IT SIGNED. 

P.S. Please send this letter to the U.F.O. if you think it is important.
