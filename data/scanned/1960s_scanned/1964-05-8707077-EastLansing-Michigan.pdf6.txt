Text extracted from the document:

reported during the personal interview. The similarity in brightness and color had misled then.

Final note: if the cutoff point had been on a line of sight passing through both observers, then no horizontal triangulation is meaningful. Elevation angles estimates are too uncertain to permit estimates.

With fair probability, the object may be taken to have been a fast, bright meteor, a fireball, far to the south and many miles high. If so, it could have been seen in northern central Indiana, and would have been brightest somewhere over the Indiana-Michigan border.

The object seem by ______ and Thornton could not have been the same as the one reported by the anonymous caller to have been "over her house," because the lady's house was somewhere between Thornton and the ______ . Unfortunately, no further information is available on this latter object.

6. ______ Thornton, 2106 EST, 23 May 1964. State Policeman and MSU college student saw brilliant white light moving east west for 2-3 seconds, then suddenly winking out. Total angular motion, about 30 degrees. Possibly a distant meteor, but conderably high speed required. Telescope described elliptical stage, short dimension along line of travel. Brightness like Venus. East Lansing-Lansing.
