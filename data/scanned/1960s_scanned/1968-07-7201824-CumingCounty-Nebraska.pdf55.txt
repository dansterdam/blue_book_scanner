SUBJECT: Observation: 25 July 1968.

1. Apparently an unidentified aerial object was observed by four individuals including two State Police officers at approximately 10:30 PM on the night of 25 July 1968 in Cuming County, Nebraska. The object was described as a luminous object that appeared to be maneuvering, and the observers felt that the object was under intelligent control.

2. FOR QUINTANILLA: The individuals involved in this sighting are extremely reliable people, and in view of the fact that two of the observers were State Police officers, I would tend to place considerable weight on their observations and descriptions. Please let me know what your evaluation of this sighting is and what action you may feel is appropriate.
