The image contains two illustrations. The larger illustration is a compass rose diagram, which appears to be used to indicate the direction of a phenomenon observed. The smaller illustrations on either side depict different perspectives of a landscape, potentially related to the observed phenomenon.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN *A* ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A *B* ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED. INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN *A* AND *B*. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS ESSENTIALLY STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, AS REFERRED TO IN 2(2,3).
