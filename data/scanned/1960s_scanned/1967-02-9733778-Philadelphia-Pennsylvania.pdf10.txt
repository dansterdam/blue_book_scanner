I have been greatly interested in and observed unidentified objects in the sky for many years, both in the country and city areas. I have seen several objects that were clearly not conventional aircraft, moving silently and in an unusual manner. I am very familiar with conventional aircraft and these were definitely something else.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
