I was first attracted by a long bluish "ray" or beam of light, about 3 times the width of a car, beaming down at an angle of about 45 degrees from the sky toward the ground. It appeared to be about 1/2 mile away, over a field.
As I watched, this "ray" or beam of light moved very slowly from left to right, then upward and disappeared. There was then a large oval or circular object, having a dull luminous glow, hovering just above the spot where the "ray" of light had been.
This object remained motionless for about 2 minutes, then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.
