"like a bus would turn," and began moving toward them. As they reached the point B, the lights were arranged as below:

Mr. said that the three (or four) lights on either side would be about a foot apart and the distance between the two groups would be about 40 feet at a point corresponding to that of the edge of the lights again corresponding to that of a car.

There were two tracts in the field immediately opposite the car. as remembering having seen the tracts during the sighting, but that it was she was concentrating on the lights. The moon was quite big and she took us to the spot where it was about 20 feet in height. Mrs. said that if the object was an airplane, its landing gear would have been in the tracts. apparently the lights were corresponds to something larger than a 180," but she emphasized the fact that shows noise.

When the object reached point B, it will think might be a plane, care to the conclusion that it would not have been behind the car. She immediately burned the corner and proceeded in a block. to the top of the hill where she stopped, turned off the engine, and as she drove north, but Mrs. was watching it.

At the point B, she stopped the car and passed the drivers side, stopping out with one foot. This was the first time down the object without the car window glass intervening. The object appeared to be hovered in a southwesterly direction (indicated by her as she turned in her car).
