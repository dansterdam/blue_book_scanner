4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: 0 Yes

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two obj ects/wings shaped like "boomerang" appeared to be in straight flight from East to West and stopped and hovered at an altitude of 100ft for about 2-3 seconds, and then disappeared. The objects appeared to be grey in color, smaller than a small plane.
11. COMMENTS: Extremely short duration. Dark night and two grey objects would flow about 1000ft high, would stop and hover for about 2-3 seconds, which is probably due to the nature of this limited sighting of two birds.
