Dear Allen,

Reference the attached sighting of a UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT. It seems to be a thorough report, in order to determine if we can help us with this matter.

We have received the weather data from the Rome, Italy sighting of 10 May 1953. Your additional investigation of the case appears warranted, however, in the additional information the observer indicated over this report, he is not in order. Could you help us with this matter?

Sincerely,

DAVID T. MOODY
