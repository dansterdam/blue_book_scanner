The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a night sky with scattered stars and some faint, blurry shapes that could potentially be unidentified flying objects (UFOs). However, given the poor quality of the image, it is difficult to definitively identify any specific objects. The image does not contain any identifiable human faces or individuals.
