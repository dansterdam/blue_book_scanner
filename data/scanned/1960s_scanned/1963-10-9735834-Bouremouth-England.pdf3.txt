The image contains a diagram with two parts. The first part is a graph with angles and elevations labeled, and the second part is a compass-like illustration. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an X on the horizon where you first saw the object. Show how high the object was above the horizon (height) when you first saw it. Place a "V" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
