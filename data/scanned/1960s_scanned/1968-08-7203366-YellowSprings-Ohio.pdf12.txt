1. Thank you for your transcript of your conversation with the officer relative to your UFO sighting of 12 August 1968. Did you gain any additional information from your personal interview with him?

2. In a matter of some interest to me, I note that you indicate you received "full credit" for your sighting. I must say that I did not complete the enclosed "Project Blue Book" to include your evaluation. If you have any additional information you wish to submit, I would be glad to include it.
