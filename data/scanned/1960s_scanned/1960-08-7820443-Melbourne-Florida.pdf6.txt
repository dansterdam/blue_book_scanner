THE MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECT WHICH RACED OVER MELBOURNE, FLA., JUNE 7, 1960

At approximately 8:00 P. M., June 7, 1960, a mysterious object raced over Melbourne, Florida, and was witnessed by several persons. The object was described as a silvery, saucer-shaped craft approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, traveling at an estimated speed of 600-800 miles per hour. 

The object was first spotted over Melbourne by Mr. and Mrs. William Coker, who were at their home on the outskirts of the city. They watched the object flash across the sky from east to west at a tremendous rate of speed, and it disappeared from sight within a few seconds.

Mr. and Mrs. Coker immediately called the Melbourne police department to report the sighting. Within a few minutes, the object was spotted by several other persons, including employees of the Melbourne police department and a group of teenagers.

The object was described as glowing brightly and seemed to be metallic in appearance. It was visible for only a very short time, but all the witnesses agreed that it was definitely not an ordinary aircraft.

The Air Force was notified of the incident, and an investigation was launched by the Air Force's Project Blue Book. However, no satisfactory explanation for the mysterious object has ever been found.
