GENERAL/
20 APR 1960 
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
1. On 7 May 1960 at approximately 2100 hours, Mr. BENTLEY, a resident of MICHIG#N, heard a loud buzzing sound and observed an unidentified object hovering over a nearby field. He reported that the object appeared to be approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter and emitted a reddish glow. It hovered over the field for several minutes before suddenly ascending vertically at a high rate of speed and disappearing from sight. 
2. Mr. BENTLEY stated that he was able to observe the object through binoculars and noticed that it appeared to be circular in shape with a dome-like upper portion. He also reported that the object made no sound during its hovering and ascent phases.
3. This case was investigated by Project BLUE BOOK and evaluated as UNKNOWN. The object could not be identified and there was no evidence to suggest it was a conventional aircraft, weather balloon, or other known object.
