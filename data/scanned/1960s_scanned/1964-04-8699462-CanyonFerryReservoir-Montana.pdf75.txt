RESUME
Attached is a questionnaire filled in by [redacted]
When I talked to the State Police the following day, they indicated this man was drunk when they went out to check on this object he had seen and shot at. They said they couldn't arrest the man for shooting since he had done it on his own property. From this information, I discount his seeing an actual object. There were no unidentified's reported by "Vest Tesa Radar Site on that night."
