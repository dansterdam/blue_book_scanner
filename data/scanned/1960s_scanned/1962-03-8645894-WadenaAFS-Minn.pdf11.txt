The image contains three sketches or drawings. The top sketch depicts a curved line with a curved top, similar to a half-circle or dome, with the text "In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown as 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (or skyline) when you first saw it." The middle sketch shows a silhouetted figure standing in front of a landscape with a wide curved horizon, and the text "It is the following larger sketch (place an 'A' at the position where you first saw it). Before you sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch." The bottom sketch appears to be a side view or profile of a curved object or object.
