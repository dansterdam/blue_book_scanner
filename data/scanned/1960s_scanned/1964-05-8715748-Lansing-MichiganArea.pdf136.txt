About 39-40 miles per hour. The actual angle of visibility may be as little as to degrees if account is taken of partial visibility through the trees. The relatively small size of the object would be normal to the line of sight. If this were normal to the line of sight, the speeds would be raised higher.

A point about 1/2 degree had disappeared behind the trees. In about ten minutes, they heard the same sound again, and this time believed at the bedroom window that they could see the object for about five seconds. The direction was the same (approximately) as before.

The object was "much farther" away and appeared half as large as before. As it passed behind the trees at the west end of the field, it appeared smaller in apparent size. Io was still midday, and the shape could not be clearly seen, although it was smaller in apparent size.

The observers say the object clearly on the first pass, both of them. On the second pass, they agreed it was bright like a star, with no discernible shape. The light was white, the remainder being a steady bright red. These lights were described as Mrs. [REDACTED]'s car's going on and off like Christmas-tree lights, and as steady by Mr. [REDACTED]. The whole procedure was completed in two passes, while Mr. [REDACTED] say them both times, once at much closer range.

Both witnesses described the body of the object as glowing, with a single uniform glow illumination of which the color was a pale sort, and found a red pencil with which to sketch its size, as the diameter of their house showed. Her sketch is shown as Fig. 8.

On both passes, the object showed an elongated appearance as it seemed to be tipped somewhat toward or away from the observers.

Witnesses state that the object definitely was not a helicopter, as no National Guard unit is stationed that a very likely source could come from.
