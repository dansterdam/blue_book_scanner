UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Joppatowne, Maryland
DATE 22 April 1969
AF Negative
IR Negative
QUALITY Poor
1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 69-108, submitted by the Office of Scientific Consultants, requesting analysis of a photograph purported to contain an unidentified flying object, taken at Joppatowne, Maryland, 22 April 1969.
2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the negative submitted to Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla by the source shows that the image is probably due to a photographic error. The resolution is too low to permit identification of the areas indicated by the subject. The overall granularity of the negative is too low to permit identification of any combination of debris and reflections within the critical system, however, without further information on atmospheric and viewing conditions it is impossible to attach any meaning to the anomalies.
