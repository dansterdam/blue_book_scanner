Hynek: How long did the whole thing last?
Response: About three or four minutes.

Hynek: And in what way did it disappear?
Response: Well, I don't know, it just disappear'd. We were looking at it and it was gone.  

Hynek: You mean it went out like a light bulb?
Response: It just went out, like that.

Hynek: Could you actually make out any outlines or was the light so bright that you couldn't see any outlines?
Response: I couldn't tell about any edge or anything, it was just round.

Hynek: Did the light go all over the edges?
Response: It looked like it did.

Hynek: So if there was any actual object there, you probably couldn't have seen it, is that right?
Response: I guess not.

Hynek: So as far as you are concerned, it was basically a light?
Response: Yes, with lights all around it.

Hynek: Do you have any idea how many lights? Were you frightened at all?
Response: Well, right at first, I didn't know what it was. I saw my cousin and he seen it too.

Hynek: Did it have any effect on the animals?
Response: Well, the dogs started barking. I didn't notice anything about the cows, but the dogs started barking.

Hynek: Well, do you think they were barking at it or something else?
Response: I don't know, but that was the only thing around to bark at.

Hynek: What did your parents think about all this when you told them?
Response: Well, it kind of scared them. They didn't know what to think about it.

Hynek: Had they ever seen anything like it?
Response: No.

Hynek: You don't know of anyone else who saw it that night?
Response: No, I guess there weren't many people up at 4 o'clock in the morning.

Hynek: How come you were up that early?
Response: We were hauling hay.
