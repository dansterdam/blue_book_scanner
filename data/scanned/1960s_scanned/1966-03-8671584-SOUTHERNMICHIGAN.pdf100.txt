SOME DAY...
Saucers for Real?
That Would Bore Us

The Times article contends that the
real thing is almost certain to be
far less...stimulating, perhaps par
ticularly if the visitors are no
more interesting than cats or
rubber-banded "boxes of junk."

After the first few landings,
the public will begin to find
the whole business tiresome.
Those years ago, the prediction
was that man would shortly
travel in space thrilled and
enchanted. It never worked out
exactly, when space travel became a
reality, when passengers encountered a
serious emergency shutdown of favorite
TV programs in order to report what
was going on in space.

NOTHING FAILS NEVS
After the first few auceer
arrivals, we will ask "What's
the use of interrupting programs to
report latebreaking saucer land
ings of a few more balls?"

This is why the public
says the saucers we do not
exist: once their existence
is established, something extraordinary,
we will take for granted like any
other common phenomenon. The crash
Landings and filings of
George E. Johnson, the crash
of airliner and the landings,
great or small.

What we want is to preserve
the possibility that flying
saucers exist without ever
really having to prove any
thing. So long as the flying sau
cers are a possibility, we con
jecture about them and the
universe.

So long as they are merely
a possibility, it is possible
that they really may have
Michael Rennie aboard, with
little green men with glass
globes around their heads.
