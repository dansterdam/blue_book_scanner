The image contains a sketch of a compass with directions and angles. There is no photograph present in the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the same curved line 15 degrees below the horizon (skyline) to show where the object was when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "G" as the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 1 OBJECT Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
