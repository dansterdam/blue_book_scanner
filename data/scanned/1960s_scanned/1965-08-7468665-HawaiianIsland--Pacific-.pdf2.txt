1. According to a summary of UFO activity in the Hawaiian area, 2 August to 5 August 1965, five UFOs were reported. One of them (PART D) received widespread publicity in Hawaii resulting in increased reporting and public reaction.

a. On 3 August, 06002 (3/2000 local) a family living in Wailuku, Maui at high altitudes and on various headings saw five lights approaching from the northeast. The lights appeared to be hovering, some stationary, some moving and descending. They could observe the sky from a position approximately 7 miles from the city. It was raining slightly. No one else reported the lights, even though they reportedly were visible for some time.

b. On 4 August, 06442 (3/2044 local) numerous sightings were made of an object which fell from the sky southwestward. The reports differed on the object's direction and altitude. It was described as round, disc-shaped, and on some occasions it appeared to be two objects. All witnesses stated it was flying at 31,000' on the 290Â° radial 180 mi out of Honolulu VORTAC. It was bright enough to illuminate the cockpit as it fell to the north, but some pilots believed there was actually two separate lights operating together in what seemed to be a unitary vehicle. The two pilots tried to track it like a ground sighting. Our investigation shows this was likely a meteor or atmospheric phenomena and it is unlikely that it was a space vehicle, although analysis continues.
