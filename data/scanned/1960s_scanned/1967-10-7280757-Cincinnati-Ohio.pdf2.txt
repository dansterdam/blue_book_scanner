The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, which includes handwritten notes and text.

Duty Officer's Comments:
Another UFO report from Cincinnati at about the same time was phoned in to and received an UFOC at AFRCC Command for a 7:20 PM attempt to contact the caller. The coming in being unsuccessful - and parted to be handled as comparison purposes to the DO is unable to do so.
