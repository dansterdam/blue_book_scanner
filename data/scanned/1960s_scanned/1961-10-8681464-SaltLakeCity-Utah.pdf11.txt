19a(2) Pertinent features - None observable in addition to 19a(6) above.
19b(1) What called attention to object - First saw it when he was making take-off run at 15a(6) above.
19b(2) Angle, elevation, azimuth - Object first sighted directly south of Utah Center, 18 degrees above the horizon. At closest point it passed within three to five miles of the observer. His altitude was 4,000 feet at that time.
19b(3) Angle, elevation and azimuth at time of disappearance - After maneuvering for about 200 degrees, the object disappeared out of sight. This occurred at a twenty degree angle or slightly more and was seen for a second or two.
19b(4) Altitude, path and maneuvers - When the object was within three to five miles of the observer, he observed the object standing still in the air for a little while, then started rocking motion. Then it would speed up like an elevator for a little then slow down appearing to be hovering. This indicated to the observer that it was under intelligent control. It then started directly over the OMRI, stayed at that position for a minute or two and then made a turn and disappeared from sight. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 6,000 feet.
19b(5) How did object disappear? Climbed toward - west on a 245 or 260 degree heading, climbing on about a 20 degree angle. Disappeared out of sight in a second or two. Estimated speed at time of disappearance in the thousands of miles per hour.
19b(6) How long object visible - Five to seven minutes.
15a(1) Manner of observation - Naked eye.
15a(2) Optical aids - None.
