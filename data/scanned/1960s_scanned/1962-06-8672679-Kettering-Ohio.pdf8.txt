The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved object in the sky above the horizon, with the instructions to draw an "X" on the object and a "G" to show how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows a landscape with a person standing on a road, with instructions to draw a smaller sketch to show the position of the object when first sighted.
