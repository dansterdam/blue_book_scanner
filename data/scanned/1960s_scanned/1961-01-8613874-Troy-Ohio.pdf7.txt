Dear Sirs:
I can't quite know how to begin on this, but I feel I should write to you. That I don't know how to put it, but I feel I should.
I have taken sightings of unidentified flying objects twice in the past eight months and I have been very much puzzled and disturbed by them. The first time was around August last year when I saw an object hovering over the house for a short time.
It was of an elongated shape, a greyish silver color, and made no sound at all. It seemed to be suspended in the air. I watched it for perhaps two or three minutes and then it slowly moved off in a straight line and disappeared. I was quite close to it, not more than 250 yards away, and I could see it quite clearly.
The second time was around Christmas time, December 26. This time there were two, quite close together, moving rapidly in a straight line across the sky. They were globular in shape, greyish white in color, and again there was no sound at all, just a steady rapid motion across the sky until they disappeared. This was a distance of perhaps half a mile.
The first thing I noticed about it was that there was no sound whatsoever, and that it was hovering or floating in the air. There was no propeller or jet sound and it seemed to be suspended without any visible means of propulsion.
This is so against all our normal concepts of flight that I am quite puzzled and disturbed by it. I should add that I am a practical engineer with a mechanical and scientific background, and I try to be objective in my outlook on life.
I wonder if you could enlighten me on this matter at all. I have read a little about the whole subject of unidentified flying objects, but I must admit I am quite puzzled and disturbed by my own experiences.
Yours sincerely,
