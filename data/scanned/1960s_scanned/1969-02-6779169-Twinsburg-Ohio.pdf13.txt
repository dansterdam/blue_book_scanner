There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE? DID THE PHENOMENON
STAND STILL? ANOTHER? SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP, DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR? 
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SPARKS?
TRAIL SMOKE?
CHANGE SHAPE?
LEAVE OR DISAPPEAR? REAPPEAR?
THIS LUMINOUS OR FLUTTERY OR PULSATE?
IN WHAT DID IT ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
The luminous or fluttering object distracted whilst driving.

A HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It faded away out of sight.

B. WHAT MOVES BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING?
No other movements were noted.
