The text in the document reads:

"These came quickly, a swift movement
quite and it was like a white object
about three times the size of an automobile.
The speed was terrific, about 3000 miles
per hour approximately, height was 500 to
1500 feet, it flew just below the hill.
When it came towards me I had a feeling 
of great magnitude time seemed to stand still, 
changing color.
I do might have seen something
out certainly, mysterious to me. I'm going
to let you decide. I would be very grateful
for a reply and if it any way I can
be of service please let me know.
I do have research and a friend mine
having some data with astronomy and
echo with meters. Thank you for
taking time out to read this.
Your friend"
