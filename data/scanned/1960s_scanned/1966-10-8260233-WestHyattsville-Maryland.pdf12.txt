The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

1. This replies to your correspondence of June 17, 1967 to which your report of UFO observation of date 22 Dec 66 refers. AFRCA-4 31603621 and your photograph is inclosed.

2. Your photograph was submitted to photo analysis experts to determine whether evidence of the object which you photographed. Their analysis indicated that poor photographic quality and insufficient clarity prohibited meaningful analysis from establishing the identity or determining the nature of the object in the photograph. This is consistent with the difficulty of obtaining good photographic documentation of UFO sightings at that time.

3. Thank you for your interest in the Air Force's investigation of UFO, and for providing the photograph is inclosed.
