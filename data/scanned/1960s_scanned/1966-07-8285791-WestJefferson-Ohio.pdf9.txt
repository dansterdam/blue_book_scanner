The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page states "This sighting cannot be associated with any known air traffic phenomena in this particular locale. I suspect probable misannounced, unauthorized fire works in connection with holiday weekends."
