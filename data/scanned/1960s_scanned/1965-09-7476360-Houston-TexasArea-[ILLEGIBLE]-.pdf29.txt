DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
329TH AIR BASE SQUADRON (CCIAC)
BELLGTON AIR FORCE BASE, TEXAS 77320

14 December 1965

BOT-P

SUBJECT: Transmittal of UFO Information

TO: ACOR-N
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. In forwarding the report received in the Houston area since the second half of November 1965, I do not section any unusual activity, based on previous experience. UFO activity has slowed down considerably and I therefore hold nothing back for possible future interest in such area.

2. Unless you consider that any very unusual report will forward any such cases immediately after completion of local investigation.
