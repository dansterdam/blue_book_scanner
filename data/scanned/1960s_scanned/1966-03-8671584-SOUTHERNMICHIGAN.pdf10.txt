REPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DEXTER, MICHIGAN SIGHTING OF 20 MARCH AND THE HILLSDALE, MICHIGAN SIGHTING OF 21 MARCH 1966

Primary
The two sightings at Dexter and Hillsdale, respectively, may be called the crucial sightings which became the focal point of local attention (and later of nationwide) and had associated with them a veritable barrage of other reports and significant association with the two principal events under discussion here. It is possible that many of these were the result of the general excitement surrounding these events and of suggestibility on the part of those who reported them. However, there were reports of odd sightings, particularly in the Milan area, a few nights previous to the sightings discussed. It would have taken an array of investigators to have exhaustively looked into all of these. In the course of my three days of investigation, I talked with the following people at some length and with a host of others in passing.

County Sheriff Harvey - Washtenaw County
Deputy Stanley McFadden
Deputy David Fitzpatrick
Patrolman Runneals
Colonel Gerald D. Miller
