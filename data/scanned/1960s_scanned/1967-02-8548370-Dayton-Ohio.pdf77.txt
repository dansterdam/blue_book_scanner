17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound none

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. IF you had performed this experiment at the time, do you estimate the angular size would have been: Very little
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you are such as colors, proportions, etc., and especially indicate traits or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
