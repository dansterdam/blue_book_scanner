There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Although the description given to you matches what we saw last night, I'm sorry to say that I can't definitely corroborate the information given. The object observed varied from a bright light to at high altitude. The variations are highly suggestive but are also difficult to attribute to any known object or phenomenon with any confidence.

I have contineed use of an experimental view-finder, high intensity strobe system, which flashes directly at objects observed when a close contact is indicated. I believe I've managed to obtain a clear photograph of the object on one occasion, and as soon as I have processed the film, I shall be pleased to forward a print to you. However, I constantly remind myself to keep my emotions in check, when reporting observations, and to avoid speculation or reaching conclusions not supported by the available evidence.

I'll be pleased to submit any additional data that comes to my attention, and believe I am still generally qualified to be your reporter on this type of unidentified sighting. Obstacles in your path distress me, but I take a long-range view, which embraces the difficulties.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,

P.S. The pressure for open hearings has been mounting. It looks as though set for 23-24 May. And therefore a list of bills pending.
