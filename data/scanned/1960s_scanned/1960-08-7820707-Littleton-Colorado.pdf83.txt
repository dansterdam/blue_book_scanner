This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text present in the image is as follows:

DATA PROCESSING DIVISION
CLIMATIC CENTER, USAF
AIR WEATHER SERVICE, ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA

REFERENCE: S.E.C. 103.7-25-16
DATE: AUGUST 19, 1960

TO: ATIC/TAFE, OHIO

1. Reference is made to T.r. message AFOTN-43 20-8-60-000.
At that time, certain negative and instructional films from Climactic Center, USAF, were and enclosed, photographs of the T.r. report 21. It is felt that the evaluation results of the photographic analysis should be included as a part of the complete data for determination of unusual weather conditions for the area represented.

However, regard for this area is not an aregistered weather records area. The films forwarded were not for the purpose of photo analysis, but merely to provide supplementary instructions for climactic date processing of weather records from California.
