Dear Captain:

In response to your request to submit data pertaining to a sighting of UFO's in the vicinity of the Kwajalein Islands in the Pacific, I would like to submit my observations.

On the evening of July 6, 1964, during the missile evaluation project being conducted by our Company on Kwajalein Island, myself and others on the field observed a strange light in the sky southwest of our location. This light was first sighted at approximately 8:00 PM and was visible in the sky for approximately 10-15 minutes. The light was observed to be stationary at first, then it started to move in a lateral motion across the sky at a very high rate of speed, stopping suddenly and becoming stationary again. 

It then started to descend in an erratic zig-zag pattern and was observed to emit small white lights at various points in its descent. The object was observed by several people on the field, all of whom were quite startled by the strange maneuvers of this light. The sighting was terminated when the object appeared to land or impact in the water approximately 2-3 miles southwest of our location.

I considered and rejected the idea that these were (1) aircraft or (2) balloons or blimps, as it was impossible to determine the actual size, speed and altitude of the object due to the lack of reference points. It was impossible to determine the actual nature or identity of these lights at the time of the sighting.

I hope that these observations will be of some assistance to you in your investigation of this incident.

Sincerely,
[Redacted], Florida
