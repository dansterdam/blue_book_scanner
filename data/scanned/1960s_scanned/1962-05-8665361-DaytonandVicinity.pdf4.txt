At about 2:50 p.m. of 11 of the month. The object was seen by two people, a man and a woman, in the sky near the Dayton area. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and it was moving at a high rate of speed. When first seen, the object was at a high altitude and appeared to be about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. The object then began descending rapidly, it was estimated to be at least 20,000 feet above the ground. As the object came down, it appeared to increase in size and it seemed to be glowing or emitting some type of light. The object then leveled off and began moving in a straight line, maintaining a constant altitude. After traveling a short distance, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The observation lasted approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The observers could not determine the exact size or distance of the object, but they were convinced that it was a genuine UFO sighting.
