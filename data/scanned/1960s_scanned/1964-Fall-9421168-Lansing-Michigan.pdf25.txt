FORMATION OF ELEVEN

August 9, 1964, near North Belton, Texas, a party of eleven persons was in a field observing a brilliant light in the sky. This light appeared to be descending toward them. They watched this light for approximately 30 minutes. During this time, the light moved around in the sky, changing color and shape. It would then disappear for a few seconds and reappear in a different position. 

The eleven persons in the formation were: Mr. and Mrs. Lou Hammond, Mr. and Mrs. Ben Wolfe, and Leonie Alezander.
