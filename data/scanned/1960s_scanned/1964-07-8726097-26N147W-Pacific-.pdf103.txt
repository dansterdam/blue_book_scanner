The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a handwritten document. I will proceed to extract the text from the document as an OCR system would.

Captain R. T. Steward
Comtrol of the Nights of July 4 1964
my Batt lost an Engine and Tail Assembly which we could not find nor re-assemble. The airplane was making Gear Up landing when the Captain saw what appeared to be a round lighted obiect stationary at his 11 oclock position. He banked to the Right to observe it, and as the airplane lowered on the Gear Up landing, the obiect iust faded away toward the East. The Captain said the obiect appeared to be approximately 100 feet in diameter, and giving off a yellowish-white light. He could discern no motors or means of propulsion. As the airplane landed Gear Up, he could see no trace of the obiect upon his touchdown.
This happened 26 N 147 W Pacific Ocean.
