There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a document with text describing findings and conclusions from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

LRS-2
cannot be proven to have been present or taken place at the recorded
time of the sighting.

Late in 1947, the Department of the Air Force was designated as
the official mechanism of the United States Government for investigating and evaluating reports on unexplained flying objects and of
determining any latent threat to the national security. The organization then established, known for many years as Project Blue Book, is
charged with monitoring, investigating, documenting and evaluating
alleged UFO sightings within the continental United States.

In addition to Air Force in-house efforts to document and
analyze the broad spectrum of sightings, special non-government consultant panels periodically have been formed to review investigatory
procedures and findings of the best documented UFO cases. Also, an
industrial consultant firm was directed to conduct an exhaustive
examination of the procedures adopted for reducing sighting data to
a form usable in later statistical manipulation and graphic depiction.

The published findings of the study efforts, both by the Air
Force and independent consultants, contain five major points:
1. UFO's do not pose a threat to the nation;
2. UFO's do not represent developments or principles
beyond present-day scientific knowledge;
3. There is no evidence of extraterrestrial vehicles
under the control of an intelligent being;
4. There is no evidence of physical matter left behind
by a reported UFO;
5. Some small fraction of total sightings remain
"unidentified."
