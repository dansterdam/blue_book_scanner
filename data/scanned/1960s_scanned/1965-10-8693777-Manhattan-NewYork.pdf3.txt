Dear Sirs:

On Friday, the 8th of this month at about 6:15 P.M. over Manhattan, New York, I saw what appears to be a plane, blimp, etc. It was a fairly large, silvery craft and below the cloud cover. Could your department confirm the sighting. Could you also send me some information about past UFO sightings.

Thank you very much.
Respectfully,
