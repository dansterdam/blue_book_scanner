MANY LANDINGS IN MEXICO: A news report from early September states several recent landings in various parts of Mexico. Some are of the "saucer" variety; and therefore found a bit suspicious to us. Others, in our opinion, involve more "orthodox" landings including the National Polytechnic Institute itself. Pictures of rocks apparently scorched by the landings were prominently displayed in local newspapers. And, in a remote province (unnamed in the article), a number of these have landed and to have been captured by the Mexican Army, though no details. In another case, residents of the Texoco area on the Mexico City scene say a saucer land on a local lake and sink below the surface. A newspaper reporter was assigned to spend a day on the lake looking, but he found nothing.

As for the "contactee" stories, they involve at least two dentist - one group from Mexico City's University, and the other age - who claim they were taken for rides in flying saucers. Students were allegedly taken to the third moon of Jupiter in a good-looking seven-foot-tall giants, who were clad in one-piece suit of some sort of stretch fabric. The giants neither talked nor operated any controls, but apparently did everything by telepathic students reported finding a family from Brazil already living there for at least several months ago. The family had been there several months ago. The family had been taken there, all of whom are blue-eyed blonds similar in appearance to Norse origin.
