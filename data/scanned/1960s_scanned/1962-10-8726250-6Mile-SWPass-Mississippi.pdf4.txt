No Case (Information Only)
6 October 1962
Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio

Cuyahoga Falls-Oct 6, 1962-6:50 PM EST
Two high-school-12-13 boys were driving along the field near Rt 8. They described it as about 2 inches long at first. They described and its thickness was about 1/10 the length. It was itself a source of light. It looked like a plate turned upside down, and did so for about 5 fat seconds. The clew was about the size of a half dollar, and seemed to be over the high overhead bridge on Rte 8. Obs Rob. Rich.
