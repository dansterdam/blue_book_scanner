Dear siri:
On the night of October 29, at approximately 9:30 P.M., a mysterious green light appeared in the west and hovered at terrific speed. Please don't think this is a favorite topic of mine.
Yours truly 
25. Dan sent the effect of the green light to the author to study, but didn't not really imply a moral, it went to facts.
