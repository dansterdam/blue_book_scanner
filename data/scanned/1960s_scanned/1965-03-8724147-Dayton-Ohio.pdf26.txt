The object was not visible when the witness first noticed it. At approximately 8:10 p.m., the witness noticed that there appeared to be a dim, mist-like object hovering only a few feet from the ground. The object then began moving slowly, but rapidly gained speed and altitude. The object appeared to be oval-shaped and had no lights. The witness said that the object seemed to be picking up smoke or dust from the ground as it moved. The object disappeared from view in a northeasterly direction after about 2 minutes.
