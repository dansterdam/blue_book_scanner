Called Mr Henry Deaboski, ONR on 16 Jul 65. They released four balloons on 5 Jul 65. Two of which they lost track on. 2.94/cm ft balloon beacon went out, tracked for five hours after launch. Launched at 0349 local and was seen over at Vancouver on 7 Jul, tracked visually until midnight, 104' W long 49.35°N latitude, drifting northwest 70 miles an hour. Other balloon, 10.6 million cu ft balloon launched at 0026, local was presumed down, because everything went out on balloon. It had been tracked visually for twelve hours.
2.94/cm ft Balloon.
These balloons were released by a contractor at Churchill, Canada. Left Churchill at 125,000 ft alt. The balloon is approximately 200 ft long, a parachute about 30 ft then another line 20 ft to payload, making total size approximately 250 to 300 ft extended. Lengths of strings is varied. The package carried was a sphere 5 ft diameter. Something may have gone wrong on the ducting. It is a Cosmic Ray Research Experiment and there is nothing classified on it. They fly from Churchill for it is the connection to the magnetic line, they project their balloons to the west. At first he didn't think it could be their balloon but after many many phone calls he feels there is a good probability of it being theirs. Doesn't understand why no one picked it up on radar as it had radar reflector on it. Of the four balloons launched on the 5th there are the only two not recovered. would appreciate getting it back, its a sophisticated package worth approximately $100,000.
Churchill is on Hudson Bay, 59° North latitude near Manitoba, Canada.

We are positive it is a balloon, however, additional confirmation can not be made unless the package from one of these two balloons is found.
