The image appears to contain a technical sketch or diagram, which seems to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The sketch does not depict any human faces or identifiable individuals.

Text from the document:

It appears to be a street light about 450 feet away. A stick match at arms length pinned the head of the same light. If this test had been made on April 7, 1966 the head of the stick would have covered the object completely.
