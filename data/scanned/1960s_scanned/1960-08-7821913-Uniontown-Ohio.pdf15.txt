The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

As this report now I am certainly convincing in my attempt at writing a report on the incident occurring.  It seems that a luminous object was seen by me this evening.  It appeared very suddenly, and almost instantly disappeared.  It had no apparent color, but seemed very bright, and was quite sufficient to illuminate the area around for a short time.  I was unable to see any shape or form, but there was no doubt that it was not an ordinary phenomenon.  We live in a rural area, and it is not often that such an incident occurs.  It went through the sky in a horizontal path, and with great speed.  I am quite convinced that this was not an airplane, nor any other known type of aircraft.
