LETTER TO MAJOR HECTOR QUINTANILLA
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting Report
LOCATION: Dayton, Ohio
DATE: January 6, 1968

On January 6, 1968 at approximately 7:30 p.m., Mr. Robert Riggs, a resident of Dayton, Ohio, reported sighting an unidentified aerial object in the sky over his home. According to Mr. Riggs, the object appeared to be a bright, glowing light that moved rapidly across the sky, then suddenly disappeared. Mr. Riggs stated that the object was visible for only a few seconds, but during that time it seemed to travel a considerable distance.

Mr. Riggs immediately contacted the local police department to report the sighting. The police in turn notified the United States Air Force, and an investigation was initiated by Project Blue Book, the official Air Force program for investigating unidentified aerial phenomena.

As part of the investigation, Mr. Riggs was interviewed by Air Force personnel and asked to provide a detailed description of what he had observed. Mr. Riggs stated that the object was a bright, luminous light that appeared to be disc-shaped. He estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. Mr. Riggs also reported that the object moved at a high rate of speed, estimated to be around 1,000 miles per hour.

The Air Force investigation was unable to determine the precise nature or origin of the unidentified aerial object reported by Mr. Riggs. No other witnesses to the event were identified, and no physical evidence, such as photographs or radar tracking data, was obtained.

Based on the information provided by Mr. Riggs, the case was classified as "unidentified" by Project Blue Book. The Air Force concluded that, while the sighting was a genuine and credible report, there was insufficient evidence to determine the specific nature or source of the unidentified aerial object.

The case was thoroughly investigated, but remained unresolved. It has been included in the official records of Project Blue Book as an unidentified aerial phenomenon.
