GEMINI TWINS SEE BUT FAIL TO PHOTOGRAPH UFOS: The Gemini 4 astronauts, James McDivitt and Edward H. White II, both reported sighting UFOs on three occasions, one over China, one over Hawaii and one over Asia. The one over China looked like a "bright star moving fast". They photographed the one over Hawaii, which was "round, white with a trail of light and a fanlike glow". The sightings and films are being studied by NASA.
