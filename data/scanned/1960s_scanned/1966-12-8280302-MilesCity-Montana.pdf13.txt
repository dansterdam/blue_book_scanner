The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on a form. I will now proceed to extract the text from the image:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
7  Dec 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.  

We think there is a slight explanation of the object as it passed overhead as a tight flight or a slight rise. It appeared as though it landed or was something that stopped along the bottom of the missile silo about two miles dis tant.

Unfortunately definition must have been obscured perhaps a small plane at a slight distance. The normal appearance as to speed or location appeared different or unusual as to might or in a slight rise.
