The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a textual description of an observed UFO event. As per the instructions, I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text from the document:

The plane arrived at Rechester, and at that point the object veered off and departed toward the NE at a high rate of speed; the airplane continued in a straight-in approach, arrival having been at 11:15 A.M. on the 10th.

[redacted] noted that as the object veered off, it changed shape into an oval, the long axis being vertical; at this point there was a bright glow running vertically, with an oval mist or vapor around it. The impression was that he had been watching a flattened disc-shaped object, and saw it turn away like a swell rolling around a curve.  

The night was perfectly clear; [redacted] first thought was that he was seeing a cellometer beam, but then he realized that there were no clouds at all.
