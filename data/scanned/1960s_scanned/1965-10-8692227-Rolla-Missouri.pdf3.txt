NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA  
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR  
1536 CONNECTICUT AVENUE, N.W.  
WASHINGTON 6, D.C.

October 8, 1965

Honorable Lyndon B. Johnson
The White House
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. President:

I am writing to express the grave concern of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena over the continued secrecy and deception surrounding the subject of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

For the past eighteen years, the United States Air Force has conducted Project Blue Book, a study of UFO reports. This project has been a sham, failing to reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon. Project Blue Book has consistently denied, debunked, and hidden the facts about UFOs.

Overwhelming evidence, much of it classified, points to the fact that UFOs are real, that they are of extraterrestrial origin, and that their presence on our planet poses a serious threat to our national security. Despite this, the Air Force has refused to fully inform the Congress, the President, and the public about the true nature of the UFO problem.

The time has come for the government to act responsibly and to end the official campaign of secrecy and deception. The American people have a right to know the facts about UFOs. We urge you, as President, to take immediate action to open up the truth about UFOs.

Sincerely,  
[Signature]
Major Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (Ret.)
Director
