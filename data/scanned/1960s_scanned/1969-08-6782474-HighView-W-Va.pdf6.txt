The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO sighting. The sketch includes a curved line to represent the horizon, an angular object above the horizon, and a compass-like drawing with instructions on how to orient it. There is also a section where the observer is instructed to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
