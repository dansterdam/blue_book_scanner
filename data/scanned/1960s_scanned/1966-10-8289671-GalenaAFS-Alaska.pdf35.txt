The image does not appear to contain any photographs. The text describes an incident where investigators observed a helicopter cruising at low altitude with several red running lights and two white lights, presenting a "most striking appearance." The text also mentions that three cases had photographs taken, but does not describe any images in this particular document.

Transcribing the text in the document:

It is known that there are helicopters in the area equipped with very bright floodlights, directed downward, which are used during night search and rescue missions. Many possible bases for a helicopter were contacted, including police both local and county, a Marine base, several Coast Guard bases, several Navy bases, private organizations, and SAGE Operations. None had a helicopter operating at the right place and time.

There must still be a source missing, however, because the investigators, on the following night, while traveling on the North Road through the area in question and at the same hour, saw a helicopter cruising at low altitude in the place where no helicopter operations could be accounted for. This helicopter showed several red running lights and two white lights (not floodlights, however), and presented a most striking appearance.

We cannot call this case positively identified yet, because there is no sighting in which the object can be associated with a known flight or a properly equipped helicopter.

THE PHOTOGRAPHS

In three cases, photographs were taken. The first appeared in newspapers on 22 October, and showed only a much-enlarged round fuzzy object. This was said to be a photograph of what the police in Patchogue had seen. The original negative was seen by GAPR personnel, who reported that the image was 0.025 inch in diameter. It is certainly a stellar image.

The second photo was taken by [REDACTED]. He stated that he saw an oval object to the west, from a position just off the New York Expressway (Lt. Marley will provide a more detailed report). The object was covered by clouds in about 15 seconds.
