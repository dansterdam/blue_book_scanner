The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions and answers about a reported UFO sighting.

Here is the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? It so, how?
Gradually faded out of sight-

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. 
If you answered YES, then tell what:
Moved behind clouds and disappeared.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what:
No.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None heard 
b. Color: White 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
about 1 inch

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show the trail or vapor trail. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
