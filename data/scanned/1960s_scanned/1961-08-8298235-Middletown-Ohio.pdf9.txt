The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing questions and handwritten responses.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
[A drawing of a curved line with an "A" at one end and a "B" at the other is shown.]

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
[Handwritten response:] 7 inches
[Handwritten response:] We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
[Handwritten response:] about 1 if viewed with one eye.

22. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
[Handwritten response:] No

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
[Handwritten response:] a large balloon with an object attached to it or beneath it of dim lighted nature, the manner of flight was slow and deliberate at a high altitude.
