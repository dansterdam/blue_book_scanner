CHERRY CREEK, NEW YORK
19 AUGUST 1965

The witness was working in a barn when he noticed unusual AM radio interference plus a beeping sound. When he went outside he saw an object which he described as being shaped like a disc plating a little color. The object was hovering and had red glowing streamers projecting downward from the entire perimeter plus a white spotlight to have appeared to have moved to the clouds. The clouds then turned green (color of tree leaves) and an odor like burning gasoline was noted.

Four to five minutes later the object reappeared descending slowly from the clouds and then ascended back up into the clouds emitting a white light again. The object disappeared at 2100 hours, descending toward the surface. No landing or take-off was noted.

The object was reported to have caused reduction in the milk from the farmer's cow from 25 cans to 14 cans, disturbed a dog which began to bark.

The State Police patrolman who interviewed the witnesses said it was his impression that the sighting could not be a hoax, but he did not feel that it was an airplane or anything earthly. No physical evidence or landing was found except an oily substance which was found to be a combination of stringent or German violet plus 3-nitro-oil which is not believed to be connected with this incident.

Although the sequence of events are dubious, the sighting is classified as unidentified by the Air Force since there is no definite concrete explanation.
