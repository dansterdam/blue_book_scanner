5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
Varied
Observer has reported numerous observations of alleged UFOs over the years. The descriptions have varied as have the time (duration) of the sightings. Aircraft are believed responsible for the sightings. Observer has reported four UFO sightings since 29 March 66. However, the witness' descriptions are lacking in details and are considered to be unreliable. The information received was a very poor quality. Further information is necessary before a definite conclusion can be reached; however, the case in question does not warrant such additional investigation.
