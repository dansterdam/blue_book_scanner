REPORT NO: IR-l-61
PART: Security Classification:
SECURITY - This Report Has Been Forwarded to the USAF Technical Information Center, Div, Hill AFB, Utah

The reporting officer is a Security Specialist, GS-9, Security and Law Enforcement Division, Hill AFB, Utah. A preliminary analysis indicates that each of the reported sightings are consistent with conventional types of known aircraft. There is no evidence that the object(s) sighted were not identifiable as conventional missiles, balloons or aircraft.
The object(s) sighted were at times described as being illuminated, and at times not illuminated, from a point which would describe a balloon or aircraft. The evidence available to explain the sighting. The hypothesis that the object was a weather balloon launched from Tooele, Utah seems plausible, as the time of the reported event would be consistent with the upward flight path and reported speed of the object.
No wind slips were present at the time of the sighting.
This report was prepared on the basis of official records maintained by the internal Security Branch, Hill AFB, Utah.
