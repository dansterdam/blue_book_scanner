" see, that seeming two small
that were spot, the biggest
one seen. The strang e mass
seemed advance, to the fact
that did appear at first to
be a thin and sharp edg ed,
became more diffused and
hazy as it seemed to near
observer. The fact that
some reported a 'halo* like
glow around it, may indicate
either a luminosity of its own
or a reflection of the moon.
The object itself, when closest,
appeared solid and about the
size of a orange, and about
200 feet away. Its movement
was purposeful and slow moving,
tho some observers stated it
appeared to make momentary
stops and then move on again.
This appears to be the most
significant report on record
so far, other flying objects
reported in this area about the
same time. The officer who
investigated this particular
incident, stated he was quite
convinced of the reality of
what the observers reported,
tho admitting he could offer
no explanation as to what
the thing actually was.

Then, such occurance to require
further research."
