UFO SIGHTING REPORT

In your own words, please describe the incident as is described. (If additional pages are needed, be sure they are numbered.)

The location of the farm is in Whitefield, Maine. I refer to as Kings Mills. I bought the farm three years ago and spend considerable time there and odd days when I can. Last summer...in late July or the first part of August...I found the farmhouse door I have had ever since then trying to get someone to identify it and I would not have seen it on to you but for what happened last Monday morning. Whether the two things are related or not, I do not know, but they might possibly be. I am not saying they are not. Perhaps the substance of some common material, but no one knows how it got there...we know that it was not there the night before and some put it there as far as we know.
