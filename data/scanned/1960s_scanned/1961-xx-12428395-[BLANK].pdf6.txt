REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TD-E

SUBJECT: Congressional Investigation of the UFO Program

TO: TDGC(General Pierce)

1. An article appeared in the 3 July 1961 issue of Newsweek, stating the possibility of a congressional investigation of the USAF UFO Program. Contact with the Secretary of Air Force, Legislative Liaison Office(SAFLL) revealed that there was no indication that such an investigation would take place.

2. Unofficial sources (SAFL) have it that Congressman Joseph E. Karth, Minnesota, of the House Science and Astronautics Committee (Congressman Overton Brooks, Los Angeles, Chairman) would head the investigating team. The investigation to be directed toward the USAF's handling of the UFO Program, and especially how the capabilities of the FTD in the analysis and investigation areas.

3. SAFL's present efforts are directed toward heading off the investigation. If it is to occur, it is to secure a hearing in Washington D.C. with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Consultant to the UFO Program and Major Robert J. Friend, Aerial Phenomena Branch TD-E in attendance.

4. If the investigation is carried out at FTD I intend to handle it within the Deputy's unless otherwise directed.
