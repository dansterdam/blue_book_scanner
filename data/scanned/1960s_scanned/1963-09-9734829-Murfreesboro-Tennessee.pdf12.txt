THE FIELDS: Nature's Best Mousetrsp
Mr. Clark's Snapping Bill 
Nature's Best Mousetrsp

This bill was given to me by Mr. Clark of the Tennessee, Murfreesboro Rural Route #2, and is dated August 27, 1963. Mr. Clark said this was given to him by a farmer who had it in his possession for several years. 
This bill which is entitled "The Fields" shows a drawing which indicates the death of someone whose head was partially buried in a field. The bill which is about 9x5 inches in size has a printed message on the reverse side which states in part "To the Tennessee Farmer, whose crops were destroyed by the unwelcome fields mouse, we offer this, our product called 'Nature's Best Mouse Trsp' which we guarantee will absolutely destroy all the mouse population in your field." The bill is signed by F. L. Harrell, President. 
I have no further information on this matter, but it seems to me that this "mouse trap" bill was possibly a cover-up or hoax for some other type of incident. The drawing on the bill appears to be inconsistent with a normal mouse trap. I would appreciate any information you might be able to provide on this particular item.
Sincerely yours,
