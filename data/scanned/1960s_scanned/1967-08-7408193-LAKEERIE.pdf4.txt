READ FOR THE RECORD
18 Sept. 1967

Called Coast Guard (231-1570) and talked to Lt. Foster. He had thought that the observation may have been of one of the search boats that were looking for bodies of parachutists that landed in the lake on 27 Aug. Lt. Foster said the search was extended under the direction of the Coast Guard on the night of Aug. 29 or early morning of Aug. 30.

(Coast Guard search was terminated at sunset 29 Aug. till moonrise the followin night.) However, there were many private boats in the area at that time and the Lt. thought that some of them should have been visible.
