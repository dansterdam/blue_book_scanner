The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, with handwritten text on the right side. The text is not legible enough for me to perform optical character recognition (OCR) and accurately extract the full content. The only legible text is the date "7/8 Oct 66" and the location "Covington, Kentucky".
