FLYING SAUCERS STILL LANDING: It seems that the giant 1964 saucer "Flips" is going to continue landing. Shortly after our September issue went to press, we received two more reports of close sightings and landings of these huge craft all over the country.
In the village of Gorham, near Rochester, New York, five children saw a landed craft and a smallish humanoid creature in mid-July. They tried to approach it but were frightened away. The visitor then went back into the craft and it rose silently and swiftly.
In the village of Goctle, near Binghamton, New York, a farmwoman was tending her vegetable garden one afternoon, when she noticed a huge metallic craft descending slowly within a few hundred feet of her. It hovered just above the ground for several minutes, then shot up vertically and disappeared. This incident occurred on July 9th, and the witness, still shaken by her experience, reported it to the local authorities. We have filed her report with the Saucer Center.
