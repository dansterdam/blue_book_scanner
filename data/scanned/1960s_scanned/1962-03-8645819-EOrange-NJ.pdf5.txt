Dear Sir,
Last night I observed something in the sky that might by some indirect or coincidental means be of some interest to you. 
At about thirty past midnight (March 16) I looked up. I saw a light in the sky that moved across the sky. It moved so fast that it occurred to me that it was not an airplane or any other usual type of aircraft. 
A sight later another object came from the direction of the first light object and moved toward it. They appeared to greet each other as they passed, as if it were with any light comes from the distance seen from near to this object with my light came appearing flickering lights.
At a distance and surrounded this object were more and brighter sparkling lights.
Sincerely,
