Center of Public Information
Washington 25, D.C. 
Dear Sirs,

I am writing this letter to report an observation of an unidentified flying object that I observed on the night of July 8, 1964 at approximately 10:00 p.m. Central Standard Time in the vicinity of New Iberia, Louisiana.

The object was sighted by myself and a boy companion who was visiting me at the time. We were standing outside my home at the time and looking up at the stars when the object came into view. It appeared to be traveling in a southwesterly direction at a high rate of speed and was emitting a bright reddish-orange glow. The object made no sound and appeared to be oval or elliptical in shape. It seemed to change direction slightly as it passed overhead and then disappeared from sight. The total observation time was approximately 30-45 seconds.

This is the first and only time I have ever observed an object of this nature and I can assure you that I am not the type of person to imagine or fabricate such an incident. I am a mature, responsible adult and can clearly distinguish between hallucinations, natural occurrences, and something clearly out of the ordinary. I feel the details I have provided are accurate and I would be willing to cooperate further should you desire additional information.

Please let me know if you require any clarification or have additional questions regarding this incident. I await your reply.

Sincerely,
