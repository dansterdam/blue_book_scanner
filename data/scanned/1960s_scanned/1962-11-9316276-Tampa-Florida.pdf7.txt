Dear Captain Henry:

This will confirm my telephone conversation with you a few days ago relative to the unusual sightings of unidentified flying objects that my wife and I witnessed.

This sight was of such unusual proportions that it is my opinion that the sighting should be made a matter of record on the part of the proper agency within our government.

As you know, we were driving along the highway near our home when suddenly we observed what appeared to be several shooting stars, stationary hovering above the horizon out of the Northeast. This object appeared to have two exterior lights - a red light on the top and a green light on the bottom. The object then came to a complete stop in the middle of the sky. After that length of time, the three bright lights went out completely. After that length of time, the three bright lights came to a complete stop. After that length of time, the three bright lights went out completely. After that length of time, the three bright lights came to a complete stop. After that length of time, the three bright lights went out completely. 

We were positively amazed.

If it should be within your power to offer some explanation, we would appreciate hearing from you.

Very truly yours,
FLS/bb
