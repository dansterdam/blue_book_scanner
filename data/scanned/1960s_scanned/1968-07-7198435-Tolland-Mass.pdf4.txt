The image provided does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, but the page is blank except for the text at the top.

The text at the top of the page reads:
"INFORMATION WHICH YOU FURNISH IS PERMANENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ACCURATELY COVERED IN THIS REPORT. PLEASE PROVIDE A NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF ANY UNUSUAL SIGHTING OR OCCURRENCE."
