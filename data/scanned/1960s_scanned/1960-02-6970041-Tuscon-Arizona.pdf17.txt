Dear Sir,
Our Wednesday sighting of some bright moving objects in the sky on February 29, 1960.
At approximately 7:30 PM my husband and I were outside watching a meteor shower when suddenly several bright orange objects appeared in the sky. They appeared to be much higher than the aircraft we are used to seeing and were moving at a very rapid rate of speed. At first we thought they might be satellites, but after observing them for some time, we realized they were not satellites, as they would suddenly change direction and speed. They seemed to be under some type of intelligent control. 
After a few minutes, the objects began to gradually fade and disappear. There were no sounds associated with them that we could hear.
At approximately 8:00 PM, a few of the objects reappeared and seemed to be maneuvering in a methodical fashion, sometimes appearing to hover and then darting off at great speed. They continued this type of maneuver for approximately 15 minutes and then gradually faded from view.
We were both quite amazed at what we saw and feel that it was definitely not any type of conventional aircraft. I am enclosing a rough sketch of what we observed, although it does not do justice to the actual sight.
If you have any questions or would like any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Sincerely yours,
