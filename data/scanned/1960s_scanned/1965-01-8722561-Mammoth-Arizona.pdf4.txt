(2) Other weather and winds: Alott observations at this time and place were:
(1) Observer reported clear skies.
(2) Winds were reported by observer as calm.
(3) No ceiling.
(4) Visibility: good (i.e. 3+). 3 - 15 miles.
(5) Their lights were seen between Catalina and Phoenix.
(6) No thunderstorms in the area.
(7) A typical sighting comparison was developed by an observatory investigator. The object observed was a commercial airliner, probably a Martin 404 en route from Phoenix to Tucson. This assumption was made on the basis of the lights observed, the general flight pattern, and the lack of any unusual maneuvers or characteristics. The lights were apparently standard aircraft positions lights, however, it is not possible to be absolutely certain of the type of aircraft involved. The details reported indicate that this was a rather routine and not an unusual sighting, and does not seem to warrant any further investigation.
