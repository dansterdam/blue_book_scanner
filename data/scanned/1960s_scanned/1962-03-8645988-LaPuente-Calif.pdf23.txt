There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

A detailed output of the text in the document is as follows:

The bright round disoks attalcked sr the sight of Hanna. His object appeared to be circling manuevers, hanging over trees at 1500 ft. 3 separate times it circled at a speed of 800 mph then would hang motionless.

The object appeared to be very large, shiny with rainbow colors reflecting off the surface. It emitted no sound.

The witness described it measuring 30 X 7.5 ft in size. Seen the time was about 7:30 PM, when the object suddenly dissapeared vertically at such great speed that it was out of sight in 2 seconds.

Other witnesses saw the object and verify the description given.

The object was red and green lights were observed at each end of the object and flashing lights frequently.
