There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a form with questions about a UFO sighting.

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP INTO PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
LEAVE A TRAIL?
CHANGE SHAPE?
PLAY OR DANCE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN ON ITS AXIS?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT CREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

Did not see a right angle, just a slight movement.

Beneath the questions, there is a handwritten response that reads: "behind the helicopter pole. Couldn't be seen except occasionally a slight movement."
