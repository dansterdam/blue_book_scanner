26. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common
    object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. 
    While I was driving, I saw a bright light like a star, only much brighter and about the size of a dime. It had a light 
    coloured breast and under the breast would give a similar shape, as it was moving sort of slowly it would turn on its 
    side briefly and show a cigar shape. This is the best description I can give.
