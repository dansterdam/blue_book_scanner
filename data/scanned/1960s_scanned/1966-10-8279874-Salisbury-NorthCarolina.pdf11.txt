The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photograph, only text.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes. It seemed to fly away rapidly above the trees and the mountains. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes NO Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes NO Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Noise
b. Color Brilliant white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Practically all of it.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc.; and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(The hand-drawn sketch shows an ellipse/oval shape with additional notes indicating its movement and trajectory.)
