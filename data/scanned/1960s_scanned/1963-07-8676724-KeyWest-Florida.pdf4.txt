SADDLE BUNCH SHORES
KEY WEST, FLA.
JULY 18, 1963

M.A.P.S.A. 
WASHINGTON 25 D.C.

SIRS:

WHAT I AM REPORTING MAY OR MAY NOT BE OF INTEREST TO YOUR OFFICE. NEVERTHELESS I AM MAKING THIS REPORT.

ON NIGHT OF 18 JULY 1963 FROM MY HOME ON SADDLE BUNCH KEY, NEAR KEY WEST, FLORIDA, I OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE ALMOST DUE NORTH OF MY LOCATION A BRILLIANTLY LUMINOUS OBJECT APPROACHING FROM ALMOST DUE NORTH. UPON CLOSER EXAMINATION I NOTICED THERE WAS NO BLINKING LIGHTS OR RUNNING LIGHTS. THIS OBJECT WAS LITERALLY SILENT AND TRAVELING AT A TREMENDOUS RATE OF SPEED. IT COMPLETED ITS COURSE OVERHEAD AND TURNED TO A WHITISH CLOUD OF SMOKE, PROBABLY DUE TO ALTITUDE AND THE INTENSE HEAT BEING GENERATED. THE OBJECT WAS AS LARGE AS THE FULL MOON AND APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE.

THERE WAS NO TRAIL, SPARKS, FIRE OR FLAME OF ANY KIND AND ALL LIGHTS OR FIRE HAD DISAPPEARED.

THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST PUZZLING THINGS I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE BALLOON THAT WAS VISIBLE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AND LOOKED VERY MUCH AS IT DID. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANYTHING THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS OCCURRENCE, BUT IT QUITE SURE IT WAS AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM MY LOCATION OVER 10 MILES.

ANOTHER THING I NOTICED ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE OF IMPORTANCE, THAT IT APPEARED TO BE DRIFTING OR TOWING SOMETHING SIMILAR IN SIZE AND APPEARANCE BUT HAD SEPARATED SOME DISTANCE AND WAS TRAVELING AT A MUCH HIGHER SPEED.

WHEN IT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED IT SEEMED TO TRAVEL AT A SPEED THAT IN MY OPINION WOULD BE MOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BE ATTAINED BY ANY TYPE OF CRAFT OF ANY KIND. I WOULD APPRECIATE VERY MUCH IF SOMEONE WOULD GIVE THIS INCIDENT SOME CONSIDERATION.

I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS TO BE A FALLING STAR OR ANYTHING I'M FAMILIAR WITH. THANK YOU.
