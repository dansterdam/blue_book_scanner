"Roseburg, Oregon 
July 3, 1962

United States Air Force
Directorate of Intelligence
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs:

On the second Monday in November, 1961, I saw a "object" gliding silently at the top of trees in my yard. This old road that is alongside my house is the route of many sightings. I am certain that it was a flying saucer. If one negatives would not show it to be real I would send them to you.

Yours truly,

P.S. I am holding the last negatives in case you do not mention them."
