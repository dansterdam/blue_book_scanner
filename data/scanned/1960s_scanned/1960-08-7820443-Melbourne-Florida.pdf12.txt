UFO Report (nr

SAFOI-3d (L/Col Tacker)
1. Reference attached letter to USAF from Mr. dated 2 September 1960, and DD Form 2$$ from SAFOI-3d to ATIC requesting information on the UFO case described in above letter.
2. The following answers correspond to the specific questions contained in the referenced letters:
a. VG reports have reached ATIC for 19 August 1960, which parallel this case. 
b. Due to the limited data in this case it is impossible to reach a positive conclusion. There are several possible explanations to account for the observations. This is not unusual when dealing with physical experiences; the UFO being, in lay terms, the results of some phenomenon that is not fully understood when some has is experiencing some degree of excitement.
c. The shadow of the moon is along cone approximately 22,100 miles in length. The area under the shadow length is due to the difference in size of the moon and the sun. Since the moon is always present, it is not always directly evident to us here on earth because of the normal lighting conditions under which it is portrayed (we are able to see evidence of it during phases other than full moon because portions of the moon not lighted by the sun are faintly illuminated by the earth).
d. While full moon the surface of the moon will at least in part be illuminated, when the sun, the earth, and the moon are in a line this illumination is at a minimum (known as a new moon). The average length of the moon's shadow is 232,100 miles. The average distance between the earth and moon is approximately 238,000 miles.
