Burning light
The South Wales Evening Post of September 3 carried a letter from Mrs. V. Franck of Swansea, telling how her daughter was returning at the time, about 11:30 p.m. on August 25, when she saw a bright light approach- ing in the sky. The kitchen light was illuminated by the light, which seemed to burn into the eyes, and she had great difficulty in breathing and became very frightened. Her husband was at work, and she was quite alone at the time. She informed the authorities the next morning.
