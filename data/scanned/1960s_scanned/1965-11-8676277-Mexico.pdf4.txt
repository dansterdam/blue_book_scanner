Unidentified Flying Objects Devision
Wright Patterson Airforce Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs,

I am enclosing a slide which has on it 3 unidentified flying objects.

About a month ago my son in law, [redacted], and daughter, [redacted], were traveling in Mexico. They went west of Guadalajara, to the Pacific coast, and took pictures, including the enclosed. The enclosed was in a primitive area, where they took pictures of a river and primitive dwellings. 

They saw no aircraft, heard no aircraft, and were sure they were far from any beaten path.

When we were watching the slides, we were surprised to see on this slide the 3 objects. I have shown them to several people, and also had 2 5 by 7 enlargements made, and looked at them via microscopes. No one could identify them.

I am enclosing the slide, which you may want an enlargement made to.

Although I would like to know about it, if you were to give it publicity.

[redacted] is a well known teacher from Eastern Kentucky Teachers College and has never been interested in flying objects, nor has his wife.

They couldn't have made an enlargement or said anything, but I thought it should be followed up to some conclusion.

Please inform me if there is any explanation for the objects.

Sincerely,

[redacted]

P.S. I have been an army chaplain and have Major General's commission from U.W.Z.
