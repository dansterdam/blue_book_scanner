The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and sketches related to UFO observations. The diagram shows an angle measurement system, with different angles labeled from 90 degrees to 0 degrees. The sketch at the bottom shows a path with two points labeled "A" and "B", indicating the motion of an observed object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the curve to show where you first saw the object. Place a "D" on the curve where you last saw the object.

90°  A  75°
60°
45°  C 30°
15°
0° 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A                  B

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
