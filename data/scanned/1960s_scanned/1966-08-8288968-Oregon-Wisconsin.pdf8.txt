The image on this page contains a sketch or drawing that was included in the UFO report document. The drawing appears to depict the movement and characteristics of a sighted object, with arrows and annotations describing the observed behavior.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It gradually disappeared in a few seconds.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes, it moved behind one cloud and reappeared from behind it.

16. Did the object move in front of something, particularly a cloud?
Yes, it moved in front of some clouds.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
