SUBJECT: Evaluation of Depressions Found in Beach Sand in Presque Isle, Pennsylvania

TO: Major M. Quintanilla, Jr., FDTDR

The Landing Gear Group of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory was requested to investigate a report of depressions found in the beach sand at Presque Isle State Park, Pennsylvania. The investigation of the location of the depressions did not confirm any unusual phenomena. The following summarizes the investigation and conclusions:

Conclusions:
1. According to the investigating USAF officer, the sand was definitely compressed under load and not excavated as might have been.
2. Assuming that the depressions were made by an applied load, the investigators that the depression was 7x0-1000 lbs. since no information was given on the size of the applied load.
3. According to Mr. Max Groff, EWPE, of Base Civil Engineering at Boiling AFD, depressions of this type could leave an inverted three-sided pyramid footprint. However, no visible or contour footprints were found in the location, which eliminates this potential explanation.
4. The layout of the three footprints showed no similarities to aircraft landing gear or support equipment which might have caused depressions.
5. Based on the number of depressions and their orientation, it is not likely that they served as ground-stabilizing contact points for any kind of platform or provide some form of symmetry in their location is basically illogical.
