Transcription of the text in the document:

On the night of 8 October 1965, around 8:30 p.m., a luminous disc was observed in the sky by several residents of the Soeaux area, France. 

The object was observed for about 15 minutes. It was round, white in color, and was about the size of an aircraft. It was hovering motionless for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a very high speed and disappeared over the horizon.

The object did not make any noise. Several witnesses confirmed the observation. The object was visible to the naked eye and was also observed through binoculars.

This is the report of the incident.
