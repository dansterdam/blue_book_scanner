The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text of the document is as follows:

3. My only contention is that it should be a U.F.O. as it continued to be contended to be contained. I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope and would be very grateful to have your higher authorities on my writing them in on seem to be this object.

This "thing" has made a deep impression on my mind. I do not know what to address for you to send me the Air Force Journal's report on U.F.O.'s.
