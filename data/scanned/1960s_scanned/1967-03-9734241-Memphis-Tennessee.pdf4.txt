The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book. The text on the page describes a UFO sighting that occurred on March 12, 1967 in Memphis, Tennessee. The report provides details about the sighting, including the appearance and movement of the UFO.

Here is the text from the document:

Between March 12 & 13 1967 our company car-driver and I observed a very large and unusual UFO (a small reddish light) which appeared as a stationary object to the northwest. This object seemed to have a light around its perimeter, which seemed to rotate or cycle around the object. 

While we were peering intently at a dark, perhaps triangular object (we could see at certain times), the object suddenly accelerated and sped away at a tremendous rate of speed, in horizontal direction. The object left our sight in a matter of seconds. This was remarkable in that it seemed to have accelerated to an extreme degree in a very short time.

The object was originally stationary, then suddenly shot away so rapidly that we could hardly follow its movement. It seemed to disappear in a southwesterly direction after reaching a high rate of speed. While we were observing the object, all the dogs in the neighborhood began to bark, as if they sensed the presence of the object. This may indicate that they were aware of the object when we were.

The sighting lasted for several minutes and the object was observed at a distance of approximately 3 to 5 miles. The object seemed to be about 1/2 to 1 degree in size, somewhat larger than a star. Just before it disappeared, it seemed to change shape, going from a round or oval shape to what appeared to be a sharper, more angular shape. I called a friend to observe the object but by the time he arrived, the object had disappeared.
