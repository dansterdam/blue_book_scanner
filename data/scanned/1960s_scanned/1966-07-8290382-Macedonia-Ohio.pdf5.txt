There is no photograph or image present in this document. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a form with various questions related to a reported UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? No response provided.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? The "Yes" option is circled.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? The "Yes" option is circled.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - Blurry - white b. Color - Reddish - white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? A whole matchstick

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially show the direction the object was moving. An arrow is drawn next to the sketch to indicate the direction of movement.
