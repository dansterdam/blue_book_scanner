Dear Gentlemen:
THE U.F.O. really are. And just about many P.F.O. that the Pentagon has any way they come from. They come from a planet. How could the one who rate them never rate from here and think someone from earth made them and how can they get this way. And how can they get this way. Through the clouds of gas and they look so much like some of ours though. U.F.O.s as possible.
