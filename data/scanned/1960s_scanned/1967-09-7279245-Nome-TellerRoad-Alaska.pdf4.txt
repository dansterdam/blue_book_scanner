The text of the document is as follows:

"I was driving south on the Teller Road near Nome, Alaska on September 7, 1967. As I was driving I noticed a bright light in the sky a few miles ahead of me. At first I thought it might be an airplane but as I got closer I could see that it was not an airplane. The object was hovering over the road about 50 feet above the ground. As I got within a quarter mile of the object, it began to move and accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared. 
The object was round in shape and appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It gave off a bright white light that illuminated the area around it. I have been quite sure of the size of a small room as it hovered over the road. If it is possible to see this at close range I think it is quite possible for me to have a good estimate of its size."
