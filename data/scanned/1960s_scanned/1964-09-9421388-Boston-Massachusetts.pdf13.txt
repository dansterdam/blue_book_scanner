SIGHTING ACCOUNTS (continued)

When the object sped up and accelerated vertically out-of-sight, the witnesses noticed something peculiar. The object seemed to have several lights on its surface which were either blinking or flashing rapidly. The object moved in a straight line and the witnesses could hear no sound as it moved. It was observed through binoculars and the witnesses noticed that it changed color from white to orange or red during its flight. The object moved at a high rate of speed and was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes.

NEAR FENWAY PARK - 8:30+

Path witnesses saw a low-flying object near Fenway Park (see Map) which was described as flat with bright lights on it. It accelerated rapidly and climbed vertically out of sight. (The witnesses requested anonymity and confidentiality for fear of ridicule and job loss).

TV-RADIO STATION WBZ - 8:30-8:55+ PM
(On-the-scene camera crew through WJAR member reporter Stuart, WBZ)
WJAR member station staff witnessed the object together with WBZS crew.

The report was of the witnesses' observations when the low-flying light was observed. The object was observed to rise rapidly and silently from one point and then moved off to another point, almost hovering there and then moved off again to a third point, at which time it appeared to pick up speed and moved out of sight at a very high rate of speed. No sound was heard during the observation. The object was described as round in shape and appeared to have a reddish glow around it.
