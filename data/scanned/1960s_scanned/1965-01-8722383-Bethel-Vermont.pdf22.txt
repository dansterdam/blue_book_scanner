Dear Mr. Fowler:

Please excuse the delay in answering your letter of February 4, but our medical work has been so heavy these past few days that I have had an opportunity to respond to it quite as quickly as I would have liked. 

I am amazed that the major could not come up with a single positive fact to sustain the theory that the major injuries were, in fact, caused by something other than a normal automobile accident. That I am amazed that "he could not come up with" a positive fact to sustain his theory is an understatement.

While I do not feel free to comment concerning Trooper Lane's comments, I am quite sure to recognize one when I see it. I can say for myself that numerous unsolicited communications in the past and again just lately had all the appearance of a moving object such as this case would suggest. However, I do not wish to make any assumptions beyond that point.

I shall assisting Corporati on of this report to you, and suggest that the might also see fit to write you concerning this matter.

By one final comment on the matter is that while I make these as to what the charges or may not have been, I do feel definitely that they were not meteors.
