The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

CASTLE AIR FORCE BASE

Captain A. W. Beckman, Pilot, reported a small metal object diving rapidly in his direction. As shown in his drawn sketch, the object was shaped like a metallic torpedo and had red exhaust-type flames. He and other witnesses reported it traveled at high speed and made an abrupt right angle turn while over his aircraft.
