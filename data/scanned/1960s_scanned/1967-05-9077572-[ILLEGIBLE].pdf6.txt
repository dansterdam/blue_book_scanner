Text from the document:

Dear sirs:

First Friday night (April 7) a couple and two small children were driving down Hwy. 71 near Holgate, Ohio. They saw a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving very fast. The light stopped and hovered over their car for a few minutes. The light was very bright and illuminated the inside of the car. It then took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared. The observer stated that the light had the appearance of a "flying saucer" and that it was approximately 200 feet in diameter. The incident was reported to the local sheriff's office.
