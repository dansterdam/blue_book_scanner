Oklahoma City
Sightings of reports of mysterious multi-colored objects in the sky swamped Little and newspapers authorities across Oklahoma City last night.
The highway patrol said Tinker AEB authorities reported tracking some of the objects on radar early in the evening but Tinker officials later refused to confirm or deny the reports.
"The objects were described as emitting various colors of light, some were said to be flying in erratic course in diamond formation."
There was at least one unconfirmed report of an object resembling a flaming plane crash near Bartlesville.
At least eight low-level unidentified flying objects were among some of the sightings of Oklahomans.
One Daily Oklahoman described the noise of telephone calls as equivalent to the Green-ville, Texas invasion scare of October 30, 1954.
Reports of four mysterious craft flying in diamond formation from Chickasha, Lindsay, Shawnee and Chandler, Oklahoma.
