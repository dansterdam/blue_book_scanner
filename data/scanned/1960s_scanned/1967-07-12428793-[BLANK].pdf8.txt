The image contains no photograph, but rather a page of text from a document discussing the "Determination of Extraterrestrial Life". The text describes the establishment of contact with another civilization through Project Ozma, a program initiated in 1959 that involved using a 85-foot steerable antenna located at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia. The text explains that the astronomers involved in the project focused on listening for possible radio signals from the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, which were chosen as the first targets because they lie within the range of our radio telescopes and resemble our own sun in age and type, potentially having planetary systems like our own. The text also mentions that signals were sent to the target stars in the hydrogen line from the observatory in May-July 1960, but it is unclear if any positive results were obtained.

DETERMINATION OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE

The only positive proof that extraterrestrial life exists is the establishment of contact with another civilization.  

The earliest U.S. attempt to establish such contact was initiated with Project Ozma.  The project was established in 1959 and consisted of an 85 foot steerable antenna, which was located at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia.  As the first step in a systematic search, the astronomers began to listen for possible radio signals from the neighborhood of certain stars.  Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani were chosen as the first targets because they lie within the range of our radio telescopes, ten to eleven light years distant, and because they resemble our own sun in age and type and therefore might have planetary systems like our own.

It was calculated that signals from planets near the selected stars should be observable with the 85 foot disk if they were generated by a million watt transmitter operating through a 600 foot antenna.  To be detected under these circumstances, the signals would have to be concentrated within a very narrow band of frequencies.

Signals to the target stars were sent in the hydrogen line from the observatory in May - July 1960.  But if these signals are
