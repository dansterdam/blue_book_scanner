The U.S. conducted meteorological sounding rocket firings earlier this week at the Tooele test range. They were designed to measure wind velocity and direction from 50 to 100 miles. 
Cloud trails, created by a physical called in-rocket effluents, were photographed by scientists at China Lake, Calif. Have Utah.
The firings, conducted by the U.S. corps, were scheduled earlier this week at the Tooele test range. They were designed to measure wind velocity and direction from 50 to 100 miles.
Russ Parisi, manager of the Tooele test range, said the tests are expected to be completed this week end.
