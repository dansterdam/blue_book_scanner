SAUCER LANDING IN SOUTH AFRICA: In the first important UFO report from South Africa, an object is seen to land on a main highway near the capital city. The object landed briefly and then took off again, leaving behind a circular impression on the road surface and vegetation apparently scorched.
The object was reported by several persons who examined the spot where the incident occurred. Grass on both sides of the highway was burned, indicating that the object had been resting on the ground. It was stated that the object was cylindrical in shape, silvery in color, and about 30 feet in diameter.
