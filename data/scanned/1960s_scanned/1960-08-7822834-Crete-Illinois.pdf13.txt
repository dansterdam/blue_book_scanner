There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text output from the OCR (optical character recognition) system is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of
the path, a "T" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
Difficult to measure - larger

22. We wish to have the approximate size of the object. Please indicate on the sketch or describe and note
how much of the object is covered by the head of a match. If you had performed this experiment at the time
of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
7 or 8 times larger than a paper match is a good estimate

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Disappeared slowly, no sudden motion

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a
common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object
which you saw.
A simple reflection of a bright metallic object in a glass window would appear similar to what I saw.
