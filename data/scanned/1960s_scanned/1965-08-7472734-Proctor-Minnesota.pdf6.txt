11. POSITION TITLE AND COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: THE SENIOR 
DIRECTOR OF THE SAGE DIRECTION CENTER SENT TWO OFFICER UP ON THE
ROOF OF THE SAGE BUILDING TO SEE IF THEY COULD OBSERVE THE OBJECT. 
ONE OF THE OFFICERS WAS AN EXPERIENCED ROYAL CANADIAN PILOT. THEY
BOTH OBSERVED A BRIGHT STAR IN THE AREA REPORTED BY THE CIVILIAN
OBSERVER, WHICH APPEARED TO CHANGE COLOR AS THEY WATCHED IT. THE 
OBJECT REPORTED BY THE CIVILIAN WOULD SEEM TO BE EITHER A STAR
OR A PLANET, AS THE B-52 WITH IT'S FLASHING RED LIGHT WOULD HAVE
BEEN EASILY IDENTIFIED.
