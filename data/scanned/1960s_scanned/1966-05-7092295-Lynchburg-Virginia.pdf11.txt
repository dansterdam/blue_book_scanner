The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter or document related to a UFO sighting report.

Proposed reply to letter from [REDACTED], 21 March 1967?

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],
Reference your recent letter reporting an unidentified flying object/observation of last summer. At this late date, it would be extremely difficult to make a comprehensive evaluation of the sighting. It is most important that we receive the reports at the earliest possible date.

The only possible explanation that I can give at this time would be that the sighting has the characteristics of an aircraft refueling mission. Such refueling exercises have been responsible for numerous UFO sightings in the past.

Enclosed is some information which may be of interest to you. We would like to have your collected in our program if applicable.
