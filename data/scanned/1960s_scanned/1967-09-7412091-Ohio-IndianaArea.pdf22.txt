ATTN OF: TDDR/UDO

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 14 September 1967 

TO: South Bend Municipal Airport
South Bend, Indiana 46624

1. The aerial phenomena series is in receipt of unidentified flying object reports from the Indiana area which occurred on 14 September 1967 between 3:40 a.m. and 4:15 a.m.

2. The report consists of two different sightings, at approximately 3:40 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. At 3:40 a.m. two objects were observed traveling from the southwest to the northeast. At 4:00 a.m. another object was observed traveling from the southwest to the southeast. The objects were traveling at a high rate of speed. The objects were observed for approximately two minutes and were orange-red in color. The objects were observed by several independent civilian observers in very Indiana.

3. These observations indicate that the sighting of a satellite decay and re-entry is a possibility. Request that, if possible, you provide any similar reports or sightings in the area that might correspond with the above approximate times. 

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.
