MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 25 February 1963, near Dixon, Illinois
21 March 68. Called [redacted], Area Code [redacted], Phone [redacted]. He said that he investigated the sighting pretty well. The TWA pilot did not actually see the fireball hit. Neither did the police plane see where it hit. The police plane was flying IFR south of Polo and saw two columns of smoke rising from a field. However, intersection of sightings gives by the airline pilot (as interviewed by Smithsonian) and Mr. [redacted] shows that the object couldn't have impacted in that area but probable impacted much further north. Since the Smithsonian and Dearborn have investigated, no further action need by taken by this office.
