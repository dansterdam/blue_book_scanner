To whom it may concern-

Not knowing who to report this sighting to, we are writing to you.

Sunday evening, October 9 while by chance, we noticed a very brilliant light in the sky like a ball that was more stationary than moving. Just looked at it a while - "It is the words - more stationary than moving. I have never seen." We called others to look and they saw the same thing. Several of the neighbors were out looking at it too. At times turning it shown brighter and at times dimmer. It was brilliantly bright at times.

Tuesday October 4 - again between 9:30 and 10:00 it appeared low in the sky of a bluish green color. Seemed quite stationary and was seen by my husband, daughter, and in-laws. It was quite clearly away from us and steadily on bright.
My husband again saw the same thing in the west some time later. It was high.  It is cloudy tonight no other stars in the sky!

What is it?  Is it something new in the sky? At 10:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. we noticed it coming home from Paulding. Our daughter and son-in-law and husband saw it. It seems to be the attraction of many.

Is there an explanation? Or is it too early?

Would appreciate your telling us in if you have heard anything about this.

Thank you for your time.

Most sincerely,
