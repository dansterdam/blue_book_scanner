Dear sir,
Maybe this letter could be of interest to you. Of course, I don't know just how important it is, but since I did observe the strange object, I thought I would pass the information along.
On the morning of August 13, about 1:30 A.M., my family and I were driving from our farm near {location} to {location}. As we were driving down the highway, we suddenly saw a bright light in the sky ahead of us. At first, we thought it might be an airplane, but as we got closer, we could see that it was not an airplane at all. The light seemed to be just hovering in the sky, and it appeared to be oblong in shape. It was a very brilliant white light, not blinking or flashing like an airplane.
We were all quite amazed at the sight, and my husband slowed the car down so we could observe it better. The object seemed to just float there in the sky for several minutes. Then, suddenly, it took off at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. We were all quite shaken by the experience, and we didn't know what to make of it.
I would be interested to know if anyone else in this area reported seeing a similar object that night. I would appreciate any information you could give me regarding this incident.
Sincerely,
[Signature]
