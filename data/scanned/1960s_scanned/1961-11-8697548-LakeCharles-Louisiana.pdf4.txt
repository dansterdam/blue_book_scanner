AVAILABLE. PART VIII. INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM CONTROL TOWER
PERSONNEL ON DUTY FROM 0600Z TO 1200Z ON 17 NOV 61, INDICATED THAT
THERE WAS HEAVY METEOROLOGICAL ACTIVITY DURING THAT EVENING. PART
IX. THIS REPORT WAS PREPARED BY CAPTAIN RICHARD J. HAMEL, ASST.
TARGET MATERIAL OFFICER, INTELLIGENCE DIVISION. THE OBSERVERS
SEEMED CONVINCED THAT THE SIGHTING WAS NOT OF A METEOROLOGICAL
NATURE; HOWEVER, WITH THE HEAVY METEOROLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF THAT
EVENING IT IS REASONABLE AND PROBABLE THAT IT WAS SO RELATED. AN
UNUSUALLY LOW AND BRIGHT METEOR WOULD STARTLE ANY OBSERVER AND ITS
BRIEF SIGHTING COULD EASILY CLOUD THE IMPRESSION AND INTERPRETATIONS
OF THE VIEWER. A. NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE.
