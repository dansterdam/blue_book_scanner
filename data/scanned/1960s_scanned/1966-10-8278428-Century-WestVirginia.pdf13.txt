The shared image contains an illustration or diagram, but no photograph. The illustration appears to be a compass rose and a graph or chart with angles and measurements related to the sighting of some unidentified object.

The text in the document reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

The same as above. The same as above.
