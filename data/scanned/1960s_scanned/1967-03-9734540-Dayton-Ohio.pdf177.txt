The image is a scanned document page titled "FORCE UFO FORM" from what appears to be a project blue book report. The document contains a series of questions and checkboxes for observers to fill out about their sightings of unidentified flying objects. There does not appear to be any photograph included in this particular page of the document.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:
