WHAT'S THIS IN SOUTHLAND SKY? - A FLYING SAUCER OR AN ODD HATT
Newsman Martin, one of Los Angeles' most respected flying saucer observers, says a "flying platform" was witnessed here Saturday night. It was 30 to 40 feet across and appeared about 10 feet thick. It made no noise, the newsman said, and did not change shape or size. The driver, Martin said, was near Martin and appeared to be taking photographs through a (sic) window, but as Martin approached him, the driver quickly closed the "window" and the platform disappeared. Martin and others also saw a large cat or dog-like creature on the platform. Martin said he tried to photograph it, but was unable to do so. The man said he was sure the platform was not an airplane or any conventional craft, and that it was hovering at least 150 feet above the ground. "The driver was as startled to see us as we were to see him," Martin reported. "He slammed the 'window' closed and the platform disappeared immediately."
