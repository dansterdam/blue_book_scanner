On 12 February 1963 we forwarded the copy of our case file on the 1960 landing of Z October 1967, Tucson, Ariz. We inadvertently forwarded you our only copy of an incoming message from David Robinson AFB, Ariz. The message was unclassified, cite 1905, ll Oct 67. We would appreciate your returning the original message. We will xerox it and send it to you. Also, please let us know if you have any other questions. We will make a Xerox here and send it to you.
