The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and a compass rose. The diagram appears to be showing the path or motion of an object or objects, and the compass rose is likely intended to provide context for the diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the points shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass rose where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
