Text from the document:

That as I was down at Sandy Hook oner evening - it was very soight - anouther looking evening - it was around 10:45 PM - Just as I looked up I noticed something brighter than any of the stars I have ever seen - This object was perfectly round and glowed a bluish-white color - it was very bright and alomost dove shaped - it came toward me at a very fast speed and then it slowed down considerably and just hovered there for a few minutes - then it took off at a tremendous rate of speed and went straight up into the sky - the whole thing was only visible to me for about 2 to 3 minutes - I would not have a plane or a meteor for that matter - as it was a controlled object - it seemed to stop on a dime and take off at such a rapid rate of speed - I saw it around the New York and New Jersey area - it was a very bright color like nothing I have ever seen before.
