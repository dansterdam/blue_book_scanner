Dear Fred Johnson:
This may be of interest to you Thursday 3/1965 about 6:00 PM. We were out in our yard and saw an object that we think is a strange an unknown flying object. If they are we could become friends with them. If they're not we can destroy them easily. PS Please send me an envelop.
Sincerely,
Bedford, Ohio
