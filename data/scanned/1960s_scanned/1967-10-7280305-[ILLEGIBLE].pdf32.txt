SAY NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS HERE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHICH LAST SEEN. PLACE AN "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
HEAVEN SLIDE NORTH WEST, THAT IS, IF TO ACCURATELY KNOW WHETHER THE SIGHTING APPEARED TO MOVE OR REMAIN STATIONARY OR OSCILLATE, CIRCLE EITHER "N", "S", "E", OR "W" TO INDICATE THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF MOTION, IF ANY,
RELATIVE TO THE COMPASS. IF IT MOVED IN A STRAIGHT LINE, DRAW A LINE FROM THE X POINT TO INDICATE DIRECTION. IF IT MOVED IN A CURVED OR IRREGULAR PATH, SKETCH THE APPROXIMATE PATH IN THE MARGIN.
