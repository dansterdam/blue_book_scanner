The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The page contains handwritten responses to a questionnaire, including the date the questionnaire was completed and additional information which the witness felt was pertinent but not adequately covered by the specific points in the questionnaire.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 2-9-63
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
There appears to be some detail or explanation lacking from the specific points of the questionnaire, and the witness has provided additional handwritten information to elaborate on their sighting. The text appears to describe the witness's observations and interpretation of the event in more detail.
