The President has asked that I reply to your recent letter regarding "flying saucers".
The investigation of unidentified flying objects reported in the skies over the United States is the responsibility of the Air Force. The name of this project is Blue Book.
In 18 years of investigating over 9,000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proved almost conclusively that reported sightings have been objects other created and exist rather by natural phenomena or have been misidentified conventional objects under certain conditions, or caused by celestial bodies of the residue of meteoric activity.
There has never been any evidence that UFOs reported to the Air Force represented extraterrestrial vehicles. No such object reported to the Air Force has given any indication of a threat to the United States nor has any evidence been presented that any unidentified flying object exhibited characteristics beyond the scope of current technical or scientific knowledge.
I am enclosing a copy of AF Form 13A which is used for making reports of this nature to the Air Force. This form should be completed as fully as possible and returned to the following address so that an evaluation can be made of your sighting:
Mr USAF (SRINCO)
Washington, DC 20330
Sincerely,
