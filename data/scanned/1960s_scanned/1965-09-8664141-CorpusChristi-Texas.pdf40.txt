NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
ITEM: Maj Quintanilla
During the night of 9 Sep 65, between 2000 - 2030 hrs. The first three calls indicated the object was moving very rapidly at about 2000-2300 mph. The first three calls indicated that the object was observed flying over a previous week, and one individual claimed he had observed the object several times before. No other descriptive data are available. Nothing abnormal and since you already have similar reports I filled no formal report.
