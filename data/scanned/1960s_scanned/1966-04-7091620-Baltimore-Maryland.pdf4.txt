The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text in a language that looks like Hebrew or a similar script.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

The reports indicate that a strange object, described as a bright light, was observed in the sky over Baltimore, Maryland on April 7, 1966. The object was seen by multiple witnesses and was reported to have unusual flight characteristics, such as rapid acceleration and changes in direction. The report suggests that the object may have been some type of unidentified flying object (UFO), but does not provide any definitive conclusions. The text appears to document the details of the sighting as reported to the authorities at the time.
