LOS AND LEAD FIREBALI (A15215) 
GIANT FIRE-TRAILING METEOR FLASHED ACROSS THE HORIZEN THROUGHOUT MOST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TONIGHT, ATTRACTING WIDE ATTENTION AND MANY REPORTS TO THE MEXICO BORDER. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING MORE BRILLIANT THAN THE SUN AND LEFT A TRAIL OF FIRE BEHIND IT AS IT DISAPPEARED. THOUSANDS OF SIGHTINGS WERE MADE IN LOS ANGELES, SAN DIEGO, AND IMPERIAL VALLEY AREAS. RADAR INSTALLATIONS TRACKED THE HUGE FIREBALL INTO THE PACIFIC TOWARDS LOWER CALIFORNIA. IT APPEARED MOST BRILLIANT-ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS THE SUN PERIODICALLY. WITNESSES STATED IT SEEMED TO BE 2 OR 3 TIMES AS LARGE AS THE FULL MOON AND APPEARED TO BREAK UP INTO PIECES CAUSING THEM TO THINK IT MIGHT BE A SPACE VEHICLE DISINTEGRATING, SIMILAR TO DRAKE'S OBJECT. JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT A METEOR FLASHED ACROSS THE SKY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, LIGHTING UP EUREKA, CALIF, ALMOST LIKE DAYLIGHT. REPORTS FROM INSTALLATIONS SHOWED THERE WAS NO MISSILE FIRING OR OTHER KNOWN EXPLANATION FOR THE LARGE FIREBALL. RADAR TRACKING SHOWED IT ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE INTACT BUT BROKE UP DURING ENTRY. MANY PEOPLE WERE STARTLED AND SOME EVEN FRIGHTENED WHEN IT APPEARED AS IT WAS SO BRIGHT.
