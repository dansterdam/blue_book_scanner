Auburn, New York 13021
Gentlemen:
On thenite of .Agust 6,1965, ut about 11:45 n.m., I
and my wife saw lihts in the night sky that I would like to report to you.
There was one white light that seemed to be about the size of the moon, slowly moving across the sky from east to west. As it passed overhead, it dimmed out, then became bright again, dimming out two or three times. It moved in a straight line, and was visible for about 10-15 minutes. This light was completely silent.
There was also a second light that appeared to be about the same size, or a little smaller, than the first one. This light moved in a zig-zag pattern, making sharp turns, and was visible for about 3-5 minutes. This light was also completely silent.
When the first light finally disappeared, a third light appeared slightly to the north of where the first one had been. This third light made a very sharp turn to the south, then disappeared from sight. It was also silent.
I have always been interested in astronomy, and I can assure you that these were not stars, planets, or any type of aircraft that I have ever seen. I feel that these were some type of unidentified flying objects, and I would be most interested in any information you might have on similar sightings in this area.
Sincerely,
