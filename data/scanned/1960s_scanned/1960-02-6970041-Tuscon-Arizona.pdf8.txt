37. WAS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU HAD SEEN AN OBJECT OR OBJECTS LIKE THIS? 
37.1 IF YOU ANSWERED "NO", THEN WHEN, WHERE, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DID YOU SEE OTHER ONES?

38. IN YOUR OPINION WHAT DO YOU THINK THE OBJECT WAS AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED IT? THE SIGHTING OCCURRED SOME MONTHS AFTER A CONSTANT FLASHING LIGHT AT NIGHT HAD BEEN OBSERVED IN THE SKY IN THIS AREA. ON THE NIGHT THAT FOLLOWS THAT OF MY SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT, THERE WAS ANOTHER BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY WITH FLASHES, CIRCLING AND HOVERING. I HAVE SEVERAL PICTURES OF THIS LIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT THE OBJECT I SAW WAS SOME TYPE OF AERIAL VEHICLE, NOT CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, HELICOPTER, BALLOON, OR METEOROLOGICAL DEVICE BUT RATHER SOME TYPE OF CRAFT OR ARTIFICIAL SATELLITE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN. IT HAD SOME TYPE OF PROPULSIONS SYSTEM OTHER THAN PROPELLERS OR JET ENGINES AND IT MOVED IN A MANNER SUGGESTIVE OF SOMETHING WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CONTROL AND MANEUVERABILITY.
