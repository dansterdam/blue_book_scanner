The image appears to contain two photographs. The left photograph shows a blurred, partially obscured image that looks like it could be some type of unidentified flying object or aerial phenomenon. The right photograph shows a grainy, indistinct image with some dark shapes and textures, but the subject is not clearly discernible.
