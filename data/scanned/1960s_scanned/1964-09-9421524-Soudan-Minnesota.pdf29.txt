The narrative describes an incident where a lumberman named Donald Martin and his two daughters saw a cigar-shaped object in the sky over Soudan, Minnesota on September 24, 1964. The object was observed through binoculars and was described as a bright light on a dark object that was traveling at a high rate of speed. The report states that the object was not a star or planet, and that Martin's daughters said it looked like it could have been a U.S. satellite, but Martin himself didn't think any planes could move that fast. The report concludes that there was no change in light intensity, indicating that it was not reflecting light.
