MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJ: UFO OBSERVATION, 19 MAR 1963
LOCATION: Miamisburg, Ohio
DURATION: About 20 Minutes
TIME: 4 to 4:15 am, 19 March 1963
PLACE: Miamisburg (Over Monsanto and Golf Course)
DETAILS: Nondescript. At first one light, later one white light and a flashing red and green light.
HEIGHT: Felt that it was low. It seemed to be circling the Golf course. Thinks that the guards at Monsanto would have had to have seen the object since it was right over them.

Lt. Marano called Base PAA 19 Mar: Was informed that it could have been one of our Base Helicopters on VFR but there is no way for the helicopters to be up with the first light. Lt. Marano doubts it would assume it to be a small plane on VFR. Suggested I contact the helicopter service to Vandalia.

Called Skyway Inc, 293-4615 and Dayton Helicopter Service 224-1451. Both stated they did not have any helicopters in the air at the time. Aviation Co 223-2275 stated that there could have been a flight but they couldn't be sure.

Called the Monsanto plant at Miamisburg 866-7441. None of the guards reported seeing anything unusual for the 12:00 to 8 am shift.
