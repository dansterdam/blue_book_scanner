March 30, 1966,

On the night of March 28, at approximately 5:20 I spotted an object in the sky a little dim lights about twice the size of stars moving in a whip like pattern out of the south-east towards the north-east. Their were 10 - 15 of these separate lights following each other at about one minute intervals. I have no doubt of this as I observed them both ends of Toledo and upon seeing these objects I called the Toledo police and reported it to them. The police told me a lady in Ridley Ohio, which is just north of Toledo, reported the same string of objects. The same night more Toledoans reported seeing an object but this is the only detail I can give about the incident. I am very interested in knowing what it is that I saw. If you have any idea would you be kind enough to let me know? Thank you for your interest and trouble.
