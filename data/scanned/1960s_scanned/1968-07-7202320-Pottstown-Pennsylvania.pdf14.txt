COMMENTS REGARDING:
I do not believe I ever spoke to Mr. ____ or his reporter, and a little too much to drink causing him to see things. I have never chided a UFO caller in any fashion.
I believe the gentleman is ranked because I could not identify the light and wasn't planning to report it.
COMMENTS ON CURRENT UFO REPORTING:
The Base Operations Duty Officer at McGuire Air Force Base is helpless to investigate and consequently identify a light over Pottstown, Penna. The person who should take a call and investigate a light is a man in Pottstown, located and appointed by the mayor of Pottstown, and equipped with an officer's badge, the local citizen of Pottstown could call the Pottstown Police who have a list of these UFO investigators. The police could then pass the phone number to the sighter who could then call direct to an appointed, equipped, and possibly trained local citizen who could meet with the sighter and possibly come up with an answer.
The current procedure of calling the nearest Air Force Base is expensive of time and money and useless as an investigative program.
