The image does not contain a photograph. It shows a blank box with instructions to "DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON" and a question about the angular size of the object.

15: DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. WAS THERE ANY CHANGE IN THE APPARENT SIZE DURING THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MATCH HEAD THE OBJECT COVERED AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.

3 to 2/3 of the object would be covered by the match.
