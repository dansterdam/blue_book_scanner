1/20/67 -- MEMORANDUM

II.  ADDITIONAL WITNESSES:

A. A spot-check of 7 witnesses in the case indicates they are reputable citizens, widely known in their community, and their accounts are consistent with each other regarding the object.

III. ATTEMPT AT IDENTIFICATION:

A. ASTRONOMICAL - NEGATIVE: Venus had set about 10:30 P.M. and did not re-appear.

B. Balloon - NEGATIVE: Used was a weather balloon, but speed and drift not consistent.

C. Aircraft - IMPROBABLE:
1) Number, color and configuration of lights do not match normal aircraft.
2) Hovering, stationary, and erratic flight not normal for aircraft.
3) Craft observed for over 30 minutes, much longer than normal aircraft flight.

4) Lights so bright that normal aircraft lights would not correspond and craft would not correspond to the object, but would be easily recognized as an aircraft.

(Note: The expanded Ball Phenomena identified in this report indicates that the object was not a normal aircraft. The witnesses described the object in detail and their accounts are consistent with each other.)
