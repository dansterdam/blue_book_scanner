The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a blank page with handwritten text at the bottom providing instructions for observers to describe the angular size of an object, how much of the object is covered by the head of a match, and other observations related to the size and appearance of the observed object.

"WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW DO YOU HAVE REASON TO CONCLUDE THIS WAS THE APPROXIMATE SIZE OF THE OBSERVED OBJECT?"
