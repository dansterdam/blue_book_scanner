1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Cape Neddick (a small town between Portsmouth, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine). The observation occurred on 12 April 1968 at approximately 11:15 p.m.

2. The observer sighted an object that had a bright white light in front and numerous red lights along the side. He stated that the shape of the object was like a flat disc with a dome.
