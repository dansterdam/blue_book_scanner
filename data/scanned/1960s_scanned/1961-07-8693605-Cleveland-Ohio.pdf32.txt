The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Narrative: Thurs day night, shortly after 10:30 was to board the object he was chasing. Others could not see it too. They lost him for a while, but picked him up again at 10:35 - 10:40. He said the object was very fast and jumped to high altitudes. He would lose it and then pick it up again. He said at one point the object hovered and then shot off at tremendous speed. He had the Air Force radar tracking it also. He felt the Air Force was especially interested in the incident.
