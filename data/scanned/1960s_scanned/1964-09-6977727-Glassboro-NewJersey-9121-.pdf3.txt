UNCLASSIFIED CASE CLOSING

ON 9 SEPTEMBER 1964, MR. RICHARD V. SCMARTZ, GLASSBORO, NEW JERSEY, TELEPHONED THIS OFFICE TO REPORT THAT HIS WIFE, MRS. MILDRED SCHWARTZ, HAD SIGHTED AND OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) ON THE EVENING OF 6 SEPTEMBER 1964.

AT APPROXIMATELY 9:00PM, MRS. SCHWARTZ WAS OUTSIDE HER HOME WHEN SHE OBSERVED A BRIGHT RED-ORANGE LIGHT HOVERING OVER HER BACKYARD. SHE STATED THAT THE OBJECT MOVED RAPIDLY EAST AND THEN DISAPPEARED. SHE REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY BRIGHT AND APPEARED TO BE ROUND IN SHAPE WITH NO VISIBLE FINS OR TAIL. MRS. SCHWARTZ STATED THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 OR 3 MINUTES.

AFTER THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED, MRS. SCHWARTZ IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO HER HUSBAND, WHO CONFIRMED THAT SHE WAS QUITE SHAKEN OVER THE INCIDENT. MR. SCHWARTZ DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT HIMSELF.

BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION PROVIDED BY MRS. SCHWARTZ, THIS SIGHTING IS CONSISTENT WITH MANY OTHER SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED OVER THE YEARS. HOWEVER, WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT NATURE OF THIS OBJECT.

THEREFORE, THIS CASE IS BEING CLOSED WITH NO DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION AS TO THE IDENTITY OR ORIGIN OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED BY MRS. SCHWARTZ.
