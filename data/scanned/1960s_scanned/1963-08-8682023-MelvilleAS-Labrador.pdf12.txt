1. Since visual contact of the target was not made in this case, it is impossible to make contact with certainty what caused the phenomena observed on the ground.

2. Equipment malfunction can be ruled out, since several radar displays the same target, and anomalous propagation appears to be unlikely.

3. From the activity of the target, it appears that the most likely explanation is balloons under some sort of control, possibly meteorological balloons of the type used by some of the weather countries. Balloons have been known to travel in strings or trains, and the lights observed could likely be the balloon itself or the cables connecting the balloons.
