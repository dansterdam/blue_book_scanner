There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a form-style layout with questions and blank spaces for handwritten responses.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output, the text in the document is as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STOP AND HOVER AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND BOW AWAY?
TAKE OFF VERTICALLY AND TRAVEL?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS OR COLOR?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
WHAT WAS THE DISTANCE AND APPARENT SIZE?
MAKE A NOISE?
WHAT DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE SEEMING OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
