This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains a series of questions and answers related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, or "0" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time, what would have been the angular size of the object?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? THEY DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. IT APPEARED LIKE SATELLITES IN THE SKY, ABOUT THE SAME APPEARANCE TO LOOK LIKE SATELLITES.
