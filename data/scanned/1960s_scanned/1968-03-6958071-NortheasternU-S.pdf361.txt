The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or form that the observer filled out to describe their UFO sighting.

To produce the output of the text found in the document:

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
