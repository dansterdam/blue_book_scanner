8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Objects described by 26 people. Each story different but all indicate objects shaped like saucers with a light in the center and a smaller light on the top. Objects flew in a circular pattern, hovering at times and then accelerating rapidly at a high rate of speed. The indicated object was spinning and as such was compared to the rotation of a radio dial face.
9. COMMENTS
The descriptions of the objects which have been gathered from numerous witnesses give evidence of a phenomenon which seems to coincide with instances of similar Sightings made elsewhere. These sightings may be caused by atmospheric refraction, but the unusual and complex nature of the gyration of the objects tends to discredit this explanation since common astronomical refractions do not usually produce effects of this magnitude or complexity.
