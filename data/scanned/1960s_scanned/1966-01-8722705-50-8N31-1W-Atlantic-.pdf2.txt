PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
66-23

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
DATE: January 1966

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF--1 print, 1 negative
QUALITY: Good

PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-56 from Major R. Quintanilla, USAFUO Officer, who asked for an analysis of a photograph depicting an unidentified flying object.

ANALYSIS: This analysis was completed jointly by the Photo Analysis and Photo Processing Sections. The photograph, as submitted, shows a single object in the sky, which appears to be the only defined object in the image. No other objects, features or background details can be seen that would provide a basis for positive identification of the observed object. Based upon the available information, this appears to be the most reasonable explanation of the image.
