The shared image contains a photograph of a dark, disc-shaped object in the sky. The object appears to be a UFO sighting reported in an old Project Blue Book document.

December 6, 1963

Dear [Redacted],

Referring to your letter of November 15, 1963, we submit the following information:

1. The object was reportedly sighted and photographed at Fairfield, Illinois, at approximately 2:30 p.m. on December 5, 1963. Consistent with a photo of this type, the object has a slight curve on the bottom, a flat top and a dark clearly defined edge.

2. Pennant: All photographic images have an easterly orientation meaning that the object was moving from left to right or eastward.

3. Easy to characterize by a breaking up or the object being obscured.

4. Duration of sighting approximately 15 minutes, the object then disappeared from view.

5. A close examination of the object indicates that it was reflecting light from the cloud cover and shadows of the clouds on the object are distinctly visible.

A case summary of the August 4, 1963 sighting at Fairfield, Illinois indicates that these objects were once again observed moving across the sky at a very high rate of speed for over 3 minutes. On that occasion, our photograph was obtained showing the object as a clearly defined disc.

There are many reasons for static or a gap or radio problems that we cannot explain, but no evidence is found to substantiate any unusual radio or radar detections. The radio station information was made available only because it was the source of the original report.

This air force has no information regarding a location or description of the object sighted on the 5th of December.
