233 Gen 1960

UNCLASSIFIED
SOUTHAMPTON, LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK
OBSERVATION
The observers name and address will not be used in this report. This report is submitted as a factual account of the events that occurred on 8 October 1960.
At approximately 1800 hours on 8 October 1960, the observer and his wife were sitting in their automobile parked in the driveway of their residence in Southampton, Long Island, New York, when they observed a bright light in the sky to the southwest. The light appeared to be moving in an erratic manner, occasionally accelerating, decelerating, and making abrupt changes in direction. The light emanated a brilliant white color, and appeared to be the size of a small aircraft from their vantage point.
The observers watched the light for several minutes as it continued its erratic movements in the sky. It then suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The entire sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes.
The observers felt that the object they observed was not an ordinary aircraft, but rather some type of unidentified flying object. They could offer no explanation as to what they had observed.
