This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text output from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon. (Eyeline) Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high you first saw it. Place an "A" on the ground to show where the object was when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how were they arranged? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
