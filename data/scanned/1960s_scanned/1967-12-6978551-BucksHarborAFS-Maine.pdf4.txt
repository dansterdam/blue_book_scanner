UFO Observation, December 10, 1967

Valley Station, Kentucky, 40272

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation of December 10, 1967. The object sighted at 0326 hours was at an altitude of 6,000 to 8,000 ft. The surface wind was toward the southwest at 4 knots, at 6,000 ft the latitude is 60 degrees at 6 knots, and at 10,000 ft it was toward the east-northeast at twenty-one knots. These balloons are essentially 1,000 ft/minute and can be observed until an altitude of about 10,000 ft.

2. Balloon launching normally do not permit these balloons unless they have a metal radar reflector attached.

3. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
