The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

"I am very sorry that I could not have had this letter in the full way you suggested. I have been so busy and preoccupied 2 1970 7 that I was simply unable to get at this for several weeks ago. APR 22-1 in the matter, for I apologize for being so slow. In any case, I would like to respond fully to your request concerning our sighting. I should like to give several points in the main discussion on this matter.

Chicago, Illinois

Thank you very much for your time.
Sincerely submitted,
August 27, 1965"
