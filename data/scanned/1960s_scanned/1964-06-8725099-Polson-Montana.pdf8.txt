But the report seldom attends to what the pilot stated, the ship was chasing. Came. That morning a and the report about the little rocket like object was quite inaccurate. The witness, saw it clearly, and stated it was not a rocket, but a circular object, hovering at a high altitude, and then made a quick departure to the west, at a great speed. He estimates its size to be about 30 feet in diameter. The object was observed for about 2 minutes. This type of report is seldom included in the official project Blue Book files.
I would not accept the usual report that does little to explain what was actually observed.
