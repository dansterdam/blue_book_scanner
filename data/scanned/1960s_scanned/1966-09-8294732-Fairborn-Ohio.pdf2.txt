Dear Sir:

I was Saturday morning, September 24, around 4:15 or 4:30 A.M. when I heard a strange noise. I went outside to investigate and got the impression of something rather large going over the trees. It seemed to have a number of persons in the vehicle and was traveling at a fairly high rate of speed. I'm very much interested in this and hope I could get some further information about it, if possible. I would like anything of the nature of the last above to be classified, but I could give you more details if desired. If such things are of any importance, I'm sorry I didn't write about them sooner.
