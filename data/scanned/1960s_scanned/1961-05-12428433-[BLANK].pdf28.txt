INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE

How well do they facilitate adjustments in spacecraft use or technological changes?
Some of the problems associated with the development of the spacecraft that have been made for improving such items as communications, navigation, meteorology, etc. are examined from a practical viewpoint. The suggestion that a market be established for the manufacture and use of inflatable structures in space exploration is considered.

A systematic examination of the state of development and applications of inflatable structures indicates that rates are determined both in the communications field and in the military field. An analysis of the consequences necessary if the benefits of communications satellites, or other kinds of inflatable structures, are to be utilized commercially and operationally reveals that the system is by definition "international" in that if provides an international system. Ground links would be made accordingly.

The United States may decide to develop and operate the system commercially or militarily and to work out participation. The Special Advisory Report of September 15, 1960, recommended changes to permit as a ground rule the participation of commercial interests. Why not develop, or at least operate, the system under some form of international agreement, ownership, or operation? This could be handled through a national technical group, or in a consortium: in a public or private corporation under international agreement.

If possible "internationalized" arrangements: their advantages, risks, and drawbacks, and the how, where, when, implications and considerations for international inflatable structures would be undertaken (e.g. International Atomic Energy Agency) in order to ensure the acceleration and installation funds required for early completion, on some of the political problems and opportunities in the field of international relations and international cooperation involved some international arrangements if this "Space Race" on Other Countries' must be faced.
