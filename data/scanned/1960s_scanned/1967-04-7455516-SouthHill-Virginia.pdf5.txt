There is no photograph or image present in this document. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book containing a questionnaire with textual responses.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The light disappeared as the object completed its night flight.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: No sound early and the object of the spirit
b. Color: Bright white color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Neither all or object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
