Text extracted from the document:

Logan, Massachusetts, 10:30pm EDT, 25 August 1954. No mention of photography - the object hovered momentarily, about four feet above the telephone wires, emitting a bright light and moving slowly. The witnesses are the hill - the remaining information indicates that the object was above the crest of the hill.

Supporting Evidence - the nurses or members of a sound area, may or may not be associated with the observation of this event. However, since no association can be established.

In conclusion, we repeat, no information presented indicates that both sighting should not have been caused by an aircraft. FOR THE COUNSELLER
