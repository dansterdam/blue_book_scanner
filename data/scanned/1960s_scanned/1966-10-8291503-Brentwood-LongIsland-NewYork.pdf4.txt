The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with text describing some observations about the lateral variations in the path and images of stars.

CONTENTS:
The lateral variations in the path match exactly on all four tracks they are clearly the images of stars, formed as the camera was slowly panned past them. The stars are the three "well" stars of Orion, followed by something, but succeeded only in recording errant background material. There is no evidence of any intentional fraud.
