SAUCER LANDING IN MASSACHUSETTS (?): We piece a question mark here, because in view of other recent landings that
can be fairly well authenticated, it seems odd that we are merely told by two observers in the Massachusetts area that they sighted a UFO at night and watched it land. No photographs are mentioned. There's a story of two youngaters who saw a large UFO in the Lawrence, Mass. area on the night of May 18th. It had flashing lights and what seemed to be a hatch or door opening. The two young observers watched in awe as the object took off again from the field where it had landed. They say it was about 30 feet in diameter, an oval shape, and had a ring of lights around the perimeter. They reported it to police, who apparently found no physical trace. The next day the two returned to the field and found a circular impression, about 15 feet in diameter, and a seared, black spot on the ground. The grass was also flattened and somewhat singed, even bent downward - as if something heavy had been resting there. They reported this to the local police, who were quite interested in the case. Two days later, the observers saw the same or similar object over the same area. Two or three smaller UFOs accompanied it. After a while the large object shot up rapidly, followed by the smaller ones. A military helicopter arrived on the scene, surveying it. The youngsters had been discussing the case with neighbors and had attracted a goodly number of onlookers each time the UFO was seen. That's about all we can say, since we have no further details here on the official disposition of the case.
