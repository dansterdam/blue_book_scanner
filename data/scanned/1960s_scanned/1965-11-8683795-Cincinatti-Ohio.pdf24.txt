Dear Sir:

This is my name I believe that all of my sightings or messages are bona fide. I realize that the anti-seeing your child-ren. I find paranoid people always trying to analyze what I saw and war [CENSORED]. I am an 18 years old can have seen strange objects on 3 August 1965 at 8:55 pm in my field. It was bright and oval and at 9:30 p.m. it was looking in the sky with my 3.5 [CENSORED] and my 1.5 [CENSORED] telescope, my neighbor, not anything such as a aircraft spotlightcontrol, teleteam, not anything was a sizable ball of light, and then two lights, they were very close together and some speed, they were very low altitude, may be 30 to 35 feet in diameter. We saw them for 10 to 15 minutes and we could not analyze them anymore. They were so bright and maneuverable far beyond our present capabilities.
