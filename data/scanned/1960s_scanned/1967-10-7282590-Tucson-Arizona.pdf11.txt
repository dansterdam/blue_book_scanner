REPORT ON UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENON

OCCURRENCE: 
Reported on: 7 October 1967
Location: Tucson, Arizona

NARRATIVE:
On 7 October 1967, a private citizen photographed an unusual aerial phenomenon over Tucson, Arizona. The witness reported seeing a bright, circular object moving rapidly in the sky. 

The witness was able to take several photographs of the object before it disappeared from view. The photographs depict a distinct, circular object with a defined outline against the background sky.

Project Blue Book has analyzed the photographic evidence and determined that the object does not correspond to any known aircraft, weather phenomenon, or other identifiable aerial object. 

The case remains under investigation, and further analysis of the photographs is ongoing. No definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the nature or origin of the observed aerial phenomenon.
