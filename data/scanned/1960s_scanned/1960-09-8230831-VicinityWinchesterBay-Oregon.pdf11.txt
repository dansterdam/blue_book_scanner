MINISTER OF VENUS
The periodic appearance of the planet Venus has caused considerable speculation and interest in its possible observation at close range. This article discusses measurements of its disk with ordinary astronomical instruments and comments upon the significance of these findings.

CORRECTION
On page 17 of the November, 1960, issue, the diameter of the planet Venus was listed as 22.5 kilometers. This figure was in error. The correct diameter of Venus is 12,225 kilometers, or 7,600 miles.

1967 - New Air Research It

The observations of the disks of the inner planets made at the Steward Observatory in Tucson, Arizona, during 1965-1967 have yielded some interesting results. Ordinary astronomical telescopes, when used at reasonably high magnification, can reveal the apparent diameters of the planets out to Saturn and possibly beyond. More accurate determinations are obtained by photographic methods or by micrometric measurements using a filar micrometer.

The photographs and measurements indicate that the diameters of the major planets do not differ greatly from those previously accepted, except in the case of Venus which appears to be smaller than the accepted value. The observed diameters are as follows:

Mercury - 5.0 arcseconds 
Venus - 16.5 arcseconds
Mars - 9.7 arcseconds
Jupiter - 40.3 arcseconds
Saturn - 17.1 arcseconds

If these figures are converted to actual diameters the results are:

Mercury - 4,900 km
Venus - 12,225 km 
Mars - 6,900 km
Jupiter - 142,800 km
Saturn - 120,500 km

The diameter of Venus at 12,225 km is 600 km less than the usually accepted figure of 12,800 km. This smaller size of Venus has been confirmed by several observers and measurements. The measurements were made by photographic and micrometric methods, and were consistent over a period of two years.

The smaller diameter of Venus, if confirmed by further observations, would have significant effects upon our understanding of the planet. The mass would be slightly less, the surface gravity would be lower, and the mean density would be greater than previously estimated.

This revised diameter of Venus also has implications for the model of the atmosphere and the theoretical temperatures associated with the "greenhouse effect." The total energy received by the planet would be less, and the temperatures, in particular the maximum temperatures, would be lower than the values usually quoted.

The explanation for the smaller diameter remains uncertain. It is possible that the earlier accepted figure was in error, or that the more recent observations have detected some real effect, such as a contraction of the planet, a change in atmospheric conditions, or some other physical phenomenon not yet understood.

Further measurements and observations of Venus are clearly needed to resolve this question. The smaller diameter should be confirmed by other observers, and the implications for our understanding of the planet should be fully explored.
