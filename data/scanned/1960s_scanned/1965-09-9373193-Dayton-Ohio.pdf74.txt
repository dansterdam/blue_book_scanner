Dear General:

In re: Missile over Kentucky

In the late afternoon of September 7th, at just about 5:00 o'clock Central Standard Time (6:00 p.m. EDT), a silver missile was observed falling from the sky over Kentucky's Diamond field, accompanied by a thunderous roar.

The rounded forward end of this missile was illuminated by the setting sun as it came down. The missile was tubular in shape and had a gold metallic appearance. There was a mist or white cloud around the missile, from away behind the missile according to observers.

The trajectory followed the surface of the earth at about a 90Â° angle to the earth. An unusual trail was visible behind the missile as it traveled.

The missile left a light greenish-yellow or yellowish-green vapor behind where it passed. 

The missile, or some other flying object or objects, was seen by people at the time this was observed, according to witnesses. One of them had a camera but had not had time to get it in use.

The owner's home on the west was informed. I am now having a map prepared showing the locations from which the missile was observed, and the path it followed.

This missile went at the speed of a super-sonic plane, or perhaps two or three times that speed.

There was no sound.
Mrs. - - - - - -, located by my side at the time, and accustomed to outdoor observation, remarked "It was a missile, it happened to was a guidance."

Articles are attached from Paris, Kentucky, Daily Enterprise and the Cincinnati Enquirer, relating to the object or objects seen by others at approximately the same time, the early evening of September 7th.

It is possible a stage or the missile may have dropped off in the vicinity?

At any rate Ms. ---------, say the overhead itself.
