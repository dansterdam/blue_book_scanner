Lt. Paul Jones called to provide additional information in regards to the radar sightings. The Jones was informed by the Charleston, S.C. that the radar prints were not of UFOs. A check of the conditions was learned that the individual monitoring the radar set had the gain on the height finder turned up to the high sensitivity. This caused the appearance of a lot of ground returns. The prints on the radar were determined to be this interference. The personnel turned down the gain on 2-23-67 again and picked up more UFOs when the gain was turned down the UFOs disappeared."
