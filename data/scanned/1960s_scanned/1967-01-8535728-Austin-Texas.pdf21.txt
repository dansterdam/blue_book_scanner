HILL COUNTRY WEST NORTHWEST OF AUSTIN, TEX. I WAS UN-
ABLE TO WATCH THE SIGHTING WITH KNOWN AIR TRAFFIC, AND
THIS I REPORTED TO THE OBSERVER IN AUSTIN. IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT THE OBSERVER SAW A PLANET, AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE
CAR COMBINED WITH THE HIGH SCATTERED CIRRUS PRODUCED THE
ILLUSION OF MOVEMENT BY THE PLANET.
