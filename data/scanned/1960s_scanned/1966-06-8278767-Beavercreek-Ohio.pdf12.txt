Dear

I have reviewed the information which you provided on your observation of a strange aerial object on 12 June 1966. We feel that the case appears to be the probable sighting of a meteor or high-flying aircraft.

The attached extracts from "Flight & Colour in the Open Air," by W. A. Lethbridge, may explain why different observers would describe a similar object in such varying ways. I hope you found the material which we forwarded to you on 23 June informative. Please feel free to write and ask us. Thank you for reporting your observation.

Sincerely,

NEWTON QUINTANILLA, Ir. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
