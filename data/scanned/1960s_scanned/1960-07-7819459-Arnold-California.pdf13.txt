"So Case (Information Only)
23 July 1950
Kennebunk, Me., Maine

Source: UFO Investigator, 1957-1958 1980

The source of this information is from a report by John C. F. Brown, Jr., a business man and inventor, concerning a UFO sighting which occurred on 23 July 1950 at Kennebunk, Maine. This report was forwarded to the Air Force and received by Project Blue Book in 1950. The report stated that at 10:30 P.M., 23 July 1950, the witness and his wife saw a bright, glowing, circular object in the sky at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet. The object was approximately 100 to 150 feet in diameter, and consisted of a bright glowing whitish light. It made no sound and was observed for about 30 seconds before it disappeared. The report concluded that the object was definitely not an airplane or any other conventional aircraft."
