The text on the image describes the witness's observation of an unusual aircraft, including details about the lighting, movement, and disappearance of the object.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

THIS OBJECT WAS MOVING FASTER THAN ANY AIRCRAFT I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. IT WAS MOST IMPRESSED BY THE LIGHTED AREA. IT SEEMED TO COME FROM A LOW ALTITUDE, MOVE UPWARD, THEN GIVE THE FEELING OF COMING FROM A WINDOW. AT ONE POINT, WHEN THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED, IT SEEMED TO BE DISTINGUISHABLE. EXCEPT FOR THE GREAT WHICH COULD OR COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONCAVE, BEFORE THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED, I COULD HEAR AND SEE JET PLANE. HIGHER AND TO THE LEFT OF THE OBJECT. AT NO TIME DID I SEE ANY FAMILIAR TYPE OF AIRCRAFT.
