that the distance between civilizations in a galaxy is not less than several hundred light years and is probably more than a thousand light years.
Although the results of these two calculations differ, the important feature is that both calculations indicate the extremely large distances involved in attempting to establish communications with extraterrestrial civilizations.
The tremendous distances between the stars is another serious difficulty; they average out to about 3 parsecs or 10 light years, not to speak of the millions of light years separating us from other galaxies. The situation is thus not very encouraging even with the most favorable assumptions about the frequency of the planets and a simultaneous existence of highly developed civilizations on these planets. (Some of the planetary requirements for civilizations to evolve are given in Appendix II.)
Soviet radio astronomers such as Troitskiy and Kotel'nikov think that 1,000 light years is the maximum distance at which interstellar communications have any meaning at all, and at this distance the existence of only one civilization similar to ours can be expected.
As is well known, Project Ozma in the US was based on a much greater restriction of the problem. Only the nearest stars were considered and among these only those that were more or
