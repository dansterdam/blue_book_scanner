5 minutes; later that night there were many radio reports from further south concerning bright objects "hanging in the sky". (These all sounded like Venus or Jupiter).

Sighting was not at close range and involved no effect, no conclusion about the actual cause of the lights can be reached. The case should be classified "unknown"; too little information for conclusion." This would correspond to the present class, "Insufficient information", except that by nature, no matter how well-observed by the witness the lights were, no decision could be reached. The object itself is nearly devoid of information.

Petresman, Keline Police Department, Keline, Illinois. sighting occurred on the afternoon of March 9, 1967. His eldest son was with him at the time. This case has been thoroughly investigated by officers from Chanute Field, so only general observations will be made concerning the motion picture film taken by ___________________

___________________was located on 14th Street and 16th Avenue, looking north. The object was seen visually at about a 45-degree elevation (modified by M___________ from the 30-degree angle given initially). The location is in the northwest portion of Keline.

The object went north; the witness felt that he could almost see what it was, but it became smaller. The film does not cover the closest approach of the object, something having gone wrong and the film not having been exposed for the first five feet of film. Finally the object drifted away to the northwest. A second object was then seen to follow the same path, giving exactly the same appearance and appearing to hover in the same places. M_______________ tried to photograph the second object, but found out that his camera had not been re-cocked properly.
