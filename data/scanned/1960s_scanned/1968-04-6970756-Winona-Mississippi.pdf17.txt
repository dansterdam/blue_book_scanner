This page does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a questionnaire or report form related to a UFO sighting. The text of the form is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object did not disappear while the witness was watching it.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

The object did not move behind anything.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

The object did not move in front of anything.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: 
b. Color:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The sketch shows a roughly circular or disc-shaped object.
