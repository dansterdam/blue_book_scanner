SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for July 22, 1961
OLD HUNGARIAN CHURCH
This ancient church in Hungary still bears the trace of its glorious past. The church, located in the village Zarnka in the midst of fields and pastures, has been in existence since the 13th century.
The walls of the church still bear scars from the long siege it withstood. The stories scattered around the church tell of the battle that took place here, more than four centuries ago. The belfry bears the marks of cannon balls and the walls are scarred by musket fire. The building stands, however, as a testimony of the valiant fight put up by the defenders against the invading forces. The church is now mostly fallen in disrepair, and is kept in existence only through the efforts of the local villagers.
TECHNOLOGY
Irradiated Plastics
PRODUCE SYNTHOCONDUCTORS
RADIATION of chlorinated plastics with electrons and neutrons produces materials from which synthoconductors can be made. These new materials behave as semiconductors under certain conditions, according to Dr. R. O. Bolt, Radiation Applications Section, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.
Ordinary plastics are poor conductors of electricity. But when they are irradiated, some of the chlorine atoms are knocked loose from the molecules, leaving behind conductivity-producing defects in the molecular structure. 
The degree of conductivity can be controlled by the amount of irradiation. This makes possible the production of semiconductors from inexpensive plastics, instead of the usual semiconducting materials like germanium and silicon.
The new synthoconductors may find use in electronic devices where moderate conductivity is required, such as in diodes, transistors, and other components. The research is still in an early stage, but the potentialities of this technique appear promising.
