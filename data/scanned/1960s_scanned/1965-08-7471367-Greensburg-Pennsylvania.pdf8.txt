The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a descriptive text about a UFO sighting.

The text reads:

Mr. ??? is obviously intelligent, scientifically quite competent as an observer. Since he is emphatic on the fact that he is well acquainted with high-flying jets and that he is satisfied that "they" are not some form or a problem then if we could assess this as an aircraft.

Thursday, August 13th, the public was apparently very excited. The time was 11:30 P.M., Daylight Saving Time. The sighting of August 11th was not seen on the 13th. The object was seen directly above western horizon, having come into sight directly in the south and proceeding in a northwesterly direction. With the naked eye, this could very well have been a star, distant and with a glowing light. It is harder to apply this interpretation to the two sightings which were seen directly overhead. If we adopt 20 or more seconds as a necessary timeframe, and compare this to our knowledge of the speed of sound, this would place the craft at 10,000 feet or some 250 miles per hour, or at 5 miles, 625 miles per hour. Because very great brightness of the light, it would favor a faster, distant object 5,000 feet above him, of course, this is highly improbable, but it seems the most logical. A jet would have not to be heard, and the brilliance of the light against the dark sky would make this the strongest possibility. There is the unidentified category. Because it appeared on two occasions and was in each case a one-witnesse matter, and the motion is that of an aircraft, I would tend to classified this down as possible aircraft. Don't tell this to Mr. ???, he will surely argue against this.
