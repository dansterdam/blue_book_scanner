Dear Sir:
Tonight my family and I saw an object in the air. It was a very bright object and it had a pulsating red color to it. The light was so bright that it hurt our eyes. It also had a smaller light following it which was also very bright. When it took off the red and color turned to a greenish-blue color. It shot up at a very fast rate and then my family and I got a better look at it.

It was an odd shaped thing, I can't describe what it was. But he said it hummed. I informed you wrote this letter to you so you would not do anything about it. It's just that I don't know what I saw. When it took off, I thought I saw a child like figure. But I have never seen anything like this before. It's really hard to explain what I saw. It was almost like a flying soccer ball. This object did not make any noise. Only the humming sound it made as it left. I hope this information doesn't go any further. You'll never tell me anything different. I'm not doing this to have anything to do with what I have told you. Please if you answer my letter don't use my name.

Sincerely yours
[Redacted]

Please take this serious you might as well face it, I'm not the only one who has seen this.
