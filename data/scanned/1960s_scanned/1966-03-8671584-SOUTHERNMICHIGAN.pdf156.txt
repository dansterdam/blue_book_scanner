There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, discussing observations of unusual lights or phenomena.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Whenever, Hinnant, in his book, "Flight and Color, in the Open Air," has this to say about swamps. He describes lights that have been seen in swamps by the astronomer Benoit and other observers. The lights, he says, resemble tiny flames, sometimes seen right on the ground, sometimes floating above it. The flames go out in one place and suddenly appear in another, giving the illusion of motion. The colors, he says, are sometimes yellow, sometimes red and blue-green. No heat is felt, and the lights do not harm or char the ground. They can appear for hours at a time and sometimes for a whole night. Generally there is no smell, and usually no sound, except the popping sound of little explosions, such as when a gas burner ignites.

Where does the gas come from, and what lights it? The rotating vegetation-eating marsh gas which can be ignited by ice and winter conditions. When a spring thaw occurs, the gas may be released in some quantity.

The flame, Hinnant says, is a form of chemical luminescence and its low temperature is one of its peculiar features. Exactly how it occurs is not known and this in itself might be made a subject of an interesting study.

The glowing lights on the swamp near Exeter, Maine, were observed for two to three hours. No sounds were heard, except for popping sounds. The lights were red, green or yellow and they appeared to move sideways, and to rise a short distance. I emphasize this would not be seen frequently, as this is of a unique character. I have never seen it myself and I can easily understand the dismay of the witnesses who see it and who sincerely described what they saw."
