The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page of text from a Project Blue Book document, discussing details about a sighting report.

Text from the document:

"These items were treated in a more detailed explanation. The photos should have been extensive, but no usual information reaching this office indicated a radar confirmation of this report. It could have been some single sighting which visualized this light, but the information was not made explicit - it could have been some other reported signals which did not reappear.

Nevertheless, who made-the report had the co-ordinates MAAF officers in the vicinity authenticated in formation sources and found the report to have details supporting its veracity and significance."
