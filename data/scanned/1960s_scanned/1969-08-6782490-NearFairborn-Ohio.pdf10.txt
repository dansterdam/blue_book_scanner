14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

We STOPPED out and a bright light vert.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
The object didn't on and off sever al times. After about an hour it did not show on so my friend and I decided that it was gone. We waited but it didn't come back.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
The object was a small, hazy and than a slightly larger faint light.
