Dear Sirs,
On March 26, I spotted an object in the sky which I believe to have been a satellite, but I am not sure. It was moving rapidly, but in a straight line for your opinion about the object. The object was in the center of the sky, a little to the north west (though) looking at it through binoculars it looked like a regular star, only closer. The color of the object was nearly the same as that of the star, but the motion of it betrayed nearly directy north, before leaving my view. Altogether it took only a few minutes to cross the sky from where I first spotted it. (about 5 minutes). Please let me know if it was a satellite or star or what. If it is a satellite inform me as of which one it was.

Sincerely yours,

Not Echo II
