The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with a series of questions related to the observation of an unidentified flying object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
Yes. No. Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Yes. No. Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object then you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and specifically without trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
