It occurred at a small airport and the duration was one and one-half minutes. Follow-up should have been made to determine whether there were other potential witnesses. Sighting is considered as unidentified. Witnesses available. Must be carried as unidentified, single witness.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.
A single witness reported seeing a round white light that hovered at 5,000 feet at 9:00 p.m. The witness was a 67-year-old lady. The light was observed for three minutes and then it disappeared. Witness said sighting occurred at a sight and that it was still reasonably bright. Witness said sighting occurred at night and that the light was similar to a very bright star. The witness was sure the object was not a star.

I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire, a case. See attached supplemental sheet A.

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Dover Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, I am requesting a copy of the Air Force investigation of same. I suggest the sighting is obviously unidentified based on NICAP report.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
I have only the card on this case, but judging from it there seems by the description that this thing was observed by 1 or more persons for 10 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Leoa, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it.
