The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten report or document. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document and output it as follows:

Dear Sirs,
I am enclosing a sketching of an object I sighted on December 10, 1956, at 6:30 P.M., which I believe to be a UFO. I held it in sight for about 6 to 7 minutes. The object was hovering and moving in an erratic manner.
The object lights, in the center, appeared to be pulsating. There were light-colored lights around the object's outer edge, which appeared stationary. The object's size was approximately 50 feet across.
One of your staff will not merely analyze the data, but conduct a thorough investigation and examination as soon as possible. This is of urgent concern to me, and I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
Yours truly,
