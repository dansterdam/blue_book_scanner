There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document containing text from what seems to be a Project Blue Book report.

THE SAME, THE WITNE8S REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, APPROXIMATELY 50-60 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND SILVER IN COLOR. THE OBJECT HOVERED AND MANEWERED OVER THE AREA FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES. IT THEN PROCEEDED TO-CLIMB ALMOST VERTICALLY AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

AND OUR   TO THIS BEING JUST BEFORE PASSED BELOW THE HORIZON, THE OBJEOT MOVED JE FRONT OF THE WITNESSES AT A RAPID  RATE  OF SPEED, AND WEIS SOME DISTANCE AWAY WHEN IT DISAPPEARED.

ALL WITNESSES OBSERVED THE OBJECT AND THEIR STATEMENTS ARE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT AS TO ITS APPEARANCE, BEHAVIOR AND DISAPPEARANCE.

THIS IS A RATHER UNUSUAL SIGHTING, AND THE FILE IS THEREFORE BEING FORWARDED TO THE SPECIAL PROJECT BLUE BOOK SECTION FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.
