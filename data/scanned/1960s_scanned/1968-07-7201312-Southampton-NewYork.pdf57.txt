Latins Seeing Saucers,
And Not in Their Cups
BUENOS AIRES, July 20 (UPI) -Reports of flying saucer sightings over parts of Latin America are increasing, but officials say the sightings are not caused by too much strong drink.
Capt. Mario Arce, chief of Argentina's Civil Aeronautics Department, said his office has received many reports of unidentified objects in the sky, particularly over the northwestern provinces.
"I am convinced that these sightings are real," he said. "The people who report them are sober, respectable citizens."
Similar reports have come from Peru, Chile and other countries. Aviation officials say the sightings are being taken seriously and are being investigated.
The navy has been alerted to watch for the strange objects. Officials say they are being seen both at night and during the day, sometimes hovering, sometimes zooming away at high speed.
