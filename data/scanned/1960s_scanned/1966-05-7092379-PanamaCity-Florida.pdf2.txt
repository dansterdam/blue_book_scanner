The image does not contain any photograph, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text from the image:

Dear Sir:

I have in my possession pictures which I took of a strange object in the sky over Panama City, Florida on May 7, 1966. The object was round in shape, silvery in color, and appeared to be hovering above the ground. It remained in the sky for several minutes before suddenly speeding away at a high rate of speed.

I would be interested in forwarding these pictures to your office for your analysis. Please advise if you would like me to do so.

Sincerely,
(Redacted)
