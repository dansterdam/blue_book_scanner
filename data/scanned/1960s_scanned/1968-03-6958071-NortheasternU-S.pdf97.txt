The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. It does not contain any photographs, but rather a typed memo describing an observation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) by a witness and his family on March 3, 1968. The memo details the witness's account of seeing three objects in the sky, describing their movement and disappearance.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
UFO OBSERVATION & PHOTOGRAPHS, 3 MARCH 1968
Mr. Xxxxx (name redacted) reported regarding his family's observation and subsequent photographs of an UFO on 3 March 1968. His address is: Xxxxx (address redacted), Elyria, Ohio.
At approximately 9:50 pm they saw three objects, two close together and in the rear, quite and it was apparently some kind of flame. His son was got a series of photographs and was going to develop them today, 4 March, at school. He doesn't know if he got anything on the film or not. It was black and white film. There was no sound to the objects, probably 5 to 8,000 ft alt, going 4 - 500 mph. Duration was about forty seconds. The objects were going northeast. My son went out of the house and saw them come from the south, then I saw it in the middle of the sky and then it just disappeared.
