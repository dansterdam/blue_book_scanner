3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2300W
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. SOURCE: Air-Visual
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-5 minutes
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Object appeared to be well defined, oval in shape, white to slightly yellow in color, with a few small lights which seemed to be a part of the object. Object moved from the northwest to the southeast at an apparent speed of 3 to 5 degrees per second, dipped slightly below the horizon, and became obscured by trees.
9. CONCLUSIONS: Was aircraft. Possibly balloon. Was astronomical. Possibly aircraft.
10. COMMENTS: This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that the object was well defined, moved at a relatively slow speed, and dipped below the horizon, which does not coincide with a typical UFO sighting. The witness is a reliable observer with 6 years of experience, and his description of the object's characteristics and movement is consistent with an astronomical object or aircraft.
