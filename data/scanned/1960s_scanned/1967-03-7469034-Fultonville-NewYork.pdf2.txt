35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I just heard a beautiful glow while going out on the porch for a visit with my neighbor. Something was descending and seemed to just glide silently without a noise. It was a big bright light that seemed to float along with no visible means of propulsion. The glow was bright but not blinding. It was a clear night and the object was quite visible. It seemed to be searching or looking around in the area. After a few minutes it suddenly shot up at an almost straight angle and disappeared from sight. The experience was quite unexpected and startling. I had never seen anything like this before.
