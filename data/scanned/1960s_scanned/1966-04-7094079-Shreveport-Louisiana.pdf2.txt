1. Check with the Shreveport police revealed that they do not use this type of light. An ambulance company advised that they have discontinued this light and had no other reports.

2. Captain Ruab, Jr., 1934#, a PBY controller from the Command Post was flying a routine training mission in a PBY on the 7th when he received a report from the crew that they had sighted an unknown object at 17,000 feet crossing their course. The object was described as a bright light, in excess of 2000-3000 mph, with no exhaust trail, and no visible means of propulsion. The object was observed visually for approximately 10-15 seconds before it disappeared from sight. Captain Ruab did not see the object himself.

3. The original report was made to the Investigating Officer at 17:00 hrs 7 Apr. The officer interviewed the individuals concerned and checked the area in the neighborhood, but could find no further evidence or witnesses. Neighbors were not interviewed as the observation was at night, and there was nothing further to be gained.

Investigator's analysis: It is possible that the object observed was some type of meteor or other natural phenomenon, as the description fits that of a bright light traveling at high speed with no visible means of propulsion. However, the high rate of speed and lack of an exhaust trail are not typical of meteors. Since there is no other physical evidence, and no other witnesses have come forward, a definite determination cannot be made.

The report is signed by an Investigating Officer and dated 11 April 1966.
