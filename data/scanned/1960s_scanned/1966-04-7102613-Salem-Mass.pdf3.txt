Object was really what appeared the bottoms part disappearing only slightly as through
it may have gone down behind trees or other objects. Shape was approximately circular.
It was in a zig-zag course flew across the sky, changing direction, speed and altitude rapidly. When it was first sighted it was at a very high altitude, then dropped rapidly 
in altitude until it was obscured from view. Color was whiteish-blue, changing from a bright white to a dull greyish-blue as it moved away into the distance.
Several other smaller lights were also observed with the main object at times, flashing on and off and maneuvering around the main object. The object made no sound whatsoever, although a loud humming sound was heard during one sighting a few minutes later in another area.
The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes before fading from view.
This report was made out by Lt. with approval of Captain S., USAF.
