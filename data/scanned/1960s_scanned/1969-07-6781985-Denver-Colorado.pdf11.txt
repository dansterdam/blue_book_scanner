JULY 5, 1969  
DENVER, COLORADO
AERIAL PHENOMENON  

On the evening of July 5, 1969, at approximately 2100 hours, a round, bright light was observed in the night sky over the Denver, Colorado, area. The object was observed for approximately one hour by several witnesses. The object appeared to hover and make sudden changes in direction. No noise was heard associated with the object.

The object was observed by four separate witnesses, all of whom were located in different areas around Denver. The descriptions of the object were consistent among the witnesses. The object was described as round in shape, bright white in color, and approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length. The object appeared to hover and make sudden, erratic movements, changing direction rapidly.

No physical evidence of the object was recovered, and no other information is available regarding this incident.
