Dear Charles,

This is in response to your letter concerning a sighting of an unidentified object on 15 May 1964. However, it was necessary for the letter to be rerouted several times.

Your description is interesting but did not contain sufficient detail to enable our analysts to make an evaluation. Therefore, we are attaching an PID FORM 164 which we request you complete and return to the Air Force.

We are enclosing a self-addressed envelope for your convenience. Upon receipt of the completed form, a further analysis will be made to determine if you will be notified of our conclusions.

Also attached is a procedure explaining the unidentified flying object program.

Sincerely,

EDWARD J. RUPPELT
Major, USAF 
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
