Winter Haven, Fla.
Dear Mrs. Green:

Please accept this expression of appreciation for your initiative in acquainting the space material. Also, since I do not know your address, please relay our thanks to him for allowing us to evaluate the material which he found under such unique circumstances. Please assure him that I will ask the analysts to use every precaution in handling the samples, and to return it to us in its original state as nearly as possible.

I received the material in good condition from Dr. Pursell exactly as he described it. I have written him a note of appreciation for his packing and shipping it to us.

Your interest and assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated. I will be very to keep you posted on the progress of the evaluation and also the findings. Any further information or material will contribute at least in some small way, to the better understanding of space phenomena.
