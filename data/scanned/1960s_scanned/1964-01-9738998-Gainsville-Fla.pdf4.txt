SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (70 miles West of Jacksonville, Florida)

1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to Mr. ------- , University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. Our records indicate no previous correspondence on this case.

2. The object reported had a southwesterly component, rolling out and shown a pulsation. The duration of the observation is not excessive for an aircraft at high altitude, particularly since he has indicated that it appeared the object was not just an aircraft out of its normal flight pattern. These are no high altitude air routes over this area, and it would not be on a regular schedule. However, this does not rule out aircraft.
