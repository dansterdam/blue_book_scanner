Dear_______

Reference your unidentified observation of 21 July 1966 over Johnston City, Illinois. The object which you observed was probably a "government supported satellite tracker." I am sure that your observation is one of the above devices and where all types of visual lights and satellite components are.

Additional information relating to your observation is contained in reports on Project Sign, Project grudge, and Project Bluebook. I am forwarding the procedure on Project Blue Book with an additional PID Form 1 for your retention.

Sincerely,

VICTOR QUIVRGNILLA, JR. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
