I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN UFO'S RESEARCH AT WORKING SITE - NEAR ALBANY NY FOR SOME TIME, AND HAVE SEEN SEVERAL (CANNOT DETERMINE EXACT NUMBER) UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES. THESE OBJECTS WERE GENERALLY OVAL OR CIGAR-SHAPED, WITH SOME LUMINOUS MARKINGS. THEY MOVED RAPIDLY AND SILENTLY, AT LOW ALTITUDES. ONE SIGHTING WAS APPROXIMATELY 1957. THE OTHERS WERE WITHIN THE PAST 5 YEARS. I HAVE REPORTED SOME OF THESE SIGHTINGS TO THE PRESS, BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE PUBLIC INTEREST. I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN ANY FOLLOW-UP ON THIS REPORT, AND IN ANY INFORMATION YOUR PROJECT CAN PROVIDE.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
