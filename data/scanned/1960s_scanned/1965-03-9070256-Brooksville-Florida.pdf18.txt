The image does not contain any photograph, only a handwritten sketch or diagram. The diagram appears to show a circular or oval-shaped object with some annotations around it, such as "Cock plan" and "first had" written nearby. There is no identifying information about the individuals involved.

Now, as requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

cock plane.

second lief the.
