1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified aerial object sighting report from your office at approximately 5:30 a.m., 9 February 1968.

2. The observer sighted an extremely bright light and also heard a noise. The object was observed to the southwest and moved in a northerly direction at a high speed above the observer's position. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes and then was lost to sight as the object accelerated and moved to the north. The sound pulsations were reported to be two or three times louder and higher pitched than those associated with conventional aircraft.

3. If you have any further data or documentation in connection with this sighting, please forward it to this office for evaluation and analysis. Is there any activity in the area at that time?

4. Did any military or civil observers (cover or uncover) report or observe this object or related objects for the early morning hours of the 9th of February?

5. We realize this information is limited and more details would be desirable; however, we would sincerely appreciate your answering these questions.

6. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
