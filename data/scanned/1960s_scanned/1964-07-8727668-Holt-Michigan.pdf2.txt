The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document.

The text in the document reads:

"... about due east. It seemed irregular in outline, almost elliptical, with a definite color that appeared brownish-orange. It was a steady light, not blinking or flickering. It moved in a straight line, maintaining a constant speed, and disappeared over the horizon going due east.

The object was sighted for about 1-1/2 to 2 minutes. It was estimated to be about 800 to 1000 feet in altitude. The object was sighted by 2 observers. No sound was heard. The object was first sighted due east about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon and it disappeared over the horizon at about the same level. The object was about 5 to 10 degrees in size. The sky was clear at the time of the sighting.

The principal observer is a high school teacher in Michigan, and the other observer is a friend of the principal observer."
