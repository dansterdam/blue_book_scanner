UFO Investigations
U.S. Air Force
Gentlemen:

I wish to report my seeing an unusual object in the sky:

On the morning of June 4, 1967 I sighted this light in the sky at about 5:00 AM. It was a brilliant object. It shone several times or more brilliance of the brightest star in the sky. From my location in South Huntington it appeared in the sky at about RBM and in a couple minutes had moved to about WSW where it quickly faded completely from view. 

It was an elevation of about 45 degrees above the horizon. I possible think this was an American or Russian satellite, possibly a guess as to the nature of the object. I would be interested in knowing your opinion.

Sincerely,
Raymond Nelson
Major, AR Res.
