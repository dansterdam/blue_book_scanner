(A) I have been on the toad with a director of a number of months last spring for the purpose of investigating a number of so-called unconventional aircraft which our country, our country, it appears, has had under observation for some time. We have heard a great deal of talk and comment about these objects, but very little actual data or information.

(B) My purpose in this report is to give you a brief summary of my findings and impressions during this investigation. I do not claim to have all the answers, but I believe I have uncovered some interesting facts which may be of value in evaluating this problem.

(C) It is my considered opinion that there is something to this UFO business - and that our air defense forces are facing a challenge which they do not fully understand or know how to cope with. This is not to say that I believe all the stories of flying saucers and men from Mars. On the contrary, I am quite skeptical of many of the wild tales that have been circulated. However, I am convinced that there is a kernel of truth in all this, and that we are dealing with phenomenon which do not fit into our present frame of reference.
