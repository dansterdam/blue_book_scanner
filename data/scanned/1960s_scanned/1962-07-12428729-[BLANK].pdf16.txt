Henoma are anything other than as claimed by the Air Force. The Air Force attempts to ascertain any object which is unidentified and has prescribed performance parameters.

In many instances the pilots, upon returning to the ground, realize that he has been attempting to close on some common object such as a planet. The Ryan case which occurred in the state of New York on 8 April 1956 was due to the misidentification of the planet Venus. Our records reveal that Captain Ryan was not directed by the Air Force to investigate the object and that, according to his own statement, he did not deviate from course for this or any other purpose. The fact that Captain Ryan arrived as scheduled on his destination, on schedule, tends to substantiate the claim that he did not deviate from course.

Scientists and engineers, though expert in their own field, can temporarily misinidentify some object or phenomena thus reporting it as an unidentified flying object. It is, in fact, possible for a scientist to be deceived by an occurrenced which Dr. Donald H. Menzel of Harvard, a noted scientist, had experienced before.

These are sightings in the Air Force which indicate lightning or some similar electromagnetic phenomena as the probable cause. Due to the infrequent occurrence and the transient nature.
