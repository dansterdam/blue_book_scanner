MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJ: Treatment of Civilian Caller

1. At approximately 2100 hours EDT, 4 July 1969, Sgt ZEP Dispatch, 5th Command Post Controller, took a phone call from a citizen in CINCINNATI, KENTUCKY. Mr. ZP stated that he might be witness to an Unidentified Flying Object, and asked if there was any known aircraft traffic in his area. Sgt Dispatch referred Mr. ZP to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Operations, advising that they might be able to answer his question about possible aircraft.

2. At approximately 2125 hours, Mrs. ZP, extremely irate because of the treatment her husband had received from Sgt Dispatch, called the FTD Command Post. She placed that a man who had identified himself as Mr. ZP had suggested that Mr. ZP had been picking too much, and that he should forget the whole matter. She related that both she and her husband had worked at their regular jobs on 4 July 1969, and that neither of them had questioned any incidents of lights on that day or as a normal practice.

3. AF Form 117, Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire, was completed at the request of the staff Duty Officer, and an apology was made for the behavior of Mr. ZP.

4. It is recommended that the Commander, FTD, bring the alleged behavior of Mr. ZP to the attention of the base Commander, and that the opinion of the staff Duty Officer and his controller at the time be obtained, to afford adverse publicity in the United States Air Force at a time when it can least afford adverser publicity in any area of endeavor.
