Transcription of the text in the document:

3 was reported 1976 on the 8th by Mrs. Walter Blacker Jr. of 3325 Broad St., Ft. Seneca, Ohio. She reported that she and her husband saw an oval-shaped, bright orange object hovering over a wooded area across the road from their home. The object appeared to be about 50 to 60 feet in diameter and was at an altitude of about 50 to 60 feet. It hovered silently for about 30 seconds and then shot straight up and disappeared from sight. No sound was heard. The object did not appear to have any appendages or projections. It was a clear night with good visibility. The reporting witness appears to be reliable. No physical evidence was obtained.
