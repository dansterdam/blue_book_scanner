UFO REPORTS DISCOUNTED AT FIELD
A series of unidentified flying objects over eight Western states Sunday night and early Monday morning, Aug 29-30, have been checked at the Peterson Air Force Base investigating center.
Only five verified sightings were reported, Major Charles E. Dayhoff told The Journal Herald, 3 Aug 65. The rest were discounted and declared to be standard air traffic in the area.
Numerous reports were received from Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, and Wyoming. Oklahomans provided most of the reports, with 10 or more sightings verified in that state alone.
The earliest sighting was at a.15 p.m. EDT 29 Aug. The latest was at 8 a.m. EDT 30 Aug. This five min assistant investigator at Wichita, Kan., said the lights observed during the period were aircraft and that no unidentified flying objects had been sighted. Each sighting had a logical explanation, he reported.
"There was some public agitation and police calls on the incident," said Dayhoff, "but each was traced to known air traffic, such as a formation of bombers or fighters returning to base, after normal flying operations." He said the Air Force has found no evidence of extra-terrestrial visitors.
