Air Force Expert 'Identifies' UFO's
WASHINGTON - Michigan's much-publicized and official unidentified flying objects have been identified. They turn out to be will-o'-the-wisps and the moon in March. This is the official explanation by Air Force experts who investigated reports of the colorful, glowing, flying, hovering and blinking objects that have captured southern Michigan's imagination. 
Meanwhile, back in Washington, Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan said it was "a very wholesome thing" for Congress to investigate unidentified flying objects. An investigation, he said, would make the American people "feel better." Identification of Michigan's strange objects came yesterday at a formal press conference in Detroit. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer and an Air Force consultant on unidentified flying objects categorized the hitherto mysterious sightings this way:
The second sighting, widely distributed as photographic evidence, turns out to be a time exposure of the rising crescent moon and the planet Venus.
A majority of the other observations--reported to be almost continuous--prove to be normal, common occurrences such as the familiar swamp gas, which is also responsible for the will-o'-the-wisps seen in marshe.
Hynek said there was no ready explanation for how swamp gas can glow so realy works.
