appeared uniformly carbonized from end to end.
A thorough search was then conducted on the road around the burned area, the shoulders of the road, and the wheat fields on either side of the road (for a distance of about 25 inches tall). Nothing unusual was found. The search was conducted with the aid of two cars' headlights and with hand-held six-cell flashlights.
The following morning, another inspection of the scene revealed four small holes (see enclosed diagram) spaced at the corners of a square approximately 11.5 feet on a side, centered on the burned area. Each hole was about 1/2 inch in diameter. The edges of the holes (not and 22) had remnants of cylindrical sides and blue bottoms, and were about 3/4 inch deep. The other two were less well-defined and were shallower, about 3/6 inches deep.
Two troopers who had conducted the search the previous night are positive that the holes were not there during the first search. The holes, however, were small, and a test made at night using car headlights alone showed that they could not be visible under low-angle illumination, appearing as just another shadow among many. The troopers, however, insisted that they could not have overlooked the holes if they had been there on Friday night.
On Saturday morning, Crowder went to see Martin, to find out if Martin had seen anything the previous night. Crowder said that he was careful not to give anything away about what he had seen himself. Martin's story: In bed about 9:30 to 10:00 p.m. the night before, he had been visited by a man wearing a dark coat, who had knocked on his door. In two or three minutes, the man left, and Martin went back to bed. At about 8:30, they arrived back home. Mrs. Martin entered the house, and Mr. Martin went outside the house, in a position where he was looking north.
