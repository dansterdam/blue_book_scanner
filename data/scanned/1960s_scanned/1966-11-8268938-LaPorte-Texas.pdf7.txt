b) Balloon: The U. S. Weather Bureau released a weather balloon from its weather station at Victoria, Texas, at 0515 on the date of the sighting. The description indicates that the path of this balloon was tracked from the weather station's official records. These records indicated the balloon burst at an altitude of 62,000 feet almost two hours before the UFO sighting could have occurred. It appears that this balloon could not be an explanation for the UFO sighting.

31. Photographic evidence: No photographs were taken.

32. Conclusions: Although investigation did not disclose any other balloon launches, it was his opinion that this was a balloon of some type. The investigation could not uncover any other logical explanation for this UFO sighting.
