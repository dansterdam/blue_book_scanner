SUBJECT: UFO REPORT, VALLEY FALLS, N.Y. - 9 APRIL 1965
DATE: 26 APRIL 1965
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, NICAP Investigating Subcommittee, Chelmsford, Mass.
TO: NICAP, 1536 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
ATTN: Richard Hall

The attached report provides information concerning a UFO sighting on 9 April 1965, 10:15 AM EST at Valley Falls, N.Y. 

Mr. Gifford has specifically requested that his name not appear in any publication. His reason for this is because he is not familiar with NICAP and its policies, and would ensure that the latest copy of the "UFO INVESTIGATOR" be sent to him from NICAP headquarters along with a request to use his name if it is decided that his report is worth publishing.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
NICAP Investigator
