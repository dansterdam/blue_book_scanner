There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten letter or document from an individual reporting a UFO sighting.

Dear Sir,
Couldn't wait any longer before letting you know the results of my investigation of the reported sighting of a UFO which I made a few nights ago. As you know, I reported I had seen it on the night in question, and I hope I could be of some help on this case.
I am sorry I was unable to get more data. As I stated in my letter, I did see an object which was far above the usual planes and which moved with extreme speed and made no sound at all. I have two or three friends who were out with me that night, and we all felt it worth reporting. We actually drew several sketches and photos, but it is doubtful if any of this added material will be of much value, since the object only appeared for a short time and was rather indistinct.
Thank you,
