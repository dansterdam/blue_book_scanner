This office has a UFO report from furnished by Mr. McMinnville, Oregon. He
stated that he be informed of our evaluation the following is
a presented reply:

Dear Mr. n

Your recent letter dated 12 Nov 64 to Doctor J. Allen has
been forwarded to the Air Force as PART OF HIS case 
file on your sighting of 11 Dec 63.

Since your subsequent letter did not indicate your desire to have an
evaluation and/or disposition of the sighting we regret to
say that it has not been possible to provide you with an evaluation.
Doctor Hynek considered the possibility of a light aircraft, however.
Balloons do carry lights and are usually battery operated. However,
several factors concerning the objects were considered with this
evaluation as possibly precluding this as the answer. The basic 
minimal object in that particular area rules out this as a
possibly identifiable object.

Your case has been filed as one of the few cases for
which the Air Force cannot find a logical explanation. The
attached statistics for 1963 indicate the small residue of
those sightings which are indeed puzzling to us as well as
men of science, such as yourself. The attached brochure 
provides a more comprehensive picture of our project to date.
