TUCSON, ARIZONA 9 SEPTEMBER 1960

Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. At approximately 2015 hours on 8 September 1960, I observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Tucson, Arizona. The object was moving rapidly in a northeasterly direction at an estimated altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The object emitted a bright white light which appeared to be pulsing or blinking at irregular intervals. No other lights were visible on the object. The object was under observation for approximately 2 minutes before it disappeared from sight.

2. The weather at the time was clear with unlimited visibility. No aircraft or other objects were observed in the area at the same time as the unidentified flying object.

3. I am a private citizen and have no special training or background in the identification of aircraft or other objects in the sky. This is the first time I have observed an unidentified flying object.
