OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE
Washington 25, D.C.
PUBLIC INFORMATION BRANCH
GENTLEMEN:

On the night of February 11, 1964 I was walking home from a friend's house where I sighted what might have been a U.F.O. I was walking near a church which is a row of six story government buildings. At a minute or two before or after 11:15 P.M. I looked up and saw eight white objects traveling in a tight formation. Within a fraction of a second they passed XXKXXXXX from over the edge of the church where I first saw them, to behind the apartment buildings. I ran to the corner of the block in time to see the objects disappear behind the apartment buildings across the street. Throughout all of this time the objects moved in a straight line toward the Southeast.

After this I ran to my home (about a block away) and called the police. It is a representation of how I first sighted the objects. The objects themselves were oval shaped and white. They seemed very slightly fuzzy around the edges as though they might be glowing. I could see no surface features. They were about three-quarters the size of the full moon. I heard no sound as they passed over. They didn't seem to make any ending noise as they passed over. They didn't seem to make any ending noise as they passed away.
