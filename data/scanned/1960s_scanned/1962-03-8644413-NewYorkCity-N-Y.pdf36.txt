from the South African Antarctic Expedition, and printed in the Bulletin of the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand at 22:07 hours GMT on March 13, 1962.

A very bright luminous object had been observed from that station, which is located on the Antarctic coast latitude 70 degrees 18 minutes south, longitude 2 degrees 21 minutes west, on February 12, 1962 at 01:27 hours. The object moved in a northeast direction at that station, which is located on the Antarctic coast latitude 70 degrees 18 minutes south, longitude 2 degrees 21 minutes west, on February 12, 1962 at 01:27 hours. The object moved in a northeast direction at high speed and disappeared after about 12 to 15 seconds.

It was the same number of the publication in which the report of another observation made at Grahamland for a different date was published by the staff of the Chilean Antartic Station, according to that report, the object moved southwest and according to a radiogram signed by Capt. Georg Taylor, base commander, the object showed three different parts, namely a central body showing a luminous exhaust, and two lateral wings. That object showed a luminous trail, leaving the whole sky According to Capt. Taylor's report, the object was at first just a point of light, then suddenly expanded, showing the three parts described, and then the whole object disappeared, leaving no trace.
The report concludes that this was not a meteor and there was no information on the fall of a satellite in that region.
