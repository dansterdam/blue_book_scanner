The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969.

The text in the document is as follows:

Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting. Observed flight path (to mile, motion, etc) indicates confusion with aircraft.

He was certain that the object or vehicle was observed for at least 2 minutes. The object appeared to be stationary for a short period and then proceeded to move out of sight.
