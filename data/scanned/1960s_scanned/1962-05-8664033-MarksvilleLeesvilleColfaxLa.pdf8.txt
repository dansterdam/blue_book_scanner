MARKSVILLE, LEESVILLE, COLFAX LA.
On May 8,1962 at 9:30 P.M.
A round, disc-shaped object, about 60 feet in diameter, was seen by a number of people in the vicinity of Marksville, Leesville, and Colfax, Louisiana. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes as it hovered and maneuvered at a low altitude, estimated to be about 500 feet. Witnesses described the object as silver or metallic in color, with a row of steady burning lights around the rim. It was observed to make a number of abrupt turns and changes in altitude before finally accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight toward the south-southwest.
