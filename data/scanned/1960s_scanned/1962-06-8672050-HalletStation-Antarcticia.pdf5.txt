Unidentified flying objects sighted in the Antarctic.
1. Date: 23 June 1962 at 01932 witnessed at Hallett Station, 72-20 S and 170-00 E observed an object which they described as brilliant white light, larger than a normal star in size, very low intensity, and moving at a very slow rate across the sky. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes and the object was observed for 5 minutes but due to it moving out of normal vision, it was lost.
2. It is suspected that it was a normal star and that the object passed through a thin cloud or haze causing the observed illusion. This caused the object and that is of the opinion that the object was nothing unusual, however unusual it may have appeared and if this condition was not continuous. The elevation of the object was less than 10 degrees and the object was observed through a theodolite.
3. Apparent size of the object was about 1/2 the size of a full moon and the color of the object was brilliant white. No sound was heard and the object appeared stationary except for the slow northward drift. The object gave no indication of rotation or movement other than the steady drift. The object was seen for approximately 15 minutes and disappeared from view behind clouds on the horizon.
4. On 25 August 1962 at 0930, a report of a similar sighting was made from the McMurdo Station, Antarctica. This was observed by experienced personnel and it appeared to have the same characteristics as the object of 23 June 1962, except that the size was somewhat smaller. This sighting was also made by use of a theodolite and the object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing behind clouds on the horizon.
