Several weeks earlier on June 13, a North Dalles woman who declines to be identified, spotted the same or a similar object, which she reported on June 5.  The yellow-white light, she said, seemed to be plunging into the ocean off Seattle, but judging from its direction, it was doubtful back on its original course.  A few weeks later, on June 15 or 16, a Dalles woman reported she watched the same or a similar object hovering erratically for a few seconds.  This sighting was also reported in the Dalles press.  In all, 21 sightings have been reported to them.  All seemed to be the same or a similar object, sighted within days or at most 3 weeks of the Pettifor sightings.
