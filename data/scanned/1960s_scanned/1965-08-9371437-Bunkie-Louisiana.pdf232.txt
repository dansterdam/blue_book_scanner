People Seeing Things 
All Through The Sky

OKLAHOMA CITY--Reports of mysterious objects that "dart and hover in the atmosphere" came in from Stillwater to the south and Carter to the north--all within the state.

The Air Force said reports of the sightings, which they said probably were nothing more than planets or stars, came in from Oklahoma and North Texas.

The reports told of "brilliant stars" that "hovered and quickly darted off," one report said the objects appeared to be spotted green and both sides with a bright red light.

The Air Force said the appearance of stars and planets are probably responsible for most of the reports. Even the appearance of planets and stars, they said, would indicate atmospheric conditions that could cause them to dart about or appear to change color.
