There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation.

The text of the document is as follows:

The sighting was very brief, but he feels it was most definite, and not something imagined. He did not believe more than one person saw it, and the brightness of the object was very outstanding. It was seen high in the sky to the north, and was round or circular in shape, and was very bright, brighter than a star or planet. It was seen for a few seconds only, and then suddenly appeared to speed away and disappear from sight. He was unable to determine the size, distance, or elevation of the object, but it seemed to be very high up, and was moving at a very high rate of speed when it disappeared from view. He stated that the object was not a star, planet, airplane, or any other known object, and he is convinced that it was a genuine UFO sighting. He had never seen anything like it before.
