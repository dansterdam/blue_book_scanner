1. Attached is a set of five (5) 8x10 color photos received from the Deputy Chief, Operations and Training Division, Ent AFB, Colorado, which were erroneously sent to Andrews AFB.

2. This misdaddressed UFO package again points out the necessity of stressing to all commands that FTD is located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.
