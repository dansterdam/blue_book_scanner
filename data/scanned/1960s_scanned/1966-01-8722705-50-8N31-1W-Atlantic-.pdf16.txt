Transcribing the text from the image:

Time 3:00 AM There was a large round object, white in color, hovering over the water, at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. It remained stationary for about 10 minutes and then began to move in a southeasterly direction at a very high rate of speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. It gave off no lights, sound, trail or exhaust. Estimated size was about 30-40 feet in diameter.
