Gentlemen,

Walter Minick this matter over since 16 the June. Also had to write you what I saw on 5/24/66. 8:30 PM I saw what appeared to be a sattelite but quite bright, it made no sound. As it came toward me, it suddenly stopped, hovered for a few minutes, then shot off rapidly in another direction at a terrific speed. There's a walking trail about 50 yards long parallel with the first. As it came from S.W. to N.E. the estimated time of the sighting was 3 1/2 min.
