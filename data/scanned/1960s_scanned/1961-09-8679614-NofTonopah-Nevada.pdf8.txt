Gentlemen:

Pursuant to our previous telephone convIErsation, I am sending you a transcript of notes we
made regarding a sighting af an object which occured on our radar site on 24 September 1961.

On Sept. 24, 1961, a station alarm was started indicating an object was on our radar
screens.. The object appeared to be moving in an erratic manner and was tracked by
continuous for 15 to 30 minutes with our RAPO' radar at a distance of three miles.

On Dept 29, 1961, a report was submitted to the CI&A and Project Blue Book
requesting additional information on projects which were being conducted in our
area. To date, we have not heard from them, with the exception of the routine
acknowledgement of receipt of the report. 

Respectfully yours,
