COMMENTS:
ALL THE SIGHTINGS INDICATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS TRAVELING IN A POLAR ORBIT. THE 2 SEPARATE SIGHTINGS OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES APART MAKING NO SOUND POSSIBLY INDICATING THAT IT WAS AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE OBSERVERS. IT WAS ASSUMED TO BE ABOUT 1 MILE AWAY. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED FROM IT OCCURRING AT NIGHT WITH NO VISIBLE REFERENCES TO GAUGE THE OBJECT CORRECTLY.
THIS OBJECT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE RE-ENTRY. THE ATMOSPHERE FROM A POLAR ORBIT, OR A METEORITE. NEITHER HAS BEEN PROVEN BECAUSE NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE HAS BEEN FOUND, AND HAS REPORTED ANYTHING FALLING.
