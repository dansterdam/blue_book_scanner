Dear Sir,

I recently sighted what appears to be some instrument concerning Project Blue Book and of 1950. The sighting took place about 6:30 p.m. on January 29, 1967 in the Ramsey, New Jersey area. I am interested in the existence of "bugs" which was apparently attached. Since my curiosity is very directed in the matter, I would greatly appreciate any information you could provide regarding the existence of flying saucers. I am convinced that I cannot be the only person who has seen such a thing. Please let me know your opinions on this matter. I am quite anxious to hear from you.

Sincerely yours,
