Dear Mrs. Hathaway,

In my search of your report I find nothing to substantiate the possible existence of intrusion in my account, and this must only be considered a clerical or transcribing error. Everything I have told you and anyone has been the complete truth and nothing more. I request that you retract any statements I have made which may possibly have implied an intrusion or any untruthfulness on my part. I am proud of my record and must insist on the highest integrity in any public reports concerning me.

I should be most appreciate{sic} if you would take the necessary steps to correct the records in this respect.

Yours truly,
