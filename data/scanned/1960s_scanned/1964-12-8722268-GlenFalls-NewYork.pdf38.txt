Lived in Knoxville, at 2100 Wayne Street, home of a General Motors family radio member. We had a medium-sized dog which was afraid of the object. It stood on 4 legs and was a whitish grayish color. It had no visible seams or openings. It made no noise and left no trail or exhaust. My wife and I both saw the object.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
Shortly after the sighting in 1964- I reported it to the air force. But it was not until a few days later that a representative came to talk to me about it.
