AFR 200-2

a. Air Defense: The great majority of flying objects reported through ordinary channels turn out to be familiar objects or natural phenomena. However, some are unusual and may be hostile or new foreign air vehicles of unknown origin. It is important to identify them as soon as possible.

b. Technical and Scientific: The Air Force will continue to collect and analyze reports of UFO's that are scientifically unexplained, as distinguished from those that have been explained. In performing this task the following factors are of great importance:

(1) To measure scientific advances, the Air Force must be aware of the latest experimental and operational data on foreign air vehicles or weapons.

(2) The possibility exists that foreign countries may develop air vehicles or revolutionary weapons.

(3) There is need for further scientific knowledge that may be gained from the study and analysis of UFO's and similar aerial phenomena.

(4) The reporting of all pertinent factors concerning UFO's will permit a direct bearing on scientific analysis and a reduction of percentage of "unidentified" Air Force sightings.

3. Responsibilities:
a. Reporting: Base commanders will report all information and evidence of sightings in accordance with the provisions of this directive to Headquarters USAF (AFOIN).
