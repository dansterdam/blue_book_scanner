Dear Dr. Hynek,

I received the attached letter from a couple of days ago. I wish that you could have a look at this case. I don't know if you are checking on the Air Force concerning a recent sighting. You might tell them that we can't analyze because of publicity which would make the investigation and analysis more difficult.

Again, there is no hurry on this, however, give the man a call as soon as you have time.

Sincerely,

(SIGNATURE)
