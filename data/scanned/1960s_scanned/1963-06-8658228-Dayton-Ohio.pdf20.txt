There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with handwritten responses to various questions about an unidentified object or phenomena.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path of the object or at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

From northeast to southwest straight line, no such course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? 

Somewhat larger than ordinary star.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a pencil or stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the pencil or stick is covered by the object. If you had performed this experiment at the time, what would have been the result?

Some would have been covered complete, others would have shown around the edges.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Only when passing behind clouds.

24. In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
