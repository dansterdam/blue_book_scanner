There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

Very rough - 2 min observed s/y
Very sharp appear no more at time behind and quickly disappeared
Moved from u.6 e. Passed below
the plane coming at it leveling
8p.m.
