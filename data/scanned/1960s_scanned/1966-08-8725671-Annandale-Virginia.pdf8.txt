I TALKED TO PR. GEO COUNTY POLICE SEVERAL TIRES AND STATE POLICE THREE TIRKS AND THEIR UNITS WERE ALL REPORTING SIGHTINGS. CHECKED RADAR AND WAS TOLD THAT NOTHING APPEARED PAGE 4 RUEBEAA7798 UNCIAS ON RADAR SCREENS. I DID SEE A SATELLITE WHICH CHECKED OUT WITH THE SATELLITE TRACKING REPORT. THAT IS THE ONLY THING I SAW. SOMEHOW A RUMOR WAS STARTED THAT ANDREWS WAS SENDING OUT A PLANE TO CHECK ON THESE OBJECTS. STATE POLICE CALLED ME TO CONFIRM THAT AND I INFORMED THEM THAT NO SUCH ACTION HAD TAKEN PLACE TO MY KNOWLEDGE. SIGNED ARC ALERT J. GRAY.
