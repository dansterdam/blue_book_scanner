SIGHTING ACCOUNT
His children called him to the bright "object" in the West during an established duration of 5 minutes. This turned out to be a silvery-metallic spherical object of about 6-650 feet and seemed to float or hover and then vanished somewhere. The "object" appeared spherical through 7x50 binoculars.
Note: Mr. [Redacted] compared his sighting to a similar sighting by himself and another witness on 3/5 that had an estimated altitude of 2000 feet.
SKETCH OF UFO(S)
REMARKS
Mr. [Redacted] confessed to me that he had just finished reading the book "Incident at Exeter" and was quite excited about his "UFO fighting" during a power blackout. The first sighting was not contained enough data to make it an unknown. It most likely was an aircraft. It would seem that Mr. Sprinklestein's fighting were influenced by the UFO book, a certain imagination.
