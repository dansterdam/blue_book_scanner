The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a scanned document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text from the document:

about Mr. just a second, the co-pilat. He gave just one paragraph here. One thing that interested me was "I thought we were close to the warning zone and had caught a sidewinder. I was ready to meet the Lord, it didn't make any difference, but it sure scared me." How did he sound in comparison to Mr. 

** Well, I got him on the line at the end of the conversation with Mr. primarily just to thank him and see if he had anything to add, but he was very definite. He was, in terms of conversation, he was more definite than Mr. was more collected and cool, and was aware of what was going on. Mr. was a little high strung about it, I think.

" Yes, I would gather that from his statement here, "getting ready to meet the Lord," and so forth.

** The comments that he made were rather excited and he was trying to get the idea across that they did see something and it wasn't something they were playing around with, and they, when they saw it they tried their best to observe it and find out what it was and try and decide what was going on. This warning area he refers to is a typical military warning area out over the water there, that sometimes we do have firings in and stuff. There's quite a few jets out flying in that area; there's restricted altitudes and everything that they work out there, and normally whenever they're out in that area there's quite a few different involved, and the civilian pilots try and avoid these areas absolutely.

" Well, I want to thank you very much for this information. It clears up the thing up. It gives me a clearer picture, but it doesn't clear it up.
