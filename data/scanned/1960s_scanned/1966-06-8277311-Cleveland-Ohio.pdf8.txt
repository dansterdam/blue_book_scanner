35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I was watching television at approximately 11:45 PM on 6 June 1966 when I noticed a bright light through the window. I went outside to observe it and saw what appeared to be an orange-red, glowing object, round in shape, moving slowly and silently across the sky. The object was estimated to be about 2 feet in diameter and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 500 to 1000 feet. It moved across the sky for about 2-3 minutes before disappearing behind some trees. The object did not make any sound and did not change in brightness or size during the observation. I have no idea what this object was, but it was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known aircraft. I am a 38-year-old male with average vision and was in good physical condition at the time of the observation.
