appeared in 1962, its second edition in 1965. The first edition was revised by the author, translated by Paula Fern, annotated by the U.S. astronomer C. Sagan, and published in the U.S. in 1966 as "Intelligent Life in the Universe" by I. S. Shklovskiy and C. Sagan.

With the First Conference on "Extraterrestrial Civilizations" (Byurakan Observatory, May 20-23, 1964) which included all the leaders in radio astronomy and some optical astronomers, the problem can be said to have obtained the official recognition of the Soviet Union.

Before proceeding to the details of Soviet schemes for the establishment of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations it is important to realize that the whole problem hinges on the answers to three general questions:
(1) What is the origin of the solar system? Without knowing this answer it is not possible to decide whether planets are rare or common around the stars.
(2) What is the nature of life?
(3) What is the origin of life on the surface of the earth?

In spite of a very large amount of work, both East and West, no definite answers to these questions are available. We have to fall back on vague arguments such as "with so many stars some of them must have planets with life."
