There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Performing OCR (optical character recognition) on the text:

Exciting experience last night. We have about 50 or more in our family. The night around 8:00 six of these little objects came out in the sky we saw them come in the same way go in the same way. But some of the people I told about it, said I should tell you.

Do you know it?

It might have been part of the Condon rocket booster reentry on that date. They are said to have taken back any reports of it to avoid people getting excited about it. They never admit anything.
