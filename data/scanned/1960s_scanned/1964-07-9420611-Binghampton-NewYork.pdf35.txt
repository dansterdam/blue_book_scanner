AIR BASE OFFICIALS SAID NO LIGHT ON SKY OBJECTS LIT

Reports of strange sky phenomena continued to pour in today from children and adults throughout Onondaga County. On the 10th some 15 telephone calls were received by the press, reporting some unusual sky happenings.
Officials at both Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, and Hancock Field in Syracuse, said today that they could throw no light on any of the reports or recent days.
Full J. BURLINGHAM, chairman of the Observing Section of the Astronomical Society of Onondaga County, made observations last night from his home in Jamesville. He said that he would identify what of the objects that were reported if they were seen again.
"At about 9:40 p.m., I saw a yellowish object move from the west to the southwest through my telescope. It seemed to be moving rapidly". If was the only object I could see, he said.
Mr. Burlingham said that he was using a 17-power eyepiece in his telescope.
Mr. Buddin also said that some of the happenings that might have seemed spectacular were in fact, natural phenomena. For instance, he said, there was a flight sighting at 10:35 p.m. with bright yellow lights, two objects crossing the sky at 10:13 p.m., and both I and Radio II.
A Murray Schoell was said to have been awakened from sleep last night upon hearing a rumbling south last night having northward. "All of a sudden it stopped," he said, and moved into a fixed position relative to the trees, remaining there for three hours.
He said that the object which he described as "multicolored-changing from red to white with a roundish tint to it" never left its position.
