The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a point labeled "A" and another point labeled "B" to depict how high an object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and how high the object was above the horizon when the observer last saw it.

The second and third sketches are larger and show landscape scenes. The second sketch depicts a road leading to a mountain range in the distance, with a person silhouetted in the foreground. The third sketch shows a landscape with hills or mountains in the distance.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. 

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
