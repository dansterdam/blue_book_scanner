PROJECT 10073 RECORD

The report describes an observation of a greenish-white object which was visible for several seconds. The pilot initially thought it was a meteorite but later concluded it must have been much larger and at a lower altitude. The object apparently exploded into several pieces. The report concludes that this object was a large fireball, likely a satellite re-entry, which is consistent with various organizations' assessments.
