Gentlemen:

I was informed to furnish what I will give up - some observed two unexplained objects hovering a B-52 or over the airman at 0:52, Oct. 12.

The object appeared to be about 30 - 40 feet in diameter and maneuvered around the aircraft in a manner similar to the way of a Cario. It was pure white against a clear sky.

The maneuvering came in close enough to the pilot and trainee who were making a night flight. It continued full of space, seemingly standing on its dead, and now and then circling around the aircraft, continuing in the same maneuver. At one point i t appeared to be in front of the aircraft while the maneuver was in progress, and then seemed to disappear as if it had fallen below the flight path of the aircraft.

Believing the group was the general superintendent, for the superintendent and three workmen were all of whom are in the employ of A. E. Jarrell & Sons of Salisbury, N.C., Roebuck, Contractor.
