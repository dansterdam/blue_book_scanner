June 8, 1966 Spooner, Wisconsin
Sirs:  Sears 6-1966 appear 5:55 P.M. Over Spooner, Wis. I live close to town - on West side - When I walked out to the area where I park my car about 5:55 P.M. I saw a strange flying object move over town.

It moved very swiftly, moving at an angle, moving over the center of town, I noticed it was silvery in color and oblong in shape. It did not make a sound and as I watched it moved away towards the northwest and completely disappeared. The flight path was from the southeast to the northwest. The object moved very steadily and quietly, at an angle. It did not hover or make any sharp turns. It just moved swiftly and quietly across the sky and out of sight.

I have no other details to report. I did not have time to get binoculars or camera. I was very surprised and excited at seeing this strange object. It was very real and not any type aircraft I have ever seen before.

WISE.
