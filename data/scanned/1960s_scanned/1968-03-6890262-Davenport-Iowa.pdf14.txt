The image appears to be a photographic print from an old UFO report document. It shows a mostly blank, white area with some scattered dark specks or anomalies. On the right side, there is a distinct darker vertical shape, which could potentially be a UFO or some other unidentified object. However, the quality of the image is quite poor and does not allow for clear identification of any specific object.
