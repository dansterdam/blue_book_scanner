The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed letter on HEADQUARTERS: UNITED STATES AIRFORCE letterhead dated July 20, 1965. The letter describes a 35mm color slide of an "unidentified flying object" that the sender has in their possession and believes may be of interest to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who is investigating such phenomena. The letter asks that the sender be informed of the address where the slide can be sent to Dr. Hynek.

HEADQUARTERS:
UNITED STATES AIRFORCE
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen,
   Change has put me in possession of what I believe to
be a very fine, 35mm, color slide showing a presumably
unidentified flying object.
   The phenomenon is perfectly spherical, very luminescent,
and obviously in horizontal movement. It is surrounded by a
purple halo or aura ( probably compressed atmosphere ).
   It quite accidentally showed up in a picture I took 
( may 30 ) for the Belmont Village at the New York World's
Fair, and the object was not apparent to the naked eye at
the time.
   I understand from Newsday, a Long Island Daily, that
you have a Dr. J. Allen Hynek investigating such phenomenaIf you think it may possibly be of interest to him and will
inform me at what address he can be reached, I'll be glad
to send the picture to him.

                         Very truly yours,
                         [signature redacted]
                         Hempstead, N.Y.
