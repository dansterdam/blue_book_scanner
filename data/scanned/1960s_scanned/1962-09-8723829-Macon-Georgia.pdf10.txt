Our airman is not on pass or pass a wild stagg and
stopped out in his autom-obile near the airport as he was
returning home about 11:30 pm at night. On his return trip
home he noticed a bright light in the sky. Upon further
observation he said it seemed to be hovering and rotating
vertically. He said the object appeared to suddenly
accelerate and disappear out of sight in a north-east
direction. The airman is a CAT - RCS member and a
dedicated officer. He seemed quite sincere in his
observation and report.
