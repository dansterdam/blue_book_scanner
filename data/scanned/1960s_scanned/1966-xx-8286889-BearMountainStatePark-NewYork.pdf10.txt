The image appears to be a letter on Northwestern University letterhead from the Department of Astronomy. The letter discusses the evaluation of UFO sightings and mentions that no photograph is included. As an OCR system, I will output the full text of the letter as follows:

Dear Major Quintanilla: 

On personnel only: I find no substantiation for the evaluation of BCAK, particularly in view of the photo-analysis report, No. 67-16, dated 20 September 1967, which indicates that the UFO photographs do not show the object. The motion is regarded as double exposure and/or retouching. The photographs appear to show indirect lighting, not a primary source, which does not constitute sufficient reason to believe that a hover duration of the unidentified object does not constitute sufficient reason to believe that a hover duration of the unidentified object of the magnitude considered has occurred.

After examination of the print by myself and by Mr. George C. Valley, we feel that the negative should be requested for further examination. Mr. Valley is a qualified photo-analyst, disagrees with the photo analysis presented in the report. It will be noted, from the print, that the focus is soft in the central portion of the picture, an indication that the distance only cannot be reliably estimated. Consequently no judgment can be made as to the real size of the object, if this judgment is based solely on this quality of focus.

My recommendation is, therefore, that the evaluation by changed from "not substantiated" to "inconclusive".

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
