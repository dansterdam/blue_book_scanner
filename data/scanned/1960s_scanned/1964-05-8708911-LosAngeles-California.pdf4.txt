Transcribing the text:

I investigated the sighting in preparation for the report, and I have never seen a plane, star, or any thing flying in my mind because I was so afraid that the sound seemed to awain from me.

Dear alone, and his mother, a lot little known from Seattle, case you have a completely reported sighting, it is my choice. Respect fully.
