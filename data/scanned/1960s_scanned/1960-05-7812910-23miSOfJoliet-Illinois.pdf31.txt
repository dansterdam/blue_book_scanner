Dear Sir:

Your office has been very helpful in the past and so I wonder if you could answer this question for us. As you know, we missed or rocked to launched down the Atlantic Missile Range April 11, 1960, between 6:50 and 7:20 p.m.

I am trying to account for a flurry of UFO sightings that occurred in NE Brazil at that time.

Many thanks.

Very truly yours,
