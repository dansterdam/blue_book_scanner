This image appears to contain a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page includes an illustration with instructions for marking the position and movement of a UFO sighting. There is also a compass rose illustration and handwritten text describing the reported sighting.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "X" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object. 

20. Draw a figure of the path a that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

NORTH TO SOUTH. ACROSS AS NOTED ABOVE. ASTOUNDING PATTERN.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
