Dear [redacted],

In regards to your reply to my letter of Jan. 24 concerning the UFO sighted by my brother and his cousin. He does not have the negative, but does have the original print. He also says he is now willing to cooperate fully in this matter and will try to answer any questions that you may have. His name and address are [redacted].

Sincerely,
[redacted]
