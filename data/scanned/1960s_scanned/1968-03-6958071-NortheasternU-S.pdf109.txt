Subj: UFO Sighting on 3 March 1968

Called Watertown AFS (Called Camp Drum A.V. 552-1605 and asked for Watertown) and spoke to Lt. Travelini. I asked him to contact local and state police in the area and also airports and see if they had any reports of anyone hearing or seeing anything strange or unusual on the evening of 3 March. He asked me to call him back tomorrow morning to get the information. Called Lt. Traveline at 0920 on 13 March again.
He checked the Watertown Airport, Ogdensburg Airport, state and city police at Watertown and also Camp Drum. No reports of anyone having seen anything or of having heard a sonic boom, thunderclap, or swishing noise. Said he might have a report at Veeseey. He will get more information on it. If it is a report for 3 March approximately 1000pm, he will call us. Otherwise, he will not bother to call.
Note: On 3 March during the evening the weather was a "little foggy."
