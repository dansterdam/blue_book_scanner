There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document describing an investigation.

INVESTIGATION:

I contacted Mr. [NAME REDACTED], Texas, by telephone at 0545 hours, 6 Feb 1966.

The following is a description of the events as they happened and as described by Mr. [NAME REDACTED]:

On Sunday morning, 6 February 1966, at approximately 0545, Mr. [NAME REDACTED], 11 year old son came through their bedroom on the way to the bathroom and woke up his parents. He pointed out that he could see/notice his parent's bedroom light on from their bed and asked them to get out of bed and look out the window to see if the street lights were also on. 

Mr. [NAME REDACTED] did so and was amazed to find that the lamp in front of his house and the surrounding area was illuminated although it was still dark outside. He then noticed that there were no cars in the area. A few moments later he noticed some peculiar yellowish-reddish lights coming from an object approximately 500 feet above the ground. The lights seemed to be moving back and forth in a horizontal direction and suddenly appeared to be moving quite rapidly in a diagonal direction and in a slow rate of climb. Mr. [NAME REDACTED] observed all of this with his naked eye.

Although Mr. [NAME REDACTED] was very fearful of ridicule from the local populace, he nevertheless had an opportunity to discuss the power failure with a local man who was the power company and determined that the reason for the power outage was that the transformer was located very near to his house and that the failure occurred.
