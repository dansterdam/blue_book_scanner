Yes, I'll be happy to.

Hynek: Can you speak up a little louder because I can hardly hear you. Now, let's see, did that object make any noise?

Hynek: Yes, it did. First, it sounded like a helicopter approaching.

Hynek: I think it was altogether about five minutes.

Hynek: The sound - uh huh.

Hynek: And was there any time it didn't have the sound?

Hynek: After a while, the helicopter sound turned into more of a whine.

Hynek: So, it was noisy all the time?

Hynek: Yes, sir.

Hynek: Now - he seemed to indicate that it was noisy for only about 30 seconds. Then, he didn't make any noise. 

Well, I heard it longer than that for sure. I believe I heard it for a good while.

Hynek: How did you first happen to see it?

Hynek: Did he looked scared?

Hynek: Yeah, he was scared, he was real scared. That's the reason he was scared about.

Hynek: Well, tell you what, let's do it this way. Let's take it from the point where you first happened to see it and you tell me in your own words just how it happened.

After he saw it?

Hynek: Yes. And after you saw it - first then.

Well, I popped out and he headed for back of the barn. I just happened to glance up at that direction and I seen the object.

Hynek: I thought maybe at first it was just an airplane. I didn't know. I was shocked, too. I didn't know what it was.

Hynek: Well, I think it was. Yeah, I know it was. Okay, I am not questioning you. I just want to get a description. Now let's get at how big it seemed to be. How did it compare in size to the full moon?
