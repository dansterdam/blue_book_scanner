At this point there seems to be no confirmation for me to gat a location or basis of this report. The observation was on the morning but this is only referred to but not substantially described. The witness gives some general information as to what was seen but does not offer any precise or specific details. If you can furnish any information as to what, if any, investigative action is required an appropriate response would be appreciated.
