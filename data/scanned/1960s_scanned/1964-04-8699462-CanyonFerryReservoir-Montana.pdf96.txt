Dear Major:

This is in answer to your letter of 18 February 1965, in which you suggest that I make a visit to Albuquerque for scientific discussions with Dr. La Garde and to visit the observatory at Las Cruces, New Mexico. Although you did not mention it specifically, since Socorro, New Mexico is between these two locations, I think it would be profitable if I could include a stop there and have a chance to examine the films were made, the local public reaction to them, and in particular, Zamora's presents situation.

Since I am not teaching classes this winter quarter, and will not until April 1, 1965, this is a propitious time to make the trip and I shall prepare to do immediately. I would be glad enough to request the necessary clearances.  I will plan to leave this next week, even though formal approval has perhaps not come through by that time.

I can be reached in New Mexico either through [redacted] at Albuquerque, or in care of Mr. [redacted] at Las Cruces, New Mexico. Upon my return, or sooner if I deem it necessary, I will submit a report to you in detail concerning my findings.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
