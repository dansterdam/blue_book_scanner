Extracted text from the document:

"A description of coming toward you when in reality it was stationary. When the object first appeared, the light now had a constant variation in intensity that seemed to be coming from the object. The light would vary in intensity from a bright orange glow to a dull red and the decreased intensity was noticeable even from a distance of your eye to the object. There were no blinking or flashing lights on the object and there was no noise associated with the object. A.E.C. believes that the flashing was not produced by the object itself but rather by natural conditions. A.30. The illumination of the lights occurred within seconds and remained constant for the duration of the observation which was 15-20 minutes. During this time, the lights did not appear to be connected to any solid structure but rather gave the impression of a very luminous gas or vapor. A.31. The amount of light emitted was tremendous and came up by an increase in its thickness just about as observed (increase in brightness is the amount of for and an increase in its thickness just about as observed [increase in brightness is in the amount of for and an increase in its thickness lust for a brief time). Weather conditions were discussed at length with Major Hill, who verified that the observation was made under near ideal conditions for such an event to occur.

In addition to the weather conditions and location of the event, the following details are in accord with this theory:

1. Patch of light conforming with the opening in the road.
2. Brief duration of sighting.
3. Light colored (a light colored gravel which would produce a light color when illuminated.
4. Height and distance consistent with the terrain."
