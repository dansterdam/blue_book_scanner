TYNDALL AFB, FLORIDA
A CASE HISTORY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC EFFECTS IN THE VICINITY OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
8 MAY 1961
AERIAL OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, 6 MAY 1961
LOCATION: APALACHICOLA BAY, FLORIDA
1. At approximately 2230 hours, 6 May 1961, the pilot and navigator of a T-33 aircraft, assigned to the 3904th Combat Crew Training Squadron at Tyndall AFB, Florida, reported observing an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the vicinity of Apalachicola Bay, Florida.
2. The pilot, 1Lt XXXXX, and the navigator, 1Lt XXXXX, were on a routine navigation mission at approximately 20,000 feet altitude when they first spotted the UFO. The object was circular in shape, extremely bright, and appeared to be surrounded by a halo of light. It was observed to be brighter than the nearby full moon. The object was estimated to be at approximately 10,000 feet in altitude and approximately 5 to 10 miles distant from the aircraft.
3. The pilots stated that as they approached the object, their aircraft's electronic equipment malfunctioned. The navigational and communication radios became inoperative, and the aircraft's magnetic compass became erratic and unusable. The pilots attempted to close in on the object, but as they approached, the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight, heading in a southerly direction.
4. After the object disappeared, the aircraft's electronic equipment returned to normal operation. The pilots reported the incident to Tyndall AFB air traffic control upon their return to the base.
