MEMO FOR THE RECORD
3 November 1968
Talked to Mr. Goff, TDPA, who is quite familiar with air-borne radars. Mr. Goff said that from the evidence available at this time it would appear to him that the sightings have been precipitated by some type of ionized air plasma similar to ball lightning. He felt that a plasma could account for the radar blips, loss of transmission and some of the visual sightings. The entry of the missile site is being investigated by local authorities and with the information at our disposal at this time no explanation is referred.
