Background information on UFO sighting by Mrs.   
A study of the subjective information submitted did not reveal the actual stimulus for the observation. Due to the late receipt of the information, it is not possible, at this time, to make a comprehensive investigation of air activity since records are normally destroyed three months after their utilization. In addition, the lack of a specific date prevents a meaningful check of satellite schedules.
No direct correlation can be established between the sighting sound and the observation of the alleged UFO. 
We are not in a position to advise [redacted] on shooting a UFO; however, it would be wise for him to consult law enforcement officers before taking such action. It should be pointed out that many UFOs have been determined to be aircraft, and there is a federal law against firing at aircraft.
The handwritten note at the bottom reads "Draft For L+L - We WOuld Dr Good 100 Watt Gas Plus 130 Jan Xtr - Presidenital."
