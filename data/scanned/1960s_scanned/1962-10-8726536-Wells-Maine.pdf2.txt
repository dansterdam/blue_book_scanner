Departmental of the Air Force 
Headquarters Flying Object Division
Washington 25, D.C.

Date: 20 October 1962
On the evening of October 20th, at approximately 11:30 p.m., a man following a woods road change a small object in flight; a witness was also within a few hundred feet, he told me this morning, of the object as it hovered over a field. The object was described first as a luminous cloud or fog some 30 to 40 feet in diameter, rapidly moving and silent. This object slowed down, hovered, and then shot off at tremendous speed, disappearing in the distance. The witness was terrified, his wife awakened upon his return and found him shocked, bewildered, and reluctant to tell her what he had seen. He then reported the incident to the Air Force Base for investigation. Preliminary interviews of the witness indicate a credible report. The object appeared to be, in some manner, controlled or guided, and its power source and manner of propulsion remain unexplained. I will maintain contact with this witness and continue to investigate this sighting.
