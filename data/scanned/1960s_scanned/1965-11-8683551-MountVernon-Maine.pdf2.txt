Gentlemen:

I had what was without doubt the most strange sighting I have ever witnessed. That night, around 8:15 my only son and I were driving home from work when a strange light, bright green, mixed white, appeared suddenly. The object moved rapidly and fell into an area near us. Fearing what the could be, we immediately stopped the car and took a closer look. Since I have seen and experienced other such incidents I try never to falsely report what I do not know for sure, but there was no mistaking what we saw.

The object remained with us for several minutes and during this time my son and I observed it closely. It had a definite shape, appeared to be oval-shaped, and seemed to be composed of some kind of metallic material. As it rested on the ground, it gave off a intense glow, approximately 20 feet in diameter, and about 10 feet in height. The awesome sight put both of us into a state of shock and we simply sat there unable to move, staring at the phenomenon.

After several minutes, the object began to rise slowly from the ground. As it gained altitude it decreased in size. Finally, after reaching an altitude of about 500 feet, it accelerated at a fantastic speed and disappeared from sight.

If there is any interest from your department for a further report, please advise.

Sincerely,
