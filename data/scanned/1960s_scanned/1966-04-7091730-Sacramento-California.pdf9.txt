The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report documenting a conversation about UFO sightings and investigations.

Conversation of 23 Jul 66 with Masher AFP, California, - Base Ops, HRI: BALL revealed that the dispatcher at Masther had received numerous UFO reports during March, April, May in the early morning hours with the same description. Investigation found fuel testing in Nevada. Looked like it went down into the fuel storage area. Went behind the mountains, gave this type of appearance. The fuel testing was being done at Jack Ass Flats, Nevada. Happened almost every morning during March, April and May. When Mrs. Hall finds the name of the personnel or company who were doing the testing she will send the address to us on a buckslip.

Mrs. Hall checked with the fire dispatcher and they had no fires in that area reported by Mrs. Miller on either the 29 - 30 April 1966.

Jackson Flats is a nickname and is approximately 550 miles East of Masher AFS. A large restricted area southeast of Tonopah, Nevada. They had no way of knowing if whether the testing was being done on the ground or by aircraft dropping fuel. Dispatcher did not know who informed him of the fuel testing.
