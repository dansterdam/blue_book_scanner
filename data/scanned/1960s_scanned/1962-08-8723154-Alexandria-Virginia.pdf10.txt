The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows the horizon (skyline) and instructs the viewer to place an "A" on the point where the object was sighted and a "B" on the point where the object was last seen. The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a person standing in the foreground.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon (skyline) where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to indicate this.
