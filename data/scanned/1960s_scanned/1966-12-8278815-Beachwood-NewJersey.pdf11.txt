The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a UFO report, with handwritten text.

The text in the document says:

"The first one, that was flashing, moved out about around static after that. It moved the other then the set for two. I saw the move that was flashing, came from the same spot into the sky."
