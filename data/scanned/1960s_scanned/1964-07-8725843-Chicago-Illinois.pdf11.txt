DEAR SIR:
AT APPROXIMATELY SEVEN P.M. ON THURSDAY NIGHT, JULY 16, WHILE LYING ON MY BACK AS DIRECTED BY SEARCH AND RESCUE AGENCY PERSONNEL, I OBSERVED A LUMINOUS OBJECT MOVING IN THE SKY. ALMOST A LITTLE HAZY AND SLIGHTLY SOUTH (ABOUT 30 DEGREES BOTH WAYS) THERE APPEARED A BRIGHTER SPHERICAL FORM A SIMILAR TO SOMEWHAT SMALLER IN SIZE TO THE TAIL OF A COMET IN ORBIT AND MOVING AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED. THE LIGHT WAS WARM AND THE SKY WAS FAIRLY HAZY, BUT THERE WERE NO VISIBLE CLOUDS, AND THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME MOTION. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MUCH LOWER THAN THE STARS, ALTHOUGH ONLY SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE BRIGHTER ONES AND MORE LUMINOUS THAN ANY. ITS ORBIT OR COURSE SEEMED LOWER THAN THAT OF THE SATELLITE, AS THOUGH APPROACHING. STILL BELIEVING IT WAS A SATELLITE.
I MENTIONED THIS TO A FRIEND NEARBY WHO GRADUALLY IT BEGAN TO CHANGE ORBIT AND APPARENT SPEED. THE ORBIT BECAME MORE ERRATIC AS WE WATCHED AND SLOWER TO THE POINT OF STOPPING. ALSO, THE INTENSITY OF THE OBJECTS LIGHT WAS A BRIGHT YELLOW--WHITE AT FIRST, CHANGED TO A DIMMER, MORE BLUISH GLOW AND DIMINISHING IN SIZE. THE CHILDREN OBSERVED IT, AND THEY TOO WATCHED ITS DIRECTION CHANGES; IT DID NOT REVERSE BUT WENT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT WHILE IT CONTINUED ITS ERRATIC COURSE. THE INITIAL FAST-HORIZONTAL WAS DIRECTION TO ALMOST DUE NORTH AND THEN SLOWLY MOVED EAST. ALL OF THIS SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES.
