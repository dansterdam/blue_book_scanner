TIME OF THE SIGHTING WAS COINCIDENT WITH THAT OF THE STAR.
PART TWO. THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SIGHTING WAS A STAR IS FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTS. THE OBJECT WAS IN THE FIELD OF THE TRACKING UNIT APPROXIMATELY FOUR SECONDS. MOVING GENERALLY VERTICAL. THE DIMENSION OF THE FIELD IN THIS DIRECTION WAS APPROXIMATELY 1/4" AND THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE TELESCOPE IN THE VERTICAL PLANE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING WAS APPROXIMATELY .02" PER SECOND. A RELATIVE STATIONARY OBJECT WOULD THEN REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 4 SECONDS TO PASS THROUGH THE FIELD. THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE TRACKING TELESCOPE IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE WAS NEGLIGIBLE.
PART THREE. THE PROBABLE REASON WHY THIS PHENOMENA WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED BY MANY PERSONNEL IS DUE TO THE IMPROBABILITY OF IT OCCURRING. FOR THIS PHENOMENA TO TAKE PLACE THE TRACKING UNIT MUST HAVE A LOW ANGULAR RATE DURING THE PERIOD THE 1/16 SQUARE DEGREE FIELD OF VIEW IS COINCIDENT WITH A STAR. THE PROBABILITY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY IS SUBSTANTIATED BY THE FACTS THAT THE DENSITY OF STARS WHICH CAN BE VIEWED WITH THE 60 TRACKING TELESCOPE IS WELL BELOW ONE PER 1/16 SQUARE DEGREE AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOCATION OF THE LAUNCHING PAD AND THE TRACKING STATION PLUS MISSILE VELOCITIES USUALLY REQUIRES TRACKING EQUIPMENT TO OPERATE AT HIGH ANGULAR RATES.
