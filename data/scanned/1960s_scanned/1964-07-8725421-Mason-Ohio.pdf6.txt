September 2, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference is made to a report of an unidentified flying object made by you and firm [redacted] on August 28, 1964. The object observed is described as being disc-shaped, with an estimated size of 40-50 feet in diameter. The duration of the sighting was approximately 2 minutes.

While the duration of the sighting was not a brief one, the speed of this object was not exceptional. During the final portion of the sighting, the object appeared to accelerate and then disappeared.

Thank you for reporting this observation to Air Force.

Sincerely,
