Transcribing the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Answer: The object didn't disappear, it just got smaller and smaller and went out of sight.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
Answer: No

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
Answer: No

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - It didn't make any sound
b. Color - It was white or silver, didn't change color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note, how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. This will give the angular size. How much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Answer: The object was small enough to be covered by a 1/2 inch match stick held at arm's length. The match stick covered about 1/4 of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
The sketch shows an oval-shaped object with a trail behind it, moving in the direction of the arrow.
