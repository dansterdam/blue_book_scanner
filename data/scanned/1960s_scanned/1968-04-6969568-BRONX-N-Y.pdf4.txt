On the date of April 12, 1967, a strange object was seen to descend from the sky to within 350 feet of the ground near Riverdale, West Bronx, N.Y. The object was about 50 feet in diameter, described as a bright light or flame colored, giving off a bluish-white glow. It was silent in its descent and started an erratic flight back up. The object was first noticed at 9:15 P.M. and was observed for about 3 minutes. After it ascended out of sight, there was a sound resembling the roar of a jet passing overhead.

On the date of February 12, 1963, at 3:30 P.M. a similar object was sighted near the same location. This object was observed for about 5 minutes. It also made an erratic flight pattern and was followed by the sound of a jet. The witness, a housewife, was alone and lives in the area. There are no air bases or airports in the immediate vicinity. The witness appears to be reliable, and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the report.
