The image provided does not contain any photographs. Instead, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that includes two sketch-like illustrations.

The top illustration depicts a shadowy figure or silhouette of what looks like a person standing near some structures or poles. The bottom illustration shows a figure standing in front of a rectangular shape, possibly a screen or display.

The text at the bottom of the page reads "Photo 2 of 4" and "Plate 4-5".
