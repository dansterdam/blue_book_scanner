CONCLUSIONS
The points B and C on the map are located at the bottom of a wooded out curve. A road passes through the ground around the points at about 30 degrees at most to the level on which the points 
are located. The trees at point B are about 10 feet beyond the street and about 30 feet from the nearest house. The field was about 100 yards in width (east to west). 
There were also some bare trees in the road position (indicated by the across the street from B.
I could find no indication in the area to which the phenomenon could be attributed.
I checked Mrs. - and she did not know of anyone who would be expected in the vicinity. The windshield is set at a 45 degree angle.
The car is not completely soundproof. An airplane motor could not be heard.
Two other facts may have some bearing on the incident: 
1) Some mail in the Naperville area is delivered by helicopter.
2) Mrs. - and the impression after she entered the car and turned the corners at C, heading east. Mrs. - had recollection of this.
There was a report of a similar object seen by a couple in Lisle on the same night. This incident was reported in the Naperville Meadows on the Clark Thursday evening after the sighting.
Mr. - had a letter addressed to the editor of the Naperville Sun from a - resident of Clayton, Georgia, who was apparently in communication with the witness.
