September 15, 1966

Dear Mr. Greilsam,

I am very sorry to bother you again, but several other witnesses and I still feel that the sighting we had on the night of September 2 is worthy of further investigation.

There really is illuminating information which I think ought to be recorded. For instance, of those of us who were present, Mr. Greilsam was the only one who did not see the strange object we all observed. This is very peculiar, and I would like to know if there is any explanation for it. Also, there were certain details of the incident which were not brought out in the original report, and which I feel should be included.

Mr. Greilsam, I don't assume that you or anyone else should be alarmed by this request, but I do feel you would want to have as complete and accurate a record as possible of the things we have witnessed.

Please give this your consideration.

Sincerely and incuiringly,
