The object would never last for as much as a minute at a time, then would move several miles away as fast as the eye could follow, and hover motionless again.
The observers said they appeared to be about the size of an airplane, except for a flashing tail. There was no noise.
Shortly before 9 p.m. all objects disappeared, the hovering pair near northern Columbus appeared to simply extinguish themselves like candle flames.
The pair of objects south of Columbus disappeared to the east, slowly at first, then vanished almost instantaneously in a burst of speed.
Both Lockbourne officials and Port Columbus tower spokesmen denied reports of UFO sightings or radar identification of any such vehicles.
The Lockbourne base officials Wednesday said the call from the sheriff's office was the only report they had of the incident. They said officials of Project Blue Book (which checks UFO reports) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, were notified immediately and a formal report was sent to them Wednesday.
The Lockbourne spokesman said if aircraft were observed to investigate the sight, they would have been sent from Dayton on Wright-Patterson orders.
