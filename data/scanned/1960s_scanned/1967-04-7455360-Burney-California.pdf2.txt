The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing an observation of a moving object at an altitude of roughly 8000 feet near Lassen Peak.

Observations: The object was seen moving Northerly at an altitude of roughly 8000 feet, near Lassen peak. Close examination of a navigational map of the area revealed that the radar ray does come close to several points on the terrain, but the Moving-Target-Indicator operates to remove all nonmoving objects and should have had no difficulty in discerning the moving object. If it remained at an altitude of 8000 Feet, the observer would have seen it "rise" above the hills to the south, near Lake Almanor. 

The hills there have an altitude of 6000-7000 Feet. On a straight northerly course, the object would have been visible under ideal conditions until it passed over the hills just south of Klamath Falls. The southern range of hills is about 30 NM from the observer, the northern range about 50 NM from the observer to the north, and also about 20-30 NM from the Klamath Falls airport, the largest one within several hundred miles.

The object was within one hundred miles of this airport at the time the observer lost contact with it, and heading directly for the airport. This fact alone rules out the possibility of a truck being the object sighted, and close scrutiny of the map reveals no roads on which a truck might have been visible to the radar beam at the necessary altitude. The question is left open as to whether the radar will pick up a speed of 20 mph.
