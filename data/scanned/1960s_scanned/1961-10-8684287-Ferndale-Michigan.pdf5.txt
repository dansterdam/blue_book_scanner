DUE TO THE TRAILS BEING IDENTIFIED BY THE CARS OF THE TRAILING VEHICLE SWINGING IN AN APPARENTLY RANDOM MANNER JUST OFF THE CENTER LINE OF THE TRAIL, AND DISTORTION OF THE BODY FORMING THE TRAIL, IT APPEARS PROBABLE THAT THE ENTIRE PHENOMENON WAS CAUSED BY THE SWINGING OR OSCILLATING MOTION OF THE TRAILING VEHICLE AS IT NEGOTIATED THE TURNS IN THE ROAD. THIS PHENOMENON OF THE TRAIL WAS THEREFORE PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE ERRATIC MOTION OF THE TRAILING VEHICLE AND NOT BY ANY UNUSUAL OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL FLYING OBJECT.
