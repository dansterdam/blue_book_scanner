11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED AT APPROXIMATELY 1930Z OVER THE ORLANDO, FLA., AREA. IT WAS FIRST OBSERVED IN AN ELLIPTICAL PATH AT A HIGH ALTITUDE, THEN DESCENDED RAPIDLY AND LEVELED OFF NEAR THE HORIZON. IT WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE A BRIGHT COLOR, POSSIBLY RED, AND FLASHING LIGHTS AROUND THE EDGES. AFTER LEVELING OFF IT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN MOVED ERRATICALLY AT A RAPID SPEED BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THREE DIFFERENT OBSERVERS REPORTED THIS SIGHTING WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. DUE TO THE ERRATIC MOVEMENT AND UNUSUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFY IT AS A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS CONSIDERED THE PROBABLE EXPLANATION.
