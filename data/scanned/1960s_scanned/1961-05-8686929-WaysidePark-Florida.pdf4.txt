2. Description of course of object:
a. The object was first observed at approximately 2315 (CST), 23 May 1961. My wife and I had just returned home from Fort St. Joe. Upon arrival, we decided to look out in the Gulf. She showed me where and it looked like a big blaze quite a distance away. We got in the car and drove toward that as fast as possible. It looked to be about 3 miles away and was hovering. While we were watching it seemed to fly out with a fire as you can see flames shooting up. This was not the case with us, however, as the location, the location, the location. The location was stationary, unusual, and I saw it as far as I know. However, it was possible for someone to see who looked in that direction.
b. Angle or elevation and azimuth of object - Parallel with horizon and in a northwest direction.
