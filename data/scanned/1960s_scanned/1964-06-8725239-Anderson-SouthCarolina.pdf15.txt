There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

This is in reply to your letter in regard to a possible UFO sighting on June 4, 1964. The information you provided indicates that the observed object was not likely an aircraft or spacecraft. The object was apparently a bright red light, partially obscured by haze, that stayed stationary for several minutes before moving away.

The Air Force has thoroughly investigated this incident and concluded that the observed object was likely a celestial body or a known type of aircraft. The object's behavior and appearance do not match the characteristics typically associated with unidentified flying objects.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. The Air Force appreciates citizens reporting potential UFO sightings, as it helps us better understand the nature of such phenomena. However, in this case, the evidence suggests a conventional explanation. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
