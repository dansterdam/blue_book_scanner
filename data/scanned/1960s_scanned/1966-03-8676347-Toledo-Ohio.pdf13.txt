I have worked in a Catholic Parochial School and have had a very interesting and satisfactory work experience. For the past 10 years I have been as a custodian of a Catholic Church. We have raised a family of 6 children, 3 boys and 3 girls, and now have 8 grandchildren. We spend most of our spare time with our family and in pursuits connected with the Church work, such as serving on various Church committees. This sighting on May 9, 1966 at about 8:30 P.M. was the first time I have ever seen anything like this object. I would like very much to know what it was because it seemed so unusual and strange.)
