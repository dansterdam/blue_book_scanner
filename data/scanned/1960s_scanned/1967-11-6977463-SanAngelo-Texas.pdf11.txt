The object appeared bright and maneuverable, it was oval in shape. At first it was about the size of a dime at arm's length, then it seemed to get smaller and then larger again. The object changed direction several times and was very bright, at times it appeared to be the size of a grapefruit at arm's length. After hovering and the object was about one half the size of the original view, it then disappeared.
