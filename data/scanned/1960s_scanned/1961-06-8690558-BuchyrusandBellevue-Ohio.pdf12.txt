OFFICIAL FILE COPY
2 DEC 1961

UFO REPORT (Major Coleman)

1. References the attached copy of a letter to ATIC (FTD) from Miss  who is reporting several UFO's seen by her.

2. The objects sighted were viewed by the witness probably due to atmospheric inversion of Venus. The objects described by Miss  appear to be planets. The sightings themselves are understandable and explainable.

3. The objects sighted by Miss  in her final appearance have been reported to FTD (Aeronautical Intelligence). Identity of this object has been erased; however, it is suspected to be under further investigation.
