OBJECT BEAMED EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT INTO OUR HOUSE THRU OUR WINDOW. WE CALLED TO SOME NEIGHBORS WHO NOTICED MOVEMENT OF SOMETHING HANGING IN AIR OUTSIDE. NEIGHBOR CAME OUT WITH CAMERA BUT OBJECT HAD GONE BY THE TIME HE GOT OUT. WE WATCHED IT AGAIN LATER THAT NIGHT. IT APPEARS THAT OBJECT MADE TWO PASSES, AS IF TO RECONNOITRE OUR HOUSE, THEN LEFT. ON EACH PASS IT BEAMED A BRIGHT LIGHT INTO OUR HOUSE. THEY WERE AMAZED AT THIS DISPLAY. ON THE SECOND SIGHTING THAT NIGHT, IT SEEMED TO HOVER, THEN TOOK OFF AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED TOWARD THE NORTH SKY. I CANNOT SAY FOR SURE WHAT IT WAS, BUT WHATEVER IT WAS, IT ACTED LIKE IT WAS CURIOUS ABOUT OUR HOUSE AND BARGED IN ON US TWICE WITH A BRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT. I AM STILL PUZZLED
ABOUT IT AFTER ALL THIS TIME. WHATEVER IT WAS, IT SEEMED QUITE INTELLIGENT AND PURPOSEFUL IN ITS ACTIONS. WE DID SEE IT ALMOST EVERYNIGHT FOR A WEEK OR TWO, THEN IT WAS GONE. I DID NOT GET ANY GOOD PHOTOS, THOUGH MY NEIGHBOR TRIED.
