The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting several circular objects and a smudged or blacked-out area at the bottom of the frame, which appears to represent something like a vehicle or object. The text appears to be a written description or account related to the image.

Your report requested text extraction, so here is the text from the document:

"...seeing over a hundred particles of light. These particle lights are very small and moving sometimes erratically. To their observation they are guided (controlled) definitely, and (7) objects.

This is the very thing they are apt to call unidentified. 

Yours truly,
Boyertown, Pa."
