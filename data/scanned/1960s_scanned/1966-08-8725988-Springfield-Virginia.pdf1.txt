11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a blue light that moved behind a cloud during the observation. The alleged UFO appeared to make a turn and proceeded in a downward direction.

Dulles International Airport is to the NW of observer, and an aircraft landing on runway 12 could account for the sighting. Report was made by a 5 year old boy.
