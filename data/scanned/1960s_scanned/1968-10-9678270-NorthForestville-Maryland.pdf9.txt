a. RADAR PERSONNEL - Whether they had any identified or unidentified blips at this time or the observation.
b. CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL - Statement as to whether the contrail or object was observed by the time of the observation.
c. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES - Often, they can provide information as to the reliability of the witness. Also, they may have received public reaction to the UFO sighting, or other information that may be of value.

It is important that you provide this information in your report so that our office does not duplicate your investigation.
