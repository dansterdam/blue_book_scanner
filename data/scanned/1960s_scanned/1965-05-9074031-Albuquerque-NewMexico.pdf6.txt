There seemed to be between 8 to 10 single bright lights, flying approximately south, slowly. They ranged in altitude from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 feet. At times the objects changed directions radically, the some times turning 180 degrees without apparent difficulty. There seemed to be some sort of connection between the lights, much as if they were strung together. The time was approximately 9:00 pm on April 24th. The objects continued to be seen for maybe 20 minutes. There are positive things about the sighting, in that the observers were credible people, and the sighting was made over a considerable period of time which lends it validity. The same time (9:00 to 9:20 pm April 24th) a number of other people in the Albuquerque area also reported seeing similar objects.
