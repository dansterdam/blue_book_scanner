At this time it is night just moving along with a ship's narrow moterry lass under my light of ground to the Genere of Houston, Texas; where I met a gentleman who said something to me about a "bright light" that kept around for a time blinking and moving slowly toward the north, the intensity of light was so very bright, could see thru machine if very close between. It appeared to be at a great altitude. After remaining stationary for a while it departed to the north at high speed, and I could not follow it any longer. This light behaved very similar to a bright star, yet it was not a star. Many strange things have occurred in this area and I have not been much excited about them, but feel it is my duty to report this unusual thing, as I step outside of my own usually skeptical tendency to draw conclusions, and try to report the matter accurately.
