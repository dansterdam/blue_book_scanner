A.F.R.
A SUMMER
Night April 25 1965 about 9:15 p.m. CST. Indiano.
To whom it may concern. At that time I was a senior at the the Central High School in Anderson, Indiana. I was out on the lawn doing my normal evening study when I noticed a bright light in the western sky - - - - much smaller than the moon but definitely brighter. At first I thought it was a shooting star but as I watched it, it began to move erratically and at a high rate of speed. It would stop, reverse direction and zig zag across the sky. After a few minutes of this it suddenly shot straight up out of sight. I have discussed this incident with a number of people and have concluded that what I saw was some type of unidentified flying object. There was no sound and the object seemed to be maneuvering under intelligent control. This is about the only unusual sighting I have ever experienced but I am quite certain that what I saw was not a normal celestial body or aircraft.
