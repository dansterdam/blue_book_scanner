Attached is a letter of introduction and recommendation from Dr. Robert J. Low(*), Professor of Psychology, University of Colorado, stating that the Dr. Low has informed me and requested that I cooperate with the NICAP group in Dayton, Ohio in any way possible. How you could help us do entitled cases with the CE UFO Study Group.

Although Local CPB's do conduct initial investigations of significant UFO sightings per AFR 80-17A, it is apparent that all UFO sightings received from civilian sources, civilian crews and military authorities according to the NICAP, should be carefully investigated for such extent as possible. In this connection, I would appreciate your cooperation in any way possible. How you could help us do entitled cases with the CE UFO Study Group.

1. The inability on the part of the Offices or Airmen to clearly determine which sightings might be significant on the basis of a telephonic preliminary report.

2. The lack of sufficient personnel to adequately field dispatch all UFO reports received.

3. The need that investigations be undertaken as quickly as possible while "trace" evidence remains identifiable.
