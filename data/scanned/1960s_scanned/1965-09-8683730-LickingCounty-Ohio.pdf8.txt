STATEMENT

(THIS STANDING)

At approximately 0235Z, I observed a white round object east of
Lockbourne AFB heading southwest. Over the SW of Lockbourne, the object then
went behind some low clouds. At that time, a dark gray elongated cylindrical
object for possible identification.

I no longer observed the object due to the fact that it was working
at the local communications and this position required more immediate attention.
