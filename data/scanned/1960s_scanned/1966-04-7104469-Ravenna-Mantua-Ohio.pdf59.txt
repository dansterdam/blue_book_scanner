DARK OBJECT SAID TO BE PICTURE OF UFO NEAR RAVENNA
Mantua Police Chief Took Shot While Following Object—UFO

POLICE CHIEF SAW IT

This Saucer Had Large Red Light

MANTUA, Ohio, April 30—(UPI)—Police 
Chief Merle McCardell said Monday he and 
his wife sighted an object that had a "large red 
light" flying over their home here Saturday night.

McCardell said they saw the object about 
9:30 p.m. while standing in their front yard and 
it disappeared behind a building.

"WE WERE LOOKING out the front win-
dow and saw this glow, like a bright star, coming
towards us," the chief said. "Then we went out 
the front door and it was right there. It was larger 
than a aircraft and just hovering there. There was 
no noise, no sound at all."

McCardell said after the object disappeared 
behind the building, it reappeared again and 
then went down behind the trees. "I tried to get 
a shot with my camera but it was gone so fast I 
couldn't get it," he added.

The chief said the object was larger than 
an airliner and had a huge red light on it. "It was 
just hovering there, then it disappeared and then 
it reappeared a little farther away and then went 
down behind the trees.

"WE FELT IT was a similar sighting reported
a week ago," he said.
