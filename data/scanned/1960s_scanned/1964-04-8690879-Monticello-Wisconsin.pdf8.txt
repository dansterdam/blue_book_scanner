The image contains a compass-like diagram, but does not appear to have any photographs.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the rising curve line to show the highest position of the object (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction.

IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arrayed, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. Visually uncorrelated lights - but they obviously were connected as they remained in a consistent relationship to each other.
