The image contains a photograph depicting a scene of several police officers gathered around what appears to be some kind of unusual flying object or phenomenon. The caption beneath the image refers to this as a "SCENE OF MYSTERY" and mentions Lonnie Zamora, a Socorro police officer, who reported seeing a mysterious flying object on Friday evening.

The text in the document reads as follows:

WON'T TELL SOUL NEXT TIME
UFO WITNESS SIGHS
AT REPORTS OF WHAT HE SUPPOSEDLY SAID
By CHARLES RICHARDS 
SOCORRO (UPI) - A policeman who gained sudden international attention Friday says he warn an egg-shaped flying object Sunday, but never said what he supposedly said about the incident.
SOCORRO policeman Lonnie Zamora said he would turn around and run, just like he did Friday evening, but never said anything like what has been attributed to him. 
"There have been so many phone calls," he sighed. And most of Sunday he spent thinking over some of the reports of what he supposedly said about the incident.
"Maybe you'd better ask some of these other guys," Zamora told reporters. "I'm the only one who saw it, but they seem to know more about it than I do." 
Denies Seeing Creatures
Zamora denied he had seen any little creatures around the object and said the unusual machine rose off the ground and flew slowly away in a southwesterly direction until it faded out of sight. It never got more than about 20 feet off the ground, he said.
Cpl. John McTigue, an Air Force officer who carried the news dispatch from Kirland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, said reports from Zamora seemed to be more sensational than the officer's own account.
Capt. Richard T. Holder, a Kirtland Air Force Base commander, termed the incident "fantastic" but referred to Zamora as a reliable witness. "Knowing Zamora as we do, we must regard his reports as dependable," he said.
