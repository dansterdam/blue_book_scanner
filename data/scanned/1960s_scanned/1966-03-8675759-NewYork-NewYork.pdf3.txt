Dear sir:
This letter relates to a matter previously mentioned to the local newspapers. The new developments are that there was a very curious and interesting report received on Monday morning regarding the sighting of a bright object over the city on Friday which lasted only a few seconds. My father told me about this matter as I was not here at the time. 
We are and six others - people that I know to be credible - have all had similar sightings. Taking into consideration the various report from the press, it was definitely looking through the binoculars for some time and they all saw an off white star-like object climb rapidly up and then it disappeared as quickly as it appeared. 
We would appreciate if some efficient action could be taken to determine the cause of this phenomenon as it is a matter of vital concern and importance to the public at large.
Please let me know the results of any investigation that may be conducted.
Yours truly,
