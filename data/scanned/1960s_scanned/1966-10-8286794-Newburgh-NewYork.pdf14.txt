The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

J. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloons releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting: N/A

K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer:
1. Initial investigation has not disclosed the nature of this U.F.O.
  a. I am not familiar with any known object matching Mr. [redacted] description.
  b. The observer may be mistaken as to the altitude of this object. His comparison of size to a silver dollar held at arm's length and an altitude of three to five thousand feet would make the object exceptionally large. An error in altitude would also account for the object's apparent rapid rate of speed, i.e., it may have been much closer to the observer and appeared to be moving exceptionally fast.

L. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs:
A map is attached showing flight path of U.F.O. and position of observers.
