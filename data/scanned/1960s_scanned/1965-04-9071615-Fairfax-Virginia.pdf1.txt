10. CONCLUSION Lights observed as described are probably due to combination of atmospheric conditions and optical illusions.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS The witness observed four or five bright lights in the sky which moved in an erratic manner for about 15 minutes. The lights were observed at an estimated altitude of about 1000 feet. It is concluded that the lights observed were probably the result of a combination of atmospheric conditions and optical illusions, possibly involving the reflection and refraction of light from existing cloud formations or dust particles in the air. There is no evidence to suggest the presence of any unusual or extraterrestrial activity.
