REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

CASE NO. 6979664
DATE OF SIGHTING: 5 May 1967
LOCATION: St. Louis, Missouri
OBSERVER: Joseph Mack

SUMMARY:
On 5 May 1967, at approximately 2130 hours, Mr. Joseph Mack, a 48-year-old engineer, observed an unidentified aerial object while driving home from work near his residence in St. Louis, Missouri. 

Mr. Mack stated that as he was driving, he noticed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving. He pulled over to the side of the road to observe the object more closely. He described the object as being oval-shaped, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and silver in color. The object appeared to be hovering and then suddenly accelerated and flew off at a high rate of speed, disappearing from view within a few seconds.

Mr. Mack immediately reported the sighting to the local police department. He was interviewed by an officer and provided a written statement. The officer then contacted the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official government program investigating unidentified flying objects, to report the incident.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK EVALUATION:
After reviewing the reported details, Project Blue Book classified this sighting as "Unidentified". The object's description, behavior, and lack of a conventional explanation led analysts to conclude that this was a genuine unidentified aerial phenomenon.
