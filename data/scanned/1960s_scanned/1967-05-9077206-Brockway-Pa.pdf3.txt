cannot catch me trying to understand and write up this object has been seen before at the same time about 9:15 pm i was coming home and heard a sharp whistling sound which seemed to be coming from the direction of the same object seen before i stopped and looked in the direction and saw a bright light in the sky which was moving very fast in a northerly direction the light was very bright but not running any flashing lights it seemed to be very high and just went on out of sight the direction it came from is the direction where the object has been seen before several times by many people i may add something occurred about 3 weeks ago at the same time of night about 9:15 pm the same bright light was seen in the same direction and it was reported by several observers in the town very unusual and hard to explain why this object or light appears at the same time also why would it keep coming back to the same spot let me know if you need any further information on this matter
Sincerely,
