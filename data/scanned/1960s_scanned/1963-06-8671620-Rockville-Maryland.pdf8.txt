LETTER FIRST SIGHTED 9:15 ON 8 MAY 1963
OBSERVER STATES THAT HE WAS SITTING IN HIS CAR AND STILL LOOKING OUT STILL LOOKING WHEN IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING. IT WAS STILL SUCH HIGH SPEED THAT HE COULD NOT FOCUS ON IT. HIS WIFE SAW IT TOO AND THEY WERE AMAZED AND STARED AT IT FOR SOME TIME. HE WAS TOTALLY SURPRISED AS HE HAD NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. IT MADE NO SOUND AND STRANGE STATIC IN HIS CAR WHEN IT APPEARED. IT REMAINED HOVERING FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN SHOT AWAY AT A HIGH SPEED TO THE EAST. HE CONTINUED TO WATCH IT AND WAS ABLE TO SEE IT CLEARLY. IT WAS SHAPED LIKE A CIGAR AND APPEARED TO BE COMPLETELY DARK IN COLOR AND ABOUT 30 TO 40 FEET LONG. IT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND AT ALL. HE IS COMPLETELY PUZZLED AS TO WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN. HE FELT IT WAS NOT ANYTHING HE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE THAT HE WOULD RECOGNIZE.
