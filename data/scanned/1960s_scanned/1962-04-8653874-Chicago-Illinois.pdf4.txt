The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. The photograph shows a table or chart with information about "Flying Saucers from Outer Space". The table includes details such as "Apparent speed", "Maneuverability", and other observations about the observed flying objects.

FLYING SAUCERS FROM OUTER SPACE
1. Apparent speed: tremendous, up to 8,000 mph.
2. Shape: circular, spherical, disc-shaped.
3. Size: from 30 feet to 300 feet in diameter.
4. Color: white, grey, silver, metallic.
5. Maneuverability: 90 degree turns, sudden stops and straight-line flight.
6. Duration of sighting: from a few seconds to several hours.
7. Sound: no sound from craft, but occasionally a faint humming noise.
8. Propulsion: unknown, possibly anti-gravity or electro-magnetic.
9. Behavior: evasive when approached, sometimes hover, sometimes fly in formation.
10. Reliability of witness: military, commercial and private pilots, scientists, engineers, etc.
