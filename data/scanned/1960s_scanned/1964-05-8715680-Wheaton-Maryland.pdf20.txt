Information Only (no Case) Course: FRIC

More About North Lawrence Case of May 17th - Mrs. Edna Sarginson identified the following after the U.S. had passed over, not during the time it hovered over the firehouse. (Passed from Mrs. White Dan Sarginson's house.) The U.F.O. had a disc-like shape, was hovering just over the trees, and appeared to be metallic. Later it descended.

She followed the sighting, the memory of it is still very vividly impressed upon her mind. The U.F.O. was very large, about 150 to 200 feet in diameter, she estimates. Mrs. White and Mrs. Sarginson are 65 and 71 years respectively. They are the children of Mrs. Edna Sarginson.

Another local resident, who insisted he saw the U.F.O. returning from the U.S. as it passed them, will be adamant in his belief that he saw it as described. However, he was unable to get any photographs. 

This "net" extended down, or at a downward angle from the large alternating (orange to white) object.

Range VII - Finally! We wonder what significant details were overlooked in this case. If additional information became available, further study would be in order.
