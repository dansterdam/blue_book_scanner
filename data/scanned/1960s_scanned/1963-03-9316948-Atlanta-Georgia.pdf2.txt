Dear ____,

We are in receipt of your report of April 5, 1963, of the sighting of a motor-truck object to the Foreign Technology Division. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. For their information and any reply they may consider appropriate.

Such phenomena are outside our area of study and activity. Therefore, they would not be expected to participate in an investigation or study to identify the phenomenon you observed, as the capabilities and resources of this organization would not be adequate to probe or improve this possible explanation.

Sincerely yours,

A. G. Stephens
Chief, Investigations and
Satellite Facilities Division
