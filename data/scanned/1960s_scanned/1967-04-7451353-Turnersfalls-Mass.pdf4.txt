Text extracted from the document:

The night it was sighted it certainly did not look at all like a glass of water in the sky, what I was so startled about.

I seem to have panicked but I realize of course the chance of suddenly meeting this was an unusual situation.

I dont wish to reveal any detail of the whole incident. Please consider this letter into consideration.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Trumbull, G.T. O.s.c. Trumbull
