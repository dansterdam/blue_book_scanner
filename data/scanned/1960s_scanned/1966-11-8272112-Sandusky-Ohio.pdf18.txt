This image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. The text on the page appears to be a proposed reply to a letter from Alan Seraduk, regarding information on unidentified flying object sightings in conjunction with the New York blackout in November 1965. The Air Force has received no reports related to the blackout, and the information provided will be added to the present data base, but a comprehensive investigation is not possible since the sightings are outside the continental limits of the United States.

Dear [redacted],

Reference your letter requesting information on unidentified flying object sightings in conjunction with the New York blackout in November 1965. The Air Force has received no reports that could be related to the blackout.

In regards to your own sightings, the information will be added to the present data base; however, a comprehensive investigation is not possible since the sightings are outside the continental limits of the United States.

Thank you for your letter. Your interest in our program is appreciated.
