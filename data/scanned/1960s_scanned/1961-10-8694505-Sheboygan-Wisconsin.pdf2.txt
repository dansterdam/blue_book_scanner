U.S. Air Force 
Contingency File 
Washington, D.C.

Dears sir: 
Since hand over fraction of a man paper that the air force had furnished investigation of while the case they have kept pretty quiet on. Can we assume this is a file of some nature out of this office. USAF said be of no help on this paper as it clears have started a complete circle and have met a stone wall. The thing has a few of its own men and space craft bet, if this so we know more about it it would be of great help as we no what to spend and who to contact to get added information on. 
On Oct.28 I had written to the Colorado Project Office for more information on the case, and have received no reply as of yet. We are quite anxious to find out more about the papers handed to us as they seem to have a glittering unmeriting mark + smell of pine and a rather unique design not consistant with any known aircraft. 
Please assist us if possible.
