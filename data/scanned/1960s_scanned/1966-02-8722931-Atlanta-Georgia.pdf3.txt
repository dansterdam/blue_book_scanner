The object drew me in to look at it. I saw a blue object, slightly larger than a full moon, and my others came out and stood near me, who had not seen anything like what I saw. The object had a downwards movement and turned the edges on the slow, I looked out the window because you can't look at it without squinting your eyes out. It seemed to. It glowed red at was still the object I looked at, it drew me to it, staring at it, but the moon looked back and forth and was not afraid, I got sick I nearly fainted with had to sit down. I told my family, my people and Dadson and everyone thought I was nutty. I did see this. it made me faint nearly seconds. it was nothing like I had ever seen.

Please write back and tell me how the came out.

It was like the thing called and me to come investigate.
