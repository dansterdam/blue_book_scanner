UFO INITIAL (Case 60-0032)

1. It is the opinion of ATIC that this has been further checked by the witness' insistence that the object is not known, but is highly possibly complyin with the normal USAF color formations from just aircraft.

2. It is impossible to determine positively what the witness saw. The object was almost certainly misidentified and is probably complyin with the normal USAF color formations from just aircraft.

3. The witness' sketch indicates that this is probably military satellite.

The information has been forwarded to AOIN-J1 to be used as a basis for USAF analysis.
