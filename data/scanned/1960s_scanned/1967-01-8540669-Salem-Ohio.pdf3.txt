Dear Sir:
Came across little this report right now of my children saw Sterling of Columbus Ohio. At about 7.15 9 P.M. They first saw it, to the west side of my home S.E. and quiet and quite still. It seem while I was working she came upon me and said have you seen that? I looked and yes it was very clear and bright. From where she was looking it was very close to the ground and about the size of a large star.
I watched it for several minutes. It would just sit and then make a short swing and sit still again. After watching it for about 10 or 15 minutes it seemed to get a little distance away and then it just took off very fast and disappeared. There was no sound at all.
I regret that I did not see it myself as I was working but my children did and they are very scared of it.
Please file this report and give me your opinion.
Thank you.
