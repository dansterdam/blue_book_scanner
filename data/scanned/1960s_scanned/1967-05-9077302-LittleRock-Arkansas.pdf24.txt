The sighting is definitely Unidentified. I was driving along the Sheridan Highway between Little Rock and Hot Springs, Arkansas around 10:00 on the night of January 30, 1967 when I noticed a bright object in the sky that did not appear to be an aircraft. The object was round or oval in shape and glowing in an orange-reddish color. It appeared to be hovering and making no sound, and was quite bright compared to the surrounding stars. After a minute or two, the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. I've had a keen interest in astronomy for many years and am quite familiar with the appearance of regular aircraft, satellites, meteors, etc. This object did not resemble any of those celestial phenomena that I'm acquainted with. I am a responsible citizen and do not have a history of reporting unreliable information. I believe this sighting represents a genuine unidentified flying object.
