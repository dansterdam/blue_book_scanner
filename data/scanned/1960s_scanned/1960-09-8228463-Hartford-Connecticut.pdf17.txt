Dr. Fred L. Whipple
Director, Astronomical Laboratory
Harvard University
Cambridge 38, Massachusetts

Dear Dr. Whipple:

It was a pleasure to be with you on the conference held at the Astronomical Laboratory and to have the opportunity to present the material which fell in scientific lines of approach and solution of the mutual problem. I believe that the presentation covered the essential high points of our discussion and that the material was of interest and value to your group at the Astronomical Laboratory.

I promised to send you copies of the Hartford police reports and other available data, and these are enclosed. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Very truly yours,

T. Townsend Brown
President
