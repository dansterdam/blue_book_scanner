There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which I will transcribe as follows:

Quartermaster was urgently told to be in Sikeston Mo, Made an effort to reeve them in a hurry-Due to the fact that Sikeston Tenn. were receiving hundreds of reports of strange light and maneuvers by a craft this was a rare occurrence of actually capturing a UFO. A Air Force team from Scott Airforce Base was ordered to investigate this sighting immediately. This constant pattern of an unusual light-sighting of 10-12 yr olds. That was not a hoax-nor over a developed mind. The boys observed them for over an hour and a quarter and tracked this strange light more than a half mile across a field. They described it as a golden egg shaped craft that hovered and made no sound and had a strange blue-green glow. They saw this craft again the next evening in the same vicinity. Their descriptions were similar and it seemed they were telling the truth of what they observed.
