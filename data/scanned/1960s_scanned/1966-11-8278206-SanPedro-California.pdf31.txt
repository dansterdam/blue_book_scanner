The image appears to contain a photograph of a unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky. The image shows a disc-shaped object that is described in the accompanying text as having been observed by an individual named Cornwail, who has reportedly joined the UFO club.

Text from the document:

CORNWALL, FLYING OBJECT 
SEEN IN SKY AT OCEAN 
View OF UFO TAKEN 
Cornwail said the UFO appeared suddenly in the sky as he was working in the field. It hovered over the stormy sea for a few moments, then moved rapidly upwards and out of sight. 
The object was disc-shaped, shiny and metallic in color, but did not glow or shine. It seemed quite large in comparison to the objects around it. Other people in the area also saw the flying object, but did not get pictures. 
Cornwail rushed to his home and got his camera. He said the UFO did not reappear, but he wanted to try and get a picture anyway. He said he was excited and eager to capture the strange craft on film. In his darkroom, Cornwail later carefully developed the film, and found that he had indeed photographed the UFO as it hovered over the ocean.
The image in the photograph clearly shows the disc-shaped object in the sky.
