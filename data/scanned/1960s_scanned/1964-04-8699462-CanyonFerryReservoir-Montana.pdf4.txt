Tioga Agog Over Space Visit Report
R. REID A. OCHS
Newark Valley, Broome Co., N.Y.
The writer has brought inquiries by an official agency, and has been a spondent in this case now since it first came to my attention over a year ago.
On two occasions, Mrs. Mary Ferrell of Tioga County, Pa. and a woman companion, whom she introduced as Mrs. Gary Barker, also of Tioga County, called on me to relate their story of a rather unusual experience. 
The incidents has brought inquiries by an official agency, and it has been deemed advisable to submit this report of the salient features of the case, while withholding the names of the principals involved, as well as certain other details which might serve to identify them.
The facts are these: On a certain Saturday evening, about a year ago, Mrs. Ferrell and her companion were driving home from a visit to relatives, when near the small hamlet of Tioga Center, Pa., they observed a peculiar light in the sky. Stopping their car, they noticed that the light seemed to be approaching them, and presently a large, disc-shaped object came to rest on the road some 50 yards ahead of them.
The object was described as being about 40 feet in diameter, with a dome-like structure on top, and a row of multi-colored lights around its periphery. A bright beam of light was directed down from the center of the underside of the object.
The two women, somewhat shaken by this unexpected occurrence, remained in the car, watching the object for several minutes. Suddenly, the beam of light was turned off, and the object took to the air with a slight rocking motion, and disappeared from view in a northerly direction.
Recovering from their initial amazement, the two women decided to report their experience to the local authorities. Through channels, the report eventually reached certain official agencies in Washington, resulting in the inquiry mentioned above.
In a subsequent interview, the two women provided additional details. They stated that, as the object hovered over the road, a 'door' opened in the side, and two human-like figures emerged and approached their automobile. The figures were described as being about 5 feet tall, with a greenish-grey complexion, large eyes and small mouth and nose, and appeared to be wearing tight-fitting, one-piece garments.
One of the figures, apparently the spokesman, addressed the two women, informing them that they were from another planet, and had come to Earth to make contact with human beings. He stated that the inhabitants of their planet were highly advanced, both technologically and spiritually, and were intensely interested in the people of Earth and their way of life.
The figure went on to say that they had been observing the Tioga area for some time, and had determined that the two women were of a suitable mental and spiritual calibre to be entrusted with a message for the people of Earth. He then proceeded to outline, in rather generalized terms, the nature of this message.
Apparently, the inhabitants of the visiting planet were deeply concerned over the warlike tendencies and environmental destruction prevalent on Earth, and wished to impart a warning and a plea for humanity to change its ways before it was too late. They expressed the hope that the two women would convey this message to the proper authorities, so that steps could be taken to avert a potential catastrophe.
After a brief exchange of questions and answers, the figures re-entered the craft, the beam of light was turned on, and the object rose rapidly and disappeared from view.
The two women, somewhat shaken by their encounter, returned home and immediately contacted the local authorities. Understandably, their story was met with a certain degree of skepticism, and it was not until several weeks later that the official inquiry mentioned earlier was instituted.
Throughout the investigation, the two women have remained consistent in their account of the incident, and have demonstrated a high degree of sincerity and conviction. There is no evidence to suggest that they are in any way attempting to perpetrate a hoax.
It is the considered opinion of the writer that the two women did, in fact, have a genuine UFO encounter of the type described. While certain aspects of their story may be open to question or interpretation, the basic facts, as related, appear to be substantially correct.
The message conveyed by the alleged space visitors, if authentic, is certainly one that merits serious consideration by the people of Earth. Whether or not it will have any significant impact remains to be seen. In any event, the incident serves to illustrate the continuing interest of some 'outside' intelligence in the affairs of our planet.
