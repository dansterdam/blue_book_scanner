OBJECT SEEN IN OHIO

Northampton Township, Ohio, April 28 - At 8:05 p.m. a UFO was observed by Myrna Johnson.

The hovering and pulsating object, a glowing white in color, was first seen to travel from the east-northeast. When it reached a position near the zenith, it halted. For several minutes it hovered, then pulsated, and traveled slowly westward, gaining altitude.

The object suddenly changed color to a glowing deep-red, appearing to grow larger and disappeared high in the distance.
