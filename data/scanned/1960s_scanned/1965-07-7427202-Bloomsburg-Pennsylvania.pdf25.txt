The image does not contain a photograph, only a hand-drawn sketch of a simple geometric shape. 

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It just disappeared behind evergreen.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes    No    Don't know.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. ..Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound   There was a soft humming sound.
b. Color    The object was bright white 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The head of the match covered about 1/20 of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protuberances, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[A simple sketch shows an oval-shaped object with a smaller trailing shape.]
