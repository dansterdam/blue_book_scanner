Name: Madison, Wisconsin 
Date: 7 April 1966
Time: 1200 hours
Location: Madison, Wisconsin
Weather: Partly cloudy, light winds

Witness(es): 
- John Doe, age 47, electrical engineer

Summary: 
Mr. Doe reported observing an unusual aerial object over Madison, Wisconsin on 7 April 1966 at approximately 1200 hours. The object was described as a silver, cylindrical craft hovering silently at an estimated altitude of 5000 feet. It remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. No sound was reported. Mr. Doe attempted to photograph the object but was unable to due to the bright sunlight conditions.

Conclusion: 
The report has been classified as "Unidentified" due to the lack of physical evidence and the inability to locate any known aircraft or phenomena that would account for the witness' observations. Further investigation is pending.
