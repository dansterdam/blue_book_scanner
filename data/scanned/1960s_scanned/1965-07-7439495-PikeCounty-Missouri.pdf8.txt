Text transcribed from the image:

It was a queer sight-did not see anything
until I looked at the ground there. I saw a
light, round and bright. It was about 15 to 30 feet 
from the ground. It lasted only a few seconds.
I did not see any shape to it. It just seemed
to be light only and no noise was heard.
It was over in a flash.

On September 9 at 11:15 P.M. CDT.
I was checking the door and saw
this light and could not understand
what it was. It was a queer sight and
I did not see anything approaching or
leaving the area.
