Alc Adams, who was dispatched with AIC Jablonski, also stated that he sighted the object for about two hours in the southern skies. The UFO seemed to assume a stationary position. First it was a hovering position, then it would speed up. The reddish orange light kept changing white and occasionally green. B-52 bomber heard approaching 15 minutes after seeing UFO. B-52 was said to be much higher than UFO.

Sgt. Hand sighted the object in the southern skies for two hours twenty-six minutes. The UFO appeared as a point of light. It appeared about the same as landing lights on the B-52 which was diverted to the area, except for the flashing red lights on the B-52.

Sgt. Smith sighted the UFO from 0355 to 0410 hours. It was primarily in the south-southwest OBC and on for 1 hour 15 minutes.

The object appeared as though a star would appear on the horizon on a clear night. The phenomenon appeared to be a reddish burst change. Sgt. Smith saw it come and shine as a star might twinkle.
