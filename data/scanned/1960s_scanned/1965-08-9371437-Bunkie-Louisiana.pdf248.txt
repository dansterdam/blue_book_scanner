Radar Tracks Zipping Objects Near Air Base
Radar operators at Barksdale Air Force Base, La., tracked several unidentified objects dipping and zipping in the sky near the base Sunday night. 

The objects, described as blips on the radar screen, were tracked for more than an hour. They were described as moving at speeds up to 1,000 miles an hour. 

Capt. Jack Bouche, public information officer at the base, said the objects were picked up by the radar at 9 p.m. and remained in the area, dipping and zipping, until after 10 p.m. 

The objects were tracked over an area within 10 miles of the base. They were at altitudes varying from 4,000 to 60,000 feet. 

Capt. Bouche said the base's radar crew, trained in spotting and tracking aircraft, agreed the objects were not normal aircraft. He said they did not resemble the flight paths of known jet and propeller-driven aircraft. 

Similar incidents have been reported at several other Air Force bases in recent months, according to official sources. The Air Force said the objects defied explanation.
