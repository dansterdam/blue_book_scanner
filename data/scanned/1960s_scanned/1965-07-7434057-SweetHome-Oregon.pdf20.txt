The full account of these above-mentioned incidents occupies a full page in each of the consecutive editions of the Buenos Aires newspaper "Cronica," (9/24/65-9/27/65), and space permits us to give here only the first of the incidents. On the night of 15th September, 1965, while driving home from the center of the city, a group of witnesses observed an intensely luminous object in the sky. It was a very large object, very luminous, bluish in color, but the color varied slightly. It seemed to produce a sort of halo or luminous effect.

Although we could not see it clearly where its upper part ended, the outline seemed to be regular and to have a shape rather like that of a short cone. Although we could not determine exactly where its upper part ended, the outline seemed to be regular and to have a shape rather like that of a short cone. According to the calculations made, it was 10 to 15 meters (yards) in diameter. In a moment we were enveloped in a luminous haze. The object seemed stationary, and no sound was heard. The ground hid it, but we continued seeing the light: it produced. Finally the light went out completely. We then continued our journey to the ranch, where we found that the laborers had seen it also.
