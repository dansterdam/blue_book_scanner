AT FLYING OBJECTS OBSERVED by USAF PERSONNEL 
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:
The personnel reporting this incident are considered reliable and their observations creditable. The sightings occurred over a 2-hour period during which time several objects were observed maneuvering in the sky.

AT APPROXIMATELY 0950Z, 12 April 1965, THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE:

A round, brilliant white light, approximately the size of a nickel at arm's length, was observed by the observers in the eastern sky travelling in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, during which time it appeared to suddenly increase in size, the light became more intense, and the object appeared to accelerate and climb at a steep angle, disappearing from view. It made no sound.

APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES LATER, at least four, possibly five, similar objects were observed in the eastern sky, travelling in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet. The objects were round and brilliant white in color. They were observed for 4 to 5 minutes, during which time they appeared to accelerate and climb at a steep angle, disappearing from view. They made no sound.

APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR LATER, a single round, brilliant white light was observed in the southwestern sky, travelling in a southwesterly direction at an estimated altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet. It was observed for 1 to 2 minutes, during which time it appeared to accelerate and climb at a steep angle, disappearing from view. It made no sound.

APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES LATER, two bright, round, brilliant white lights were observed in the eastern sky, travelling in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet. They were observed for 2 to 3 minutes, during which time they appeared to accelerate and climb at a steep angle, disappearing from view. They made no sound.
