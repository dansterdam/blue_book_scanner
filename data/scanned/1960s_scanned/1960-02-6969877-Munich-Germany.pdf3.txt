The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document that describes the transfer and investigation of a case submitted to the AFOIN-M2 collections on 13 April 1960. The text indicates that the case was returned to L442 on 22 April 60 with no indication of action taken. On 25 April, Sgt. Poxen had informed Cpt. Ballou that L442 decided that there wasn't anything of importance to the report, and that further and material analysis would have been sent in for analysis.
