There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C)
THE PHENOMENON
BEGAN TO RISE STRAIGHT UP AND RUN AWAY?
ACTUALLY, THE OBJECT APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED
GIVE OFF SMOKE? 
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
LEAVE OR FLICKER?
CLOUD OR HAZE APPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
PLAY OR BE TRANSLUCENT?
WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
What did it finally disappear?
It gradually faded out. It was silently, flying north at a slow rate of speed.
DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREES, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
