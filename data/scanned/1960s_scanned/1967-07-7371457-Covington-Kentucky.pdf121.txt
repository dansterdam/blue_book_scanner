Proposed reply to correspondence from[REDACTED] age 15 (sighting 7 Jul 67)

Dear [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your correspondence on an unidentified flying object sighting of July 7, 1967.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in the evaluation and possible explanation. If you had reported your observation to the nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data base.

[REDACTED], Henderson, New York
