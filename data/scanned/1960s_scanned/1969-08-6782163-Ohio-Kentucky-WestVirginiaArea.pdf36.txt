Your name was been given to the Aerial Phenomena Office as having seen an unusual bright meteor, called a fireball, in the early morning hours of 5 August 1959. If this is true, we would appreciate your completing the attached AF Form 117 on your sighting and return it to us in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. This data, when compiled, will be used in Project Blue Book and your cooperation will be most helpful to the Air Force and the American Meteor Society. The data contained in these reports will then be used to compute the trajectory of the fireball and the probable impact point of the meteorite. Thank you for your cooperation.
