Any object suddenly appearing may seem to be a phenomenon of great interest but the observer's report gives only a subjective observation which may be quite at variance with the actual facts. This case illustrates the difficulty of reaching definite conclusions on the basis of such reports alone. Evidently the observer's report is a personal interpretation of an incident too vague to allow any firm conclusion as to its cause or nature. It is important that observers of such phenomena, if genuinely interested in the subject, should make detailed and factual reports which can then be carefully evaluated by competent investigators.
