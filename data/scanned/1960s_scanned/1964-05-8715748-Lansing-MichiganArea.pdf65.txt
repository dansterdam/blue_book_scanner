Dear Captain Quintanilla:

Enclosed is a field report very interesting. I am sorry but it is not cover a single UFO sighting. It covers more of an observation of a general nature- related to sightings of objects reported in this area over a number of years. This is a rather unique observation and may be of value in understanding the psychology behind sightings and our attempts to collect reliable data.

On 6 occasions over the last 6 years I am enclosing a list of sightings and data. Dr. Frank Horak, director of the observatory, has analyzed this data and made the following observations:

1. Most of the early plans are gills and even relatively some modern cases (July 11, 1957, for example) are in no way typical of what a normal observer would say, but are very much like the old woodcuts and artist's conceptions of what a UFO ought to look like.

I would like to add that working with nave people was a pleasure.

Sincerely yours,

WILLIAM T. POWERS
Assistant Director
