POSSIBLE SOURCES OF HELICOPTER TRAFFIC TO EXPLAIN LIGHTS (UFOs)
Investigating officers checked all Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard and National Guard units in the area with negative results.
Not one had any helicopter activity in the area the evenings of the sightings. Checked possible private sources, i.e. Oregon Forestry Service, private helicopter firms. Oregon Forestry Service has no choppers and was unable to raise anyone at a private helicopter firm servicing Shell, Oil Co. off-shore oil drilling rigs. This firm, located at Coos Bay, did not have any choppers in the area according to personnel at Tillamook County Airport.
