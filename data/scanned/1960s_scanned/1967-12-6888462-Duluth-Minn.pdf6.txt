The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, with handwritten text.

Duluth, Minnesota

January 15, 1966

Dear Sirs:
Space at 6:40 A.M. on this date there appeared in the sky over our home at 1105 Woodland avenue, a brilliant light, that descended almost perpendicular to the north.
It appeared to be round or oval in shape, a beautiful white light, no sound whatsoever, and remained visible for about 30 seconds before disappearing below the horizon.
The sky was clear, no clouds, stars were visible. This sighting was observed by my wife and myself.
We are interested in your findings. Please let us know if you have any information in your files pertaining to this sighting.

Yours truly,
S****** L. Ross
