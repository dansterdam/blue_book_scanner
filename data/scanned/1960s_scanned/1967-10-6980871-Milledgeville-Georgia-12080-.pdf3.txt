The image contains a black and white photograph of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. The image shows a hazy, blurry object in the sky, which looks like a disc or saucer-shaped craft. There is a silhouetted landscape in the foreground, suggesting this was taken outdoors.

CONNER S. BEAM
INVESTIGATOR
U.S. AIR FORCE PROJECT BLUE BOOK
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
DATE: 6 October 1967 

LOCATION: Milledgeville, Georgia
SUBMITTED BY: Col. Joe Caddis

SUMMARY: On 6 October 1967, at approximately 1915 hours, Mr. Connor S. Beam, Investigator for U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book, received a telephone call from Col. Joe Caddis, Commanding Officer, Milledgeville Air Force Base, regarding a UFO sighting in the Milledgeville, Georgia area.

Col. Caddis stated that several base personnel had witnessed a large, glowing disc-shaped object hovering over a rural area near the base. The object was described as approximately 75-100 feet in diameter, emitting a bright, pulsating light. After several minutes, the object shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

Col. Caddis requested that Mr. Beam travel to Milledgeville to investigate the incident. Mr. Beam arrived on the scene the following day and interviewed several eyewitnesses, including base personnel and local residents. Attached are the witness statements and a photograph taken by one of the observers.

Based on the evidence gathered, Mr. Beam concluded that the object witnessed was indeed an unidentified flying object of unknown origin and nature. The case is being classified as "unresolved" and will be included in the Project Blue Book archives for further analysis.
