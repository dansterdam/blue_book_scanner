Jume 14 - TWO employees of an oil company reported observing several unidentified objects over a period of four minutes. The objects, bluish-white in color, were first sighted to the north and later sighted to the northeast of the observers. The objects were in view for a total of four minutes. It was reported that the sighting was observed by additional personnel, but no further information has yet been revealed on this UFO encounter.

JUDG'T: COULD BE AIRCRAFT
THIS RESULTING OPERATION WHICH OCCURRED IN LOCATION WAS THOUGHT TO BE CAUSED BY FLIGH INTO THE AREA BY NORTHEAST WINDS.
QUALITY OF DETAILS SUCH AS SIZE, LIGHT, ALTITUDE, ETC., IS LOGICAL, CONSISTENT AND COMPETENT. VISIBILITY COULD HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD OVER TWENTY TO TWENTY-FIVE MILES ON THE NIGHT.
LOCATION AND OTHER ACCOUNT DATA SUFFICIENT FOR ANALYSIS PURPOSES-GEOGRAPHICAL DATA
HISTORICAL LICENSED CIVIL PILOTS AND THE STATED ABSENCE OF A TYPICAL MUNICIPAL AIRPORT SUGGEST THAT THE INCIDENT MIGHT REPRESENT PHENOMENA ENCOUNTERED BY SUCH AERIAL PERSONNEL IN THE AREA AT OTHER TIMES.
