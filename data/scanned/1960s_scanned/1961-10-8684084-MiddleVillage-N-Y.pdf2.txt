UFO Department

On October 10th at 11:15 P.M. I saw what might have been a shooting star burning out or something that might have been an object to outer space. I was at Briarcliff Manor, New York, approximately 27 miles from a position at Perspptan Avenue and Ellin Avenue.

The trajectory was almost horizontal with the earth. This object gave off what appeared to be a blue-green line of light to the horizon and the ground was illuminated for a considerable way.

Distance is undetermined but relative to a high course it would be incomprehensible, on a flat trajectory a distance of July four or five miles - but only for a brief period of time. 

At first it was as a bright as a star, but moved very fast, then a light formed a spherical shape for a considerable time, and then disappeared.

Burn out location relative to my position was approximately at 2 o'clock.
