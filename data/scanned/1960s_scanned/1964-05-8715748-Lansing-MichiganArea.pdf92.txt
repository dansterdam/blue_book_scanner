"92. CIVILIAN, sighted opening in clouds, around 8:40 p.m. 9 Apr. 64, making round ball about the size of a basketball, hovering overhead. Duration to be controlled by Capt. XXXXXX.

Subject: CIVILIAN sighting 3.45, 4.50 and 10 appear to be the same case, well ascertained. The witness appears to be a credible person, with a good reputation in the community. His sighting occurred about 8:40 p.m., 9 Apr 64, in the Lansing, Michigan, area. The object appeared to be a round ball, about the size of a basketball, hovering overhead. The duration of the sighting was not given, but it was stated to be "controlled" by Capt. XXXXXX.

This sighting is somewhat similar to the others in this report, with a small, round, hovering object being described. The sighting appears to have been of good quality, with a credible witness. However, without any further details or visual evidence, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the nature of the observed object."
