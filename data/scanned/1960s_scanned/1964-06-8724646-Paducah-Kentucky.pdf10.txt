ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL SPECIMEN
6 August 1964

CAPT RICHARD A. WALTER
UNITED AIR FORCE RECRUITING OFFICE 214-11
ROOM M-10
FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING
PADUCAH, KENTUCKY

1. The object which Mrs. X turned over to you and which was analyzed by our office. A copy of this report is attached. You may inform Mrs. X that the results of our analysis indicate that the object does not represent the results of any type of meteorological or other phenomenon, since the object itself was consumed in the analysis. Essentially the object has the characteristics of a material resembling a cotton cloth saturated with fuel oil and burned. While we are uncertain as to the exact nature of the object, it was definitely not of a metallic nature.

2. While this office did not have the opportunity to physically examine the object, we are of the opinion that it was in her backyard.

3. Your attention is directed to your action in insuring that the Air Force did not obtain an object of potential scientific value.

FOR THE COMMANDER
