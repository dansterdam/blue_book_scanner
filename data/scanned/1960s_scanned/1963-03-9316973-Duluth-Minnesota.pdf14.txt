Scout Leader Observes Strange Light
On the afternoon of March 22, 1963, between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m., Mrs. Beseris Watson, an assistant den mother at the Piedmont Council, Boy Scouts of America, witnessed the passage of four UFOs. These UFOs were described as being white in color and flat in shape. The outlines were not sharp and were fuzzy around the edges. They moved at great speed and did not appear to follow a straight course, though it was a sunny day with good seeing conditions.
The first two which traveled toward the west passed one after the other and were not in formation. A few minutes later another one appeared, going west and objects which was going east also. No more were seen.
