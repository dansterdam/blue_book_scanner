The text in the document reads:

"The average that only some from 1952 30 or town under object. Carefully seen morning in the very thing at sky and how this so well I do not know them and not at the which seems like home cloud. 19)I have a visible white field about 2 1/2 mile and in between brighter white light over moving on a steady speed north had 10 to 12 thousand feet the top of the object was flat and surface smooth, shiny but not reflective could see no protrusion or other features. The position it was in very high seemed almost motionless for about 1 minute and then started to move off at a steady speed of about 300 to 400 miles an hour. Disappear in the air as it gained altitude. There was no noise, it did not seem to be powered or have any propulsion unit visible. No vapor trails no sounds no disturbance of the atmosphere at least not enough to be noticed. I watched it for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes and it was quite some distance away when I first sighted it in the open sky. The sighting was very clear and distinct and I am certain but it was not anything I have ever seen before and could not identify it as anything known to me. I feel I must report this even though I cannot fathom what it was. Please instruct me as to any further procedure I should follow."
