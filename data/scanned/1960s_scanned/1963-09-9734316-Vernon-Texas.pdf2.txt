Dear Sirs:

On the night of Sept 23, 1963 at 10:25 P.M. C.S.T. 6 miles east of Vernon, Texas, we observed a strange object over our ranch. The object seemed to be hovering 300-500 feet above the ground for over 7-8 minutes. At first it appeared to be similar to a landing craft but with a somewhat larger size.

This flashing object seemed to have a red light which was quite bright and blinked on and off. It gave the impression of an object rotating on its vertical axis. It made no sound that we could hear from our position. The object then took off toward the northeast at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of just a few seconds.

Please note this information for your records.
Sincerely,

(Redacted name)
