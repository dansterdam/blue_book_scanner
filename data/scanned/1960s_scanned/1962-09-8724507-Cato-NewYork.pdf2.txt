Dear Correspondent:

I am very much interested in regard to my reported sighting of an unidentified flying object, as classified in my earlier letter. I would appreciate it if you could possibly give me some explanation as to what this object possibly could have been. If you have any explanation as to what it could have been, possibly send me an answer to this letter and my question. Thank you.

Yours truly,
