NEAR MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SECTION
13 Friend Court
Waltham, Massachusetts
SUBJECT: UFO Reports, Mass. Power Plant, Salem, Mass.
DATE: 15 March 1966
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler (Chairman)
TO: CC: PROJECT BLUEBOOK
(minus ref. letter)
Enclosed is UFO report no. 9 originating above the Mass. Power Plant, Salem, Mass., on October 26, 1965. This report involves the sighting of a cigar-shaped UFO on that date.
This location was also the site of the well-known UFO sighting which took place on July 19, 1952. I hope soon to forward complete data on this case to report UFO activity so our Committee can immediately take a closer look at the details.
Of particular interest is the enclosed letter from a witness who is a private representative of the July 19, 1952 UFO sighting who relates his observations of the creation of a new UFO object and the events surrounding it. This letter may contain information additional to that which has been reported previously.
Sincerely submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
Chief Investigator
