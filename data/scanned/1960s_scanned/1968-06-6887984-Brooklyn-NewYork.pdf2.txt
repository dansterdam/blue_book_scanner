UFO Sightings of Aug 1967 and 3 Jun 1968

Brooklyn, New York 11215

Reference your UFO sightings of Aug 1967 and 3 Jun 1968. Although we consider these sightings too old to investigate properly, we did submit your photographs to our photographic experts. Their findings are as follows:

"There is a definite pattern of light imagery on both prints. There are at least five of these images in addition to the particular one on each print identical for print Nr. 1 with tick marks over each image including that identified as a UFO. When this overlay was applied to print Nr. 2, the tick marks correspond perfectly to the images present. Due to the fact that there is a definite pattern it is almost certain that there is a view difference consistent between the images, and it's almost likely that this effect is due to the holder of the printing device."
