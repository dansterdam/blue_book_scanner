UFO Sighting Re-Enacted: NoHelp to Scientist
SOCORRO (AP) - An Airforce consultant on unidentified flying objects had Dr. J. Allen Hynek, consultant, and said after the re-enactment that he could draw no conclusions from what he saw and was "more puzzled than ever" when he arrived here.
Dr. Hynek returned to Albuquerque Tuesday after viewing the site and departed for the East by plane.
Zamora reported seeing an object fly away shortly after 5:45 p.m. Friday. Other reports have followed, including. After the re-enactment, Dr. Hynek said he was puzzled that there was no evidence at the Socorro site. "The story is simply told, certainly without any intent to perpetrate a hoax. The story of course was told by a man who was obviously frightened by what he did see. He said there was evidence at the site.
Is This the Answer?: U.S. Government aircraft flying at low levels along US-66 and US-70-80 taking photographs with powerful electronic flash equipment during the last week, may be the part of the answer to the rash of "flying saucers" seen in New Mexico. The jet airplanes were taking the photos during both night and day, from Albuquerque west to Deming, Ariz., and from Deming west to Casa Grande, Ariz., according to a Kirtland Air Force Base spokesman.
