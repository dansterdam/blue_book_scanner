The image provided does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned copy of a typed document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

27 February 1960

Subject: Advanced Report of UFO's

1. At approximately 2000, I received two calls from the Headquarters USAF Command Post with the following information:

a. A UFO was sighted at 2330 Z south of Essex, Vermont by the Tower and other personnel. It reportedly had a long red tail and moved from 3500 to 1000 feet. One aircraft reported it might have been a celestial body.

b. The above information was relayed through Major Wright, 6th AP on via TWX.

c. According to Col. Richardson, Bolling AFB, Wallops Island launched a balloon today which coincided in time and possibly in appearance with the UFO.  

2. Loring will probably follow up with a UFO report.
