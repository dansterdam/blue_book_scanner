11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer's name was listed in another report as a witness to an incident on 17 July 1967. The witness reported that he saw some objects on 13 July and two on 23 Aug. He gives all three reports on them same 17 July. The results are somewhat difficult to understand and is in general, confusing. Also the report was nearly 3 months old when submitted and because of the involved it would be very difficult to investigate properly.
