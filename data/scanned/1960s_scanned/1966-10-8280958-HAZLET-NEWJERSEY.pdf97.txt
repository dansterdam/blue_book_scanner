Dear Gentlemen:

During the October month, and my family and I witnessed a series of UFO sightings. 

One of the earliest sightings was seen by my daughter and myself. The time was approximately 10:45 p.m. An object, zoomed by above the school building, and seemed to change color on occasion. It had no blinking lights, and made no noise when the object passed by.

When the girls came home from a meeting, they both witnessed and ran away from an object. In the month of October, was when we witnessed the most sightings. 

I were in my dark room, I saw a series of lights on. As we were sightings, I glimpsed a large object approximately 50 feet above the neighboring houses. I would estimate the object was round and I saw much interference in UFO lights.

Then, we both suddenly knew it was one. I called my wife and others as I ran out to the back yard with camera. When I did so, it was gone. No trace at all, no rumble, no wind, nor a hum.

Later that night, after that sighting, I stood in my backyard for one hour and thirty minutes. The little one (approximately 50 feet) came close several times frantically, but it seemed to toy with my reactions.

Suddenly, it did another maneuver. We could not determine the incredible speed, although it was very low and very close. Air space movements seem most advanced, not advanced enough, however, for a visit with other speed.
