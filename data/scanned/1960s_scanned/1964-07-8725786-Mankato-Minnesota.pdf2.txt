Dear Sir:

I am a student at Mankato State College in Mankato, Minnesota, and I am studying a course in astronomy. I was excited to hear the letter from your office to obtain information concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object which occurred on the night of Saturday, July 10, at approximately 11:27 p.m. (Central Daylight Time).

Through the following considerable delay caused by passing from one agency to another, I was finally able to obtain the information that this sighting could not be passed to you correctly through the normal chain of events. I was advised to ask your advice on this site conservation in that there was no knowledge obtainable as to the source of the stated object.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
