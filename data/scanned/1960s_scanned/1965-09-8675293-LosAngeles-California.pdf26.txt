MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: UFO, 9 September 1965 
SIGHTING "A"

TIME AND PLACE: Between 2145 and 2200/9 Sept 65,

REPORTED BY: Mr. [redacted] 
(Los Angeles County)
Telephone: [redacted]

Mrs. [redacted] stated that between 2145 and 2200/9 Sept 65, she, her husband, and a neighbor, [redacted], observed the object. The following is her description:

It was a real thick object shaped like a saucer and had a slight glow to it. It was observed for about 15 minutes. As it flew out last night, no clouds in the sky, it was as clear as a bell.

It is hard to say how far away it was. It appeared to be some distance, but steady. It didn't change shape; it was just a steady object. The color was yellow like electrical house lights are yellow. The center section was a little pale, but the outer edges were more yellow.

The object was to the west of where Mrs. [redacted] is located. It appeared to be dodging up and down. The neighbor also observed the object and gave a statement that the object was also moving toward them. However, Mrs. [redacted]'s statement are correct.
