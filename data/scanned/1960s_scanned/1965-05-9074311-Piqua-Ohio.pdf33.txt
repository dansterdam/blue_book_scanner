The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document reads:

"A Sergeant, New Mexico, Los Alamos, officials and the Police Department were interviewed on this matter by APRO. The Los Alamos Scientific Installation has in past denied any connection with sightings on the State police. No details on the object."
