PROJECT BLUE BOOK  
This incident occurred during the early morning hours of November 7, 1969, at approximately 2:00 a.m. local time, near Dayton, Ohio.  
The witness, a civilian individual, observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be approaching his location. The light rapidly increased in size and brightness, and the witness was able to observe it for approximately five minutes before it disappeared from view.  
No other individuals were reported to have observed this incident. There is no physical evidence or photographic documentation available regarding this particular sighting.  
The investigation conducted by Project Blue Book personnel was unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the light observed by the witness. The case was classified as "unidentified" due to the lack of definitive evidence.
