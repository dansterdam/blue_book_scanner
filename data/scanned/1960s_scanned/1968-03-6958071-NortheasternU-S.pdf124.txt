Dear Captain [REDACTED],

Captain John Morrison, whom I have met here at the Martin Marietta Corporation, has asked me to write you regarding a UFO sighting by me on the night of February 3, 1968.

I was flying a Lockheed Jetstar at 33,000 feet and indicating Mach 0.82. The weather was clear and winds indicated visibility. A beam UHF light was observed at a flight of fifteen or twenty thousand feet higher. At first, the light appeared to resemble a flight of two aircraft in trail. The light moved at a high rate of speed, at a steady course and altitude. My heading was 87Â° so I would guess its heading was south.

As it passed at 12 o'clock, they definitely appeared as two distinct light sources. Each light source consisted that I would describe as a pencil beam of light. This beam had no taper, did not trail off but maintained a constant cross-section and simply disappeared in seemingly a instant. I would describe it as white in color changing to phosphorescent. The changes in color were subtle and did not appear modulated.

When these lights moved to 1300 o'clock the front light seemed to be outdistancing the rear light. The rear lights at this angle appeared as two distinct lights of similar intensity and both boiled and roiled in identical pencil beams of light. A few seconds later, it all disappeared from sight because of the distance.

The time was approximately 10:45 p.m. EST. My course was a doppler track from 270 degrees to 105. Drift was six degrees right. The total time this was observed was between 40 and 50 seconds. All this observation is as it was actually witnessed and my contact confirms with everything as it is stated here.
