1. Reference inclosed letter:

a. I asked Mrs. *****o write this for me because she wanted to call the President and other government officials.

b. As you know, Amherst is only 10 miles from Niagara Falls, however, the telescopic study of an object at Amherst led Special Delivery personnel to report the object to the UFO officer. After mentally disturbing the children, she is about thirty (30) years old and has a (2) children, she oldest one being nine (9). She was constantly complaining how loud they were and that the radio was on full blast all day. Their unusual figures were completed.

However, Objects sighted during our visit were stars and airplanes. However, the missiles they are not aliens but communications systems from the UFO's mentioned also introduced me to them.

This morning, 30 September 66, she called me and said she was not afraid and brought the spotlights from the central office. The report-lights she was referring to were located at new car dealers' lots, arriving with the new 1967 model cars.

Again I say, the only reason I am forwarding this is to let you know it has been looked into and if an inquiry does arrive, you have an answer.
