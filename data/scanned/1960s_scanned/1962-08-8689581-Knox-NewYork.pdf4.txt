Transcription of the text in the document:

"it is contended that the object was caused by a metcor or weather balloon.

(1) Witnesses - 1.10, Mostly
2. 2 - Soldiers reported it to State.Police.
3. Appeared as a glowing orange ellipse 
4. Moved east to west, at 5,000 feet
5. Disappeared in northwest

(2) Evaluation
1. Postulated the object was a METCER, based on reported size, shape, and flight path.
2. Could not determine why it was reported as orange in color.
3. Could not explain how two experienced observers could mistake a meteor for a high-altitude elliptically-shaped object with no tail.

It is concluded the officers did not mistake a meteor, but probably observed a high-altitude balloon. However, why it was reported as orange remains unexplained."
