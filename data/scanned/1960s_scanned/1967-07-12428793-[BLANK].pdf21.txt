HISTORY

Unidentified flying objects do not constitute a new phenomena. UFOs have been reported by historians since 593 B.C.

At this time, Ezekial recorded a whirlwind to the north which appeared as a fiery sphere. In 1254 at Saint Abbs Abby, when the moon was eight days old, there appeared in the sky a ship elegantly shaped, well equipped, and of marvelous color. In 1520 there appeared in France a round shaped object with rotating lights and two fiery guns. In 1871, over Texas, a farmer reported seeing a dark flying object in the shape of a disc cruising in the sky at a wonderful speed. Many, many more observations have been recorded by historians throughout ancient and modern history.

The modern era of UFOs and its beginning on 24 June 1947. I say the modern era, because, national news coverage on UFOs up to this period was virtually non-existent. Mr. Kenneth Arnold's observation and subsequent news reporting of his UFO sighting, swayed the public into believing that our planet had been visited by unknown vehicles from outer space. The Arnold sighting and subsequent publicity on flying saucers created an avalanche of reports. The Air Force began receiving reports from people of all walks of life.
