The object appeared as a group of lights in a triangular formation. It seemed to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, moving at a high rate of speed, approximately 70 to 80 miles per hour. It was silent and appeared to be at an altitude of around 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The object changed direction twice, making 90 degree turns, and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. The sighting lasted approximately 1 to 2 minutes. There were no other witnesses that I know of.
