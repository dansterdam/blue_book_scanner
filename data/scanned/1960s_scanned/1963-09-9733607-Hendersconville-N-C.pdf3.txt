December 11, 1964

5. The object made no sound in its passage from horizon to horizon, nor was there any sound, such as a sonic boom, after it had disappeared from view.
6. The object appeared to the earth and with the oval (see drawing) facingupwards. As it passed us, it rotated around its central axis so that the oval was perpendicular to our line of sight. After the object had passed, it rotated back into its original attitude.
7. The object appeared to be flying parallel to the curvature of the earth. 
8. There was no evidence of any type of operating propulsion unit.
9. The outside section( formed by the division of each wing by the curved line) of each wing moved as the object executed its two rotations.

made no estimate of the time that the object took to pass from horizon to horizon, but did state that the object seemed to be moving at an unusually fast speed.
