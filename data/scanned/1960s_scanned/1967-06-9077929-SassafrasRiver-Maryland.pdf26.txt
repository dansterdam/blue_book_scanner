Dear sir,

I am an Irish student residing in the United States for the summer. I am extremely interested in UFO's and prospects of an advanced scientific technology.

My father and I are excessively ineterested in the UFO mystory, and have read books and articles by prominent authors. We have carefully studied the UFO's disclosed in the news and seen TV programs about them. We feel that the time has now come for the truth to be revealed instead of the public being left in the dark. I realize the controversy and sensetional tendencies concerned in this field, but I sincerely believe that the authorities are withholding a great deal of information about the subject.

I would be eternally grateful for any literature, pamphlets, or data you could send me in regard to this matter. I assure you that I am a responsible student and will treat any information I receive with discretion. I am not a newspaper or magazine publisher and have no intention of publishing anything.

I hope you will give this matter your immediate attention. I will be glad to pay any mailing or copying costs involved. Thank you very much.

Yours sincerely,
