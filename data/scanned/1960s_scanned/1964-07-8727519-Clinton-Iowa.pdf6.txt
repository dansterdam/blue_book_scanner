There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically a letter dated August 27, 1964 from Maston M. Jacks of the United States Air Force to an unnamed recipient. The letter discusses a response to a previous letter dated July 22, 1964, which appears to have reported an unusual object observed in the Littleston, Illinois area. The letter indicates that the original report did not contain sufficient information to allow for a proper evaluation, and requests additional information for a supplementary investigation.

Dear Mr. __________,

This is in response to your letter of July 22, 1964, in which you reported observing an unusual object in the Littleston, Illinois area.

We would appreciate receiving any additional details you can supply, such as the exact time, duration, direction of movement, color, size, shape, and altitude of the object. This information would be most helpful in our efforts to determine the nature of the sighting.

Sincerely,
