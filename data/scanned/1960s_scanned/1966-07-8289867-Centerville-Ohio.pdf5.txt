TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1966
CENTERVILLE, OHIO 7 JULY 1966
Case should have been followed up. Only a local phone call would have been necessary. There were four witnesses: man and wife and two children. Now, more than two years later, a follow-up hardly seems needed.
Since many objects were observed all in one place, not moving around-and an explosion was heard-one wonders, in view of the closeness to July 4, whether this could have been a belated July 4th celebration. 
"Upside down coffee cups" suggest parachutes, perhaps some toy consisting of small parachutes on the way down.  
I have seen children toys consisting of small rockets which eject a small parachute on the way down.
I think this sort of explanation has equal weight to "possible aircraft". Aircraft do not look like upside down coffee cups, and do not explode (well, rarely!).
