THE ATTITUDE OF THE AIR FORCE WITH
RESPECT TO THE UFO PROBLEM: OFFICIAL
POLICY, PAST AND PRESENT
1. LACK OF A UNIFIED GOVERNMENT POLICY
Since the closing of Project Blue Book, the Air Force has
clearly indicated that it regards the UFO problem as "closed"
in the sense that it no longer considers UFO reports to be a
matter of direct operational concern to the military. This
policy has been publicly stated on a number of occasions by
various Air Force spokesmen. However, it must be emphasized
that this policy represents the attitude of the Air Force
only, and does not necessarily reflect the views of other
government agencies which may still be actively interested in
UFO phenomena.
2. REASONS FOR AIR FORCE POLICY SHIFT
The reasons for the Air Force's apparent change in
attitude toward UFOs can be attributed to several factors:
a. Exhaustion of Investigative Leads
After more than 20 years of intensive UFO investigations
by Project Blue Book and its predecessor projects, the Air
Force concluded that no tangible evidence had been produced
which would alter the scientific community's sceptical
attitude toward the existence of extraterrestrial visitations.
The gradual exhaustion of promising investigative leads and
the Air Force's inability to provide clear-cut explanations
for many UFO reports led the service to conclude that further
investigations were unlikely to yield any startling new
discoveries.
b. Civilian Research and Investigation
With the cessation of Project Blue Book, the emphasis
for UFO research and investigation has shifted to civilian
research groups and individual investigators. The Air Force
apparently feels that this civilian effort, combined with the
large volume of UFO reports now being handled by the National
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program of the Center for UFO
Studies, is adequate to deal with the UFO problem from a
research standpoint.
