The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sirs,

Recently I have had occasion to look into a matter which I believe may have some significance. This I have not a photo or print to bring in as some of these have appeared, seemingly to have been very true, but I have a little to tell and you might find it worthwhile investigating.

Sometime ago, while on a trip up North Central Pennsylvania in search of a lead, I got a little tired and stopped to rest. While here I saw a strange object high in the clear sky, seemingly circular and at times reflected light at various angles. It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen and I am familiar with most type. Some of these have been reported but I'd hard to tell if they are real or imagined. I realize I cannot describe this accurately, but is quite unlike anything I have witnessed before. I would caution you not to make an open report before you have checked thoroughly as no doubt you have had many of these reports and you know how wise we must be. If this has any significance, I would be glad to cooperate and would appreciate a word from you on the matter.

Sincerely yours,
