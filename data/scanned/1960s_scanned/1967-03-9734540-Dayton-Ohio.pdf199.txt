Dear Mr. [Redacted],

This replies to your letter reporting your unidentified flying object sighting.

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will add it to our files. However, it is important that a witness report his observation as soon as possible after the sighting. This enables the Air Force to make a thorough investigation while the incident is still fresh in the observer's mind.

I do not see that you saw - but it was obviously not familiar to you -- and appears out of the ordinary to the observer.

Thank you very much for your interest in our program. A copy of the report on Project Blue Book is enclosed for your information.

Sincerely,

BARNETT E. YOUNG
CHIEF, CIVIL BRANCH
COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIVISION
OFFICE OF INFORMATION
