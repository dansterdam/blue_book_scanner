UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
Flower and Cook Observatory

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

Your letters of 27 September, 1968, which refer to our letter of 29 September, 1968, have been received. I do not have any information about a UFO sighting near Minden, Nebraska on 6 March 1968.

The Annual A.A.A.S. Report for 1967, which was sent earlier, was completely routine. Several circulars were also included, but they did not refer to any UFO sightings.

Sincerely yours,
Charles P. Oliver
