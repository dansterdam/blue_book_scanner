1. The information pertaining to the radar portion of this sighting indicates that it was observed by ground radar and disappeared at 15-20 minutes (visually, apparently, for 31 minutes) at a range of 25 miles and disappeared at 10,000 feet. 

2. With no course information, speeds, etc., reported there is no positive way of determining a possible national origin. If there were some indication as to whether conditions for the visual sighting were similar to the radar conditions, it might be possible to remain more certain that the sighting was of the same object. As it is, the discrepancy between the radar and visual observations as to duration, altitude, etc., makes it difficult to assess the true nature of the observation.
