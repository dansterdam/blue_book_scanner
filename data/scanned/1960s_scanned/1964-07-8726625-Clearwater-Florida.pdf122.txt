SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT(S) (CLEARWATER, FLORIDA) 16 JULY 64

1. REFERENCE LETTER 9268TH AIR RESERVE SQUADRON (USAF) 15 JULY 64, PERTAINING TO ABOVE SUBJECT.

2. WITH REFERENCE TO DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT AS SET FORTH IN THIS PARTICULAR LETTER, MY COMMENTS AND OPINIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

OBSERVATIONS: THE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT AS RELATED BY THE SEVERAL OBSERVERS (PILOT AND OTHERS) INDICTES THE OBSERVATION OF AN OBJECT IN THE SKY WHICH POSSESSED UNUSUAL CHARACTERISTICS. THESE CHARACTERISTICS WERE APPARENT TO A NUMBER OF TRAINED OBSERVERS AND CANNOT BE LIGHTLY DISMISSED WITHOUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

EVALUATION: BASED UPON THE DETAILED DESCRIPTION PROVIDED, AN EVALUATION OF THE INCIDENT WOULD TEND TO INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS OF UNCONVENTIONAL OR UNUSUAL NATURE, POSSIBLY SUGGESTING SOME FORM OF UNCONVENTIONAL OR UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON. FURTHER INVESTIGATION MAY BE WARRANTED TO MORE FULLY EXPLORE AND DOCUMENT THE DETAILS OF THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT.

3. YOUR CONCURRENCE IN THIS CASE IS APPRECIATED.
