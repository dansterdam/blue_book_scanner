Dear Sirs:

I am 12 years old and I am very interested in rockets and UFO's. On Sept. 2 I saw a late movie on flying saucer reports.

This movie mentioned an incident that I wanted to tell you about. The object that flew over Cincinnati might have been a "Flying Saucer".

One of the UFO's in this movie changed its color while travelling through the air. It changed form white to amber.

I saw the same UFO when it first came out of the northeast and headed southwest. However, the color was very bit as fast as the changing of the object in the movie.

In the movie I was telling you about, the object changed color. When I first saw the UFO it was white and was heading towards Cincinnati.

I would like to know if you think that the object I saw could be like the one in the movie.

I would also like to know if you know what it is or would you call it a UFO.

Thank you very much.

Yours truly,
