MAY 22, 1961. IT IS A.M. ON MONDAY, MAY 22, 1961, AN OVOID ALUMINUM COLORED OBJECT 50 FEET IN DIAMETER SILENTLY OVER A THINLY POPULATED AREA OF SANTA TERESA DEL TUY SIXMIN(?)SOME 20 MILES SOUTHEAST OF CARACAS, AND LANDED ON A HILL NEAR THE SITE OF EARTH-MOVING OPERATIONS IN THE AREA. DARILED ENGINEERS, TOPOGRAPHERS AND A POLICE OFFICER THEY SAID IT GAVE A PATH OF LIGHT IN THE AIR AND DROPPED TREES AND FLYING IT ALONG SOME 25-30 FEET IN THE AIR OVER A STRETCH OF "GAMELOTE" GRASS. ONE OF THE OBSERVERS STATED THAT AS HE WAS CATCHING UP WITH IT JUST IN TIME TO SEE IT DUCK BEHIND A HILLOCK, AS WELL AS THE ROAD HE SAID HE GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT HAD REACHED A BEND IN THE ROAD. FURTHER IN THE DISTANCE, ON REACHING THE SPOT LATER, HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE TALL GAMELOTE GRASS COVERING THE GROUND WAS FLATTENED TOWARD THE CENTER OF A CIRCULAR AREA ABOUT SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER. ANSWERS TO INQUIRIES BY INVESTIGATORS INDICATED THAT THESE SIMILAR OBJECTS HAD BEEN OBSERVED TRAVERSING THE SAME ROUTE THE DAY BEFORE. AN ITALIAN LIEUTENANT AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT CORPS, ALSO SAW THE OBJECT. HE TOLD SANTANA THAT IT WAS SIMILAR TO A HELICOPTER BUT WITHOUT MOTORS AND SEEMED TO BE MOVING IN A SORT OF "WHITE CLOUD" WITH FUZZY EDGES CENTERED MOVEMENT INVESTIGATED AND FOUND THAT THE FLATTENED GRASS THERE PHOTOGRAPHED THE AREA, AND FURTHER EXAMINATION SHOWED THAT THE ROOTS OF THE GRASS APPEARED TO BE BURNED.
