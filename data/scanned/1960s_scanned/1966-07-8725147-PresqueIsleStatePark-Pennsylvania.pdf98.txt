PTD Duty Officer called three different times to inform me that Captain called and wanted a breakdown of the UFO sighting in Erie, Pa. I asked OD to call Captain Meier back and to tell him our office would call him at 0730 or 0800 hours in the morning on 3 August 1966. 

Again O.D. called back and stated Capt Meier called him and wanted to know if he should go to Erie, Pa. that he could only get a statement from the observers and she didn't make too much sense. The other girl was to Erie to present interview and I told the OD to call him back at the girls house tomorrow, 3 August 1966.

Again: O.D. called and said Capt Meier called him again and said if he went at the time stated we were going to call the other observers home for the statement required by us. O.D. requested that either Lt Marley or myself give Capt Meier a call.

2115(L) I called Capt Meier and gave him a brief summary of the sight. He stated that the girl he spoke to did not make much sense, all she was saying that it sounded like a jet engine going on and off right away. Told Capt Meier as soon as he got the other observers statements to call collect and he said he would give us a rundown of what the girl told him.

2145(L) Received another call from the O.D. he was here and he stated that Juan called and wanted to know about the M/Sgt Hall from Project Blue Book and I informed the O.D. if they want me to call them back to tell them to call our office from 0715 - 1600. The O.D. wanted to know if it would be okay is he said Project Blue Book. And I said that's Okay.
