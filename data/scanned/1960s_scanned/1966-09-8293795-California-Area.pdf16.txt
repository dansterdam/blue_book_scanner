Naturally I expect you read my letter! I looked over your instructions and other details the same as you wrote them. Since I am not easily excited I have been in a normal campaign. I have been in a few campaigns but I felt this attack was peculiar. However, I am not familiar with the details and I felt to avoid committing myself. Please keep me advised!

Sincerely
