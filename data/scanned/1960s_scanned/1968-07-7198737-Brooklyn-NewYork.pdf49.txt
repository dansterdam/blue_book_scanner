The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text found in the document is as follows:

"Lt Col Quintanilla/70316/mns/9 Sep 68

References your photographs of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which you submitted to this office on 27 July 1968. If you desire a photographic analysis, this material will be so completed on your sighting. Upon receipt of this material, it will be forwarded to the Photographic Analysis Section, who will make a photographic analysis of the pictures. You will receive the results of this analysis to your 27 July sighting, and for no other date later. I need to mention this information, and have told them that you want your pictures analyzed. 

3. Reference your unidentified observations that are occurring almost nightly: 
a. Telephone calls from you, since the local UFO investigator is in a minor condition, we are unable to conduct an investigation under this circumstances. We suggest that you contact another investigator in your area, if you should have any further sightings.

a. Stewart AFB, New York, area code 914 John 2-1300

b. Suffolk County AFB, New York, area code 516, Westhampton 5-1900.

Since your sighting and reports on the object seen are observing, these observations may be misinterpreting natural phenomena, which as astronomical bodies, conditions, etc."
