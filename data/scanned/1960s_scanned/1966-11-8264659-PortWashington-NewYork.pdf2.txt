Dear Washington: 77.41, 1550

Re: c. u. f. o.

It was seen at 6:03" p.m. There was low stratus cloud cover, visibility approximately 1Â½ miles. The object appeared to be 800-1000 feet above the ground and was traveling in a straight line at an estimated speed of 100-150 mph. It was shaped something like an "anvil" though somewhat rounded at the top. The color was a whitish luminescent glow. The object was visible for about 1 minute and then disappeared completely. No sound was noted. The object was seen by 2 observers, both of whom are considered reliable. One observer was a retired naval officer. The other was a retired businessman. Both are personal friends of the writer.
