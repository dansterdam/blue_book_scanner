The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with several questions about the observed UFO.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or one's length in line with a known object at the distance the object is observed from. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the color, size, number, relative position, etc., of the object as you observed it. Please do not make the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
