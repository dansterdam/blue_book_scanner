SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED SURFACE FLARE
SIGHTED DURING TEST 1802 REC

Dear Sir:

A bright surface flare was observed in the immediate vicinity of the recovery operation during Test 1802. This persisted for approximately 10 seconds.

Range Controller personnel reported this to be an air-borne light dropped to a controlled illumination by a shore-based launcher at the time the Ship Operations Manager had confirmed the flare, it was too late to photograph it.
