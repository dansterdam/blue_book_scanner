The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text content of the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - low roar, rather slow escape
b. Color - unusual silvery, bright, rapid flashing, light

17. Draw a picture or sketch and give details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Object itself was not visible even the result of illumination by its own lighting. It appeared to be some distance away and very high, flashing at frequent intervals in a manner that suggest a regularly pulsed, rotating or flashing light source. Characterized by a peculiar "dancing" motion of its flashing light, rather than a steady beam or glow. This motion and flashing effect was noted by the observer to continue for several minutes before the object disappeared from sight.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Fuzzy or blurred
b. Like a bright star
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
