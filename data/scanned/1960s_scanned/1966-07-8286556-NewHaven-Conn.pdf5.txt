The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this image. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? YES!

IT DISAPPEAR SIX TIMES BEHIND A TWO STORY BUILDING!

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): YES No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: (SIX TIMES) A 2 STORY BUILDING

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: NONE
b. Color: PART OF A WHITE OR A SILVER

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match or pencil at arm's length in line with the object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
MOST OF THE OBJECT

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
