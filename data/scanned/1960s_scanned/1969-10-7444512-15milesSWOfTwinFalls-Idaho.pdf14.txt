SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR STREET LAMPS. FOR NIGHT SIGHTINGS, INDICATE WHETHER IT WAS MOONLIGHT.

Give a full description of the phenomenon, indicating whether it appeared dark or light, whether it was self-luminous and what colors you noticed. Describe your impression of what it looked like, how it moved, how you estimated its size and distance, and anything else that will help in evaluating the report.

It first appeared to be a steady light about the size of a dime at arm's length. It gradually increased in size until it was about as large as a basketball at arm's length. It then started oscillating, changing color from white to red to green. Sometimes it appeared stationary, other times it moved slowly. Moments later it suddenly disappeared from sight. Its direction of travel was approximately south.

The observer felt a strange sensation during the sighting, as if some form of energy was being emitted by the object. He said, "It was like being under a high tension line, it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up".
