TRANSCRIPT OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HYNEK & 

Hello, Mr. 
Yes sir.
Hi, this is Allen Hynek at Northwestern University.
How are you, Dr. Hynek?
Fine. I didn't call earlier because I was detained. I'm very happy to have your letter which I got just today as a matter of fact (yes sir) and just in time to make the call. Your case there is a very interesting one and I would like to get more details. I have the report here, as it came from Moody Air Force Base and it's a very sketchy report. Let me tell you briefly what it says, and then you can probably fill me in.
Description of object: Oblong shape; Length: 40 or 50 yards; white, resembled a rounded football on its side. As UFO approached vehicle engine died and all electrical equipment failed. A beam of light was emitted from object. Loud static on auto radio tuned to a station that normally comes in clear. Object departed straight up at high rate of speed. Went completely out of sight in 15 seconds. And, essentially, that's about all. What I'd like to ask, if you are agreeable, to just sort of back, take a deep breath and, in your own words, just give me a narrative account filling in the details that certainly the report doesn't have. Can you do that now?
Yes, I'd be glad to. (Fine) Col. Gaduc(?), I believe, that came up and he had one of the standard forms that he wanted filled out. It was just a questionnaire form and I just answered the questions to the best of my ability.
Well, those questionnaires are certainly helpful in many respects, but I find that in my own work with the UFO problem that I like to start with just the narrative account of what happened. What a person was and what happened.
