December 13, 1966
Fancesville, Pa.
Dear Sir,
Again I must tell you of a strange sighting that I have. On October 28, 1966, I saw a strange object in the sky. It was about 6:30 p.m. and the object was about 5 miles away and traveling at a speed of approximately 1200 m.p.h. The object was cigar-shaped and had a brilliant bluish-white light on the front and a reddish light on the rear. The object was traveling in a straight line and I watched it for about 2 minutes before it disappeared. I have heard no reply from my previous report so I am writing this one to you.
I have heard so many of these that I can hardly believe my own. I hope this report will be of some interest to your files.
Yours sincerely,
[Redacted]
P.S. I've more spectacular photos to send - when not SEND ADDITIONAL UNTIL YOU - .
