The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is as follows:

September 2, 1964

Dear [redacted],

This is in reply to your recent letter, some of the details of which we discussed in our telephone conversation.

It is possible that you were watching the same small light airplanes as mentioned. Their unusual appearance may be due to certain atmospheric conditions.

Thank you for reporting this observation.

Sincerely,

MASON M. JACKS
