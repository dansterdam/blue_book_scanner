Dear Major Quintanilla:

On October 18, 1967, the Tower recorded thirty (30) operations between 6:20 PM and 7:05 PM local time, these activities which involved 4 civilian locals, 4 Navy personnel, and 4 Navy locals. On October 19, 1967, the Tower recorded ten (10) local time, 5 operations, involved individuals were observed at the Airport. The flights were at a low altitude while landings or take-offs were accomplished.

None of the air traffic controllers in the Tower saw anything unusual. There were no reports received at the Airport on these occasions.

We have no theories or explanations as to why an observer recorded sightings of an unusual nature on the nights of October 18-19, 1967.

Very truly yours,

William P. Wilder
Airport Manager
