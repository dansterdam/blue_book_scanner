REPORT ON THE SAUGER LANDING AT GLASSBORO,N.J.
Mysterious holes left in the ground by a flying 
saucer, which landed near Glassboro, N.J. The holes were 15 feet apart and 12 inches deep. The main hole (foreground) is 12 feet wide. The object was silver-colored. On the ridge in the background, near the trees, the witness, an oil man, who was told about the incident by his son, saw the saucer taking off. The witness could not get to the landing site in time, but his son told him all about it.
