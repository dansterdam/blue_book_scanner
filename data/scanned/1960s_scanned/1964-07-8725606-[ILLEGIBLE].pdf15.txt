27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the sketch where the object was shown to be in relation to the horizon (skyline) when you FIRST saw it. Please draw a line from the "X" to the place where you LAST saw the object.

29. This picture will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
