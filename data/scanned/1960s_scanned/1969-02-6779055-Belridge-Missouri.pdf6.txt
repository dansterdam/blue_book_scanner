The image contains two sketches or illustrations:

1. A compass-like diagram showing directions, with labels for the cardinal and intermediate directions.

2. Two sketches depicting landscapes, with a person standing in the foreground of each sketch.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "T" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "T" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. SKETCH A SOLID LINE TO REPRESENT THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON, IF POSSIBLE. IF NOT, SKETCH A BROKEN LINE TO SHOW THE APPROXIMATE COURSE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
