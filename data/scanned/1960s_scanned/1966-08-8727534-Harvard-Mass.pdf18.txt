The text in the document says:

"This was the report about the sighting which occurred to me and my wife on the evening of August 8, 1966 in Harvard, Mass. We were returning home from a trip to New York City and were about 30 miles from our home when we noticed an object in the sky which seemed to be traveling at a very rapid rate of speed at an altitude of approximately 2000-3000 feet. The object was bright white in color and shaped like a half moon. It was moving in a southerly direction across the sky. After watching it for a few seconds it seemed to suddenly stop and then resume its southerly movement. It was visible for approximately 1 minute. We were both quite impressed by what we had seen and felt that it was some type of Unidentified Flying Object. We reported the incident to the United States Air Force and a representative came to our home and interviewed us about the sighting. The representative seemed to be interested in what we had observed and requested that we submit this written report of the incident. This is the report that I am now submitting to the Department of the Air Force."
