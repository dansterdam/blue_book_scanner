There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a blank document page from an old Project Blue Book file.

The text found in the document is:

IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE SHAPE, SIZE, COLOR, SPEED, AND TRAJECTORY OF A REPORTED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, OBJECT WAS STUDIED AND ANALYZED IN DETAIL, HOWEVER, NO PHOTOGRAPH OF THE OBJECT WAS OBTAINED. 

However, on the bottom of the page, there is a handwritten note that says: "Oh take it and we will have a time."
