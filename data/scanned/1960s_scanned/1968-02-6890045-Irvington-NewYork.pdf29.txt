INTERVIEW WITH
was interviewed separately from and after The interview took place in the town of Vashon
He stated that he was with a group, observing the object. He reports that they parked the car on the main road and walked, via the access road, to the gravel pit area. Both of the witnesses stated the object as they rounded the curve of the road leading into the area.

The object was described to be lens shaped, about the size of a compact station wagon and made of shiny bright metal. He had difficulty defining the quality of the lights, but insisted on describing it as having the quality of reflected light (light not being generated within the object). He further stated that the object was on the ground, a little to the left (east) of the pond. No sound was heard.

Estimated duration of the observation was ten seconds. He reported that he looked away from the object towards his car and found that he had gone. As this point, he ran back to the car to find it was warming and ready to leave.

Both youths drove back to town (Vashon) and brought more people out to the gravel pit area. The object was gone when they returned. The ice covering the pond was discovered shortly thereafter and the sheriff was notified.
