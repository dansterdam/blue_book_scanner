(PAUSE) WHEN IT WAS QUITE AWAYS OFF IT SEEMED PRETTY SMALL. 
WHEN IT GOT CLOSE ENOUGH YOU COULD TELL IT WAS FAIRLY LARGE. WELL, I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T ESTIMATE HOW BIG IT REALLY WAS SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS, BUT ANYWAY, HOW FAR AWAY DO YOU THINK IT WAS WHEN IT WAS THE CLOSEST?
WHEN IT WAS CLOSE, IT WAS PRETTY BIG, AND I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
NOW IT SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT IT NEVER GOT VERY HIGH IN THE SKY AND THAT IT WAS ALWAYS CLOSE TO THE HORIZON. IS THAT CORRECT?
WELL, WHEN I FIRST SAW IT, IT WAS PRETTY HIGH, AND IT WAS COMING AT AN ANGLE TOWARDS US, AND THEN IT GOT HIGH UP WHEN I LOOKED.
HOW COME YOU NEVER SAW IT LEAVE?
WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO CRASH OR SOMETHING, AND I HEADED BACK INTO THE BARN, TOO.
OH, I SEE, SO BOTH OF YOU HEADED INTO THE BARN?
WELL, YES, SIR, THAT'S RIGHT. I DON'T BLAME YOU AT ALL, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN SCARED, TOO. WHAT COLOR WAS IT?
OH, IT WAS JUST LUMINOUS, YOU KNOW. 
OH, YES. HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU TELL ABOUT IT, AND WHAT DID THEY THINK?
WELL, THE FIRST THING I DID WHILE IT WAS THERE - SO WE HAD TO TAKE IT PRETTY EASY, I REMEMBERED - WE HAVE A DOG, AND HE SHOOK UP, BUT HE WAS JUST LAUGHING ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT. (PAUSE BUT AT THIS POINT) 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE?
NEVER HAVE.
WOULD YOU WANT TO?
NOW THAT IT HAPPENED I WOULD SORT OF LIKE TO HAVE A PICTURE JUST TO PROVE THAT I SAW IT.
WELL, THAT WOULD BE AWFULLY NICE OF COURSE. I THINK OF PEOPLE BELIEVE ME.
IN THE REPORT I DIDN'T GET A PICTURE OF THE OBJECT. I DO HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS, THE GENERAL LANDSCAPE, BUT I NEVER DID GET A DRAWING OF THE OBJECT ITSELF. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SKETCH IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND SEND IT TO ME, THE ADDRESS HERE IS VERY SIMPLE. IT IS SIMPLY THE ASTRONAUT DEPARTMENT NORTHWEST NORTHEAST, AND THAT WOULD BE ALL. I'D LIKE TO SEE IT, AND ALSO, LET ME HAVE ANY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO ADD. JUST SEE WHAT WAS THE SKY LIKE, WAS THE MOON OUT?
WELL, IT WAS PARTLY CLOUDY IN THE WEST AND CLEAR IN THE EAST.
THE MOON WAS OUT, I BELIEVE, A LITTLE BIT, AND I BELIEVE IT WAS THE MOON.
