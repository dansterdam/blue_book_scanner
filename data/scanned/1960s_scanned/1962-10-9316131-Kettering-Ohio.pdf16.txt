'Strange' Flying Objects
Seen Over W. Colorado

GUNNISON, Colo. - F or the third night in a row, mysterious bright objects have been seen in the sky over West Colorado by scores of reliable persons. Their strange behavior has renewed interest in reports of "flying saucers" in this area.

The objects are first sighted about 8 p.m. and remain visible for more than an hour, according to observers. They appear to be circular, glowing reddish-orange objects, moving at high speeds and making sharp turns. Sometimes they stop momentarily, then dart away at tremendous speed.

The objects are not believed to be aircraft, astronomers say, as their actions are quite unlike anything known to aerial vehicles. Witnesses have included business and professional men, farmers and ranchers, policemen and other trained observers.

In another Colorado town this week, two Larimer County residents reported sighting a luminous, egg-shaped object that hovered for a time and then took off at a high rate of speed. It was 50 to 60 feet in diameter and weighed an estimated 200 to 300 pounds, they said.
