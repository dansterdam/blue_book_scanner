TRUCK DRIVER CHASED BY FLYING SAUCER IN KANSAS: One of the weirdest incidents of the current saucer-side film occurred about 25 miles south of Abilene, Kansas, shortly before 2 a.m. on the morning of August 4th. Don Tennyson, a truck driver from Bartlesville, Oklahoma, reported that he was driving south on Highway 15 when all of his lights suddenly went out. He then noticed an object passed just in front of the truck with a "sizzling or whirling" sound, going above the sound barrier, clearing his truck by about 10 feet. The mysterious object was only about 15 feet in diameter, orange in color, and was moving at a great rate of speed. It seemed to be about ten feet thick, with a deep, wide, four-foot-high hump or dome in the middle. This protrusion was completely unnerved by the experience, but he was not sure on this point.
