On the evening of Thursday, 2 March, 1961, at about 7:30 to 7:45 PM, I observed a streak of light in the eastern sky. My location was my back yard at North College Hill, Cincinnati, Ohio. Startled by chance and was not sky watching. I was looking directly east at the object which appeared to be traveling due north in a horizontal path and was situated at about a 30 degree elevation.

It had the impression of viewing it head-on at it was visible to me for about 5 seconds. It was visible to me for about 5 seconds and disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. Appeared as a distinct outline somewhat elliptical in shape and smaller than an average star, estimated size 20 angular minutes more or less.
