June 13, 1966
I had the most strange experi-
ence. As my wife and I were driving 
along, my wife said she saw a bright 
light in the sky. I saw it too, and it 
seemed to be coming nearer and
nearer. As we watched it, it suddenly 
went out. We were so amazed that 
we called my son Richard, who came 
over to our house. He said he saw the
same light, and he said it was an 
unusual experience. 
I have never seen anything
like it before. The light seemed to be
like a basketball, and it was hovering
over the trees. It seemed very close. 
I could not give any explanation
for what we saw, but we all saw it.
Richard said, "And no one can
say we are crazy."
Particular Wero said
I am going to record this experi-
ence, because it is unusual and
something that many people have been
seeing. I think that there are more
people who have seen things like this 
that they do not tell about. I feel 
that I should record this, because
there may be something like this 
happening, that people do not tell
about. If they tell about it, they
are likely to be criticized and made
fun of, as people who say they see
something unusual are often treated.
I should not have to be afraid to tell
about something I have seen, if it is
the truth. The people in this area have
been seeing something like this for
some time, and I feel I should record
this experience, so that if there are
other people who have seen the same
thing, they will know they are not alone.
