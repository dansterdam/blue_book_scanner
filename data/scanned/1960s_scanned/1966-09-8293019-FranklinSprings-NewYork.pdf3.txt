The image contains a hand-drawn illustration of a UFO or unidentified flying object. The illustration shows a cross-section view of the object, labeled with various color designations for different parts, such as "YELLOW LITE", "RED GREEN LITES", and "GREEN LITES BLACK".

Below the illustration, there is a handwritten letter that appears to be describing the UFO sighting. The text mentions that the writer is enclosing a sketch of the object they witnessed, and provides some details about its appearance and behavior.

As an OCR system, the text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sirs,
This is what I saw the other nite wile returning home. The nite was very clear and I saw this object very clearly. It was oblong in shape and seemed to remain motionless for some time at a very low level and then suddenly shot up at terrific speed. I could not determine the exact shape or whether it had any markings on it due to the rapidity of its movement. 
It seemed to have a glow that lit up the area. I wanted to take another look but it was gone. But nothing has happened since.
