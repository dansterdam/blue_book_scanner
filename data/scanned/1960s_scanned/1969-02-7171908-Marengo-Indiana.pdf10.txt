A. DO YOU NORMALLY WEAR GLASSES? [ ] YES [ ] NO
B. DESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW, INCLUDING SPEED AND DURATION OF THE PHENOMENON. GIVE ESTIMATE OF SPEED: 25 mph.
The object was visible for about 2 or 3 seconds. It appeared to be rather low and large, difficult to judge the actual distance, but it was dark and looked as if it were about 50 to 100 feet in diameter. It had a distinct circular shape with no protruding parts that could be discerned. It appeared to be a dark gray or black in color, and it seemed to travel silently, with no exhaust or vapor trail. The object had a peculiar motion, not exactly straight-line, but a kind of wavy or oscillating motion, but could not be called erratic. It seemed to be under some kind of intelligent control and had a purposeful movement. At no time did it appear to reflect any light, and it did not seem to have any lights of its own. I could not estimate the actual speed, but it appeared to be moving at a rather rapid rate, perhaps 25 or 30 mph, as I mentioned. The object passed behind some trees and was lost from view. I saw no other aircraft in the vicinity at that time.
21. DID YOU NOTICE ANY ODOR, NOISE, OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF?
The object was completely silent, and I noticed no accompanying heat, light, or noise.
A. DID THE PHENOMENON DISTURB THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? [ ] YES [ ] NO
IF YES, DESCRIBE:
