Dear Sir:

Last night (April 5, 1967) at about 9:30 P.M. I notified a police dept. in the Greater Cincinnati area about a ight in the sky which I observed over Springfield, Ohio Towers of a that is my belief that it might have been an V.F.0. Inasmuch as my report to the police dept. I have reason to believe that it is my duty to inform the Proj. Blue Book of this occurrence.

The observed light was orange or red in color and in my opinion was travelling at a speed and altitude which would rule aut a conventional aircraft. The light was in view for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. It moved in an erratic and zigzag pattern and was visible over the Springfield, Ohio area before it disappeared.

Although I realize that this may be of little importance to the Proj. Blue Book program, I felt it was my responsibility to report this sighting to you.

Sincerely yours,
