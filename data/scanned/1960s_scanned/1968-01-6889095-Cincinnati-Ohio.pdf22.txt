12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT WAS ROTATING, STATIONARY OR MOVING, ETC. WHAT OTHER OBJECTS DID YOU NOTICE IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW? WAS THIS THE ONLY OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW?
None brighter and appeared about the size of the brightest stars. Although it varied in intensity through 7x35 binoculars, no edges or other details could be observed. They appeared to be flashing, but synchronization. My original impression was that they were a radio tower with red lights, but, of course, I know there was more at that direction.
