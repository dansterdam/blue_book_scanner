MEMORANDUM

September 6, 1963

SUBJECT: [redacted] of New York City called about 
3:30 p.m. today.

He advised that he sent you 133-g5g 
UFO pictures about three weeks ago, and wanted to
know why he had not received any acknowledgment.

He asked him why he had not written you,
as he had previously informed him that he'd written you.
He said therefore he was writing you again.

If you have his pix, suppose he now has them? If
not, let him know if and when you receive them.

Jo G.
