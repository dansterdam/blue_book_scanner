The image provided appears to contain a diagram or sketch, but does not contain any photographs. The diagram shows a view from the rear of a police department, looking west, with annotations indicating the location of a Casselberry Utilities water tower and a strong light, as well as a description of the movement of an observed "control" star.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:
