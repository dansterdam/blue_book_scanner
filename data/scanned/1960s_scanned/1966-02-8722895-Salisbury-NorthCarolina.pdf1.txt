11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a silver colored object, without noise, moving at a constant speed, descending and ascending at a fast and unusual rate, not in a straight line but darting around in different directions, alighting on the ground for approximately 15 seconds, and taking off straight up and disappearing in the night sky. The object had revolving lights that seemed to be coming from its exterior. The object hovered after landing for about 15 minutes, then moved off to the north. The weather was clear.
