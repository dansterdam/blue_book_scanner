My Lawrance Fisher, a Crop Farmer of St. Louis, Missouri states:
At about 8:00 P.M. I was on my farm in St. Louis, Missouri and noticed a small round light in the sky coming from the West and traveling very fast. It appeared to be about the size of a basketball and had a bluish-white color and no visible means of propulsion. It made no sound and disappeared in about 5-6 seconds, traveling at a very high rate of speed. I was completely surprised and somewhat startled by what I saw.

It did not disturb me physically in any way, nor did it leave any physical evidence. I have no idea what it was, but it was definitely not an airplane, satellite, or any other known object that I am familiar with. I have never seen anything like this before.
