The image appears to be a weather map or chart. It contains a large main map with various isobars and weather patterns depicted, as well as a smaller chart or map in the lower part of the image. The main map shows patterns of high and low pressure systems across a geographical area, likely the United States. The smaller chart in the lower portion appears to display additional weather data or information, but I cannot make out the specific details.
