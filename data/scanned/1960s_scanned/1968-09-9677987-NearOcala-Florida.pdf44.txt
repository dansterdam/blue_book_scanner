1.  At approximately 0052Z, 16 September 1968, Lt Colonel Crandall, Chief Intelligence Division, was informed by a call from the 306 Bomb Wing, Clovis AFB, New Mexico, that a G-string-clad William aircraft, S/N 53616, had reported a sighting of a UFO in the vicinity of Ocala, Florida.  Colonel Crandall was requested to release this information again for further investigation.  As this information did not meet the minimum criteria for unusual observation, Colonel Crandall was requested to discontinue any further investigative action on this matter.

2.  On 17 September 1968, Lt Colonel Crandall was contacted on the telephone by Captain Haibach of the USAF, SAGE Center, 32 Aer Division (SAGE). Captain Haibach stated he had some information on a ground UFO lighting at O52Z on 16 Sep 68.  The information, released by the 306 Bomb Wing, stated that this sighting and reporting was valid.  During the conversation it was determined that this was the same sighting and reporting referred to in paragraph 1 above.  Captain Haibach requested that Colonel Crandall furnish all information he might have on the sighting.  Captain Haibach stated that he had previously coordinated this information between the 20th Air Division Headquarters and others, and that Lt Colonel Crandall should be aware of it.  However, because the tape was practically inaudible on the telephone Colonel Crandall stated he would transcribe the conversation and send the transcript to Captain Haibach and this office.

3. Presence of sighted object is not explainable by this office.
