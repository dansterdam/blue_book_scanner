SUBJECT:
Request for UFO Information

FOR:	US ASIP IA-3 (Mr. e)

The Smithsonian Institute has forwarded us a letter from Mr. G. Dodd of Gainesville, Georgia. The following information is provided: On 4 July 1964, the object was observed by several residents of Gainesville and was reported to the Air Force; however, it is indicated that no official report was made.

The object was observed at about 2200 hours and was described as a normal size circular object with a definite outline and color similar to a flashlight. The object was rated as very bright and brilliant - bright enough to illuminate the area. There are four lamps on the object and it was silent and motionless during the entire observation which lasted for about 15 minutes. The object was evaluated as not attributable to ball lightning. The cause of this sighting remains unknown.

The grass sample submitted with the article and letter contained nothing unusual from that of a normal grass sample.

The newspaper article of the Gainesville sighting is the first official report on this case. No previous reports were made to the Air Force on these sightings; therefore, no evaluation is being made at this time.
