The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, which seems to document a sighting of a "bright object" on July 8, 1961 at 12:49Z, traveling from south to north, with a possible satellite re-entry. The report evaluates the sighting as "no threat" and includes some location information and internal references.
