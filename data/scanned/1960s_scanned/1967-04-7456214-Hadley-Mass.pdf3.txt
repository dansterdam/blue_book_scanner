There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a handwritten letter or report from Project Blue Book.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

When I got back to my office, I wrote down what I saw right away, because it was amazing. It was just a light. When it got behind the tree, it disappeared for a while, then came back, then disappeared again. It must have been some kind of object, because I could see it moving more than once. I don't know exactly what I saw, but I would be grateful if you were back to take a look.

Thank you for your kind consideration of this letter.

Your close friend

P.S. Please excuse the place where the pen slipped and there was not a good enough place to cover it up with an erased stain. I was in a bit of a hurry to write it all down while it was fresh in my mind.
