The text of the document is as follows:

On Aug 19, Major White set a new altitude record of 26,390 feet in the XB-70A #3 which he developed. This marked the 28th test flight of the XB-70A aircraft.

On Aug 18, Capt Joseph Kittinger Jr. performed a record breaking feat when he made a balloon ascent to 102,800 feet, or 19.5 miles and descended to earth, landing in the New Mexico desert and destroyed a GB-47 drone aircraft.

The period of unprecedented unusual air activity began on Aug 15 when the XB 70A capsule was first made public. Two days later Capt Kittinger, a research project officer at the Aerospace Medical Division, Headquarters at Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, made a record breaking jump. His 1960 parachute descent reached a peak speed of 614 mph, the highest speed ever attained by a human in free fall. His aerial acrobatics and plunge to earth were recorded on Nov 16, 1960.

The XLV capsule carried a 12-man test crew, including a captain, six lieutenants, four airmen, and the commanding officer, a colonel. After landing, the capsule was deemed acceptable for astronaut training. Members of Captain Mitchell's "military team" were present at the test to greet the capsule and crew on their return to earth.

Major and Mrs. Robert A. White, who had gained national fame as the first man to fly the X-15 rocket aircraft, maintained a keen interest in Kittinger's venture. Prior to the jumping, Col. John P. Stapp and Dr. Paul A. Campbell examined Kittinger and pronounced him fit for the historic leap.

Sgt. Airman Howard, Sgt. Airman Herman, and Sgt. Airman Bard were recognized as AMC crew members who assisted in the mission. selected General Schriever presented Sgt Howell with a Citation and Silver Star on April 27, 1961 for his part in the record breaking jump.

The fifth and final of these record-setting events occurred for Colonel Robert M. White on June 9, 1961. He was the first man to fly more than 4,000 mph, setting a new speed record for manned aircraft. The Air Force termed his flight "the greatest single advancement in manned flight since the Wright Brothers".
