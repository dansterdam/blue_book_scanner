Vehicles appeared to lower in elevation by at least 200 feet or more over the minutes. They showed a pulsing type of light, varying in brightness, and a series of short light flashes to the South or the object. Three or four distinct objects were visible at the same time, illuminating the sky over a wide area. They were seen to disappear and reappear at irregular intervals, watched for an additional 45 minutes. No further physical evidence was available.
