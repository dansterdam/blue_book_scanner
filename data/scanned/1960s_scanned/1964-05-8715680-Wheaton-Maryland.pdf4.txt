May 25, 1964

Dear  

1964 in which you forwarded a newspaper clipping stating that your office had received a report of an alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object. Since your office had no reports on this matter, we thought it best to acknowledge receipt of your letter and to inform you that this office has no connection with the investigation of UFO sightings.

With specialized descriptions of the phenomenon, investigation of UFO sightings will be made by the Condon Committee under the contract with the University of Colorado. Accordingly, we must refer you to that investigation for any connection between the Condon Committee and UFO sightings.

Sincerely,

MASTON H. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division

Bluffton, Indiana
