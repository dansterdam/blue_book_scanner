The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains text describing an incident.

The full text of the document is as follows:

"WE SAT THERE AND LOOKED AT IT FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES.  MY SISTER KEPT SAYING 'IT DOESN'T DISAPPEAR" AND IT DIDN'T, WE WATCHED IT UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT. LIKE I SAID, IT WAS THE BIGGEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN THE SKY.

THERE WAS AN ABOUT 100 FEET AWAY, PART OF DID-U-CLOSE I'T, IT CAN BE SEEN HOW HIGH IT WAS. HOVERING WITH NO SOUND BUT VERY LOW, ABOUT 2000 FEET UP.

NEWSPAPER PEOPLE AND TOWN OFFICIALS WERE ALL THERE TO SEE IT. NOW THAT IT IS ALL OVER WE ARE STILL DISCUSSING IT: THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN IT EITHER. IT WAS LOCKED UP AND PUT AWAY. THE STORY IS ON THE POLICE BLOTTER, 'SAID THE OFFICER."
