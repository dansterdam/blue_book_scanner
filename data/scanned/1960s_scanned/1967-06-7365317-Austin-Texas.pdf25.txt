OCR output:
14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? [Response: It seemed to curlt off to the left as if going behind something, but it might have been lifted straight up as it faded from sight.]
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know [If you answered YES, then tell what.]
It moved behind some trees and then came out again.
16. Did the object move in front of anything at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know [If you answered YES, then tell what.]
It passed in front of some clouds.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound None heard
b. Color White or Light gray
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? [Response: About 4 to 6 inches of a match head would have covered the object at arms length.]
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
