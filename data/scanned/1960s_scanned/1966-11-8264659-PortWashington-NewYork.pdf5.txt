To date, we have made no real significant observations regarding the strange objects which appeared to be flying in the sky 1, 18 October 1966, in the vicinity of Port Washington, New York. The report received from Lt (name redacted) of the Port Washington Police Department, indicates that a number of officers saw several strange objects in the sky at approximately 1930 hours on the above date. The objects were described as being oval shaped, bright white in color, and moving at a relatively high rate of speed. They appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 2000 feet. The objects were observed for a period of approximately 5 minutes. Several other calls were received from local residents reporting the same observations. No further information is available at this time regarding these sightings. We will continue to follow up on this report and any other similar reports that may be received.
