The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch showing the movement of an unidentified object and instructions on how to describe its motion. The text output from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same line to show the angle the object finally reached. Draw a line from "A" to "B" on the compass to show the direction the object was traveling.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. 

None

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
