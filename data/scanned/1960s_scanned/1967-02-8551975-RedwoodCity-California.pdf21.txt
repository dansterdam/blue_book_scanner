1. Reference your letter of 14 February 1967 in which you
forwarded a physical specimen for chemical and metallurgical
analysis.

2. X-ray emission spectroscopy revealed the presence of aluminum, boron, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, sodium, and calcium were also found. It is suspected that the specimen was the aftermath of some pyrotechnical display, possibly some types of fireworks.

3. Request that you inform the local citizen of our results. There was no evidence disclosed to indicate the material was extraterrestrial in nature.
