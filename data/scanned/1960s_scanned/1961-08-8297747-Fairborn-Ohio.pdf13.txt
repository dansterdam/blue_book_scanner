U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

At about 2027 EST, on Aug 31, 1 observed a moving light in the sky. The light was moving from east to west. It was brighter than the moon and appeared to fluctuate in intensity. The light seemed to be oval in shape and apparently had a tail or wake behind it. The light was observed for about 10-15 seconds and then disappeared (passed behind trees). I called a friend to observe the light but he was unable to see it. 2 sketches (attached) show what I saw.

Description of object:
- Moving light
- Brighter than moon
- Fluctuating intensity 
- Oval shape
- Apparent tail or wake
- Observed for 10-15 seconds
- Disappeared behind trees

E.g.: If this is intended as a report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object, this is a valid summary of the key observations about the shape, movement, and disappearance of the light object reported.
