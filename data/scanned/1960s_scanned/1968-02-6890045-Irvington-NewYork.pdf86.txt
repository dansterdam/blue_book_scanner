BUT IT'S JUST FOR KICKS

The MOUSE WITH STARS Again

By TAMY McNAMARA

People in the Cape Canaveral area have been seeing strange objects hovering in the sky lately and they're only for "kicks".

At least that's the story two scientists gave who say they saw the objects.

According to the scientists, who didn't want to be identified, the flying objects are about the size of a man and "very bright". They say the objects dart and hover but are only visible for a few seconds at a time.

One scientist described it as "quite a strange phenomenon". He said it looked like a "metallic, disc-shaped object" which was illuminated and then suddenly went out.

The scientist said he and another observer were watching the sky one night recently when they saw the object zip across in front of them.

"It went so fast, it was just a blur," he said.

The scientists say the objects are only seen at night and in the early morning hours.

They have not reported the sightings to the Air Force or any other official agency.

"We didn't think they would take us seriously," the scientist said.

The recurring sightings have sparked rumors of a secret project being conducted at Cape Kennedy. However, according to Capt. Ronald L. Thygerson, public information officer at the Cape, there are no secret projects underway and the objects probably are "natural phenomena" and not man-made.

The "Vanguard" satellite was blamed for some of the recent sightings, Thygerson said. The satellite is only visible in the evening and morning hours and could appear as a strange object in the sky.
