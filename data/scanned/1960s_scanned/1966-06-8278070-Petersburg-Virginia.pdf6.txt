20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

It was just about the size and brightness of a jet exhaust at low altitude which is about 15000 feet I would say. The color was a bright white light. I could also see the color wasn't quite right.

22. How much of the object was visible to you at the time of the observation? Was your view of the object ever obscured by the trees, buildings, or other objects?

Probably all of it. 

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Just gradually fade out and disappear, similar to a jet exhaust.

24. In your own words, give as clear a picture as possible of what you observed. Describe the object or objects which you observed. Give the same experience as the object.
