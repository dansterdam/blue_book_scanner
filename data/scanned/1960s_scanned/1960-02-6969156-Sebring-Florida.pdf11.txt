There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of handwritten text from an old document.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output:

It might really be worthy of some investigative effort but until the time of the passage of the object and the direction of its movement was definitely ascertained it is difficult to say whether it might have been a meteor or something else. I saw no other phenomena connected with the passage of the object such as smoke, sparks or other indications. The only other point to be considered is the possibility of some reflective material being aloft and being illuminated by the sun such that it could account for a bright moving object. However, this seems rather far fetched and I am inclined to discount it. On the whole the matter remains obscure and unexplained. In the absence of more definite data and observations it is difficult to reach any firm conclusions. The passage of the object was too brief and the details too meager to warrant a positive explanation. I would suggest that unless some additional evidence or sightings of a similar nature come to light, the matter be filed as an unexplained phenomenon without further speculation. There is no photograph or other physical evidence available.
