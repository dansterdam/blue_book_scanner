The written description states "The 'four' of us witnessed it together but the time lapsed from NE to SW and appeared to be 4 in number in a formation as if the 'objects' traveled about 15/20 miles before the 5th one appeared toward the NE."

The text indicates there were originally 4 objects observed, and then a 5th one appeared later in the same general direction.
