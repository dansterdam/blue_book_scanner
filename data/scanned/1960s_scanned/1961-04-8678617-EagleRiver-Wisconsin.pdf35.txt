Dear Mr. Hoerber:

This letter is in reference to your recent inquiry concerning the object sighted by you over the Eagle River, Wisconsin area on January 8, 1961.

The incident has been thoroughly investigated by the United States Air Force and the following information has been obtained:

On the date in question, at approximately 6:30 P.M., an unidentified flying object was sighted by several residents of the Eagle River, Wisconsin area. The object was observed to be hovering over the town for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Our investigation has revealed that the object was most likely a conventional aircraft, possibly a jet or helicopter, that was conducting routine training or other operations in the area. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object is consistent with the performance capabilities of various military and civilian aircraft.

While we understand your interest in this incident, we do not believe that the object constituted an extraterrestrial or unconventional aircraft. The United States Air Force is confident that the observed object was a conventional aircraft, and no further investigation is warranted.

If you have any additional information concerning this or other UFO sightings, please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate your continued interest in air defense and national security matters.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
