March 3, 1964

Dear Mr. ----,

This is in reply to your letter of February 12, 1964, in which you reported an unidentified flying object sighted in the New York area on the night of February 11th.

We appreciate your interest in reporting this sighting to us. However, due to the lateness of your observation because of the darkness of the evening, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory information necessary for evaluation. There are limitations to what can be determined from such late reports, and we would suggest that in the future you report sightings as soon as possible after they occur.

I am enclosing the basic fact sheet on the case. This will help to explain why further investigation cannot be conducted at this time.

Air Force personnel will be unable to contact you, as your letter did not include a phone number. However, if you have any additional information which you feel would be helpful to explain why this sighting may have been of interest, please feel free to write again.

Sincerely,

MASON M. JACKS
MAJOR, USAF
