Gentlemen:

On December 19, 1964, at 3:30 A.M., two Central Tower Operators on duty in the tower at Larson Air Force Base, Washington, observed on radar unidentified objects moving at a speed in excess of 7000 miles per hour. At one point, the objects approached a point only 10 miles from the tower. The nearest aircraft was 90 miles away. The UFOs were real solid objects. What is the Air Force conclusion for this report?

On December 21, 1964, at about 6 P.M., a man by the name of Horace Burns reported observing the landing of a UFO while driving on Route 250 near Dayton, Virginia. In the object, he could see two men, described as wearing shiny suits, with a blue fluorescent band around the base. After a minute, the UFO rose up with a slight hissing sound. A similar report was previously received on December 14, 1964.

On March 14, 1965, between 1 - 2 A.M., a man by the name of James Flynn reported observing a UFO in the Florida Everglades. The UFO was shaped like a "sharp-edged disc" and descended with a whirling motion. The object approached within 150 feet and the witness felt dizzy and was knocked unconscious. He had to be hospitalized with eye damage. That is the Air Force conclusion for this report.

Thank you very much for your cooperation in informing of the conclusions of the above reports.

Sincerely,
Herbert S. Taylor
