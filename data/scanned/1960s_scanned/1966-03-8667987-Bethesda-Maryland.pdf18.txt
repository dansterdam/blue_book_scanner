Important Note:
I am more than glad to cooperate in any way I can gathering of information. On routine duty, I had no choices. I do now. I am also willing to have questions asked of my family, if desired.
Provided - Some small black-known-to-all docsesly condemned. For example, several months after making a report to Chapel Hill re UEO sightings - seen by other pilots, too - was asked OS how much he would be thanked (as did be same done) was assuring in his family, and OS every, so help me, how much he abused himself. Any chance like that, I thus oust private contact with that so-called "investigator" out the house, body, to be treated in such a manner.
I do not demand even an oral (and anything, expressive, in the real sense of the word) record, but I do demand the ordinary decencies a cavalcade. Those standards were observed by rather an investigator, private, whos have already interviewed us.
