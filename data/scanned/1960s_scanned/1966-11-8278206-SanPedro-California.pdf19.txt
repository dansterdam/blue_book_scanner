The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, that contains handwritten text.

P.S.--The handwritten text on the page states:
"P.S. Information given verbal reported in memo of 1962 from our national center to local area centers of investigation of above."
