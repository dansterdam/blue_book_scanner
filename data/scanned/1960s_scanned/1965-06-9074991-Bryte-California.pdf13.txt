Text from the document:

"We are seeing at the side of the road a similar object. Mrs point is this. I strongly feel that more with a shocking experience such as this can and will act like those who are hardly get excited at a lot things. A UFO can adult who he didn't see it at all because he blieve the other or because he admite because of the friend is another way to look him up. Also, it's to "see another one like it."

I think you know all this, but it's great do of UFO's. I want to get more information."
