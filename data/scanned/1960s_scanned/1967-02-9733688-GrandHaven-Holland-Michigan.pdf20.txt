The image does not contain any photographs, only text describing an observation of a UFO near Grand Haven, Michigan. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

miles SW of Blair, in Holland. Both saw a bright object to the east, the other observer, so the object was between them. Neither claimed to be interviewed. After these reports, we questioned the "variable Hill" on the Lakeshore (Grand Haven) and obtained statements regarding this object with binoculars. It had the same appearance as the original object, a round white light flanked by red and green patches. They were then to the northwest, watching an airplane in the field of view below the object. There was no resemblance. 
All of the witnesses went out to look at Venus several times that evening, making a statement to justify their having been watching Venus. They all agreed that Venus was unusually large and not nearly as bright. The light was a "blinding type" similar to igniting magnesium. The two observers had remarked to the owner that the appearance was much more striking. 
All had also seen airplane landing lights; in fact, we investigated a sighting about a year before and had found the airplane landing lights. He said this present object was much larger and was not similar at all.
All witnesses agreed that the light had physical size, were 1/2 to 3/4 inches across the moon. Indicated size, I think, and forefinings, however, were around 3/4 to one inch, in a size of about two degrees. Remarked that the 9:30 object in 7 x 50 binoculars had about the same apparent size as the moon. When seen with the naked eye in the binoculars was a "teticle", and of this it was established that the apparent size in binoculars.
