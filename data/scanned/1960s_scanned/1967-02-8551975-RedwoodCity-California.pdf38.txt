The light was observed for a period of about 10 minutes as it moved from the northeast to the southwest and appeared to descend at times. It was round in shape, about the size of a star, and had a bright whitish-yellow light. It did not appear to be an aircraft or a satellite. At times it would appear to stop and hover and then continue on its course. I have been interested in this subject for some time and I feel that this sighting was that of an unidentified aerial phenomenon.
