There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned document from the Project Blue Book records, specifically a letter dated June 4, 1954 from Major James to the Project Blue Book Information Office.

The text of the document is as follows:

Major Vernon Jacks
Project Blue Book Information Office.
United States Air Force.
Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Jacks,

I am requesting all available data, including detailed reports, photographs, and testimony regarding all sightings, objects, or Unidentified Flying Objects that have been reported to your office from the Washington, D.C. area, the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Summit, New Jersey, on or about June 4, 1954.

I would also appreciate receiving any technical information sheets or references to unidentified aerial objects and phenomena. These would be most helpful for a study being conducted toward an understanding of Unidentified Flying Objects and interplanetary visitors.

If possible, kindly forward this letter to the Secretary of the Air Force Directorate for this purpose.

I am trusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience.

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]

P.S. I have already received the 1964 Project Blue Book Pamphlet and would appreciate the information requested is for a college thesis due 1965.
