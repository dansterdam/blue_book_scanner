There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a textual report about a town councilor who witnessed a "saucer" in Scotland on August 1, 1963.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

No Case (Information Only)
25 July 1963
Lesmahagow, Scotland

Source : Crawling Shreeve Arwin - Mr. Wm. Robert, Town councillor

The Town councillor sees saucer (Scottish terminology) over a field on August 1, 1963. Following his attention, he mentioned the strange object being white in colour, approximately 50 feet in diameter and some 250 feet above the ground. It made no sound and was hovering motionless for a few seconds to attend the other councillors. The object then moved rapidly eastwards and disappeared from sight quickly. I told my secretary these facts this morning as I received them and she duly recorded them.

The description tallies with that given by Mr. Gallagher of Lanarkshire as described in our file. He had observed the same or a similar object on the evening of the same day at 9.45 p.m. It had disappeared at 9.56 p.m.

This is Mr. Williams Robert-
