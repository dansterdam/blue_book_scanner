Sunnyvale, Calif.- Lt John E. Haag and Officers Sonstrd Siteard of the Public Safety Dept were on duty at the fire station at Lawrence Station and Mountain View-Alviso road when they observed an object in the sky for 10 minutes from 9:33 to 9:43 p.m. on the 6th of July. Both officers declared they are familiar with aircraft in the area and that this object, after hovering, was "faster than anything I'd ever seen before". It went straight up into the air and disappeared. The object was described as being at a great distance from the ground which was about 20 degrees, then, without hesitating, it made a sharp turn southwest for about three miles and then turned northwest. Both officers were sure the object was not a star, and observed that it pulsated on and off from dim to bright in three second cycles. They thought the object might have been from Moffett Moffett planes were scrambled, but said planes from other bases might have observed the object.
