SUMMARY OF CONFERENCE:

Major Quintanilla and Lt Col Jones met with Mr. Newhouse to discuss his sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFO's) on 1 July 1952 near Tremonton, Utah. Mr. Newhouse provided details of his sighting and showed color motion picture film that he had taken at the time. The film was analyzed by personnel at Wright-Patterson AFB and it was determined that the objects depicted were not birds, aircraft, or other known phenomena. However, a definitive identification of the objects could not be made. The conference participants discussed the Tremonton, Utah UFO sighting in detail, but no conclusions were reached regarding the nature of the objects seen.
