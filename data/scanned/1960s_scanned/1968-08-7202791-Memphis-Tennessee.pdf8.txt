DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIMES
BUDDY-WAS IT SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE IN COLOR
CHANGE SIZE?
CHANGE SHAPE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPLIT INTO PARTS
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUFFY-COMBLEY?

WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

STILL THERE

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
YES   NO    UNKNOWN
