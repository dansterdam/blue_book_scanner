The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document from a Project Blue Book file.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

On this same night, we saw an object near the horizon. It was moving and turning at incredible speed. It was a brilliant light, hovering and emitting different colored lights. But instead of it disappearing and reappearing, the light seemed to fall and rise again slowly. It lasted just a second.

It's very much to know more on these objects as I wondered if they could give me some clues. If you yourself could not give me some.

I would like to know, how many people have seen these types of objects and how many are checking this part of the world for these objects. The way is certainly not approaching when we are.

These people had known something about these objects. I wish some of the Air Force people would tell us something. more about what they have learned.

Thank you.
Respectfully,
