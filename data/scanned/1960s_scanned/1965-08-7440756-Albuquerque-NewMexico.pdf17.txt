READY FOR THE RECORD: 3 AUG 65

Mr. J. Harlow at Littleland AFB, has been dealing with many unidentified flying objects. The majority of which are playing lights.
He requested permission to forward these reports as a unit on Project rather than in a TWX, as stated in accordance with AFR 200-2. This had a N ICOCY and is approved.
He will forward these reports to our office also, he requested verification on release of information to the press by the 1300 SIO. Informed him that UFOB as such are unclassified and that AFR 200-2 provides for release of evaluations through SAFOI. It's only for him to tell the press that they are conducting an investigation and it's okay to release information on identified objects, such as known U/C, etc. because they are not unidentified.
