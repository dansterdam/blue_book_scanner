REPORT OF UFO

1. COLOR: Flashing red and white with some blue.
2. Had left a trailer parked behind it.
3. Was observed of like a disc. 
4. Tested first sighted in the N.W., then in the WEST.
5. Was circular and when observed longer south like.
It was hovering over something or waiting for something to materialize. It was fairly large and round like a grain mill and hovered for several minutes. The witness could not determine just what it was, but from past experience of many years standing and knowing what the different objects is in the sky, he stated this was not any aircraft or satellite. He judged the size to be about 60 to 80 feet in diameter and as there was a trailer parked near it, the UFO appeared to be over twice as large as the trailer.
