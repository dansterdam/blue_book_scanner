Gentlemen,

After making a sighting of an unidentified flying object on 7/27/63, I have almost nightly observed the sky in an effort to again see the object which I could not ascertain. However, this evening at about 9:00 P.M. (EDT) while trimming the yard my attention was called to a jet aircraft which I had heard but had not looked up to see. 

It is the growing darkness I could not ascertain if the plane was military or civilian, but took for granted it was military because it was maneuverable because it was single engine. Behind the plane and off the starboard and port wingtips were three objects which seemed to match the speed of the jet. Being able to distinguish the wings and tail of the plane I estimated the objects to be from 50 to 100 feet from the plane. The aircraft and objects were not in view more than 20 seconds, but were visible the whole time before a hill obstructed the view. The plane and objects were traveling in a westerly direction.
