The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten report or letter describing an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed on December 18 (year not specified). The text mentions that the object was sighted around 5:30 AM, was bright, hovered in the sky, and then went out. The observer describes the object as "like lights" and notes that it did not seem to be an aircraft. The rest of the text provides additional details about the sighting.

We. The two of us were watching, at about 5.30 a.m. was there 3 
lights in the sky. They looked like headlights on a car. Their from a distance. One went out, then the other went out. Later that morning, when it was dark, I seen them again, if again they went out. Was it some plane? They didn't come back. We saw only the lights.
