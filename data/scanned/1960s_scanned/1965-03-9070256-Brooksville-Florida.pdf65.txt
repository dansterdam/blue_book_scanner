BROOKSVILLEI MAN'S STORY:
I Saw A Flying Saucer
A Robot-Like Thing

BROOKSVILLE - An fantastic "robot-like pilot" was told here Monday by John Reeves, a 50-year-old resident of the Brooksville area.
Reeves, who lives about 5 1/2 miles northwest of Brooksville, said he saw the mysterious object while on a routine walk through some woods near his home about 1:30 p.m. Tuesday.
He said the object, which he described as being round with four legs, was hovering about 20 to 30 feet off the ground and about 75 yards away. The object was gray and reddish-purple in color, he said, and the four "legs" appeared to be about 12 to 15 inches long.
"I often walk through these woods and I've seen deer and other wildlife,' Reeves said, "but this was the first time I've seen anything like this."
Reeves said he watched the object for about 15 to 20 seconds. "It flashed again and I took my glasses off to get a better look. It seemed to be glowing or pulsating. I got the impression of a rounded shape - like a bowl or dish - with some kind of dome on top. I felt weak and I said to myself, 'What is this?' "
"The thing flashed again and I took a good look. It seemed to have some kind of opening under the dome. It also had what appeared to be some kind of steps leading up to it. He described the object as being about 15 to 20 feet in diameter and about 15 feet high.
"AFTER HE WAS inside some bushes, the thing ran or lit off some 300 yards so fast I could come to understand,'' Reeves said. ''I wanted to follow it but I watched it go and then it just disappeared."
Reeves said he then walked back about 50 yards to where he first saw the object and "checked the area." He said he saw some "strange indentations" in the ground which he believes were made by the object.
"I looked around me and I didn't see anything else, no craft or anything," Reeves said. "This was unlike anything I'd ever heard before."
Reeves said he didn't try to get closer to the object because "I was so amazed and it all happened so fast."
He said the saucer and the "robot" went off in the same direction, traveling along State Road 50 toward Brooksville. He described the craft as being about 15 to 20 feet in diameter and about 15 feet high.
Reeves said he drove to Brooksville and called the sheriff's office and the local newspaper office to report what he had seen. The Times immediately sent a news team to the Reeves home to interview him.
Reeves said his experience was somewhat similar to a recent sighting in Texas where a motorist said he saw a robot-like figure emerge from a UFO.
Reeves said there have been other UFO and strange object sightings in the Brooksville area over the last few years but that this was the first time he has seen anything like this.
"I just wish I could have gotten a closer look at it," Reeves said. "But it happened so fast, I just stood there and watched it go."
