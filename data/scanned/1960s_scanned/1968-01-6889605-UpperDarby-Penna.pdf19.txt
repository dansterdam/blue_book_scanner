There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document, containing a form with various questions and spaces for answers. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document.

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STOPS STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOUR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE OR SPARKS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
PLANES OR FASTER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
RUN LIKE A TOP?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

The handwritten text at the bottom of the form states:

"When it disappeared - then it reappeared it went behind a building,"

and

"Did the phenomenon move behind or in front of something, like a cloud, tree, or building at any time? Yes - it went behind a building,"
