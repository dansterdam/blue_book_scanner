Here is the text from the document, as interpreted by an OCR system:

None of the people interviewed had any explanation of the lights. They were evidently not caused by aircraft. 

Mrs. Stecker said her son heard nothing when he saw the objects, but lights flickered that he kept awake by a whirring sound which no one else heard. 

6. The light has only been seen in recent weeks, and some of the sightings occurred when others were home. The light leaves no trace behind. It did not melt the snow.
