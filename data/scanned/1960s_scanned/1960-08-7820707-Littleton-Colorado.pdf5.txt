The image shows a photograph that appears to depict an unidentified flying object (UFO) or aerial phenomenon. The image shows a dark, elongated shape in the sky against a cloudy background. There does not appear to be any text or other identifying information included in the image itself.

Project Blue Book was a well-known U.S. government study of UFO reports, so this image is likely part of the historical records from that investigation.
