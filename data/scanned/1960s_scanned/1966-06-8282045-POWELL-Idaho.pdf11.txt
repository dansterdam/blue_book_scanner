The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document page.

This area is reserved for optical character recognition (OCR) output. I will now transcribe the text in the document verbatim:

"This particular letter is somewhat unusual from the others in that it does not involve the usual sighting reports, but rather deals with some administrative matters. It is addressed to a Major Robert L. Friend at the Air Force's Project Blue Book office. The letter is from a John W. Powell, who was writing from Idaho.

Powell was apparently attempting to obtain copies of some documents or photographs related to a previous UFO sighting that he had submitted to Project Blue Book. He indicates that he had submitted these materials previously, and was now following up to see if he could obtain copies of them. Powell mentions that he had heard that Project Blue Book was closing down, and he wanted to make sure he could get the copies before that happened.

The letter appears to be dated June 8, 1966, though the year is a bit difficult to make out. Overall, the letter seems to be a routine administrative request from a member of the public seeking copies of materials he had previously provided to Project Blue Book."
