Dear Major:

Here are reports on two sightings I recently investigated. One is the old case from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This remains an unknown. The facts as stated did not indicate any explanation for the sighting and reflect a light.

A few points to be added: after all this time, Dr. W regards this as having been "a most unusual sighting". A had him count off an imaginary rectangle of size similar to that described (100 degrees), and he said the light appeared to be strictly parallel except that one light moved abruptly closer to the other continuing on a strictly parallel path.

Dr. W said it was not a brilliant light, "was reddish." Had some stars and said not brighter than the brightest star. The sighting lasted 15 minutes or more. It had him never did locate objects or lights - seemed to be emanating from behind objects and trailing edge seemed discontinual luminosity. Both the ten-year-old girls saw them also.

I had talked with the girls earlier and they confirmed the sighting but smaller than the moon. The other sighting, in Milwaukee, was a ball reflecting sunlight, smaller than the moon, but stayed the same brightness. This sighting lasted 9 minutes and a matter was made from an inility in location. Noon was shining.

Dr. W definitely thinks they were not birds, but there is still no compelling reason to rule this out. There was no sound whatever observers could detect. Observers could not rule out birds because of high speed.

That's all on this report.
