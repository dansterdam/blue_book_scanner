1. This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Miss [redacted] collected in a suggested reply: Allentown.

a. Dear Miss [redacted]

Your letter to Secretary McNamara has been forwarded to the Air Force. This is not possible to provide a final conclusion or 100% solution, as the total duration of the sighting, variation in apparent speed of the object, and altitude variations do not permit the detailed physical location and direction to be precisely determined.

In the absence of this necessary information it seems possible that the observed trajectory may have been a fireball.

In order to make a firm evaluation on your observation, it is requested that you fill out the attached FTD Form 142. The witness' statement that the object was perfectly round which, if true, rules out the above hypothesis. Therefore, request that your office forward this FTD Form 142 with a letter to MISS.

FOR THE COMMANDER

ERIC T de JONCKHEERE 
Colonel, USAF
Deputy For Technology

YOU - THE NUCLEUS OF SECURITY!
