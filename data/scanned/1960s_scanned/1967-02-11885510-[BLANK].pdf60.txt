APPENDIX V
RESOLUTIONS OF THE BYURAKAN CONVERENCE
MAY 20-23, 1964

1. Although materialistic philosophy favors the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life, at the present time there is no valid proof of such life. However, there are strong indications that such life might exist and might develop civilizations.

A contact with extraterrestrial civilizations would be of the highest importance and interest but until very recently such a contact was clearly impossible. At the present time, however, there is a possibility of establishing interstellar communications by means of electromagnetic waves. The best range for this purpose are frequencies 10^9 to 10^11, that is the region of centimeter and decimeter waves.

The present-day technology allows the registration of radio signals across stellar distances. A rapid development of cybernetics makes it possible to formulate the problem of cosmic linguistics.

The rapid growth of scientific literature on these subjects, and the first practical steps made in the U.S. to contact extraterrestrial civilizations clearly show that interstellar communication is an actual scientific problem.

2. It is therefore necessary to undertake the development of an experimental as well as theoretical approach to this problem.
