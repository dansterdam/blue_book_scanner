Statement of Lt. Miller:

An "Unidentified Project Officer for Ground Sighting" had been alerted to the expected re-entry of the Russian Rocket 1960 Epsilon II. The rocket was fired from the Kazakhstan area on 18 July. I requested that the local AACS and Weather Observer Assistants be alerted to watch for the rocket and report any sightings. 

At about 0615Z I received the report from TSgt [redacted] concerning the object he saw at about 0600Z. Major Harrison, the Weather Officer, was notifying this sighting report at about this same time. Major Harrison, Sgt Anderson and myself studied the reports and agreed on the contents. After comparing times, I see that I inadvertently reported the time of Anderson's sighting as 1912Z rather than 0912Z.

From about 0831Z until 1032Z, Major Harrison, Sgt. Anderson, Airman Fletcher, and I observed the object. We could find no logical explanation on the matter. The sightings of Sgt. Anderson and Airman Fletcher were some 95 minutes apart, and I assumed that these sightings of the same object.
