There is no photograph or image present in this page of the UFO report document. The document appears to be a questionnaire or form with various questions about the observed object, its movement, and other details. The text in the document can be extracted as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: it's movement are soundless.
b. Color: -

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object and gauge how many times the object's width goes into the match stick length. How many times did it go in? (This gives us an idea of the size of the object in relation to your distance from it).

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you have not described in words. (Such as the color, the number of appendages, the direction of motion, the tail or exhaust, etc.)
