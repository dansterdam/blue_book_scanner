There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned document from the Project Blue Book UFO reports, specifically a memo routing slip.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I shall extract the following text from the document:

MEMO ROUTING SLIP
* TO Lt Matthews (TDAMF)
REMARKS
Gene:
Reference your note concerning the gray porous object found at Cypress Gardens, Florida. We have examined the object and find no reason to extend the evaluation any further. We are unable to determine if the object is meteoritic in origin. Possibly Lt/Col Quintanilla's shop would be helpful in this regard.
