34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 17 OCT 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Just a recap of the information covered in the questions above:
I was in a deserted parking lot talking with Ron Weiner and for no reason looked up into the northern sky and saw this (those) objects. It passed much faster than a bird or (flight of) birds making a formation so perfect that I cannot personally accept the idea that I saw a flight of birds, of any kind - also I have never seen birds which reflect light without having seen it vary in intensity as they moved away from the light source - in fact, I have never seen a bird reflect light in any manner.
