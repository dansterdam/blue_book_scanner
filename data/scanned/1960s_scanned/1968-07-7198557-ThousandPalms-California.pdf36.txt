The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with redacted text.

My name is Mack and I am an investigator for the U.S. Air Force project Blue Book. On 7 July 1968, I received a report of an unidentified flying object sighting near Thousand Palms, California. The witness, a local resident, claimed to have seen a bright light in the sky that maneuvered in an unusual manner before disappearing. I have included the witness's handwritten account of the incident, which has been partially redacted to protect the individual's privacy.
