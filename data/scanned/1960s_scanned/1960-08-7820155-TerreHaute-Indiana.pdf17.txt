Washington, D.C.

Dear Lt. Colonel Tacker:

Enclosed you will find the report form I sent to you on September 2, 1960. I have filled the report out as best I could. I have several questions that I would like to ask you.

1. When evaluation and analysis is completed on my report will a copy be sent to me so that I too may know what the Air Force thinks the object was that I saw?

2. How many of all the reports that you have received from 1947 to the present concerning U.F.O.'s have not been explained away?

3. Will you please send me the present fact sheet out on U.F.O.'s?

4. What does the Air Force think these objects are? Is it true that many of the Air Force people think these objects are from other planets?

Thank you very much for your co-operation in answering my questions. I am very glad that I have been able to help the United States Air Force.

Respectfully yours,
