Dear Sir:
On March 28, 1966, I reported in a postal card, to you,
to have made an unidentified observation.
In reply to this card you sent me an FTD Form 164 to fill
out and return.
6, 1966, I did so and mailed this form to you on April
As I have since received no reply from you and do not
know whether some error has caused this report form to be
misplaced this report form. If so I would appreciate you sending
me another report form.
If you have received my report form which I mailed to you
and have not yet had a chance to reply to me I would greatly
appreciate your earliest attention and evaluation of the report.
Sincerely,
Toledo, Ohio 43609
