Catpelying for the last an the aircraft over the wheat fields rather than just low than normal. Made not have been a plane because it seemed to stop in midair. Could not have been a plane. It was a round shaped craft. It stopped off straightup into the rafter as a rocket. But very good look at it. Ratcheting stopped and it just sort of it closed during from passing. Could see 3 - 4 small lights or portholes on the underside of the craft. It sloped off before it meeting the light shut straight up.  Real was very faint maybe 2 inches per second.
