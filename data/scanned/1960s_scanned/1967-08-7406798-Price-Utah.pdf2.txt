Attention: U.F.O. Department
Gentlemen:
This summer my wife and I, along with two friends, were vacationing in the Yosemite area. We were particularly interested in objects seen in the night sky, and set up a watch on several occasions near our campgrounds, away from any concentrated sources of light.
On one night around 11 p.m. September 23, it was quite dark and we were watchfully scanning the sky when a light suddenly appeared in the North, West of the road. At first it appeared as an ordinary star, but gradually it began increasing in size and brightness, and started moving across the sky. 
It immediately became much brighter, changing color as it moved, appearing to be various shades of green, red, and blue. As it approached the zenith, it appeared to be the size of a dime held at arm's length, and its brilliance was so intense that it cast a bright illumination on the ground below.
It continued on across the sky, growing smaller in size as it moved away, finally disappearing in the South-east. The entire observation lasted about 3 minutes.
Upon returning to our campgrounds we immediately discussed the occurrence, and the consensus of opinion was that it was not an airplace, satellite, or any conventional celestial object. While we cannot offer a specific identification, it was definitely not a normal occurrence in our experience, and seemed to substantiate reports of UFO activity in that general area.
If you can provide any information which might help explain this occurrence, I would appreciate hearing from you.
Sincerely,
