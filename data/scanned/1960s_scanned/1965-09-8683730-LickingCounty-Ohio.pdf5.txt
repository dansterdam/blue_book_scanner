STATEMENT

(UFO SIGHTING)

I observed a white circular object South of the Central Tower from the South to the North Northwest in an arc rising in an arc line. During the first sighting of this object it appeared to be one white circular object, the second sighting it was observed to be two white circular lights. When the object was approached by the lights of the Central Tower it appeared to take up a constant heading Northeastward until it was no longer visible.
