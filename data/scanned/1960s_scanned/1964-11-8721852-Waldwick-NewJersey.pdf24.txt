Nov. 7, 1964
Waldwick, New Jersey

Witness was convinced this was a real thing that he saw, not just imagination or illusion. He described the object as a bright light with a trail behind it, travelling at a high speed across the sky before it became obscured. The object had a red glow around it and appeared to be under intelligent control. The witness watched the object for about 1 minute before it disappeared from view. No other witnesses were reported.
