The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO. The sketch depicts a saucer-shaped object with a rounded body and no visible wings or protruding parts. The text indicates that the observer was asked to draw a picture showing the shape of the observed object.

As an OCR system, the text present in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, by gradually going up

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes (62%) No (38%) Don't Know. 
IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (62%) No (38%) Don't Know.
IF you answered YES, then tell what in front of: It seemed to pass in front of a paper cup.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: There was no sound that I could detect
b. Color: The color of the object was white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? No, it or it would take up not more than 1/4 or 1/5 of the apparent size of the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
