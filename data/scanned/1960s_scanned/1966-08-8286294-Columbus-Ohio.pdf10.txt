"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 25th August 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This was a very unusual phenomenon - We knew its was not a meteor or a missile or any known type of aircraft. The object was shationary for a few minutes as it hovered over us before it suddenly disappeared. The individual paralleled objects from the original object appear to have been in a single line formation - They and gazed at the object , these were mostly within one mile and gave very similar descriptions. We still have the original object completely vanished."
