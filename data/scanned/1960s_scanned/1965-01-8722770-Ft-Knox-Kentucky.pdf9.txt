Transcribing the text in the document:

Dear Mr. _______,

In response to your request, please be advised that the incident reported in your letter of 7 February 1965 has been evaluated by the Project Blue Book staff.

The incident as described, which allegedly occurred near Fort Knox, Kentucky, on 2 January 1965, has been classified as a possible satellite or space debris reentry. This classification is based upon the physical description and behavior of the object as reported, which is consistent with known characteristics of such reentries.

While we appreciate your interest, we do not believe the incident warrants further investigation at this time, as it is likely explained by this natural phenomenon. If you have any additional information which would indicate this classification is incorrect, please let us know.

Sincerely,

Colonel, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
Foreign Technology Division
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
