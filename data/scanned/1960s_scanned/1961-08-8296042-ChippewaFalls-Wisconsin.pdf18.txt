The image contains no photograph, only handwritten text on what appears to be a page from a report or document. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe the text found in the document:

"Volume, but you are Dandelion family, it seems a long time since we had a meeting or serious discussion about what appears to be a copy of a very interesting eye witness account of a close encounter with a bright light about size of an automobile that passed over a witnesses car and that the witness believed to be moving at a very high rate of speed. Other than that it would be difficult to determine just what the witness could have observed. Some directors are about as worthless as a bricklayer would be at designing an atomic reactor. Of course there are some exceptions. Those who seem to be afraid to rock the boat have no place at all in this work. If we can not be open and honest with ourselves, how can we expect the public to have confidence in what we are doing - and we must have that public confidence, even the skeptics and scoffers. Without it we might as well close up shop. This has been going on for too many years already. We can and must do better."
