Dear Mr. Hall:

Enclosed is my report on the Unidentified Objects. Unfortunately, I am not able to enclose the photographs originally had on this incident. I lost them both, and this photographic print was one of my friends'using the one I have.

I am quite aware that you are not one of the groups that pose as much as antagonistic towards these matters, and in my investigation I have contacted some of the many groups interested in this particular field. I have, however, seen the data, that the objects are extremely and others nebulous and erratic in nature, and their motion. I am hoping to get a scientific analysis of my sightings.
