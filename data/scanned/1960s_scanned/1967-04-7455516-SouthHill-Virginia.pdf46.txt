There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text only.

THIS MEANS THAT THE BURNED SPOT ON THE ROAD WAS PRODUCED BY SOME TYPE OF FLAMMABLE LIQUID OR MATERIAL. THIS, CONCEIVABLY, COULD HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED BY THE "OBJECT", BY CROWDER HIMSELF, OR BY OTHERS.
IF THE FLAMMABLE MATERIAL WAS DEPOSITED BY THE "OBJECT," THEN IT
WAS IGNITED BY THE"OBJECT" IN THE PROCESS OF TAKE-OFF. IT DEPOSITED
BY CROWDER OR OTHERS, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IGNITED BY MORE CONVENTIONAL
MEANS.
THE FACT THAT ALL FOUR MATCHES WERE COMPLETELY CHARRED INDICATES
THAT THEY WERE ON THE ROAD AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE.
THE DISCOVERY OF THESE CHARRED MATCHES PRODUCED AN INTERESTING REACTION, BUT NOT A SURPRISING ONE, AMONG THOSE PRESENT. (RECALL THAT CROWDER WAS AT HOME AT THE TIME.)
TROOPER CRAWFORD DECIDED NOT TO BOTHER TO REPORT THE INCIDENT (CROWDER'S
REPORT) TO HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR, SIT. D.H. DAILEY, HEAD OF THE LOCAL
POLICE. "BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING TO IT," THAT'S MY OPINION.
I ASKED TROOPER CRAWFORD IF ANY OF THE OTHER OFFICERS PRESENT ALSO
WERE SUSPICIOUS. HIS REPLY WAS... "AFTER WE FOUND THE MATCHES."
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHOSE SUSPICIONS
WERE AROUSED. FRANCES L. HUCKETT, A RESIDENT/PHOTOGRAPHER FOR THE
ROANOKE WORLD-NEWS, ALSO RESPONDED IN THIS WAY WHEN I ASKED WHETHER THE MATCHES HAD AROUSID INTEREST. "I JUST WENT AND PUT MY CAMERA AWAY, AND SAID CHRIS HURLEY (HUCKETTS HUSBAND) YOU KNOW, CROWDER IS A HIGHLY THOUGHT-OF, UPSTANDING MAN. I THINK HE'S A MAN OF INTEGRITY, PERSONALLY. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN-I LIVED IN HIS HOME IN AN APARTMENT WHEN MY WIFE AND I WERE FIRST MARRIED. BUT WELL, HERE'S THE MATCHES, YOU KNOW, I SAID, WELL, I'VE WASTED MY FILM." I DON'T EVEN THINK I'LL SEND IT TO THE NEWSPAPER."
