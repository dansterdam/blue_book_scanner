SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon
1. At approximately 1615 hours on 30 May 1965, the undersigned observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon while on routine patrol at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
2. The object in question was first observed at an estimated altitude of 15,000 feet and appeared to be metallic in nature, reflecting sunlight. The object was moving at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 knots.
3. After approximately 30 seconds of observation, the object rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.
4. Attached are two photographs taken of the object during the observation. The quality of the images is poor due to the high speed and altitude of the object.
