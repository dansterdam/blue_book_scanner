UFOs REPORTED OVER COUNTY
Two Boys, Woman, Man See Unidentified Flying Objects
By NANCY McKECHNIE
Three separate sightings of unidentified flying objects Fri-day night in the Saratoga Springs area were reported to THE SARATOGIAN. 
A spokesman for the Saratoga Springs Police Station said he had received a report of two boys, camping in their backyard, spotted a huge glowing object which they said streaked upward suddenly.
Two Greenfield women sitting on their front porch reported seeing two large glowing objects which appeared to move in the sky. 
THE THIRD REPORT came from a Vermont man, who said that as he was driving cross-country, his car engine suddenly died, and he saw a huge battle-shaped object slowly rise from behind the trees. He said it steadied itself and then shot steadily upward until it was out of sight.
The description of the sighted objects and the manner in which they reportedly behaved lead investigators to conclude that these were the sightings of as yet unidentified flying objects. At 12:30 a.m., the boys said, the objects streaked across the sky toward downtown Saratoga, and disappeared near the lights of the city.
ON THE REPORT which the boys sent to the Air Force Project Blue Book at Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, they stated that they did not actually see any occupants of the objects.
THOMAS MERCER, SLI New Arts, said, and Project Blue Book replied that their report has been received and is being investigated.
According to Mercer, the analysis of the sightings and investigations indicate that the lights observed simply reflect bright lights. If more than one source provide details indicating a bona fide unidentified object, he said, then the Air Force will look into it further.
