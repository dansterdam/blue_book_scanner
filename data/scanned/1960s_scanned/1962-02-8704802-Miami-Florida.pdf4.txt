Gentlemen:

On February 14, shortly after 9:00 p.m., I was sitting with three other persons by the swimming pool at the Key Biscayne Hotel, Key Biscayne, Florida. The sky was cloudless, and the stars were very bright. While watching the sky, we saw a bright light, as bright and as large as any star in the sky (as a matter of fact, it looked like a star). It was moving across the sky, roughly from west to east. We thought it might be Echo. We have seen it a number of times. However, as it approached the vicinity of the moon, it dimmed. We thought that this was because of the brightness of the moon and that we would see it again on the other side of the moon. It seemed to us that its path would have taken it across the face of the moon. We waited for at least 20 minutes, but did not see it again. We estimated that it should have taken it no more than 2 minutes to pass over and beyond the moon's radiance so that its brightness could again be seen. But, as I said, we did not see it again.

We wondered if it was a weather balloon, etc. Could you enlighten us?

Sincerely,
(Mrs.)

P.S. It was not a falling star. We cannot figure why it did not come out on the other side of the moon!
