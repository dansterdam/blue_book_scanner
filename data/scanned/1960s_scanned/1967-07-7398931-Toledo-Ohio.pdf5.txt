The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten letter with an unidentified graphic or image beneath the text.

I am a twenty-six year old commercial artist, father of twin daughters and a member of Grace Church. We described and illustrated as close as possible what we saw. I waited until now to write this letter as I have been working longer hours than usual.

Yours truly,
[REDACTED]
