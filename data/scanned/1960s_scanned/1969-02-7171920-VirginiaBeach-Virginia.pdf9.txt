The shared image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

The text reads:

"for twelve flight east, with me; subject to investigate. Witnesses about his actions were a 12 year old female observing, not to have an interest in and was said present report of the sighting incident. the closest approximation was about 1 miles, as thought; have been viewed as a flying disc of metallic like characteristics, hovering at the time & later went off at a terrific rate of speed, out of sight. This description seems to be quite different from the original one given and it is doubtful either information given is accurate, as the Witness stated that she was a good distance from the object. A detailed investigation does not seem to be justified in this case. The sighting is filed but no further action taken."
