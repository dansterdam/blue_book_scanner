There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a transcript of a telephone conversation or interview regarding a UFO sighting.

Hynek: I see. Is there anything else about it you think I really ought to know?
I believe that is about all.
Hynek: Did it ever actually stop still for awhile?
Well, it stopped for about a second and then it moved, and it moved on around the horizon.
Hynek: Well, now, how long did the sound last and how long was it?
Well, let's see, it lasted, I did would say, about 30 seconds.
Hynek: I haven't the least idea what it was that you saw, but there have been other reports like it. We are trying to figure out what it is.
You don't have any idea what it was?
Hynek: No, I don't.
I don't know what it could be.
Hynek: How many of your friends your own age did you tell about it?
Pretty near everybody knew about it afterwards.
Hynek: No, they never did get hold of it;
That's good. But some woman put it in the paper, but we never did.
Hynek: Well, thanks very much for the information, and you say that is at college right now? What town is this in the Southwestern Oklahoma?
Weatherford, Oklahoma.
Hynek: You don't happen to have his address, do you?
Well, you know the other man in the report, well, that's his.
Hynek: I'd give him a ring there and see if I can find him.
Well, he ought to be home right now.
Hynek: All right, I'll give him a ring and see what happens. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
Hynek: I'd like to put in a person-to-person call to Mr. ---- located in Weatherford, Oklahoma, and the number is ----.
Operator: Hello, is Mr. ---- there? Long distance is calling.
Hynek: Hello, Mr. ----. This is Dr. Hynek from Northwestern University calling...I think you may have gotten a letter from me or your cousin did mention that you had a nice long talk with him, and I wonder if you could answer a few questions.
