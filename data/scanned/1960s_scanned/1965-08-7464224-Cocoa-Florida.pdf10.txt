they like green and white
M: Did you look at the sky also?
M: Oh, yes, to compare.
H: To compare - exactly what I want. How did they compare?
M: Like a group of stars (?) the same white. I kept looking and then I switched back to the formation. And the formation was different - casting off these lights, you know. Then I looked back at the stars
H: It gets more interesting all the time. Let's go back to when you first saw them. How did you first sight them?
M: It's now. I was out on a call. It was approximately 11:25, when sandwiches were served, and I came back to the car. I heard Ed say that he was in contact with a 7:20 on the radio in the car. I heard the radio and I said:
"Ed, what have you got?" He said: "We've got a guy flying a saucer. And with that I looked up, and I saw it. You know, it was scared and I had the mike in my hand, looking up and watching this thing fly -- moving like crazy!
H: What direction were you facing?
M: I was facing east.
H: And it was moving west.
M: It was moving west.
H: Waste. It couldn't have been a satellite because satellites don't move that way.
M: I see. When he said: "He's looking," and I said: "Yeah. And you can see it" - you know - these things are about 20 miles an hour, when I looked up, you know, just for a second. And then I got under the dashboard.
