The image shared does not contain any photographs, but rather a handwritten document or report. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

At no time while I had the object in view did it change course or altitude, or move behind or in front of anything. The motion was smooth and speed seemed constant. I saw no port holes or other openings. The orange glow in the center portion seemed to pulse at intervals of several seconds, and what it contained, if anything, I did not or could not determine in sight.

I have described what I actually saw and have no heavier or lighter than air craft, any phenomena or temperature inversion mirage, or sun reflection.

NOTE: Enclosed is a sketch of an idea of the object might possibly have looked like. This is not a drawing as such, but an approximate toward the bottom portion, and flatter toward the center portion.
