Major Hector Quintanilla,

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In reply to the letter enclosed in the large set of reports on probable firebolls received yesterday, September 1, 1967.

We have two reports from aircraft, one of 1:21 and one was 0213.2, probably some observation on Sept. 1, 1967 before the approximate time you mention. So I regret to say we have no information of use to you.

Thank you for this request. It will take some time to go through our old reports. and search for the object in which case examination would be undertaken to see if an astronomical path could be calculated.

The report from Clyanne, Wya., for object of 28 March, 1967, - a truck on the ground with luminescence and glow-internal, 1s is very similar to work on that the much longer unexplained observations used. The complexity must scare many observers. This method will verify multiple observers.

Sincerely yours,

C. P. OLIVIER
