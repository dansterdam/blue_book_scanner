"It appeared to be a large disc over the barn, It was moved 3 flashing lights on the bottom 2 were pulsating real fast - the other was a steady beacon. It hovered over the area about 10-15 minutes. I watched it through binoculars as long as I could see it. The object seemed to come closer to the ground, got larger and then shot up out of sight real fast. It then came back and hovered again over the same area. I checked to see if there was any aircraft in the area and later called the U.S.O. and reported this sighting. Certainly from everyone. The paper said that the U.S.O. and reported this had already called the F.A.A. 

I looked at it later with my relatives and can swear on a stack of bibles this was not terrestrial aircraft. It was discoidal in shape with flashing lights and moved with no apparent sound. It was larger than the middle and seemed to glow as though lighted from within. It was certainly a mystery to me and I am convinced that what we saw was not of this world."
