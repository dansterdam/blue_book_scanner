This report contains information obtained by interview of persons who claim to have observed an unidentified aerial object. Based on the information provided, evaluation has been made and conclusions drawn. This report is furnished for your information and should be considered in conjunction with other information on this subject which may be available.

The individual who reported the sighting was interviewed. He stated that he could not provide any information regarding the identity of the object sighted since he did not see it clearly enough to determine what it was. He said that he was in a boat fishing at the time of the sighting, which occurred at approximately 8:30 PM on 10 April 1960 in the vicinity of the Gulf of Mexico near the Louisiana coastline. He said that the object was visible for only a few seconds, and he did not have time to make a detailed observation. He said that some "pranks" had occurred in the area recently, and he wondered if this sighting might be related to those incidents, but he could not be certain. He said that the people in the area were still talking about the incident, but that he personally had no additional information to provide.
