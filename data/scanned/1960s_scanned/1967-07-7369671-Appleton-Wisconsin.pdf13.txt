COMPLAINT DETAILS
Greg Verhoeven, age 14, stopped at the station with a photo he took of a U.F.O. This photo showed an oval, flat object in the sky. Greg states this U.F.O. came out of the east and hovered for about 15 minutes, and then went straight up and disappeared. The object was estimated to size at 100 to 200 feet in diameter. It was lower than an inflight air craft.
The photo was taken with box camera number 620, black and white film and processed by Kodak photo shop. These photos are being forwarded to Patterson, Air Force Base for review.
