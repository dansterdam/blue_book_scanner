DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES MAR. 24-30, 1969

The surface map for the period is shown by the dashed lines, and the contours - connected points of equal barometric pressure - are shown by the solid lines. The ridges, or high pressure areas, are shown as elongated ovals, and the troughs, or low pressure areas, are shown as elongated oval-shaped depressions. The numbers show the heights of the constant pressure surfaces in hundreds of feet above sea level.

This weather map is used to analyze the circulation patterns of the atmosphere. The isobars - lines of equal barometric pressure - show the general direction of air flow and wind movement. The positions and movements of high and low pressure systems are important in forecasting future weather conditions. The surface weather data is also recorded on the map, indicating temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and other pertinent information. The weather patterns reflected on these daily maps are used by meteorologists in preparing short-range and long-range weather forecasts.

The vertical section or cross-section through the atmosphere, shown at the bottom of the map, depicts the temperature and moisture conditions. The dashed line indicates the freezing level. The areas of precipitation are indicated by the shaded regions. This information is useful in studying the structure and development of weather systems.

The bottom of the map also includes data on the amount of sunshine, wind speeds, and other meteorological parameters measured at various observation stations across the country.
