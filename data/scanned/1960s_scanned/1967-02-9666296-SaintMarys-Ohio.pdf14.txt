The image contains a diagram with instructions, but no photograph. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine a situation and sketch the motion and direction of an observed object. There is also a compass-like illustration provided for reference. The text on the page appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show the point at which the object was first seen. If you saw it first from a point above the horizon (outlined), place an "A" there. If you saw it first from a point below the horizon (shaded), place a "B" there. Next, show the path the object took by placing a "C" on the line where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
