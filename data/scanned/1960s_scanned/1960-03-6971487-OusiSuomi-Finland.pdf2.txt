This page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or documentation of some kind.

The text in the document is as follows:

The object was apparently of a silvery color and cylindrical in shape. The object was sighted flying over a residential area at a high rate of speed, approximately 1500 miles per hour. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute as it passed overhead at an estimated altitude of 500-600 feet. No sound was associated with the object and no details of the construction were visible. The object was tracked both visually and on radar for the duration of the sighting. This case is classified as a 'good' report, meaning that the observers are considered reliable and the object could not be readily explained as a known or conventional aircraft.
