There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document containing text from a Project Blue Book report.

As per your request, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the full text output from the document:

A Mr. Zamora stopped his car while he was still talking on the radio and started to get out. He finished his conversation with the sheriff's office in Socorro where the object was. He then became aware of a very loud roar, something like a jet, which seemed to come from over the arroyo a short distance from the object. Object started to rise from the ground, slowly. The color was light blue and some of orange, but he saw no smoke. However, the object made a rather sharp turning motion, then departed at a high rate of speed, so fast that he could not see the flame and heard the roar turn suddenly away from the object. He looked in the direction of this departure, but the object had already disappeared. He was so impressed, got up and proceeded away from the object for a few seconds.
When he looked back, the object had completely disappeared. It lifted its hand and gave a signal that appeared to go straight up, slowly. The object was on the ground for 2 or 3 minutes. It was approximately 20 feet long and about 6 or 6 1/2 feet high. As it lifted off, it came out of a shallow indentation in the ground in which it had been resting. Zamora went back to the station to look out the window and see if he could spot the object, because he was facing it and could not see the object from this angle. He said the object appeared to be so hot that it left a shiny mark on the ground. He waited for a few minutes but could not see the object, therefore he did not know in which direction it had gone. It is my belief that the object which probably belongs to one of the government agencies while he Zamora saw some from outer space, we may or may not ever know.
