Aere Used was a Minolta SR-7 with 55mm 1.4 Aero Rokkor. Film used was Ektachrome X (CESA 64) Exposure 1/5 Sec at 1.4 (code open) Processing normal.

Due to almost inpressible brightness it seems to have hit the film and overexposure. It seems to have the color and maneuverability of super sonic fighter However its speed could easily have been as high as 5,000 mph, due to the extremely short duration of appearance. Speed remained constant throughout their appearance. One object on the right side seemed to pull off to the right and immediately after which all objects disappeared from view. Judging from my past experience I did not expect these photos to be usable. I decided to depend on a little "luck". One of the enclosed pictures is a blank - the other three appear to photograph the objects. I regret that they are not of better quality. It is not necessary to return slides. Since they are of no use to me. To provide you with directions of travel, etc. - I enclosed a map of New York and Canada to the world.
