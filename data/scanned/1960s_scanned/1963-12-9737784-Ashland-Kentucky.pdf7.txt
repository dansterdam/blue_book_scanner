The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The diagram shows an angular object with rays or lines emanating from it, and there is also a circular compass-like diagram in the lower right corner. The text in the document appears to provide instructions or questions related to the diagram, such as asking the viewer to imagine the object's position and to draw a picture showing how multiple objects may have been arranged.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Pick out the places where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 0" where the object was first seen, a "20" where it was at its maximum elevation, and so on, according to the numbered positions.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion of the object, as it changed direction during its course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
