February 13, 1964

Dear Commander,

This air evaluation of the observation which you and Mr. [redacted] reported having seen in the vicinity of the 14th Street Bridge on or about December 12, 1963.

Since the object viewed was apparently in the vicinity of a military air traffic and no reports were made from aircraft or towers personnel nor from any other persons in the vicinity of the bridge on that date, it is believed that you observed some natural phenomena which was not identified as to the cause of the observation.

Sincerely,

MAJOR M. J. JACKS
Major, USAF

Commander [redacted]
Alexandria, Virginia
