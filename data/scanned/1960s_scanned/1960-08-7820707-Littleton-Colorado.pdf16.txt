Dear Sir:

I am writing again in regard to the UFO residuals which have been discussed in my previous letters dated 7 March 1960 (see my letter dated 7 March 1960). 

I have delayed sending this material to A. T. C. for several reasons. First, for the fact that Air Force analysis should have an opportunity to study the complete history of the material before attempting tests.

A complete report of this case has been prepared for some time and was authorized for forwarding to your office as soon as practical. However, due to the rather complex nature of the case, and the desire to insure that every possible facet be covered in this report, the final preparation has been delayed.

For Francis Gary Powers' observation, you have probably observed that the proposed tests are not intended merely to prove or disprove the UFO nature of the observation. Rather, the intent is to obtain all possible information concerning the nature and characteristics of the object observed, in order that a better understanding may be reached.

I trust the foregoing clarifies my position in this matter, and I hope that the report will be forwarded to you within a reasonable time. If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to call on me.

Sincerely yours,

(1) The case at Red Bluff, California, August 13, 1960, involving Sept.
15-23, 1960 observations provided range and altitude data.

(2) The two-day observation of a UFO near Holloman AFB, New Mexico, August 1960 involving May Hawks. As stated "excepted" detailed missile track information from AFMDC, Holloman AFB.

(3) The case at Tremonton, Utah, July 2, 1952 where 16mm motion pictures were taken.
