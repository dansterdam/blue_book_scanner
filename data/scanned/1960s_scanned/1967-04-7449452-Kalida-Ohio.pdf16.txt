The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with a questionnaire form filled out by someone. The text in the image is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 10 6 67
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The person has provided a handwritten response to question 35, describing their sighting and thoughts about it. The text mentions "something unusual a lot of light", "most likely some type of aircraft", and "many people saw".
