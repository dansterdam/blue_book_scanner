There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document, likely a report or account of some kind.

The text of the document is as follows:

The rays of light of the object were about as bright as those of a car headlight, though they seemed to be a little more intense. The object was a yellowish-white color with a slight reddish-orange tinge. It appeared to be oval in shape and seemed to be at a very high altitude, perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 feet. It was traveling in a northerly direction at a relatively slow and steady speed, much slower than a jet aircraft. At times, the object seemed to be moving erratically or zigzagging slightly more over than a minute or two, then it would resume its steady northerly course. When it changed direction, the entire object would move in unison, there was no separation or division of the light source. The rays of light seemed to extend the full width of the object, which was estimated to be around 300 to 400 feet in diameter. The rays of light did not seem to illuminate the ground or surrounding clouds. As the object passed overhead, it did not make any sound that could be heard. The observation lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before the object disappeared from view to the north.
