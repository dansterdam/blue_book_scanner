PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 5 Aug 63
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 0528/272
5. PHOTOS: Yes, Radar Scope
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2.5 mins
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two objs with normal paint on height finder on site about 2 miles of n/s observed for almost 1 min. Objs were 2 miles apart. Initial pickup on HRI at 60,000 ft 1.12 deg azimuth (6) miles range. Disappearance at 166 deg azimuth 7+ miles range. Height fluctuated between 60,000 to 80,000 ft. Vertical movement. Normal AP. T-33 airborne could not get visual contact. 2 flights were scrambled for identification and could not get further pickup on visual contact. Seems flighty and 6.5 s rounded in attempt to gain visual contact without success.
11. COMMENTS: Negatives of scope analysis submitted for further radar corner refle- ction the most probable solution. Would be from a/c traveling high speed intercept radar.
