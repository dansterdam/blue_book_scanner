WITNESS STATEMENT

ON 8 AUGUST 1966 AT APPROX 2200 HOURS THE WITNESS, MR. HOWARD TOBIN, SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT HOVERING OVER A FIELD EAST OF HIS RESIDENCE NEAR DONNYBROOK, NORTH DAKOTA. THE LIGHT WAS REPORTED TO BE ABOUT 50-75 FEET IN DIAMETER AND APPROXIMATELY 25-50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THE LIGHT WAS OBSERVED FOR 20-30 MINUTES BEFORE IT SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED.

ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, THERE WERE NO UNUSUAL SOUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIGHT. HE STATED THAT IT ILLUMINATED THE SURROUNDING AREA AND CAST A SHADOW ON THE GROUND. ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO PHOTOGRAPH THE OBJECT, BUT NONE OF THE PICTURES TURNED OUT.

THIS REPORT WAS INVESTIGATED BY MR. PHILIP J. KLASS OF COLORADO, AN ENGINEER AND SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANT, WHO CONCLUDED THAT THE LIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A SWAMP GAS PHENOMENON.
