"Additional report:
This report came to me from a 59 year old credible citizen and resident of - - - Haverhill, N.H. who observed a strange object in the sky at about 8:00 p.m. EDT on 8 August 1963. The object was observed for about 10-15 minutes as it slowly moved across the sky in a northerly direction. It was reported as a large luminous object, circular in shape, and estimated to be 30-40 feet in diameter. The witness stated that it emitted a bright light and appeared to change color from white to blue-green. The object was observed through a telescope and the witness indicated that it appeared to have some type of structure within the bright light. No sound was heard. The witness is considered a reliable and credible observer."
