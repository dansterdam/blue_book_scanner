Because the sightings were of a moving star-like object, the Project Blue Book will attempt to determine if a satellite could be the stimulus.

SDC engineers are studying the above times and determined that COSMOS 103 rocket body would be visible from Auburn at the above specified times.

Project Blue Book will classify these sightings in the satellite category.

** If queried about the nature of COSMOS 103, the following statement is authorized:

COSMOS refers to a series of Soviet space research satellite launches. COSMOS 103 was launched on Dec 20, 1965, with an announced payload.
