"A BRILLIANT ILLINOIS FIREBALL

To Terry Schmidt's June 13, 1963, photograph of a fireball, which appeared in the Chicago American, I would like to add some additional information.

On June 13, 1963, a brilliant fireball was recorded at about 9:50 p.m. (CST) at the Adler Planetarium, for 1 minute and 15 seconds. Its apparent magnitude was minus 8, the meteor drill is nearly as bright as the full moon. This picture may have been taken from somewhere in central Illinois.

The fireball was photographed with a 4 1/2-inch camera lens, at f/0.7 and 1/200 second. The film was Tri-X, developed for 10 minutes in D-76 at 70Â°F.
