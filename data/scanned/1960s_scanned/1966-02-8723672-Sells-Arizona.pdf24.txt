VICTORIA AUSTRALIA 11/11/1967-

Dear Sir, Reading in the Science Digest, I somewhat surprised at the interest in the flying saucers Collecting the information interested in collecting. I intend to tell you of a 3 day raining from Australia a last february 27th 1966

I had been during middle of that country for some travelling 1964 east a distance of some miles in countryside when with family suddenly I saw in the sky a flying craft. It was circular and stationary and seemed to be about 60ft in diameter. Watching it for some 15 minutes I phoned the Director of the Museum of Victoria in Melbourne but could not get through. It rose slowly vertically to about 2000 ft and shoot away at tremendous speed. My wife and family also witnessed the amazons of the apparition. It was a gold silvery colour and had no visible means of propulsion. There was no sound. I have seen a watch of clock with me so as not know the exact time, but it was in the afternoon about 1.00 PM.
