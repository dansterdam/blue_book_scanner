CHERRY CREEK, NEW YORK - AUGUST 9, 1965

On January 8, 1965, the Air Force received a letter from a Mrs. XXX of Cherry Creek, New York, regarding a reported UFO sighting by her husband, Mr. XXX, on August 9, 1964. 

The major details of the report are as follows:

On August 9, 1964, at approximately 10:00 p.m., Mr. XXX observed a bright red-orange light in the sky over his home. The light was stationary at first, then began moving slowly to the northwest. It would then stop and hover, then move again. This pattern continued for approximately 30 minutes. 

Mr. XXX stated the object was approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length and gave off a bright glow. He reported that the object seemed to be under intelligent control, and that it disappeared from view by simply blinking out.

No other witnesses to the sighting were reported. This is the extent of the information contained in the Project Blue Book file on this particular case.
