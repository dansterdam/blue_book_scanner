SAW A UFO AS VERY CLOSE RANGE In Meridian, Idaho, at least four people in Meridian, Idaho, sighted a UFO as very close range on October 26th. The witnesses were a 26 year old man and his two sons, one of whom made the following report:

At approximately 8:45 p.m. on the 26th, he heard a noise in the house at 5:45 p.m. In Russell, Indiana, he looked outside. It was dark out, but he noticed a lighted object at tree-top level apparently hovering about 300 feet away. It seemed to be about 50 feet in diameter and was giving off a yellow-orange light. His father and younger brother also saw the object.

The object, they stated, made a very deep humming noise, paused for a few minutes, and then moved off to the northwest at a very fast speed, disappearing from sight in about 10-15 seconds. Very little time elapsed between the object pausing and its sudden departure at the high speed.

The report stated that the family, as well as the F.A.A., discounted the possibility that the craft could have been a helicopter.
