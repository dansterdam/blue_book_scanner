Dallas Police See Mysterious Flying Object

Dallas, Texas, January 7, - (UPI) - Dallas police reported sighting a mysterious object in the sky over the city early today, but could not identify it.

The object was first spotted at 12:15 a.m. by two patrolmen, P.T. Matthews and R.L. Hunt, who said it appeared to be about 30 to 50 feet long and extremely bright.

The patrolmen said the object hovered over the downtown area for several minutes, then accelerated at a terrific speed and disappeared. Sgt. Dillard Webb, another officer on duty, also reported sighting the object.

The Dallas Air Defense Command and Carswell Air Force Base were notified but neither could identify the mysterious flying object.

Some persons in the Dallas area have reported seeing similar objects in the skies for the past several weeks. Police said they are checking to determine if the object was a weather balloon, satellite, or some other type of aircraft.
