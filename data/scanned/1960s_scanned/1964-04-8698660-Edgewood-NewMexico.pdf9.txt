TWELVE SHOTS FIRED AT FLYING SAUCER: A news report dated April 23rd, just four days after the Socorro incident, tells of another astonishing occurrence in New Mexico. Don Adams of Edgewood, N.M., saw a glowing greenish-colored object about 25 feet long, hovering only 100 feet above the ground, as he was driving late on the night of the 27th. As he drove under the object, his car stalled. (This is just one more case of the strange "electromagnetic effects" magnetic on saucers - Editor.) Thereupon, the young man got out and fired six shots at the UFO, then reloaded and fired again. The first six bullets did not hit the saucer and were just lost in space. By that time the UFO was drifting silently northwards. Originally, it had been directly over his head. Once the saucer had left the vicinity, his car started again.
