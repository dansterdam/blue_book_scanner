"Many Reports Says'
9/26/64

Prof. Charles Mancy, AFRO member in Ohio, forwarded the following information:

John Dodson, 15, Franklin, Michigan, 14, of Redford, Michigan, reported he and four companions saw an object that seemed to hover over the General Motors Foundry where they worked on August 28th, 1964.

According to the boys, the object was about 50 feet in diameter and seemed to be lit up on the underside. The object was first spotted when one of the boys who was working alone noticed a bright light approaching in the sky. He called the others and they all watched as the object slowed down and seemed to hover over the General Motors Foundry. The object made no sound and seemed to be standing still.

It had lights arranged horizontally and appeared to change colors, according to the boys. One boy said 'it moved slowly at a moderate speed and then shot up vertically according to the boys. They described the sound as a 'high pitched continuous whining sound'...and the object was 'brilliant'.

It was daylight when the object was sighted and the boys said it was 'dazzling'."
