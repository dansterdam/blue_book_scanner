Dear Sir:

ON MONDAY, September 19, 1966 at approximately 9:30 P.M. a teacher-A. D. Williams and a student were conducting routine driving the football squad through and above the trees which appeared to be a most unusual occurence, but a more careful examination showed the object disappeared behind or in the trees.

There was a reflection, but it had a reddish-orange glow and was shaped in the formed of a quarter moon, the size of about car top and approximately 300 feet in width and approx-
imately 150 feet in length.

The object appeared approximately 5 miles South of Keynesville: Louisiana. We think this is worthy of investigation.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
