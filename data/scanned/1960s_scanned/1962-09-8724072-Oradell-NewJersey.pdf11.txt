MAJOR "FLY" IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY. An important "Fly" in Hillsdale, N. J., and 
surrounding area was reported at approx. 9:30 P.M. EST on 7 September 1962. The 
object was described as being approx. 25 ft. in diameter and moving at high speed 
in a Northwest direction at an altitude of approx. 1000 ft. 
Observers were: 
Mrs. Mary Ann Smith, 5 Springdale Road, Oradell Park, N. J.
Mr. Robert Stanley, 14 Grant Road, Oradell Park, N. J.,
Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Crane, 154 Highland Avenue, Oradell, N. J.
Mrs. Smith said that the object appeared to be surrounded by a red glow and made 
no sound as it passed overhead. She said it just about blotted out the stars as it 
went by. Mr. Stanley said that it appeared to be a solid, well defined object and 
did not blink or pulsate. Mr. Crane said that there was no trail or exhaust visible. 
The object was observed for approx. 10 to 12 seconds and then disappeared from view 
to the Northwest. No explanation or cause for this observation was determined.
