TEXT/UFO
Request for UFO Evaluation, ********** 13 December 1966

Hq USAF (SAFOIR)
Reference the attached letter from ********** requesting the evaluation on his sighting of 8 March 1966. His case is being placed in the "Other" category, specifically, conflicting Data. In one place he mentions that the object disappeared after approximately ten minutes. In another place he mentions that the object did not disappear while he was watching it. The turns would have appeared much steeper than usual. As an aircraft in the distance could have been observed at such a distance, turns would have appeared much steeper than usual. The turns could account for the color fading at times.

FOR THE COMMANDER

LOUIS De GOES, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems
