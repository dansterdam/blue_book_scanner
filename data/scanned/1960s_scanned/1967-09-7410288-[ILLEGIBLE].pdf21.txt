UFO Observation, 10 September 1967
Rochester, New York 14605

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation on 10 September 1967.

2. If the object is as large as you say (six match heads to cover the object) and you observed it for thirty minutes, why didn't your girlfriend's mother and sisters also see the UFO?

3. We acknowledge your copies of the AFTO Form 164. However, you may do as you wish with the additional form since we have all the information we need on your observation.

4. Thank you for your assistance in providing additional information on your observation.
