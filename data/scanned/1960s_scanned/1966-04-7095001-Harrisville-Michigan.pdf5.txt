The image appears to contain a handwritten note and a signature. The note mentions a "personal drawing, reflecting the object seen by the observer". However, there is no photograph or image present in this particular page of the document.

Extracting the text from the document:

mentioned in item l, above, might well have been the answer.  In view of the fact that the boy saw what he thought to be these UFOs the previous week after talking the situation over with his father he decided it must have been a figment of his imagination.  However, because of the conversation with his father, and after looking at pictures of other reported sightings in Life Magazine, I personally feel that he is still the object of some investigation.

1. None.  A personal drawing, reflecting the object seen by the observer, is attached.
