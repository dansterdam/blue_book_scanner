The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Concerning your letter of December 20, 1965, on the subject of objects of unusual nature observed in the sky, I regret that I can furnish you only the information which has been developed under Project Blue Book. The nature of these objects or phenomena, as they could not be identified, indicates that they could be considered unidentified. Also, I believe that Form 164 might confuse things. The manner in which we keep records, which took several weeks to prepare, have presented the total story and the identification of the objects, which have had the report commended by several UFO investigation groups.
As for the negatives, I can not submit the originals, for they disappeared between Lincoln and Valentine. I have no objections to the destruction thereof, but do not possess the file or the negatives. I wish to know anything about the objects that be quite unidentified, identifiable nor seen before. I will endeavor to furnish any information on the basis of our investigation, without disclosing the source of the report.
