DEAR ROGER, 

This is the second part of my report on my trip to New Mexico.

On the day after I visited Holloman Air Force Base, I drove to Roswell, New Mexico, which is about 125 miles south of Alamogordo, where the Air Force Base is located. I had driven in this area on September 18, 1962, and photographs, which were made at Roswell, New Mexico, were said to have been taken of objects in the sky that same day. These photographs, which have attained some notoriety, purportedly showed sighting of unidentified flying objects. I was anxious to interview the people involved and to try to ascertain the facts in this matter.

Dr. and Mrs. XXXXX operate the La Fonda restaurant in Roswell. Apparently they do fairly well, and appear to be questioned frequently by curious visitors to Roswell who are interested in the "flying saucer" incidents which were alleged to have occurred in that area. They told me that on July 4, 1947, some ranchers had brought in some rather strange debris, which they claimed had fallen on their property. They stated that the ranchers had notified the Roswell Army Air Field of this, and that the military had promptly sent out a detail to pick up the material. The ranchers showed them a rather large area where a great many pieces of this unusual wreckage were strewn about.

Both he and his wife were quite reluctant to discuss the details of that particular incident. They did state, however, that this was the subject of much notoriety at the time, and that it resulted in a good deal of publicity and interest on the part of the public. They indicated that much of this was "blown out of proportion."
