The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be a report or letter, discussing a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The text is written in cursive handwriting and discusses the details of the sighting, including the object's appearance and behavior.

Transcribing the text:

"The object was spherical and attached to the bottom of a seemingly long and thin cylinder. The aspect of the object was about 1:4 and its apparent size was slightly larger than a dime as viewed from 40 feet away.

It passed over very slowly and silently, maintaining a constant altitude of 50 to 100 feet. As it passed, I saw no source of propulsion, no flames, fire or smoke. 

As I went to tell the family, there was a brief flash in the area of the object, and the object was gone, just as suddenly as it had appeared. There was no noise or vibration of any kind.

I remember that the object seemed about 20 to 25 feet in diameter and the cylinder was rather longer, perhaps 50 to 60 feet in length. The speed was very slow, only about 20 to 25 miles per hour, and the direction of travel was from southwest to northeast.

I hope this information may be of some use to you. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."
