Text from the document:

At about 5:55 pm on the evening of 8 October 1960 I was standing in my front yard at 404 Willard St, Shreveport, Louisiana, looking to the west. I observed a very bright light, moving rapidly across the sky from west to east. It was bright enough to be clearly visible in the daylight. It appeared to be an elongated oval shape and was traveling at a very high speed, much faster than any aircraft I've ever seen. It seemed to be at a very high altitude, probably 30,000 feet or higher. After traveling about halfway across the sky it suddenly disappeared from view. The whole sighting lasted only about 10 seconds. I have no explanation for what this object could have been. It did not resemble any aircraft or other known object in the sky.
