Brilliant object, as before.
Later checks proved that no unidentified object was in the sky, only the other celestial bodies. Apparently there was little cloud cover in the area I was observing.
I thought you might want to keep this information on file in case other reports will be turned in. The object should have been seen around the Terre Haute area and nearby villages. I would appreciate any answer or information you could give me concerning this sighting. 
I will be available for further information.
Sincerely,
