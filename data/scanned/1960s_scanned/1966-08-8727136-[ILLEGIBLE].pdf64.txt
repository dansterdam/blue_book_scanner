34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 August 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or is corroborative evidence of your sighting:

About 8:30 P.M. Observers were washing dishes and looking out the kitchen window, which faces west. They saw a bright light in the sky, quite high, and moving steadily from North to South. The light moved very fast and blew apart in flashes, like an explosion, momentarily disappearing and then reappearing, continuing on its course. The lights shifted towards the west, moving in a horizontal direction at a constant speed (not fast). They finally faded from sight.

The observers were certain this was not an aircraft, helicopter, or any known type of aerial vehicle. The movement and behavior of the light was very strange, unlike anything they had seen before. They were convinced it was some type of UFO.
