The image provided contains a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a questionnaire or report form related to a UFO sighting. The page does not contain any photographs, only text fields for the observer to fill out.

As requested, here is the text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It appeared to gradually fade away or disappear, I couldn't tell which.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know
If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes (No) Don't Know
If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: The object made no sound that I could hear.
b. Color: The object appeared to be a dull silvery or metallic color.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had confirmed this measurement at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?  About 1/2 the diameter of the object would have been covered by the match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please be as precise as possible to show the direction the object was moving.

The sketch provided shows an elongated oval or elliptical shape, with no other details indicated.
