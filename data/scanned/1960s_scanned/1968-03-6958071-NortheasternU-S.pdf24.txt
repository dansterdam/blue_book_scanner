"They said Quintanilla. "I do not personally know anything about these objects. I am asked this frequently. We will send the full reports and records on the whole matter to you directly."
"But as long as there is some physical evidence that something was seen, and a reasonably qualified observer saw it, I believe there are aircraft or objects in space that are perhaps more than just natural phenomena. As to what they might be, I am always interested to have people provide more concrete information."
"YOU NEWSPAPER people have done it all.' Quintanilla said. "In 1957 a Newspaper reported the word 'flying saucer' was already out of style. You were right. It has been almost 20 years that this term has been used." 
"In his official record here, Quintanilla adds that this is only one object coming under his investigation which has not been identified. A citizen in Chesapeake City, Md., reported seeing a bright object in the sky on the night of March 3. He estimated the object he saw was about one quarter the size of the moon, was circular in shape with a bright orange and green lights."
"WE HAVE NOT FOUND much to work on in this case," said Quintanilla. "That is why we are asking it in we can get any more concrete information." He added, "I don't think we ever will end up with a 100 percent solution."
