WITNESS STATEMENT

WITNESS: Robert H. Woodside, Captain
LOCATION: Tucson, Arizona
DATE: October 7, 1967

On the night of October 7, 1967, at approximately 8:00 PM, I was on duty as an air traffic controller at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. While monitoring the radar screen, I observed an unidentified object displaying unusual flight characteristics. The object appeared to be larger than a conventional aircraft and was moving at a very high rate of speed. It made several sudden, erratic maneuvers that were not consistent with normal aircraft behavior. 

I immediately contacted the local authorities and the U.S. Air Force to report the sighting. A thorough investigation was conducted, but no definitive explanation for the object was ever determined. The incident was documented and filed as part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects.

I am submitting this witness statement as an accurate account of the events I observed on the night of October 7, 1967. I am willing to provide any additional information or clarification if needed.

Signed,
Robert H. Woodside, Captain
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base
