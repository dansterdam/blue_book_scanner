Text transcription from the document:

"I believe the head "shot" so to speak is the center portion of the frame, and that the "mark" or image in the center is so high above the black line of the water that it is lighting the edge very slightly. The time of this picture is the right time of the picture as shown above, and the optical analysis is on the back of this sheet.

"KERRATION" is on the back of this picture
