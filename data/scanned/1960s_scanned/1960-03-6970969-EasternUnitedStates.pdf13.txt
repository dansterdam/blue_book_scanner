On April 3, 1960 about 2010A while eastlin in 13 Sandford st. I observed a saucer shaped object hovering about 250 ft. above the ground. The object was approximately 30 ft. in diameter, gray in color with a raised center. It appeared to be tilted at an angle. The object remained stationary for a few minutes then moved off rapidly to the east. As it moved, a blue flame seemed to come from the rear of the object and it was gone in a matter of a few seconds. The object was seen by myself and Godfrey P. Blount.
