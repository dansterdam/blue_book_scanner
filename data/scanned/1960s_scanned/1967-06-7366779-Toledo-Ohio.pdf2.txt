Major Dinsdale,

This is the report a sighting of Friday night, may be of interest to Air Force at Toledo Ohio and all from Sandvasky must the same night at about 11:00 A.M.

The first on the scene was a man by the name of Jim Tilly, a milk plant operator and his wife, the children asleep in the back. The observe the object hovering and at a sudden rise and rush to the south at a speed that was incredible, the others in a neighboring farm house saw the same thing.

The object was seen by at least 3 other witnesses in the vicinity and described as a brilliant light, elliptical in shape, hovering a few hundred feet off the ground and then suddenly accelerating forward and out of sight, and it required a clean bright day light this evening but we could not recall to be seen again at that time. I could see the object or whatever it was from my place and I felt there was something out of the ordinary and I'm sure Jim Tilly and his wife and a neighboring family would agree with me on this.

We would like very much if anyone in your Department has any information on this strange incident.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
