Aware of this, a mute shone in our sky a moment ago. Though no larger than a
star, it showed up plainly enough. It was an elliptical shape, moving at a steady
pace across the heavens in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be at a high
altitude and was plainly visible for several minutes before it disappeared from
view. I watched it closely, it was not a satellite, meteor, or any known object.
It was clearly an unidentified flying object. I cannot offer any explanation for
what I saw. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before in the sky. I hope
this information may be of some use to your study of the phenomenon of unidenti-
fied aerial objects. Please let me know if you have any other questions. I would
be happy to discuss this further.
Sincerely,
