MARS ONLY PLANET NOW VISIBLE
The magnitude stars are conspicuous to the unaided eye during May evenings. Mars is nearly 100,000,000 miles away. The brightest object in the sky this May is Saturn which is some 800,000,000 miles away as it now appears about 35 degrees from the sun. The disc of Mars, which is part of the inner planets, is now becoming very circular or nearly round. As the Earth moves rapidly toward the outer planets, Mars appears to be receding or moving farther away. On May 15th, for example, Mars will be about 93,000,000 miles away. By May 31st it will be about 98,000,000 miles distant. On June 15th, Mars will be about 103,000,000 miles from the Earth. And it is getting larger. Under good atmospheric conditions it may be possible to observe some of the surface details on Mars with a good telescope.
