God, that is of course the question. Been what do we have to do, what's left of it? There's no practical place for me to go now, no way to stay about it longer. The impact seems to me of continuing significance. I must comment on that further. All us find it necessary to continue here, what's left of it. How can you please believe one - don't know; still looks so real. Great lights in the field to thought many occupants of one or another explanation. Could be no other reason for our being set this way - on what a future do we greet. I hope some notice could have seen more light.
