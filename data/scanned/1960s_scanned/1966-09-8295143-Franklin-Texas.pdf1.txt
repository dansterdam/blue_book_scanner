The observers watched the objects for some time and noticed that the objects would fade in and out and appear in 3 different locations, sometimes simultaneously. The observers described the objects as shimmering and appearing to fluctuate in brightness. The description is consistent with the behavior of astronomical objects, likely stars or planets.
