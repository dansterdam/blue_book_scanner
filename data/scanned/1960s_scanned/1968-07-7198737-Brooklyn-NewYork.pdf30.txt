27. THE INFORMATION GIVEN BELOW WAS OBTAINED BY AN INTERVIEW AND EXAMINATION MADE ON APRIL 30, 1968. AS ACCURATELY RECORDED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
The picture seen does appear to be a definite object as there could be near certain details and form clearly visible and distinguable with a clear outline. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape, and of reasonable size, estimated at about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. It was observed clearly in the eastern sky for a period of time, estimated at 3 to 5 minutes, before disappearing rapidly out of sight.
