The text in the document is as follows:

22 October 1964

Dear Mr. 

We are in receipt of your report of unidentified flying object sightings on 9 September 1964 in the Boston, Massachusetts, North Shore area. This report has been considered with the conclusions as follows:

Apparent there were two or more objects observed and not identifiable as known aircraft. The sightings could not be evaluated as natural phenomena. 

The sightings of witnesses are and two cannot be evaluated as the available data provides insufficient detail of the observation to determine the nature of the object. A complete evaluation would include the weather conditions at the time of sighting, the nature and details of the terrain, the location of the observers, and the direction and movement of the object in relation to ground and celestial references. The object is in accord with this evaluation. The object was elliptical in shape with a well-defined outline. Color was reportedly silver/grey and brightly lit. No exhaust or vapor trail was observed.

By your continued investigation this possibility could be finding that the second object was just a star or planet and the first object was a more conventional aircraft such as someone with a spotlight perhaps attempting to locate the UFO.

The Air Force wishes to thank you for your interest in aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,

MASON H. JACKS
