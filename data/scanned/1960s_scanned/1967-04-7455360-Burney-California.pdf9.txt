Case 4533
Dear Major Quintanilla:
I examined that the evaluation be changed from ionized plasma to unidentified since there is nothing in the data to support "a charged particle plasma". To the best of my knowledge, this does not correspond to a physically reasonable phenomenon. I, at least, do not know of any known physical plasma that is supposed to occur shortly and is visible for approximately 10 minutes. This appears to be a purely ad hoc explanation, and it open to the severest criticism.
Since this case has also been submitted to the University of Colorado, I suggest that Ir revises an evaluation from them.
Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
