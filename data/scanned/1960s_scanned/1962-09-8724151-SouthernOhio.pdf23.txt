The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above the horizon. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine they are at the point shown and place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it, and a "B" to show how high the object was when they last saw it.

The second sketch shows two circular views, each depicting a landscape with a person standing in the foreground. The instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" on the first sketch to show the position of the object when they first saw it, and a "B" to show the position when they last saw it.
