There is no photograph present in the image. The image shows a handwritten document with text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

My husband has purchased a lake house up North. He received the pictures in May. He mentioned a white object which developed on the pictures and which could not be explained. It was just showing up and any shot a mile. If a person lands an object is seen - all allowed to photograph it ? I would like a help to this question.
