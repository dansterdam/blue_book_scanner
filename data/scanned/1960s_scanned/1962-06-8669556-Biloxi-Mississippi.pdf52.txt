There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page of text, likely from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. As per the instruction, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the output of all the text found in the document.

THE PROBLEM OF UFOIS DISCUSSED BY MEMBERS OF THE
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND MANY LAYMEN CONTINUES TO
BE CONTROVERSIAL. OPINIONS RANGE FROM COMPLETE
REJECTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF UFOIS TO FIRM BELIEF
IN BOTH THEIR EXISTENCE AND THAT THEY REPRESENT
INTERPLANETARY OR INTERSTELLAR CRAFT. CURRENT
'OFFICIAL' GOVERNMENT POSITION IS THAT UFOIS DO
NOT REPRESENT A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND
THAT REPORTED SIGHTINGS CAN BE EXPLAINED AS
NATURAL PHENOMENA OR MAN-MADE OBJECTS. HOWEVER,
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETENT AND RELIABLE
OBSERVERS CONTINUE TO REPORT SIGHTINGS OF
UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS WHICH APPEAR TO EXHIBIT
PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS BEYOND THE PRESENT
STATE-OF-THE-ART IN AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY.
