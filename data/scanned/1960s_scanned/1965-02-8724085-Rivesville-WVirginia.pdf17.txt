UFO Over Southern California
Friedrich Burkert of Baldwin Park, Cal., reported seeing out into the late afternoon sky on 1955 and saw a clear-shaped object or vehicle about 20 minutes and then it moved slowly from 
the view and disappeared.
It made no sound. Burkert called his neighbor in Covina who couldn't see the objects but who reported three small red objects in a different direction. One object flew from horizon to horizon in 30 seconds.
The object seen by F. Burkert was like two saucers edge-to-edge with a red light on top and one on the bottom. "These 'gates' as Burkert called them, would light up one at a time until all sequence would start again.
