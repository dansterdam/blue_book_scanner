Dear Sir:
I have written to you once before about the topic of flying saucers. I am well aware that this letter may be considered a hoax, because I have seen them again and I believe even more than before.
It has been at least three months since I have seen it with my own eyes. His brother saw it at the same time, but we have seen it with our own eyes. I know you might mark this as a hoax, but can you send this to another form and I will give you as much information as possible. There was a jet next to the saucer. I could clearly see the markings on both sides of it and it seemed to be about 50 feet in length. I beg and pray that will be the one. believe me, it's no hoax.

Thank you
