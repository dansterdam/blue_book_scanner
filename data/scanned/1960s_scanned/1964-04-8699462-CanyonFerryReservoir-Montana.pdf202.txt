There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document, likely part of a Project Blue Book report. The text visible in the document is as follows:

"Commander of the Missile site notified by Colonel Sheppard of an unusual object sighted over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir, 10 miles NE of Helena, Montana, on the evening of April 8, 1964. The missile site personnel had observer this object for several hours, and their description appears to be as follows:

Object was observed to appear at approximately 2045 hours to the NW over the reservoir at an estimated altitude of 2000 feet. Object was observed through binoculars and was approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length. Object appeared to be hovering or stationary with no apparent propulsion system visible. After hovering for approximately 30-45 minutes, object accelerated from the area at a tremendous rate of speed, climbing rapidly out of sight, in a NW direction. During the entire sighting, the object exhibited no exhaust or trail."
