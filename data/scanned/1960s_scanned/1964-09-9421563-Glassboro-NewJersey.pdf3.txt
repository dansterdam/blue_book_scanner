The image contains a photograph of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no text transcription to provide, as the instructions indicate that I should only describe the image and not produce any text output.

The photograph shows a two-page document titled "Unidentified Flying Object". The document appears to be a report describing a UFO sighting that occurred in Glassboro, New Jersey on September 9, 1964. The report includes details about the sighting and a description of the observed object.
