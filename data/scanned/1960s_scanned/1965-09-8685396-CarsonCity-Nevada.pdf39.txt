DEEP FORK REPORT CITES
OKLAHOMA CITY SIGHTING
"We are releasing a comprehensive report on a recent incident involving a UFO sighting over Oklahoma City. This report, requested by the Air Force, was conducted by James H. Kerr, a photographer, and an associate editor of the JOURNAL. The sighting took place on August 9 and was observed by several reliable witnesses including Alan G. Smith, of Oklahoma City, a well-known newspaper writer.
According to the report, Smith stated he saw the object at about 10:30 p.m. while standing in his front yard. The object was described as round, with a diameter of about 40 feet and with a steady light encircling it. It was hovering silently at an estimated distance of about 250 feet above the ground.
Members of the Smith family who also observed the object said it appeared to be surrounded by a luminous cloud or haze, and they described the light as brilliant white in color. They said the object seemed to increase in the intensity of the light at times.
According to the report, Smith said the object was visible for about 15 minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a terrific speed and disappeared from view in the direction of the southwest.
Atmospheric conditions at the time were clear, and the object was visible to all members of the Smith family as well as two other neighbors who happened to see it. The report states that the witnesses could not make out any details of the object's surface, as it was too bright to enable close examination.
This incident, the report concludes, is one of the most clearly defined and well-authenticated UFO sightings to come to the attention of the JOURNAL. The JOURNAL plans to follow up on this report and will reprint it in full in an early edition."
