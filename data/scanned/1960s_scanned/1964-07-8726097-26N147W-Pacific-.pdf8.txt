LARGO SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL
LARGO, FLORIDA
July 7, 1964

Dear Sir,  
On the night of July 15, 1964 over the family and a friendly family, we were on the new campus of the school. We had almost finished picnicking when the children spotted a bright light in the sky. The light was stationary and we observed it for some time. The children became a bit frightened so we decided to leave. Upon returning home, the light was no longer visible. My wife and I are interested in any information you may have regarding this incident. Sincerely,
