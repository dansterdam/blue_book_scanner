Dear Sir(s),
I am a boy of 13 years of age, and I'm very much interested in U.F.O.'s. In May at Park Train School #3, a science fair will be held. For my science project I am working on U.F.O.'s. I have heard of your work and I was hoping that there was some information you can give me.
Also I was wondering if you had any medals or U.F.O.'s. If not, would you know of any place from which I can purchase a model?
Thank You
Yours truly,
