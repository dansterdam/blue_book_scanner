The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document.

The text of the document is as follows:

Roads - At roughly 1300, car
passed on road. Same car
turned around & passed again.
Couldn't get closer to examine.

As car went by, bright object
in sky moving slowly
towards east. Lost object
in low clouds.

Have many believe one
on pass to airport. Could not
explain what seen than cars."
Sincerely,
