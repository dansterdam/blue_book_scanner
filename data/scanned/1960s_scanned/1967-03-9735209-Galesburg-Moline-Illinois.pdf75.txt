New Downstate UFOs Reported: 'Like A Boxcar'
From Sundimes Wires
Two unidentified flying objects were reported over Moline, Ill., and Galesburg, Ill., Wednesday night, shining bright lights and appearing box-car shaped.
Policemen from both cities reported sighting the objects while patrolling on their beats. Deputies in Rock Island and Knox counties said they too watched the objects in the sky.
Moline Sgt. Glenn Kocinski said the object he saw appeared "like a boxcar" and was about 4,000 feet in the air, hovering for about 10 minutes and then leaving at a high rate of speed.
Rock Island County deputy sheriff Frank Courson, who said he saw the object for about 15 minutes, estimated it was 50 to 60 feet in diameter.
The object, he said, then shot "straight up" and disappeared.
Courson said the object he watched was "very brilliant" and appeared to be illuminated from inside.
Officials said the object was later spotted by a pilot but could not be identified.
Galesburg police officer Thomas and Shereman Gaines said they watched the object for about 30 minutes and estimated it was about 80 feet long.
Deputy Sheriff Frank Courson jotted these observations in a small notebook while watching an unidentified object. (UPI)
