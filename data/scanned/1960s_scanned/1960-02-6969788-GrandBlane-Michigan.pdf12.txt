That was the letter received concerning unidentified indications sighted on radar near Grand Blanc, Michigan, on October 6, 1952. It was investigated at the time by the Air Force. Report filed by the Air Force states that radar at the Grand Blanc, Michigan, ADC station picked up several unidentified targets at various times on October 6, 1952. Photographs were taken of some of these targets but when developed were too hazy to be of value. Witnesses at the radar station advised that the targets were on the scope for an extended period of time, maneuvered rapidly, and disappeared from the scope at high speeds. As this case has been thoroughly investigated by the Air Force, no further action is required.
