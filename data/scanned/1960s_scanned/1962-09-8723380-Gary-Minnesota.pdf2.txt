Do whom it may concern:
I receive a lot of rocks in the mail for identification and recently received this one from Gary, Minnesota. It apperently came in on 2 September or '62. He says he has lived there for 3 years and the rock suddenly appeared in his yard. The chunk enclosed is about one-sixth the size of the chunk he found. It was about the time the Russian Sputnik pieces were found in Wisconsin. I have had reports from people in our area who say they break up so was wondering if some of it could have landed this far west. I would appreciate knowing the results of any test made on it.
Best wishes,
Fargo, North Dakota
