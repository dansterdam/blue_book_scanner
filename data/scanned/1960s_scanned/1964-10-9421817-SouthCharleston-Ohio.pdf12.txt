The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing a UFO sighting in South Charleston, Ohio on October 31, 1964.

SOUTH CHARLESTON, OHIO
31 OCTOBER 1964

A free lance photographer took a picture on 31 October 1964 at 5:30 pm EST. Three other shots were made of the same scene at the same location with slight changes in the exposure time. According to the photographer, the other three negatives are clear of foreign objects.

The strange objects that appear on the film were not visible to the photographer, nor were any sounds heard at time of exposure. Photo analysis personnel feel that the images were caused by a series of exposures prior to the film plate loading or after removing the film from the film clip holder.

This super-imposed image was probably caused by a reflection from a housed light source.

The sharpest image on the negative and prints is probably caused by a light with reflector and a screen over the reflector, such as is commonly used for ceiling lighting.
