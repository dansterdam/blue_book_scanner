UFO Sighting, Rolla, Missouri
Hq USAF FEYDOIC (Mrs Hunt)
Reference the attached letter from Mr. requesting information on the sighting. The following is a suggested reply:

We have checked the satellite schedule on the date and time of 6 October 1965 and find that only Pageos I was in the area, however, this satellite is in a very high orbit and its magnitude is low. Therefore, it is quite likely that one or more of these other satellites were observable. 

All known satellites have orbital flights with an easterly component, whether Northeast or Southeast, and have visual characteristics distinctly different from the objects described in the sighting. Also, there is no evidence that the sighting objects fit the pattern of any known satellites or space probes.
