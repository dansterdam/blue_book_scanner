The image contains three sketches or drawings rather than any photographs. The top left sketch appears to show a starry night sky or cloud patterns. The top right sketch depicts a landscape with hills or mountains. The bottom sketch shows various geometric shapes and patterns, possibly representing some kind of topographic or terrain map.

Text from the document:

The hills were very high and varied in shape. They appeared to extend in a South East direction. The landscape was covered with a definite pattern of markings which were reminiscent of contour lines on a topographic map, but they did not conform to any known terrain features. The markings appeared to be produced by some kind of energy disturbance rather than normal geologic processes.

The entire area was illuminated by a diffused glow of light which came from no apparent source. The light appeared to emanate from the ground itself. There was no horizon visible, only the mountainous terrain extending in all directions.
