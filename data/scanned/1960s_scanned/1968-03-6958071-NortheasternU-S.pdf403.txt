The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing a questionnaire with text responses.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE? 
DRAW A PICTURE OF HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED, AND PUT AN ARROW TO SHOW THE DIRECTION THAT THEY WERE TRAVELLING.
