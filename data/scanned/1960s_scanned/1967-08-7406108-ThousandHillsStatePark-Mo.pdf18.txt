DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STOP STILL AT CALLING YOU AWAY?
COME STILL AT GOING AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE SPEED?
CHANGE DIRECTION?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
THAT IS TO SAY, IT?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IS WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

My mother drew my attention to it.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

It went behind the trees.

B. DID IT SEEM TO BE HOVERING OR STANDING STILL, OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
