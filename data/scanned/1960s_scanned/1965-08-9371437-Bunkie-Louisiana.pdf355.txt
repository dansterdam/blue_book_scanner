Dear Mr. Hall:

In my letter of Sept. 7, I said that the photos that accompanied my report on unidentified objects or phenomena would be forthcoming. They are enclosed.

By photographic analysis, it was determined that photos A and A1 in the reports were two different printings of the same negative, so to save some, only the `best copy' negative was printed. 

I am most interested in your opinion of the nature of the phenomena that I observed.

Very truly yours,
