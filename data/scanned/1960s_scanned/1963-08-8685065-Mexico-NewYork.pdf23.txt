The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document or report. The text in the document appears to be a description of a UFO sighting or encounter.

I cannot identify any individuals mentioned in the text, but I can provide the full text found in the document:

"I was doing because I notice the plane was flying very fast. how did seem like an engine carrying and slowly going down, the color seemed whitish, when the plane was going down it was a blink of a light, plane went back to normal, the object stopped and start to move a little and then stop again, it was about four minutes, and all the maneuver of the object was really outstanding that day, and everyone was a little puzzled then you directly was back to normal."
