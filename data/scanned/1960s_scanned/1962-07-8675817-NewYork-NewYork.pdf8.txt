The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page describes an incident that occurred on July 9, 1962, where an object of the size of a star was observed and compared to the echo satellite of the previous year. The writer is providing this information to the recipient and asking them to examine these two incidents.

July 9, 1962. The object in point was the size of the average star as it appears to us, and it was high in the sky. It was about 72 deg. St. It travelled from horizon to horizon - the Southwest to Northeast. It was very similar to the Echo satellite of last year.

We feel it necessary to bring this information to you. We hope you will quench our thirst for knowledge concerning the matter at hand by explaining, if possible, these two incidents.

Sincerely,
Press Officer
Vice President
