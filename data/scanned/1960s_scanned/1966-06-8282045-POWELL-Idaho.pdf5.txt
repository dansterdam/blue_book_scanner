Prepared reply to letter from Gail Garrison, July 26, 1956 (received 1956)

Dear [redacted],

I acknowledge your letter in which you reported your unidentified observation of June or July 1956.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to often much of an explanation. Essential data such as maneuver, flight characteristics, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation at the time, it would have been possible to take a better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data.

The [redacted] information on Project Blue Book is of interest to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
