There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, dated July 29, 1965, regarding a UFO sighting that occurred on July 15, 1965 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The text in the document is as follows:

SUBJECT: UFO Report - 15 July 1965 (Westmont, Massachusetts)
DATE: 29 August 1965
FROM: Raymond D. Fowler - 237 Howard St., Framingham, Massachusetts 01701
TO: NICAP

The following report is providing information concerning the sighting of a UFO at Westmont, Massachusetts on 15 July 1965 between 10:30 PM and 2:00 AM EDT. The observers were a resident of Westmont and a licensed civilian pilot.

This phenomenon is still in the process of evaluation, over 40 UFO reports received from early to late hours of sighting. Several have been eliminated as hoaxes, a high-flying aircraft, the moon, satellites and misidentification of an aircraft. Because of the volume of reports being received, detailed accounts and our evaluation will be slow in reaching NICAP. The continuing "study" is actually reading an interpretation.
