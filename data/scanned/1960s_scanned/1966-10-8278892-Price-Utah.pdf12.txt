Dear Mrs. *****,

Reference is made to your recent unidentified flying object (UFO) observation and the photographic which you submitted.

Photographic analysis revealed the following: Examination of the submitted color slides has shown the unidentified objects to a result of an artifact within the photographic film. Identification of everything except several sources of lights. Although the object was determined to be a light source, it could not be identified as to the type, size, shape, etc. The light sources on the October 8 and October 15, 1965 frames were identified.

The photograph indicates a repetitive coverage of the exact same target on subsequent photographs from a common point. Each exposure reveals a different shape for the light sources. This is a common phenomenon which is caused by two long exposures when the camera is hand held. The resulting frames are April 7 although showing a different pattern of light sources, exhibit camera movement also.

The description of your visual observation is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. To obtain a photograph of an astronomical body requires high speed film and a tripod to prevent camera movement. Your slides are enclosed; thank you for submitting them for analysis.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
