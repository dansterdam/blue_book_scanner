The image does not contain any photographs, but rather sketches or drawings. The first sketch shows a curved line and an object above the horizon line, with instructions to indicate the positions of the object when it was first seen and when it reached its highest point above the horizon. The second sketch contains three different landscape illustrations, with instructions to indicate the position of the object when it was first seen and a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
