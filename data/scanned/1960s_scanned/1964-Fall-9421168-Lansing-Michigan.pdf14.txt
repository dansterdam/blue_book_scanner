UFO form continued

Was not too clear as to the details but the reporting individual had no doubt what he saw was a UFO. He said it was cigar shaped, dark in color and moved silently above the trees. The object was accompanied by lights that seemed to flash intermittently. He said the object came down closer but then suddenly shot back up and flew away in the same direction. He watched it for about 2 minutes until it disappeared from sight. This case seems to have problems in that the reporting individual failed to notice any details, such as size, speed and altitude, that could be verified. It is a classic example of an observation of a UFO that is subjective in nature and cannot be evaluated scientifically.
