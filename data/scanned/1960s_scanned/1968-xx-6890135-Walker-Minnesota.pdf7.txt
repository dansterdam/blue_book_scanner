The image does not contain any photographs, only a sketch/diagram and text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.

90°    75°
60°    45°
30°    15°
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path. Show any changes in direction during the course. Through it appeared to be standing still, I saw it move higher in the sky at intervals of several minutes. Then we lost it when we drove to our destination, and I saw it high in the sky, about 90° and I tipped out of the car at about 60°.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Only one.
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
