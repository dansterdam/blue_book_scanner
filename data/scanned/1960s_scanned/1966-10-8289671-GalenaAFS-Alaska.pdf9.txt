OCT 27 1966

Dear Miss ***,

Reference your letter of August 22, 1966, concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object on October 15, 1966. Your report has been reviewed and a conclusive explanation due to the date of your sighting.

Sightings such as yours are extremely difficult to trace since there is much a time lapse involved - space reports several months old are somewhat difficult to analyze.

We regret the unfortunate circumstance that arose, causing such a delay in reporting your observation. Your report will be kept on file to aid our analysis in their investigations.

If in the future you observe another unidentified object, suggest you place a collect telephone call to the nearest Air Force Base. They in turn will do a prompt investigation.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. For your information we are including the brochure on Project Blue Book which describes the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR. 
Lt Colonel, USAF
