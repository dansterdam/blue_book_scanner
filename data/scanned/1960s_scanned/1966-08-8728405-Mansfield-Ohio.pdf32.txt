The text in the document is as follows:

Report of sighting of August 17, 1956: Roseau-Thief River Falls
Witness: Two other passengers [redacted], Roseau, Minnesota [redacted].

The Report: The [redacted] were driving back to Roseau from Thief River Falls, 50 miles to the southwest. They were just south of Holt (about 10 miles north of Thief River Falls on highway 32) when they saw a bright orange or red object appear in the sky slightly east of north. It expanded rapidly, at first having a dark hole in the center and then appearing "all colors of the rainbow". This appearance gave way to a silvery cloudlike appearance. About 10 miles further north, the second object appeared, and [redacted] called the attention of the others to it. The second object appeared apparently directly above the remains of the first, and went through the same sequence of appearance. The clouds remained visible in the sky, apparently drifting slowly to the northwest, all the time while the rest of the trip was completed. At one point the clouds seemed to drift in front of the north star, which could be seen through the silvery cloud. The cloud also passed before a "bright star" in the northwest.

Time estimates are highly variable. [redacted] says that they arrived at Roseau at 10:42 CDT, which would place the initial sighting at about 15:43. [redacted] guesses that the initial sighting took place at 10:15 to 10:30. If [redacted] is off an hour, the initial sighting would agree with the others of this series provided the trip took around 50 minutes. According to the road map, the distance from Thief River Falls to Roseau is 60 miles by road, the road passing through 6 small towns starting with Holt.
