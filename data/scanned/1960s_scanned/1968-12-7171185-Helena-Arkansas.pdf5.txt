The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The top image is a compass rose or directional diagram with labeled cardinal directions. The bottom image contains two sketches depicting a person observing an unidentified flying object in the sky.

Now, as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract all the text found in the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "*" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "*" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON AFTER IT HAS MOVED. MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "*" - THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
