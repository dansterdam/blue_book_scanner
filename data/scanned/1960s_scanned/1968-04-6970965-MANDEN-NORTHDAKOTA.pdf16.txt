TOP-UFO
Letter of Appreciation

1. On behalf of Aerial Phenomenon Office and Hq Air Force Systems Command, may I express my appreciation to you and your wife for releasing the metallic specimen found in the vicinity of your home to our office for examination.

2. After a close examination of the item by USAF analysts, we are unable to determine the exact identity of the debris. The composition of the item, containing elements which are common, specially aluminum and iron, the physical condition of the item precludes any substantive identification. The investigation files, which are closed, considered this item unidentifiable.

Sincerely,

INSPECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
Aerospace Technologies Division
Production Directorate
