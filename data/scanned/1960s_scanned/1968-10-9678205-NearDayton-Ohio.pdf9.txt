The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. There is no visible photograph on this particular page. 

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

WHAT HAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLDS A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH, WHICH AT A DISTANCE OF 20 FEET WOULD SUBTEND ABOUT THE SAME VISUAL ANGLE AS THE OBJECT SEEN. SUCH AS A LIGHTED CIGAR OR CIGARETTE END. WHAT IS THIS OBJECT, OR OBJECTS, SEEN AND WHAT IS YOUR INTERPRETATION OF IT OR THEM.
