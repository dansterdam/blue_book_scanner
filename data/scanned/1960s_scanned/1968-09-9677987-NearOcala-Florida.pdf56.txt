Yes, because this report says Jacksonville Center, Mr. telephoned Senior Director (that is you)...

OK. Now the pilot had called Mr. and reported seeing the object. I don't know what the time lapse was, three or four minutes, when the second one appeared. And then the second one was under observation for a very short time and it went straight up and out of sight and there was no stabilizing on it. The other one, this one that they had closest and kept for a long time, was in fairly close to them occasionally and it would go off to the side and get motionless, and come out in front of them and dance around, bob around, and would go at about the same speed they were. Apparently this was there to five mile out, or so, and then they turned--they were, I think, going east at that time--and then they turned on a heading of about 150 to go down the peninsula of Florida. They continued to have observations of it on and off, and when they got under Miami Center Control they were still trailing it. They got on down and left Miami Center Control--this must have been 40 minutes or so later--and went over to the approach Control in the Palm Beach area and that is when we had radar pickup out of Patrick Air Force Base.

The radar pickup was out of Patrick, then. I didn't get that from before.

We didn't get any radar pickup from Cross City, Florida, or from Jacksonville, Florida. We never scrambled any aircraft to go out and try and get a visual on it.
