Dear Mr. W,
Just read your article in the Chicago Sunday Tribune regarding page 3 of your handwriting and the same match expected on the handwriting on the card found in the possession of the individual who was having the trouble with this switch. These object were circularly in shape and that is what I am trying to tell the U.S.A.F. that they would be of great help information and investigation if their pilot saw anything circularly in nature.
