REQUEST FOR 1970 ANALYSIS
 
TO: AFNIC (Major Coleman)
AITTN: Mr. D. C.

1. ATIC received a letter from Mr. about reporting the sighting of a UFO and requested analysis. The case was reported by STEWART AFB Nashville, Tenn.

2. On 23 MAY 1961, Jackie Creek Radio, located about 25 miles north of Nashville, Tennessee, at an altitude of 1,200 feet, spotted a high altitude northwesterly object through a telescope and positively identified the object through a telescope as a balloon. The object was so high it could no longer be seen with the naked eye. The Air Force pilots, while flying at 47,000 feet, saw the object and confirmed that it was far enough below them so that they could no longer see it with the naked eye.

3. ATIC has confirmed the object was probably the high altitude balloon Department of Commerce approved. This confirms STEWART AFB analysis. COORDINATION: ATIN-4-CB/DAMES C. COLEMAN/CAPT USAF DATE: 18 JUNE 1961
