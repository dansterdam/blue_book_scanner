Finally both objects disappeared below the eastern horizon. We returned to the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office and met Deputy Sheriff Gooch and met Deputy Sheriff Hesse, who had been to Los Molinos and clearly described to us what we had seen. The night jailer also was able to corroborate the subject and its maneuvers exactly as we had seen them. 

The objects were about 1950 hours and observed for about 15 minutes. During this time there was experienced radio interference.

We submit this report in confidence for your information, we were chinh after our initial shock and decided to observe and record all we could of the objects.
