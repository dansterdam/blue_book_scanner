REPLY TO
ATTN OF: LOUNE-O/Captain King 1. Reference your letter, 7 May 1968, subject as above.

2. I have no knowledge of the indicated report. Although I was UPO Project officer at that time, your letter of 19 September 1967 was not referred to me. No investigation was made.

3. The only assistance I am able to offer is that the object was seen in the vicinity of Flathead County Airport.

Captain, USAF
