August 31, 1962

Dear

I regret the delay in appearing your letter of March 24th.
The sighting your witnessed was evaluated as being an aircraft
area and the delay in receiving the complete information is caused
possibly to the evaluation of the aircraft which caused the delay.
This delay in providing the complete information is evaluated within the speed
of both conventional and jet aircraft.

There is no association between the sighting and the appearance
of the aircraft. Your interest is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM J. LOOKABAUGH
