Dear Mr. [redacted],
This is in reply to your letter of July 7, 1968, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object or UFO.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation or what you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire, the people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate this matter and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base or the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more complete report.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting by looking at the sketches or drawings often reported as UFOs in the Project Blue Book report we are enclosing.

Sincerely,
JAMES M. AIKMAN
