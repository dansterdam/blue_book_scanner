"PFT (UFO)
Existence of Extraterrestrial Flying Saucers

Parsippany, New Jersey 07054

Dear Mr. _____,

This replies to your letter dated 10 Jan 1969. I do not share your concern with regards to the existence of extraterrestrial flying saucers. As you have undoubtedly noticed, the claims that extraterrestrial life exists at Alpha Centauri or any other planet or star in the cosmos - if you have positive proof that flying saucers exist, then I am sure that the National Academy of Sciences would be most grateful if you would supply them with this information.
