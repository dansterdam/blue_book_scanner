Enclosed for your information files is a report of an unconventional object sighted on February 25, 1967, over the intersection of routes 1,95 and 1/93 at 6:29 P.M. Although the object described is similar to that of a conventional aircraft, the witnesses, after close observation, indicate it was not an aircraft but an unconventional manifestation.
