STATEMENT

"At 1910 hours, 25 February, my friend (name deleted) and I were standing outside Burrill Hall on the University of Illinois campus, when we observed an object which appeared to be hovering over the main library. (Illinj Tower is a building 15 stories high). We observed an object which appeared round and stationary, and seemed to be surrounded by a bluish glow. It appeared to be dropping ashes or sparks. Then the light reBECame a steady glow and disappeared to the north east.
