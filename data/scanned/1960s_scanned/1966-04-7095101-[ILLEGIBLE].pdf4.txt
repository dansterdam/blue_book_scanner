The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter on official letterhead from the United States Air Force regarding a UFO observation report.

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],
We have completed our evaluation of your April 10, 1966 observation and photographs of an unidentified flying object.
Although the images appeared genuine (as opposed to photographic hoaxes), we were not able to determine the cause or nature of the object. It was interesting to note however that you state you were photographing a known aircraft. This would seem to indicate that the object you observed had some different characteristics.
Also noteworthy is the fact that no effect on the aircraft itself would occur at the speed. Also noteworthy is the fact that no significant degree of "blurring" as would be expected when a fast moving object is photographed.
Although it is a mystery, our conclusion is that the images are likely caused by the camera itself making a small object which was thrown into the air photographed.
It appears that the photograph is not typical of the object observed by the witness. The quality is not sufficient to indicate that any extraterrestrial vehicle was observed.
I am enclosing your negative and prints. We appreciate your interest in our program.
Sincerely,
GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
