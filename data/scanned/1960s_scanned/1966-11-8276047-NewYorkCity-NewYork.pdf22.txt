The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a diagram with angles and instructions for reporting UFO sightings, but no actual photograph.

37. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the horizon where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you lost the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
