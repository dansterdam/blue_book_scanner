There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically a questionnaire from Project Blue Book. 

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

34. Have you completed this questionnaire:   Day ___ Month ___ Year ___

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
