Doctor Quintanilla, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Dear Sir:

Since we have not heard from you since our letter of December 27, we are writing this to request some information about the report that we sent in to you on September 3rd. We have not as yet received any acknowledgment that we have just seen stars or planets, or high altitude aircraft.

As we mentioned in our letter to you, it could not be classified as the usual type of unidentified flying object. It was a much larger and slower moving object, and it may not even have been the same as others that have been reported in the past. 

As you know, we are all familiar with all the 3-47's and B-52's, and other conventional types of aircraft, and we are quite familiar with the manners and flight characteristics of all kinds of aircraft. This was quite different, and it is our sincere feeling that it is not some kind of conventional aircraft that could have been in the air at that time.

What concerns us the most is that many people are quite upset and disturbed over the sighting, and incidentally, unless we are able to furnish them with some kind of explanation, it creates a great deal of rumors and speculation on the part of the public. Will you please let us hear from you as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

Patrolman Eugene Bertrand
Patrolman
Exeter, New Hampshire
