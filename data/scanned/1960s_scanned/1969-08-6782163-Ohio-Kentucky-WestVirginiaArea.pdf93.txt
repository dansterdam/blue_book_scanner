LOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND TURN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
STAND STILL
GIVE OFF SMOKE
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
AS WE TURNED THE CAR WE OBJECT LIT UP THE SKY.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
IT APPEARS TO LOSE BRIGHTNESS AS IT MOVED A SLIGHT DOWNWARD ARC.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
AT FIRST IT APPEARED TO BE VERY NEARLY AS HIGH AS THE PLANE MOVED IN THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION. IT GRADUALLY FADED OUT AT THE 5 O'CLOCK POSITION IN RELATION TO THE MOON.
