The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of reports on unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings investigated by the United States Air Force.

Text transcription from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 21 June 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: As a U.F.O. is sighted, the small and weak and poor in appearance. It is not a airplane or helicopter but a small saucer looking thing. It came up out of the swamp moving very slow, and went back into the swamp, the light was very dim. There was no sound at all and only lasted about 15 seconds. The shape was round and about 15 to 20 feet across. There was a glow all around the object and the color was yellowish white. A faint outline could be seen and there was no wings, propellers or jets. It flew level and did not change altitude. As it went back into the swamp, it appeared to sink down and disappear. There was about 100 yards visable at the most. The object was close to the ground, about 50 to 75 feet. I would judge the speed to be about 15 to 20 miles per hour. The object seemed to be under intelligent control. I am certain that what I saw was definitely not any known aircraft.
