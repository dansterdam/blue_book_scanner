26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The object I saw was oval-shaped and metallic in appearance. It seemed to be hovering silently in the sky, changing direction and speed without any visible means of propulsion. It was quite large and appeared to be solid, with no discernible openings or appendages. The object emitted a faint glow or halo around its edges, but there were no lights or markings that I could make out. It was a very strange and puzzling sight that I have never encountered before or since.
