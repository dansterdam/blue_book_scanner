The image provided is a black and white photograph showing an intricate grid or graph-like pattern. The image appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). There is no obvious photographic depiction of a UFO in this particular image.

As requested, I will now proceed to act as an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system and output all the text found in the document:

Lincoln, New Hampshire 
August 30, 1961
There appeared in the sky to the east-southeast, a seemingly large object resembling a luminous sphere, surrounded by a diffuse glow.

The object seemed to remain practically stationary for one to two minutes. It then appeared to move away rapidly in a northeasterly direction until it was no longer visible. The witness estimated the duration of visibility to be approximately two to three minutes.

The object appeared to have a solid, circular shape, surrounded by a diffuse glow or haze. There was no trail or exhaust visible.

The witness, a retired Air Force officer, stated that in his opinion, the object was not an aircraft, balloon, or any known celestial body. He further stated that he had observed many aircraft and celestial bodies in the course of his career, and that this object was unlike anything he had ever seen before.
