INVESTIGATION OF PRESQUE ISLE PARK UFO SIGHTING
Youngstown Municipal Airport (COGAC)
Youngstown, Ohio
LOCATION: Presque Isle State Park
Erie, Pennsylvania
OBSERVATION: On 8 Aug 66, at approximately 0155L, the Youngstown Municipal Airport Control Tower Operator observed an excellent saucer-shaped object which he investigated the phenomena and all available witnesses. The object appeared to be about 50-75 feet in diameter and was hovering at an altitude of approximately 500-1,000 feet. It had a bright blue-white light shining downward, and navigation lights were visible also. The object remained in the area for about 5-10 minutes, during which time other witnesses in the area confirmed the observation. This report is based on information and samples submitted to SAFPR on 3 August 1966.
