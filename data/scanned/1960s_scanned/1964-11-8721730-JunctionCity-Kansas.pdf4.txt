Dear Messrs Whitesaker and Wolford:

With reference to your letter of November - in which you reported observing an unidentified flying object. Attached is a copy of AF Form 164. It is requested that you complete the form as fully as possible and return it to this office for further evaluation.

With reference to your query on sending boys from college education, there are many college students who have reported seeing unexplained aerial phenomena. The Air Force maintains a continuing interest in gathering all factual data which may have a bearing on the subject.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerospace Information Division
