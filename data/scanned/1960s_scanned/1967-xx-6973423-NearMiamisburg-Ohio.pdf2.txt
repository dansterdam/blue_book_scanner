The object appeared to be very small and very high. It could be described as a medium size star on a clear night when it reflected the sun. Because it continually reflected brightly for a few seconds and then went to a dull or no reflection at all, it gave the impression it was spinning very slowly ( about one revolution every 15-30 seconds). It appeared to be solid since it reflected light as might a high altitude small jet plane.
