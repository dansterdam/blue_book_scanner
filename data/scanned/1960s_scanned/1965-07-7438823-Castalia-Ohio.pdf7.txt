CASTALIA, OHIO
23 JULY 1965

Observer was out, viewing Venus from approximately 2040 - 2100 EST as it was setting. Observer then began to observe other stars and planets in the sky. At 2115 as observer was viewing the astronomical bodies he suddenly saw a shining light. This object was moving in a SSE direction. The observer stated that the object was brighter than Venus but not as bright as Venus. 

The object made no noise at all during the observation. The object was first noted near the star Deneb and proceeded between Lyra and Vulpecula through Aquila to Sagittarius where it stopped, grew dimmer and disappeared suddenly.

The total time of the observation was approximately ten seconds.

COMMENTS
A logical explanation of the reported sighting would be a meteor, although the time factor is in excess of those normally reported for a meteor (5 - 8 seconds). Whether a trail or tail was visible was not reported, making such an explanation impossible. Considering the available information the case is being listed as unidentified.
