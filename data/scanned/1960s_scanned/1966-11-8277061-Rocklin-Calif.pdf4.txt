Here is the text transcribed from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
FADED UNTIL HARDLY VISIBLE-THEN APPEARED AGAIN AS IT MOVED.

AT CLOSEST POINT: approx. half

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
