The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The diagram includes a compass rose and lines depicting motion or direction. There is also a question asking the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion of an object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object. Please a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
