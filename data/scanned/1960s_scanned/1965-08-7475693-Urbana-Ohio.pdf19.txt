The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten report from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation program. The report appears to be a questionnaire filled out by a witness, with questions and answers about the sighting of an unidentified object.

The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Yes

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes. No. Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.
In moved behind

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes. No. Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: Orange - gray

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arms length with the known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment, then tell how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Matches with lens covered about 2/3 of object in distant

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an arrow to indicate the direction the object was moving.
