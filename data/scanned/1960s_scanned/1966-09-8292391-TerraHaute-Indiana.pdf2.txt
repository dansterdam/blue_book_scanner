The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten letter describing an unidentified flying object sighting. The letter is dated September 4, 1966 and was sent from Terre Haute, Indiana.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sirs:

I wish to relate a report of an un-identified flying object. As I went out onto my back porch I noticed the object appeared in the western sky about 10:10 p.m. on Saturday, September 3, 1966. I first believed it to be a star, therefore I didn't call for others to see it. There was, however, something different about this object as compared to other celestial bodies surrounding it. It had a definite brilliance. I thought this might have been because the object was at a lower altitude.

I sighted the object off a tree branch, and accordingly, it did not seem to move. But, at approximately 10:18, it faded readily in a western position, away from where I was sitting. Within approximately five seconds the area of the sky was completely clear of any object.
