AMUSEMENTS!

"Patterns" And "Diabolique" Merit
Attention Along With Cool Snap

YOU can't beat the weather for moviegoing. Midge-temperature, violet-colored Skies, the promise of a cool, quiet air-conditioned theater. Two of the five new movies opening this Wednesday are especially worthy of attention - "Patterns" and "Diabolique."

"Patterns," co-starring Ed Begley and Van Heflin, is simultaneously with the national release. It's a strong, absorbing drama and a compelling film. It's about the power struggle between a brash, driving young executive and his boss, the president of a large industrial organization. It's a little too literal and inevitable in its conclusions, but it's superbly produced and acted.

"Diabolique," which brought the recent "Sensation of the Art world - the twisted, climactic ending that puzzles fans and keeps them puzzled and wondering, is also a highly interesting, powerful movie. It was directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, based on the novel of that name, and it features the plot twists and weird ironic humor that are the trademarks of this master of screen suspense. This one is in French, but it's subtitled and well worth seeing.

"The Diabolique" stands alone as the more unusual attraction at the Art. Patterns could be at Loew's, the National or RKO-Keith's - a good example of reliable movie-making. But "Diabolique" is unique in its approach, in its climactic mystery. And while it may lack the mass appeal of "Patterns," it compensates in a speciality flavor that many will find fascinating.

This is a good movie week, with a cool snap to boot.
