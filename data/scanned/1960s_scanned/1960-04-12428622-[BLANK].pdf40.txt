Transcribing the text:

Suffice it to say that the 1947 incident continues to be of considerable interest to me. It is difficult to be certain how many reports were received at that time, but it appears to me an unparalleled example of the reporters' availability to give serious & boost to the popular mind by conceiving the opportunity for the demonstration of the phenomena as an investigation was pursued. There are certain cases that better service could be given to the world in describing the happening than the scientists in detailing the fashion, so about gathering their clues and creating what measurable condslusinn. I would like to point out that it is possibly the greatest incident for an investigator either to be inspired for a conclusion, or to be supported by a network of opinion, as a guide rightness.  There is a slight claim but in actual consideration are not arrived at by implication are careful step-by-step analysis.

I would like to recommend, in concluding, that since the problem has been with us for the past dozen years and is likely to remain as long as certain selected reports from time to time risk the risk of great popular curiosity (and by that I'm referring only to reports be carefully physical, not only of qualified/ scientific, but of a psychologist-a psychiatrist, a lawyer, and perhaps a prosecuting attorney, plus secondary public relations people.) have a panel, operating without climax or implies critics could address itself to the task of reviewing - not in a study of flying saucers - which appears to be idle - but in a way that would put things in context.
