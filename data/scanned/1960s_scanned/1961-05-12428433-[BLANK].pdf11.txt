The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a page from an old report document, likely from Project Blue Book, discussing "Inflatable Structures in Space".

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE

The text discusses various aspects of inflatable structures used in space, such as solar collectors, materials, and problems encountered in their use. It mentions studies conducted on the material properties of these structures, as well as the challenges of temperature cycling and potential brittleness over time. The text also discusses the use of other materials and the search for a suitable material for these structures.
