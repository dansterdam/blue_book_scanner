If you had - why don't you do this right now, even though it looks a little silly, hold your hand straight out in front of you, as far out as you can get it, and your thumb now, straight out (I'm doing it here too). Now if you'd held your thumb up against the light, would your thumbnail have covered it, would your thumb have covered the whole thing?
L    Ex If I held my thumb up against the light, v would my hav
H    Yes, that is, pretend your holding your thumb up toward the light and how much of the light,would it have covered all of it?
L    Oh, see those two ends went back, you know.  It would cover the whole middle part.  
H    I see.  But your whole hand would have covered it?
L    I just have my thumb up.  No, the middle part maybe.  You'd still see the edges.
H    Uh huh.  Let me put it this way.  As you were looking through the windshield at first - you never got out of the car did you?
L    No, I was too scared. My feet and hands were hot. Everything in the car got real hot.
H    Now this is something new that you hadn't told me before.  Tell me about xxxhhxxgaa that now.  Did you, I'll shut up now and you go ahead and tell me.
H    Well, Mark was - you know, Mark saw it first and he was looking at it and I asked him what that is, and he said he didn't know and then he wouldn't talk any more.  He just sat there and looked.  And then, if I remember I started crying a little bit, you know, I said Don't be scared.  Lock all the doors:  And we didn't get out because everything got hot.  It seemed like the inside of the car got hot, the bottoms of our feet.
