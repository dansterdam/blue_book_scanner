Messrs. ___ picked me up at my home about 6:30. We were traveling down Washington Street when __ said, "What's that?". I turned and saw a bright, luminous object in the sky above. It appeared to be at a distance of about a mile. There was a light very different from any aircraft light I have ever seen. She got very excited and said, "It must be a UFO or flying saucer". At that moment, the car lights and radio went out. We all became quite concerned. Then the object began moving rapidly toward us, very close. I was scared and I refused to get out of the car. We had just passed the Post Office and the car started.
