I think there's a Marine base there, if I'm not mistaken. And they were doing similar looking acrobatics, going straight up, over the top, straight down, and then back up again. And there were two of them, one following the other, and I think it was jet now, like I say, I never asked. But this is the only thing similar to this I've ever seen. And these acrobatics, went for a total of how many minutes? G I'd say about 15 minutes. H And then, let me get the sequence straight, after that it went off to the east. G It went off just to our right. H Oh, you said, 15Â° angle up and disappeared in the sky, did it? C Well, it disappeared into the other stars. We couldn't identify it, it's a point where we couldn't identify it from the other stars in the sky. R Right, well, this has been extremely helpful; I wish I knew the answer to this. G Well, I'm afraid only the good Lord knows these, some of these answers. I believe there are things that we who are mortals on this earth don't know about, but I have accepted the fact that there are things going on that we can't comprehend with our finite minds and I, too, am ready to meet the Lord, but Mr. Rushing is an unusual person; like I say, I don't believe you would gain any information from calling him.
