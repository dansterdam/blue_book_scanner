The image contains a sketch depicting instructions for reporting the sighting of an unidentified flying object. The sketch includes a compass rose and instructions for marking the location and movement of the observed object. There does not appear to be any photographic image included in this document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture of the path, or motion, of the object or objects sighted, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arrayed, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
