PROJECT 10373 RECORD
2. LOCATION Davenport, Iowa
19. CONCLUSION Case: Cetee (Unresellable Report) Photo: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted and photographed a grey, grayish-white object. However, the observer was requested to submit polaroid photos, but failed to do so. In the course of the followup contacts, the date and time of the sighting could not be ascertained definitely, as the observer indicated uncertainty on still another, 15 minutes. He also stated that other unidentified objects were sighted, but addresses, even after requested to do so, never gave any further details.
