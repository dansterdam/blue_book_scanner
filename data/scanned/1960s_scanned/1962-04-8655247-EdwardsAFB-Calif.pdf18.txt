There does not appear to be any photograph in this scanned document from Project Blue Book. The image shows text about various topics such as an "Air Academy to Get Basic Research Lab", "RADC Man Gives New Solution for Radio Puzzler", "Cancer Detection Seen As By-Product Of Research In Human Senses", and other related information. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document.

AF Academy To Get
Basic Research Lab
The Air Force will establish a basic
research laboratory at the Air Force
Academy near Colorado Springs, Col
orado. The aim of the new facility, a
part of the Academy's research pro
gram, will be the first time such a
high-ranking research center has been
located at a military installation.
The new laboratory will serve a dual
purpose. It will conduct basic research
in the physical sciences and will train
cadet officers in research techniques-a
means for teaching future Air Force
Academy graduates and commissioned
officers to better understand and con
duct research programs.
Selected members of the Academy
staff will be assigned to the new re
search facility as part of their normal
duties in order to better integrate this
research effort with the overall Acad-
emy educational program.

RADC Man Gives
New Solution for
Radio Puzzler
A trans-horizon radio propagation
phenomenon providing highly pre
dictable patterns in certain frequency
ranges has been discovered by a Re
search and Development Command
scientist, Dr. Drenner H. Ring, and pre
sented in a paper to the Institute of
Radio Engineers.
The new solution dispenses with the
complex mathematical analysis usually
required to explain this type of propa
gation and has proven highly accurate
in practical application by radar scien
tists.
The trans-horizon propagation pat
terns discovered by Dr. Ring were pre
viously unexplained. The effects have
been observed and reported since 1947
but a satisfactory analysis has not been
presented until now.
Dr. Ring's solution has been applied
to radar propagation problems with
startling accuracy. It is expected to find
wide application in communications as
well as radar when fully developed.

Cancer Detection
Seen As By-Product
Of Research In Human Senses
A diagnostic technique which may
lead to the effective detection of cancer
in its early stages is seen as a by-product
of research now underway at the Aero
medical Laboratory.
Part of the Laboratory's long range
study into the auditory and visual
senses, the current research involves a
detailed examination of the "attack
time" inherent in the human organism's
responses to stimuli. Initial studies in
dicated that the reaction time, or "at
tack time", of a person's auditory and
visual responses reflected a definite
change when certain forms of cancer
were present.
While the Laboratory's basic interest
is still directed toward a greater under
standing of the human senses, the pos
sibility of this technique aiding in cancer
detection is now being explored. Tests
were made which indicated the "attack
time" of responses from a person who
already had cancer showed a measur
able change from the "attack time" of a
person without cancer.
The technique, called the "Auditory
Response Time Analysis", could lead to
a non-invasive, simple procedure to aid
early diagnosis of some forms of can
cer. It may also provide a more sensitive
indicator for the study of the effects of
cancer and other diseases on the human
organism's sensory functions.

Man-Denver Gets
Algae Research Lab
The Air Force has awarded the Mar
tin-Denver Division a $140,000 contract
to establish a research facility at the
Denver Division plant to study the cul
tivation and uses of algae.
The contract provides for the pro
duction, cultivation and distribution of
various strains of microalgae for re
search and development purposes.
The Air Force feels that algae may
provide a fruitful field for the fabrica
tion of lightweight, compact and versa
tile devices which someday would be
highly useful in aerospace operations.
The facility will be located at the
University of Colorado's School of
Medicine, Denver Division.

Special Acts Award
Yellow Springs engineer, Robert
Colbert, of the Aerospace R&D Labor
atory at Wright-Patterson AFB, re
ceived a special acts award presented
to him by the Dayton Laboratories Di
rector, Dr. J.H. Hough.
The citation carries a cash award of
$600 and recognizes the outstanding
efforts and contributions by Mr. Colbert
to the Laboratory's work.
For many months, Colbert worked
evenings and weekends, conducting
studies and analyses for the R&D Lab
oratory on certain radar propagation
techniques.
When difficulties arose in negotiating
contracts that were impeding the prog
ress of the laboratory's research, he
took it upon himself, on his own initia
tive, to personally contact firms and
negotiate the contracts. His self-initiated
efforts were a distinct contribution to
the program.
Command officials felt that the un
usual diligence, ingenuity and technical
competence displayed by Colbert in
these activities warranted the special
recognition.
