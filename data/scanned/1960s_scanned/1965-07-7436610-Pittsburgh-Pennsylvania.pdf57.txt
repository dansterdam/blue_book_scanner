The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The text accompanying the sketch provides instructions for the observer to draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects observed, as well as details about the object's movement, such as any wings, protrusions, or trail.

The text also indicates that if there were more than one object observed, the observer should draw a picture showing how they were arranged and a sketch to indicate their direction of travel.
