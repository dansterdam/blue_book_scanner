June 7-65
Dear Mr. McManus,
I don't know what information that I have regarding an aerial object. I have not observed any physical object. The story I recounted was what I heard from the neighbors, as an anecdotal account. I don't believe I can substantiate the story. On Saturday night about 11:00 p.m. I was in my back yard. I got some friends to come over and we observed the moon and also the morning star (planet) straight ahead. We saw no unusual objects in the sky, and all of a sudden the sky lighted up, and my wife said "did you see that?" I did not see anything unusual. Perhaps this was some natural phenomenon, and does not represent a secondhand account then turned into more, again. I hope this clears up the matter. Please let me know if you need any additional information.
