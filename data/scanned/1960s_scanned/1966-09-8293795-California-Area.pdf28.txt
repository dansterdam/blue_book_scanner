The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document that contains only handwritten text.

I've transcribed the text as an OCR system:

"I don't think I'd get anywhere reporting this to our local county or state police. I've repeatedly reported sightings to the local police and have never been satisfied with their response. This is not to say they have not been courteous, only that they will not give me the date of my call, and without that, we can do nothing. I don't make a note of the timing of these silly little things, but since information is asked for in this paper today, I'm sending mine on. For what it's worth, I have you can make something of it.

Very sincerely,"
