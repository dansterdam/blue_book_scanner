Transcribing the text in the document:

"The emotional impression which one form the the observation was and the the commanding intelligence which the object disclosed arent of the same variety as the one we may associate with any know earthly phenomenon. I cannot believe that I have ever come close to a similar experience; in fact, I dont believe that I have ever heard of a aimilar experience that a others have had. 

The object seemed to be hovering in a fixed position in the sky, approximately 500 feet above the ground. The way it was suspended and absolutely motionless was in marked contrast to any know type of aircraft, either military or civil. At the same time, there was no disturbance of the atmosphere, no trail of exhaust fumes or condensation, or any visible means of propulsion.

Finally, stand the object which concerned the size which concerned me most. From where I stood, it appeared to be roughly the size of an automobile, which at that distance would make it sizable indeed. If such an object were the size of an automobile and hovering motionless in the sky at a distance of 500 feet, it staggers the imagination - I can scarcely believe what my eyes reported."
