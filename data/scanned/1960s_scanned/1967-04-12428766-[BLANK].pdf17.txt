Dear Major Quintanilla:

I am delighted to hear from General LeBailly that you will be able to appear before the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 21, when we present a panel discussion of the UFO problem.  

First, as to the physical arrangements, the meeting is at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. Saturday, April 22. We will get under way with your panel at 9:30 a.m. or if you have not been assigned by a member of our program committee, we will do so then.

I think it would be wise if you and other panelists were there by 9 a.m. so that we can meet one another, have a cup of coffee, and proceed to the directors' room.

Please let me know whether you want us to arrange accommodations for you at the Shoreham for the night of April 21. We will be glad to do so at our expense, if that is your wish.

I am still working on a possible fourth person for the program. This would be a non-agency citizen who thinks the program has done a remarkably good job in this area.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSISTS OF THE OFFICERS AND THE FOLLOWING:
