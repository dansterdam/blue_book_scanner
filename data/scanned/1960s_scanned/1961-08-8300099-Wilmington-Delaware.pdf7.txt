The provided image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

Some previous and rather scattered information on the subject - some of which apparently supplied. I may this is because written to a military organization and some information sought to be withheld - or the witness does not wish to identify himself. (My brother and a friend say they saw the object - so it maybe the witness does not wish to identify himself or other interested parties).

I am writing my observations where one or two came and I would like to get some confirmation of yours as well. Please send me one - I would like to display it as part of this file. If you can accommodate my request please advise me, or perhaps I should submit it to headquarters for their records.

A postclip I am forwarding, which may be of interest.

Sincerely yours,
