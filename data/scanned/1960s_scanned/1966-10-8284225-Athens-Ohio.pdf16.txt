34. Date you completed this questionnaire:

                           WED. 12     OCT     1966
                                  Day        Month      Year
                
35.  Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
     
     1. IN MAKING THE INITIAL "PILOT" AN ERROR WAS MADE IN SITTING
     THE FIELD OF VIEW OF THE BINOCULARS, I SAID IT WAS 30°
     WHICH I THOUGHT WAS THE SEPARATION OF TWO STARS IN THE SKY WHICH
     WERE FAMILIAR TO ME, IN LOOKING UP THE SPECIFICATIONS IT WAS
     SO° WHICH AGREED WITH THE INITIAL DISCOVERED FIELD ARRIVED AT BY
     THE BINOCULARS (7x,50)

2. WE WENT OUT AGAIN AT 11:00 PM THE SAME NIGHT TO TAKE
    READINGS ON A COMPASS AND SAW ANOTHER (THE SAME?) DIRECT
    AGIN, IT MADE ONE PASS BACK AND FORTH IN THE SAME
    DIRECTION AS THE OBJECTS SIGHTED AT 7:30 PM AND THEN VANISHED.

3. WHILE WATCHING THE OBJECTS A PLANE PASSED IN A DIRECTION
    PERPENDICULAR TO THE OBJECTS' LINE OF FLIGHT, DURING THE
    TIME OF OBSERVATION SEVERAL (3?) PLANES PASSED, AND
    AFTER THE OBJECTS WENT AWAY FOR GOOD A SATELLITE PASSED
    OVERHEAD IN AN APPROXIMATE SOUTH - EAST DIRECTION.

4. WITH REF. TO QUESTION 23b: IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO JUDGE SPEED
    AND DISTANCE WITH ANY REAL ACCURANCE. THE VALUES GIVEN CAN BE
    VERY WRONG DEPENDING ON THE ACCURACY OF WHAT I WAS TOLD. THE FRIEND'S
    WIFE SAID THE OBJECT ABOUT 11:PM, THE SAME TIME WE SAW THE
    OBJECT WHICH ONLY MADE ONE PASS. THE TIME ACROSS FIELD OF VIEW
    WAS TAKEN FOR THE 7:30 SIGHTINGS, NOT THE 11:00 SIGHTING WHICH PROBABLY
    MAKES THE VALUES WRONG. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS IS ALL I HAD TO GO BY
    I ASSUMED MIGHT AND REPEATED THE VALUES DESPITE THIS DOUBT.

5. I WILL ENCLOSE A SKETCH DRAWN BY THE FRIEND, AT THE TIME
    SHE WAS LOCATED AT MILLFIELD, O(H)IO.

6. THE OBJECTS DEFINITELY NOT: 1) STAR  2) PLANET  3) SATELLITE

   4) METEOR 5) COMET

7. I DO NOT LEAVE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS A PLANE BUT
    WOULD SAY THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNPROBABLE. (HELICOPTER Ditto)
