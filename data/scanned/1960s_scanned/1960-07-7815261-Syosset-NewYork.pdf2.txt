SUBJECT: Observation of an Unusual Flight

1. On the evening of Saturday, 16 July 1960, at about 2300 hours, my wife was sitting on the porch of our home at Syosset, New York. It was a beautiful, clear evening. A multitude of star-like objects were visible, which appeared to be moving slowly in a northerly direction. At first she thought they might be flares, but they continued their course and did not behave as flares normally do. When the objects slowed down and then somewhat abruptly changed their course to a westerly direction.

2. I was in the house at the time and she called to me. I obtained a glimpse of these objects and then for some minutes (approximately five or ten) I returned and observed them. When I observed these objects a peculiar direct motion appeared - they seemed to proceed in a staggered fashion, at times apparently stopping. I pointed these out to my wife, and we both watched as these objects flew a slightly varied or a vacillating course, approximately in a southerly direction. Then, somewhat abruptly changed their course to a westerly direction.

3. No sound was made; these objects appeared to be at a great height, and thus emitted a reddish-orange light.

4. In discussing this phenomena with an acquaintance, he informed me that one of his neighbors, a former officer in the U.S. Air Force, had observed the same objects in one direction, and at the same time that my wife and I had observed the phenomena outlined above.

5. In view of the interest of the Air Force in observations of this kind, I have written this account so that you may evaluate it and compare it with other reports you may have received.
