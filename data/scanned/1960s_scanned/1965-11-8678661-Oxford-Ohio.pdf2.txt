Dear Sir:

We have checked our records of November 5, 1965 and find we have no information regarding unusual type activities in the Dayton area on this date.

Our control positions normally scan the area within 25 nautical miles of Patterson Field. We did not detect anything unusual which would not normally be looking at. The activity and characteristics of detected objects which occurred in the area on that date were normal for this type weather-operating conditions and would not indicate anything significant from an information standpoint. Our controllers would not normally be concerned with traffic or this type which we are controlling unless it became significantly hazardous to established traffic operating in the area or some unusual characteristic appeared to be present.

I am forwarding your letter to the Unidentified Flying Objects Officers of the Foreign Technology Division here at Patterson Field. They will be able to look further into this matter for you.

Sincerely,

Arvid R. Olsen
Chief, Dayton
