MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observations, Maryland, 22 Aug 67
At 0215, 22 Aug 67, Major Quintanilla spoke with Captain Jensen and Lt. Nielson of the Public Information Office, Andrews AFB, Maryland. 
Lt. Nielson had investigated the reports on this particular UFO. He said he had asked Lt. Nielson if he had checked with the police department on this sighting. He said he hadn't but he had heard that the police department had made observations of the UFO. Major Quintanilla explained that we also felt that the observation was a balloon but confirmations from someone (like the police department) is needed before we can release a statement to the public that it was a balloon. Lt. Nielson said he would check with the police department but he wasn't sure that he could get a confirmation.
Lt. Nielson commented that NICAP was on an NBC report. The NBC film report left no doubt that it was a balloon for evidently this person had observed one go up the night before. Major Quintanilla asked Lt. Nielson to call the lady in the documentary and find out where she had gotten her confirmation. Lt. Nielson didn't understand why she should not get a confirmation from her since the film left no doubt that it was a balloon. Major Quintanilla explained that we needed a confirmation before we can release a statement that the observation was a balloon.
Captain Jensen then asked what Major Quintanilla's job was and who he was connected with. Captain Jensen also wanted to know who was interested in this. Major Quintanilla informed him that it was Public at large that had had the inquiries and that we must give them a statement. Captain Jensen said they would try to get a confirmation.
Lt. Nielson said that the sky was overcast to 12,000 ft and the air was very still. Their extension is 4511.
