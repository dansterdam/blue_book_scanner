SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The USAF/UFO program has represented a modest but continuous effort since 1947. The program has been well organized although the resources assigned to it have been quite limited. The program has undergone personnel, attitude, and procedural changes and because of problems and pressures has been periodically reviewed by external consultants, scientists, and more recently a congressional committee.  

At present, the firm conclusions of Project Blue Book are:
(1) No unidentified flying object reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security;
(2) There has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as unidentified represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present day scientific knowledge;
(3) There has been no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified are extraterrestrial vehicles. Scientific analysis and committees previously reviewing the UFO situation, have repeatedly reached the same conclusions even though their recommendations have concentrated on the symptoms, not the cause of the UFO problem.
