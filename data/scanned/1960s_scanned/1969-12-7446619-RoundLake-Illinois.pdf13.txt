35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I had been very interested about the "Flyers" and what I had heard around town about them seeing a strange object over Round Lake on this date. I was out scouting around that evening and noticed what was at first an unusual bright light in the sky. It seemed to be moving towards me and getting larger, although it did not appear to be a plane or other aircraft that I was familiar with. As the object came closer, I could see that it was a large saucer-shaped craft, completely silent, with reddish-orange lights around the edge. At one point it appeared to stop and hover, and then it accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. I was quite amazed and baffled by what I had seen, as it did not seem to be any kind of conventional aircraft. I have no explanation for what it was, but I am confident that it was not an airplane, helicopter, or anything else I have seen before. It was a very unusual and unexplained sighting.
