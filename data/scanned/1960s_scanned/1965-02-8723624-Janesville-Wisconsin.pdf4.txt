I had just come home and was getting ready for work at 5:00 A.M. I looked out the window and saw an extremely bright light over the northeast part of the town. It was hovering and moving slowly. It had no sound that I could hear. It was about 300 feet away and 1,000 feet high. The object was round and had four flashing lights on the outside. Very bright. The sighting lasted about 3-4 minutes. The bright lights dimmed after a while and then the object just gradually increased in speed and disappeared into the northeast. I did not see the object actually leave, it disappeared from view. 

On this particular night the weather was as dark as a dark night, stars were visible but the moon was not out. The visibility was very good. The object was so bright it illuminated the darkness. I have never seen anything like this before and it wasn't like any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. I hope this will keep you informed.
