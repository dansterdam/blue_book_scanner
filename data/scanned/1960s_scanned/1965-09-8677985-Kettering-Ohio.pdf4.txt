27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the diagram to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you last saw it. Place on "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" on the start of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
