6. DETAILS OF SIGHTING: Object appear as bright star-like light varying in intensity. Large oval shaped object with red light on underside. Object hovered for about 30 minutes and then disappeared over a ridge. Observer noticed object appeared to vary in size. Total elapsed time of sighting was 45 minutes. First observation of an object and in 45 minutes sighting disappeared. Description as astronomical, but location and sighting characteristics indicate this possibility is remote. Observation of an astro-body normally would not produce the described effects and sighting duration. Source appears to be an aircraft, possibly the VEGA.
7. COMMENTS: Report was in the southern area at report time and in 45 minutes sighting disappeared. Description and duration of sighting indicate this was not an astronomical observation but possibly an aircraft, possibly the VEGA.
