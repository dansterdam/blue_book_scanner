Fishing and Hunting
MONTANA offers some of the best trout fishing in the world. One of the nation's finest streams, the Big Big urn River, provides unexcelled fly-fishing for brown and rainbow trout. Other streams and lakes, both large and small, offer angtlers a wide choice. Montana's many lakes and streams provide ample opportunity for the fisherman to enjoy this sport. Hunting is also a major attraction in Montana. In adiiition to the native species of elk, deer, antelope and upland game birds, hunters are drawn to Montana's roaming herds of buffalo, mountain goats and grizzly bear. These animals have continued to thrive in Montana's unexcelled natural habitat. 
For the bird hunter, a variety of upland game birds, including pheasants, Hungarian partridges, blue and ruffed grouse and chukars provides hunters with a variety of pleasant hunts. In addition, Montana's vast reaches of native prairies offer waterfowl the finest of feeding and nesting grounds. Migratory fowls such as geese and ducks attract sportsmen from all parts to Montana's prime shooting areas.
