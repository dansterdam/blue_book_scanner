FOR THE RECORD

Most witnesses did not wish to contact the Air Force because of reports of ridicule and embarrassment from that agency.

Reporters from various nation-wide publications have been in contact with some of the witnesses. Publicity on the Hampton U.F.O. activities may be forth-coming in the very near future.

The mission of County Radiation Control is to minimize and control all sources of radiation that may be harmful to the public's health.

Documented evidence from newspapers, books on U.F.O. sightings, and from NICAP, reported radio-activity emanating from U.F.O.'s. Therefore Radiation Control has been requested by the police authorities to assist them in investigating reported U.F.O. "landings" or "near landings" in Suffolk County.
