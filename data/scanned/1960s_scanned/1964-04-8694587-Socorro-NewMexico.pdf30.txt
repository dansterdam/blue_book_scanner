Santa Fean Reports
Seeing UFO Landed
North of Espanola

An unidentified flying object was reported to have landed and taken off near La Madera, north of Espanola, New Mexico.

The evidence that Orlando Gallegos of Santa Fe reported was that he and his family went to visit his father, just north of Espanola, on Sunday, arriving about 1:30 a.m. 

Gallegos later told state police he saw the object sitting on the ground in an arroyo area when he arrived. He did not approach closer than 500 feet. He reported a luminous egg-shaped object about 40 feet long and 12 feet wide. He said it rose straight up and disappeared to the west. Some of the evidence is missing and take-off seems to have been via shallow holes where the object apparently landed on its landing gear and scared clumps of grass and there were two round, very shallow depressions found.

What appears to be evidence of an unidentified object landing and taking off at Socorro has been observed, a highly reliable source, as can be gathered from the evidence of a secondary nature and testimony. In Socorro, State Police Sgt. Sam Chavez told of an unidentified flying object which landed in a quarry late last Friday. The object was reported by two people who reported what they saw to Chavez. Near the center foreground and burned greasewood and charred pieces. The object was later trampeled on by curiosity seekers when the photo was taken.
