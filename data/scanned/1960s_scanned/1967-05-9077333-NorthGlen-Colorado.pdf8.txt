18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object would have been covered by the match. If you had not performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
APPROXIMATELY 1/16TH THE SIZE OF THE MATCH HEAD COVERED THE OBJECT.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
