This suggests that the observed sighting was in the vicinity of two large operating airfields, which could potentially be a high-flying aircraft. However, the report indicates that this could not be definitively identified. The sighting remains unidentified due to the large number of such tracks processed at this location and the observer's inability to provide more details.
