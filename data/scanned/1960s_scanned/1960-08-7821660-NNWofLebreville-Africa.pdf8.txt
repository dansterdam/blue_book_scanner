Analysis and Conclusions: The apparent size, shape and speed of the object suggest that it may have been a type of meteor or other natural phenomenon moving in the direction indicated at the time. The description of the object is very similar to that of a meteor, though the ascent and final descent pattern is perhaps somewhat unusual. However, the case cannot be satisfactorily explained and should be considered as unidentified at this time.
