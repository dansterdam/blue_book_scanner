The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document with text. I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

1. Attached is a video tape that was forwarded to the Aerial Phenomena Office, Captain Arthur AR, Illinois, 14 November 1967. It indicated that the film was taken "on approximately 9 November."

2. Captain Arrington used the video tape in conjunction with sightings of 13 September 1967 and stated that it contained data we could not find anything on the film that we would define as significant. We made an unsuccessful effort to find the film to this event any further, since the sighting is so old, we are returning the film to you without having made any investigation.
