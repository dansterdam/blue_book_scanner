The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

This unusual type of  report is be  n presented  since it refers to certain data and phenomena which may be of interest and importance with relation to the investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena.
The source of this information is considered reliable and accurate. The details given have been carefully checked and verified as far as possible.
On the afternoon of  4 September 1960, at approximately 4:15 pm, an employee of the Western Union Telegraph Co.  was making a routine check of the telegraph lines in the Seneca area, south of Tiffin, Ohio. He was driving along a rural road when he noticed  a strange aerial object in the sky about 1/2 mile to the east. The object was about 15-20 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and metallic in appearance. It was hovering over the top of a group of trees at an altitude of perhaps 200-300 feet.
The witness stopped his truck and watched the object for about 5 minutes. During this time it remained stationary, except for a slight swaying motion. It then accelerated rapidly and flew off to the northeast at a very high speed, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.
The witness stated that the object was completely silent and gave off no exhaust or vapor trail. He was quite impressed by the performance and appearance of the object, and reported the incident to his superiors at Western Union and to the local police authorities.
