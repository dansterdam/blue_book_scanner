Dear sir:

I know you get hundreds of letters each year concerning U.F.O.'s (Unidentified Flying Objects). But please, please, take this one. 

Here is my story:

It was the night of April 11, 1967. My brother and I were going up to the Alleghany mountains, traveling on a country road and all of a sudden we saw a bright light in the sky. It was first small, then became very bright, we thought it was an airplane light. After coming out of the state we decided that was no airplane light. 

For a long time we watched it, then it disappeared. Again we looked up, flashing around until I saw a bright green object. It seemed strange, it was hovering and shooting small green and red lights to every direction. Then the bright object moved away slowly. 

I wish to my brother and pointed several times the star-like object. But he could not see it. I was certain my eyesight was alright. The object seem bigger and brighter each time we saw it. It seemed to hover in the same area of the sky, then moved away slowly.

Sincerely, the witness (name blocked out)
