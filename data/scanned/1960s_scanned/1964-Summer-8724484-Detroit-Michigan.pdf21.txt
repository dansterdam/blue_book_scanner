Burlington sighting

The contents of the text in the document are as follows:

"The following narrative was prepared by Dr. John D. MacRae, officer investigating UFO sightings for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP).

'A search of a deserted granny area near Burlington on Sunday, June 7th, resulted in sightings of a strange aerial object which was observed by L. C. Rinkerhoff, a deputy sheriff, and Binkerhoff's brother and two friends. According to Binkerhoff, the object was first sighted in the sky shortly before midnight and was observed again by Binkerhoff and three others for about fifteen minutes.
Richard Bryan, who was with Binkerhoff, told Binkerhoff that the object was maneuvering at high speed and making rapid changes in direction. As it passed, they could see that it was an apparently metallic, disk-shaped object, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It passed over the area at an estimated altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 feet. Binkerhoff stated that he couldn't say what it was, but added that "it seemed to be intelligently controlled."
The object was sighted again at about 3:00 a.m. on Monday morning, again by Binkerhoff and the same three companions. Richard Bryan, one of the observers, told NICAP that the object passed over them at a high rate of speed, making very rapid maneuvers. At one point, according to Bryan, the object appeared to be hovering or stationary. No sound was heard. Bryan said that the object was definitely not an aircraft of any conventional type.
Binkerhoff stated that he and the others were "absolutely amazed" at what they saw, but added that "I couldn't say what it was." The object was described as a strange, luminous, disk-shaped craft, which seemed to be intelligently controlled. It was sighted on two occasions, around midnight and again in the early morning hours.'"
