The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document related to Project Blue Book.

One aspect of the incident which has reportedly come to mind is the difficulty which the witnesses had in describing the characteristics of the light which they observed. The glow must have been something entirely unusual, making it difficult for words to describe.

Another puzzle is the reported statement by the witnesses that the light radiated by the object appeared to be diffused, which is important when you consider the fact that there was a heavy overcast and that no sources of light were known to be in the area which could have caused a reflection.

The triangular area found on the edge of the pond may or may not be significant. One might hypothesize that something was put into the pond at that point. There is, however, no evidence to confirm this notion.

I have speculated enough on the matter, but there is one additional comment which I wish to make: The Irvington incident is the first incident of this type which I have investigated in person and in detail. The apparent credibility of the witnesses, the unusual formation of the light, and the general conclusion surrounding the incident have raised more questions than answers. In short, the experience has brought forth a very strong desire to learn more about this incident and others of similar kind.

Carefully, further analysis of the material in this report by others who have had some more light on the problem. Should you need any additional data, I will try to run it down.

Sincerely,
