35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

It is my recollection that I saw an object moving rapidly overhead at an estimated altitude of only 100-200 feet or less. It seemed to be cigar-shaped and dark in color. I also believe it did not make any noise that I could hear. When I first saw it, I was driving a little gravel road with me, and it seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. My initial impression was that it was an aircraft, possibly a small jet, but it did not seem to be making any noise nor did it appear to have wings or other conventional aircraft features. It was moving at a remarkable rate of speed and changed directions almost instantly without slowing down. I am quite sure that what I saw was not a conventional aircraft, although it is possible that it was some sort of experimental craft or device. There seems to be no natural explanation for what I witnessed. I was quite startled and amazed by what I saw, and it certainly would be extremely difficult to account for in any conventional way. The sighting was a brief one, lasting probably no more than 10-15 seconds, and I was unable to get a good look at it as it passed overhead so rapidly. I would be glad to provide any additional information that might be helpful in understanding or evaluating this incident. (Signed)
