It was stated that he arrived at work at the Shell truck stop about 0600. A neighbor called and told him that an object had risen from the site of the station and asked him to come outside and look. When he came out, he saw a glowing light above a farm house approximately 1 mile East of the station. The farm house had two lights and the glowing light was located between these lights.
