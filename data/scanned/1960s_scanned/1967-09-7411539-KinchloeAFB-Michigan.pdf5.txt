MEMO FOR THE RECORD:
Subject: UFO Operation on Radar, Kincheloe, 11 Sep 67
At 1445, 14 Sep 67 Lt Stoecker Intelligence Division at Duluth, Minn, ext 756/755 spoke with Lt. Marano regarding the above sighting. There was no action taken since the visual was no more than 5 points for a short period of time and you couldn't have gotten something scrambled in that time. The sighting was on ground control approach radar. All that was observed was at ground level, by then nobody could have taken action. They didn't have anything on their SAGE radars. Lt. Marano asked them how they were on radar. Lt Stoecker said he could not give all the information on the radars but that they weren't too good on low altitude. Lt. Stoecker said they consider the direction and it could be anomalous propagation, but when it could be other causes. The man who reported the sighting is very experienced and would probably would know what it was if it was anomalous propagation. Lt. Stoecker said we could probably find out more by talking to Kincheloe. Lt. Stoecker said he would send a letter explaining what he had discussed over the phone. Lt. Stoecker said they had not gotten a report from 55 Marie's radar. He said he would check it out again and indicate it in his letter. He didn't seem to concerned that the sighting was anything unusual, especially since there was an inversion.
