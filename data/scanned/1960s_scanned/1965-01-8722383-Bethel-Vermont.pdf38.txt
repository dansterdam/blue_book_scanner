Tektites and the Cyrillic Shower

JAMES A. O'KEEFE, Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration

THE LAUNCHING of more than 30,000 small satellites on a number of occasions between November 8, 1957, has astonished many people. This deliberate action, continuing in the years since, has been misunderstood by the public. It is widely believed that the satellites were put into orbit for purely scientific purposes, but there is some reason to believe that this is not true. Instead, the launching was part of a series of unusual natural events occurring in the earth's environment, the full significance of which is not yet appreciated.

On February 12, 1958, the United States announced the recovery of tektites from the surface of the earth. These glasslike objects, first discovered many years ago and distributed over wide areas, have been a subject of scientific research and speculation. The announcement indicated that one area of particular scientific interest concerned the launching or origin of the tektites.

The tektites are believed to be ejected from the earth's surface by natural processes, violently ejecting small solid masses of silicate glass into the atmosphere to fall back to earth in a shower. Some scientists believe the tektites may have originated in a violent impact on the earth's surface, or possibly from the eruptions of volcanoes, but no completely satisfactory explanation of their origin has yet been given.

During the past several years, a strange phenomenon has been observed in the earth's upper atmosphere, known as the "Cyrillic shower." This phenomenon consists of a large number of visible luminous trails in the night sky, often described as resembling letters of the Cyrillic alphabet. The exact cause of these luminous trails is not known, but they may be associated with the launching of the artificial satellites.

An attempt is now being made to relate the tektite phenomenon to the Cyrillic shower. It is believed that the tektites and the Cyrillic shower may both be the result of a common cause, and that this common cause may be associated with the launching of artificial satellites. The full significance of these events is not yet understood, but they appear to be part of a complex series of natural and artificial events occurring in the earth's environment.
