21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

   d. Uncertain
23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could visualize the object that you saw. (Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what kind of shape would it have? What color would it be, and what other characteristics would you give it-such as the same appearance as the object which you saw?)
