Analysis of Photos and Negatives

In BEAT (BEATTY) - 2 File Case
The photographic prints and negatives attached hereto have been examined.

In the photos 14 all the basic data on 14 shots of a bright circular object in the sky are given. The object appears to be self-luminous and smaller than the full moon. The object was stationary for a period of about 10-15 minutes and then moved off at a high speed toward the southwest. The photos were taken with a hand-held 35mm camera.

The BEAT (BEATTY) photos provide additional validation of the eyewitness testimony by showing a bright circular object that was observed and photographed. The two positive prints and one negative have been retained as a permanent record.
