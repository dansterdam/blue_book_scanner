There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Object
TO: Maj Janger
DEFENSE AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO
The attached object was sighted, to the best of my knowledge, to be a real, physical object. It flew into his swimming pool. He believes the object may be part of some type of military device. 
Attached is information to forward the object to the correct UFO information center for analysis, if advisable.
