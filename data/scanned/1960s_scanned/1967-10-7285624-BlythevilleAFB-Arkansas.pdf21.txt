The image contains two drawings. The larger drawing appears to be a compass rose, with cardinal directions labeled. The smaller drawings show what appear to be perspective sketches, depicting a person standing on a road in a landscape with mountains or hills in the background.

GA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A DOT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A DOT AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
WHETHER THE MOTION WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIGZAG; REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
