[Handwritten text]
The object I saw was round and had a silver color. It was quite large and flew across the sky at a fast speed. I first noticed it in the southeast and it moved in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be about 1,000 feet up in the air and was silent as it flew. I watched it for about 3 minutes before it disappeared from view. This is the best I can describe what I saw. I'm not sure what it was, but it did not appear to be any kind of aircraft I'm familiar with.
