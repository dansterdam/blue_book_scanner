REPLY TO ATTN OF: FDPM/R. J. Parker/55027  26 October 1966
SUBJECT: Evaluation of Depressions Found in Fallowed Field Near Gwinner, North Dakota in Connection with Reported UFO Sightings
TO: FDPM/Lt. Morley

CONCLUSIONS:
1. The symmetrical layout of the depressions is a logical arrangement for the operation of a piece of heavy farm equipment.
2. The absence of vehicular tracks in the field effectively rules out the depressions being made by a piece of heavy farm equipment.
3. Careful analysis of the information suggests that the depressions were most likely created by natural causes such as the settling of soil in the area, and not by any artificial means.
4. Based on the information contained in the report made by Brig. Gen. Homer G. Smith, PARDING, there is no evidence to refute that the depressions were caused by natural means. The ground was soft and saturated with water, likely the result of recent heavy rains or melting snow, making the area susceptible to settling and depressions.
