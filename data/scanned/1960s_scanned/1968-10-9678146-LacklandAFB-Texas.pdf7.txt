PHOTO ANALYSIS 
NOTES: CHARLES BLACK
THE PHOTO APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN AFTER I1AY 68
IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE PHOTO MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM A MOVING VEHICLE AS THE MAJOR OBJECTS APPEAR SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, POSSIBLY DUE TO VIBRATION EFFECTS.
THE TWO MAJOR OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE "FLYING SAUCER-TYPE" CONFIGURATION AND APPEAR TO BE EMITTING SOME FORM OF LIGHT OR ENERGY. 
THE TWO SMALLER OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE MOVING AWAY FROM THE MAJOR OBJECTS AT GREATER SPEED.
BASED ON THE RELATIVE SIZES AND SEPARATION DISTANCES, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE TWO MAJOR OBJECTS ARE APPROXIMATELY 50-60 FEET IN DIAMETER AND SEPARATED BY ABOUT 1/4 TO 1/2 MILE DISTANCE.
THE TWO SMALLER OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE APPROXIMATELY 10-15 FEET IN DIAMETER.
THESE MAY BE LIGHTS FROM SHIP OR REFLECTIONS FROM SHIP COMPONENTS.
