Now imagine you are at the center of the compass rose. Place an "X" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when first seen. Place a "+" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen.

In the sketch below, place an "A" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "B" at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Connect the "A" and "B" with a line to approximate the movement of the phenomenon between "A" and "B". that is, schematically show whether the movement of the phenomenon was straight, curved or zig-zag. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this.
