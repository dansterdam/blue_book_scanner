AUGUST 4, 1964

Dear Sir:

This letter summarizes our teleconference of July 31, 1964 in which we discussed the present problem with the __________ and the possible methods of handling it. We have carefully studied the report from the police department and my file, and I think we now have enough about the situation to decide on a course of action.

As I indicated on the phone, I would like to get more information of this UFO case reported from the same area. Perhaps you or your office could send some information on the incident. This would help us as we consider a plan of action for 1964.

Sincerely yours,
