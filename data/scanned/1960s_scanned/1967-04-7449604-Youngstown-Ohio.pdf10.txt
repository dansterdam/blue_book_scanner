Dear Sirs:

Thank you for sending me the account of a U.F.O. sighted several months ago. I have been wanted to look into that in order of my friends seem to have some idea about five minutes after my applying I interviewed them and found that they had seen the same thing. I hope you do not think I am an impersonated joker to cry wolf. Thank you.
