This office has received a report of an unidentified flying object from Shirley, Massachusetts. The following is a suggested reply:

Dear -----:
The object which you have described is similar to either a meteor or satellite decay. Several essential bits of information were omitted from your initial evaluation: the duration was not stated, nor was the size, distance through which the object passed. Satellite decays are often misinterpreted by the general public as unidentified flying objects or unusual aerial phenomena.

A satellite observation from Massachusetts would hold an association slightly longer that that associated with meteor observations.
