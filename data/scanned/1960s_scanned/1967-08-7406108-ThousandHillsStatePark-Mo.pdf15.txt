Text from the document:

AS BEST I COULD GET IN A POSITION SUCH AS A LAY THE POSITION OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACES AN X ON THE COMPASS AS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE OBJECT IS SAID TO HAVE APPROACHED. PLACE A DOT ON THE OUTLINE OF THE COMPASS ROSE TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT APPEARED TO MOVE.

THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT IN FLIGHT WITH FIRST SEEN, AND DURATION OF SIGHTING, WITH DESCRIPTION OF FLIGHT AND ACTIONS OF OBJECT ARE FULLY DETAILED IN THE ATTACHED SHEETS.
