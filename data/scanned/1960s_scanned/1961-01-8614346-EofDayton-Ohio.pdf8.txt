The image contains three sketches. The first sketch is a curved line with a point marked "A" on it, representing an object seen above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger view of the scene, with the object's position marked as "A" and "B" to indicate its movement. The third sketch depicts a landscape with a person on a road.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
