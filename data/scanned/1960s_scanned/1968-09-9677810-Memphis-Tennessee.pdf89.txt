The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

have seen anything like this. Once, driving through the White Mountains with my wife about ten years ago, we were both startled by what appeared to be an airliner swoosh across our path dead ahead of us. All we could make out was the fact that there were numerous round, single-pane windows along the side of the object, like an airliner. It was at night. There was no noise and no light other than our headlights and the lights inside the object. We remember the event. We seldom speak of it but now it comes back to us and we know no airliner could be that close to the ground and be absolutely silent. So, now I am going to the farm, I probably will sit up all night waiting for another show.
