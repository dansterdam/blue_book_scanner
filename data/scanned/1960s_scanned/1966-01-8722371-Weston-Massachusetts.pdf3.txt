Both Mr. and Mrs. *** have requested that the results of the communication be obscured so that they will be able to cope with a clean-cut and definite solution to this problem which, because of the manner in which it was reported, make it in more ways than one a potential embarrassment.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Director
