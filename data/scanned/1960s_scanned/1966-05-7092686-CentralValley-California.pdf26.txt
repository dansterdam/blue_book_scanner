Dear Sir,
I hope you will forward this letter to the correct office. It is a description of an "Unidentified Flying Object" (UFO) which my wife and I saw last night. First seen: 10:00AM to 5 minutes to 10:30 AM, May 24, 1966. Duration: 6 to 7 minutes. Location: Rowan-Morven Hotel, Flower, Italy. It looked like a very bright white star, brighter than any visible in sky at time. Sound came from different course, heading up from horizon towards direction of this UFO. Observed very quiet night. So far have heard no one else mention seeing it about 60Â° West of from. Speed not constant, but variable. Almost stopped at times. Course not straight, but slowly changing, upward to be wandering slightly. Clear sky. Disappeared by slowly fading out over a period of 5 to 10 minutes.
