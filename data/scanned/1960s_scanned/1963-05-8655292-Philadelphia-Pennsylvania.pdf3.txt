Text from the document:

Sighting of the Air Force
Philadelphia, Pa.
2-16-63

The thing was quite unidentified. It was estimated to be about 30-40 feet long, cigar shaped, with a long tail. It was silver in color, on a straight level course. It was observed by the witness for about 25-30 seconds. The witness felt it was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or conventional aircraft.
The witness could not estimate the altitude, as there were no reference points in the sky. However, the witness felt it was flying at a relatively high altitude.
The weather was clear at the time of the sighting. The witness had never seen anything like this before and felt it was definitely a genuine UFO sighting.
