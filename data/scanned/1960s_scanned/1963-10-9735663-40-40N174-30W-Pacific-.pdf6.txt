BLUEROOK CASE NO. 10379
DATE OF SIGHTING: 9 OCTOBER 1963
TIME OF SIGHTING: 0440Z
LOCATION: 40-40N 174-30W (PACIFIC OCEAN)
DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
A VERY LARGE BRIGHT ORANGE-RED LIGHT WAS OBSERVED BY THE CREW OF A PAN AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT TRAVELING FROM TOKYO TO HONOLULU. THE LIGHT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AT 40-40N 174-30W, APPROXIMATELY 200 MILES WEST OF MIDWAY ISLAND. IT APPEARED STATIONARY FOR 5 TO 10 MINUTES AND THEN BEGAN TO MOVE ERRATICALLY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THE LIGHT WOULD SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR AND THEN REAPPEAR NEARBY. THE PILOT ESTIMATED THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT TO BE 10 TO 15 MILES FROM THE AIRCRAFT. AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES THE LIGHT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND DID NOT REAPPEAR.
CONCLUSIONS:
THIS SIGHTING REMAINS UNIDENTIFIED. THE OBJECT EXHIBITED CHARACTERISTICS NOT NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANY KNOWN CELESTIAL OR MANMADE OBJECT. ITS ERRATIC MOVEMENTS AND ABILITY TO SUDDENLY DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR WOULD TEND TO ELIMINATE IT AS BEING A NORMAL ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENON. SINCE THE SIGHTING ORIGINATED FROM A COMMERCIAL AIRLINE FLIGHT CREW, IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE REPORT.
