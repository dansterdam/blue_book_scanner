The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a typed text document. As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

1. The objects we see too big to be planes, blink or flicker.
2. They do not give off any noise or exhaust like a jet plane.
3. Could look like an object hovering or maneuvering. These were reported several times at different dates and locations.
4. I really think it is something quite unexplainable. The light trail by my husband's car has me quite puzzles. Could you give me any more plausible explanation? Thank you.
Sincerely,
