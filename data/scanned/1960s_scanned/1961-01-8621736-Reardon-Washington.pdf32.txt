1. How bright were the objects as their brightness changed?
Quite bright
2. Did they cast shadows?
No shadows
3. When the objects were closest to the witnesses, how close were the objects to the ground?
They were a fair distance away and I am not a good judge of distance. I would estimate the distance from witnesses to objects was around 1500 to 2000 ft.
4. Did the objects pass between the witnesses and some other objects such as a pole, trees, etc.?
No.
6. Over how large an area of the sky did the objects move?
I saw them for only a short time before I lost track of them.
7. What was the pattern and speed of movement?
Speed was apparently constant and not exceedingly fast.
