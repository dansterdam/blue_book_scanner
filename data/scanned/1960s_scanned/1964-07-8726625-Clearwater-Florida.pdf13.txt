Mysterious Lights Solved
The sighting of mysterious lights over Clearwater early Tuesday morning has been explained by Federal Aviation Agency officials as lights from an airplane. According to a spokesman for the FAA, the lights were dropped from a civilian airplane which was spraying malathion in the Clearwater area. The spokesman said the lights would appear and disappear as the plane made drops of the chemical. There was no evidence that the lights were anything unusual.
