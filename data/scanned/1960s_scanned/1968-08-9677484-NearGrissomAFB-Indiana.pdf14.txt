TO WHAT WAS THIS WHAT COULD BE SEEN, HELD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT, HOW WOULD IT COMPARE IN APPARENT SIZE?

NOW THIS IS JUST A ROUGH ESTIMATE AS I WASN'T ABLE TO JUDGE IT ACCURATELY SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPARE IT TO AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE STREET LIGHT IT APPEARED TO BE.
