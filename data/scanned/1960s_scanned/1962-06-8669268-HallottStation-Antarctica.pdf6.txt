The text in the document is as follows:

"2 June at 07/010Z, the UFO at Hallett Station in the Antarctic made an appearance over the station area for some 90 minutes. The object was at a 30 degrees elevation and 330 degrees heading. It was golden in color and appeared to be self-luminous, hovering, and pulsating. This object was observed by several individuals with binoculars and the unaided eye. The light seemed to be associated with the object. The light remained stationary although it seemed to pulsate. Several individuals who observed it estimated the size of the object to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 30 minutes, after which it suddenly accelerated and disappeared into the distance. There were no sound effects associated with the object. The light remained on until the object had disappeared from view. No additional objects have been noted.

Attached is the report received at HQ (Havel Message #A11) 2 3503 (11 Jun 62) regarding this incident. No photographs were taken but sketches were made to aid in the analysis."
