Over the beach at about 1 to 2 feet of altitude. At this time the object appeared as a silver craft which had no visible means to calm. The space craft was of neutral color.
In his interview he stated frequently throughout that he was "real scared" as all times during his experience and can about 1970 feet in the sky but stopped when a voice had perfect clarity, no accent, and talked very slowly.
As the craft hovered about 100 feet to the ground, there was a flash which lit up the entire country side but there was no smoke or noise whatsoever. It became very quiet and the cause of curiosity and went aboard the craft through a sliding door.
as he entered the compartment he estimated was about 6 by 9 feet and was lighted very brightly from the ceiling and walls, it reminded him of a dressing room of another department. He entered and saw a man (owner of the voice earlier) sitting on something like a chair.
The spaceman looked like a perfect human specimen. He was very erect and had a strange face, no wrinkles or blemishes on face, perfect fingernails and had dark hair worn like a crew cut. He was wearing a garment which to the witness, looked like silvery Nylon.
The spaceman invited him to ask questions and so he proceeded to ask the following:
(1) Q. How did you evade our radar? A. The hull of our space craft has a material which will not allow a reflection of the penetration.
(2) Q. How is your ship constructed, what is your speed, what communications do you have? A. No answer.
(3) Q. Where are you from? A. Our home is on the other side of a planet which you can observe from Earth.
(4) Q. Are you human, but not of our type. A. Yes, we are human, but not to you but we are much more respectful to the Supreme.
