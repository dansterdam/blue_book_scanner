ESTABLISHMENT OF MODEL OF U.A.P. (UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA OR U.F.O.)

The triangular pattern of the U.A.P. (U.F.O.) (lights) never changed during the sighting and one wide initial observation. This statement is based upon detailed discussion with her - they definitely maintained formation arrangement as reported. Even the road traveling west.

When first sighted, they had acute angles and were as small as "near star" with the center object (not rotating) apparently relative to the others. However, my wife mentioned that the formation was moving (recall that we were traveling/paralleling 50 mph) relative to the "near by" stationary stars.

when first
seen by my wife. 
Formation
was moving
very slowly southwest.
(a) moving slowly (relatively)
(b) center object not rotating
(c) constellation (relatively) stationary stars - but small.

Notice acute angles of triangle formed by outer three objects. Also lights appeared high in the sky (at least 20° to 25° clockwise from the north)(road direction is 10° counterclockwise from the north).

As the lights approached us (turning westward) they appeared as shown in figure 2 (on trajectory of overall colored formation).

(b) Center object was now "jumping around" but not as much as overhead.
