STATUS CLASSIFIED AS RESTRICTED FROM PUBLIC

Pandora, may 13, president of General Pedro Rodriguez alie.

The object that I saw on the night of July 27, 1956 was a very large disc-shaped object with lights around the perimeter. It was hovering and made no noise. I estimated its diameter to be approximately 75 to 100 feet. The object hovered for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and shot straight up out of sight at a very high rate of speed. 

I was very impressed by the performance of this object, as it made no sound and its movements were very different from any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. I am convinced that this was not an ordinary aircraft, but some type of advanced craft of unknown origin. I have no explanation for what I observed that night, and I would be most interested to learn if any similar sightings have been reported in this area.

I hope this report is helpful in your study of unidentified flying objects. Please let me know if you require any additional information from me.
