INTER HECKEL QUINTERNILLA. CR. 
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AF8, OHIO 

Dear Sir:

This is in reference to your personal note concerning several reports
of unusual aerial objects observed in relation to recent flight incidents.

Since I have been asked on the report sheet and advice to send
a copy of this letter to your office, if a reported incident
should come to my attention. I have with me several reports 
which I feel I should bring to your attention.

Our son, Capt. ________ _____, is in the ___ ___ in ____ ____. He 
has given us the account of his experience which is in full agreement with
what you have told us not to do, i.e., not to make any publicity concerning 
experiences with unusual aerial sightings. We still are very interested in
this matter ourselves, but will not do this unless I am told otherwise.

Similar incidents are occurring to neighbors concerning what they believe
to be unidentified flying objects. There are persuasive reports of others in 
this area reporting the same. The latest was yesterday. There are no reports
of the sane of the story being connected with the Russian action. Therefore,
it does not seem to be connected to the display on the war. I realise the
makers of the story may not be persons responsible for the making. However,
for your own information, you might want to give this some thought.

Sincerely,

P.S. I am a teacher at Denham Junior High School.
