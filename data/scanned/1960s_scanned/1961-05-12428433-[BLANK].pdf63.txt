The Chairman: One question was asked about the cost. It is probably too early, isn't it, to tell you just what the cost of the inflatable fabric structures are. That's right, isn't it, Chairman? Yes, it is pretty difficult to pin out exactly the cost of all of these things.
However, I think it is very evident that when you make a structure like this, we have to fully insure on the ground, we don't have a lot of options to be much lower than making similar types of metal structures. Also, these are a lot of things that can do with structures such as this that can't be done with metal structures. I think we come out and maybe it is quite a difficult thing to do at this time, because all of them involve, that none of which none of that would be quite a difficult thing to do.
We are very certain that the costs of schedules like this will be much lower than comparable metal vehicles.
The Chairman: Thank you very much.
Mr. Richardson: Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to come back and share some information. It is subject that are going to hear more of in the space effort of our country.
