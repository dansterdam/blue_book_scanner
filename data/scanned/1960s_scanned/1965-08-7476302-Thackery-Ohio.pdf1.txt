PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 15 August 65 16/0405/
2. LOCATION: Thackery, Ohio
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual
7. COURSE: West to North
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: The evidence indicates that the object was NOT A/C, but the duration this report represents a possible transient target has multiple factors considered.
The object appeared as a star close to it. It looked like a bright point. Changed brilliance and appeared to wand slowly. Conducted night fly for several minutes, turned to North. Appeared to stop when it changed directions. Moved a considerable distance at constant motion before disappearing. This report sufficiently clear to evaluate, although the stopping and changing directions and the fluctuated existence does not easily classify the object into a normal category. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that an A/C was the likely culprit.
