I was driving home from school about 3:45 pm on October 15, 1966 and saw the same object that I saw about 1 1/2 years ago - it was hovering and seemed to be under intelligent control. It had lights on the bottom and was shaped like a saucer. It was about 75 feet in diameter and I watched it for about 10 minutes before it took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared. I was very puzzled and upset by what I saw - I saw it once before and tried to tell people but they just laughed at me - I'm glad this report is being taken seriously.
33. When and where did you report that you had seen the object? Our Town
