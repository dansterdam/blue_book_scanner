The image appears to be an old document page from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains handwritten text but no visible photograph.

Text from the document:

Was It a Satellite, Star, Plane?
On October 8, 1966, at about 8:40 P.M., EDT, the writer observed a bright light moving across the sky from north to south. It appeared to be at about 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon and was visible for about 1 minute. The light was steady and maintained a constant brightness. It was much brighter than stars or planets visible at the same time. It appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed but was silent. The writer checked with the local control tower at the nearby Southampton Airport but they had no reports of any aircraft in the area at that time. The local radio stations also had no reports of any satellites or space vehicles visible in the area. The writer is quite certain the observed object was not a satellite, star, or any conventional aircraft.
