TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Apr 7, 1960
ARCATA, CALIFORNIA
Aerial Phenomena Observation

On the night of 4-7-60, at approximately 7:00 pm, while working at the USAF RDF station, Arcata, California, I observed an unidentified aerial object from the radar site located near Arcata. The object was first detected on the radar scope at approximately 15 miles northeast of the station at an altitude of 6,000 feet.

The object appeared to be moving in a straight line at a constant speed of approximately 1,000 mph. The object was illuminated with a bright light and was visible to the naked eye from the radar site. After being observed on the radar scope for approximately 1 minute, the object disappeared suddenly from the scope, and no other sightings were made in that area for the remainder of the shift.

No unusual atmospheric conditions or meteorological phenomena were evident at the time of the sighting. The object exhibited characteristics not normally associated with conventional aircraft, such as its extremely high speed and abrupt disappearance from the radar scope.

The sighting was reported to the proper authorities in accordance with established procedures. A detailed report and sketch of the sighting will be forwarded to Project Blue Book, ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.
