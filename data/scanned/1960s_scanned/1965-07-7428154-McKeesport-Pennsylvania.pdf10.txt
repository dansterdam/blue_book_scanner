October 26, 1953

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Unfortunately, I forget to ask you one very important question the other evening when I visited. When you first saw the objects coming up from the south, did you see it blinking its way, so to speak, among the stars? Were you conscious of them being there for some time out? And, later on the porch facing north as you watched one of the objects go north, was it a steady flight? Was the moon visible? Would you kindly write and give me this information, as being out and roughly how many?

Thank you for your trouble. 

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen [redacted]
Director
