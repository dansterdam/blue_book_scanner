38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I am not qualified to judge what I saw [my] impression is that it could have been a Aircraft of some unusual type & probably one in development or testing - its shape & motion were not like any aircraft I have seen before & I saw no wings or signs of propulsion although it did seem to be under control. My own opnion is that it was some kind of experimental Craft but I HAVE NO WAY TO REALLY BE CERTAIN WHAT IT WAS - I SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW AND THERE IS NO NEED TO SPECULATE FURTHER.
