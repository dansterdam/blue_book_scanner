The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a series of sketches and illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved horizon line with an object above it, and instructions to indicate the position and height of the object. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road with a curved horizon line, with instructions to indicate the position of the object relative to the horizon.

22. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve at the point where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve at the point where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this sketch.
