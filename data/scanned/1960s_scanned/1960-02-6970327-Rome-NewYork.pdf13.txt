Larry Moquin, visitor at Tiny Naylor's, had received special training at Pearl Harbor during World War II for the purpose of sighting unknown objects. He was Chief gunner for Major Calibre Anti-Aircraft Artillery. His training proved useful on the night of February when he saw a red object in the sky about the size of a five cent piece of silver which emitted a vivid glow during five or ten minutes, and it had sort of a hollow sound, and you felt it as well as hearing it. Though I saw it myself, I thought it was a bright cherry red, self-luminous and sharply outlined. It appeared to be turning rapidly round to the Easterly direction, and when the witnesses came to line it up with something behind the trees, the interviewer was exactly where he had lined up the red object. The front part of the building has a gentle roof extending a considerable distance out beyond the main part of the building. On the left is the sign "Tiny Naylor's". He stood under the edge of this and watched the object sail approximately 8 minutes, then began moving slowly westward. Very slowly it moved to the southeast, still visible, and then in approximately two minutes it was out of sight.
One of the cashiers at the Safeway market, on the southeast corner of Sunset and La Brea, told interviewers that she had not seen the spectacle herself, but that she had heard a lot of excitement building about it.
The hostess at Carolina Pines Jr. Coffee Shop, 1518 North La Brea (near the intersection of Sunset and La Brea), said that patrons had told her all about the red light, the explosion and the mushroom cloud.
There can be little doubt that a red light of unknown origin, created considerable excitement in Hollywood two nights in succession-traveling over a period of five to ten minutes. Hollywood citizens are still asking, "What was it?"
