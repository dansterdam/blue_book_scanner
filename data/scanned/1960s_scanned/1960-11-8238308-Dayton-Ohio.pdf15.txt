The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output all the text found in the document:

Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
(Circle One)   Yes   No

If you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate?

Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was?
(Circle One)   Yes   No

IF you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was?

Please write a description of what you saw:
