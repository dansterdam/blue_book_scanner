Dear Mr. Chappell:

This is in reply to your recent letter inquiring about unidentified flying objects.

I am enclosing the Air Force publication which explains the Air Force investigation of UFO reports. This publication describes the Air Force project, "Blue Book", and its procedures for investigating UFO reports.

I hope this information will clarify the Air Force position on this subject. If you have any further questions, please feel free to write again.

Sincerely,

FRANKLIN M. ROSENWALD, Lt Colonel, USAF
Contract Manager
Director, Legislative Liaison
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force
