COR Rnp.. OF 20 IT DISAPPFAHED AS IF IT WERE NEVER THERE
THEY REASON WHY I AM SENDING YOU THIS LETTER WITH THE APPROXIMATE COURSE OF THE UFO IS TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS ANY SATELLITE, ASTEROID, OR COMET PASSING OVER THE EARTH IN A COURSE THAT WOULD COVER NEW ENGLAND.
THE OBJECT WHICH WAS OBSERVED COULD NOT OF BEEN A METEOR ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE FOR IT DID NOT CRASH, OR SPEED UP, OR DIE OUT SLOWLY BUT BLANCED OUT WITH NO TRACE IN A CLEAR SPACE WITH NO OBSTRUCTION TO OUR VISION. THIS SIGHT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE THE CLOSEST SIGHTING THAT YOU HAVE JUST SEEN IS TRUE IT IS NOT FAKE.
MY AGE IS FOURTEEN, I ATTEND CATHEDRAL HIGH SCHOOL, SPRING. MASS. AND I AM ABOUT TO ENTER INTO TENTH GRADE.
SINCERELY YOURS
