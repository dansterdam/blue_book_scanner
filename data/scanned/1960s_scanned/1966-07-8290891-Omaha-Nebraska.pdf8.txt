Dear Major Quintanilla:
In reply to your letter of Aug. 4, enclosing four reports on objects seen night of July 13/14, 1966 from the Omaha,Neb. area, I have now gone over them carefully.
My opinion is that they refer to two ob-jects. The first has seven reports for roughly 1 1/2/0400 to the other for 1 1/2/0600 Z-and that seems a very rational scene as to observed data. This latter duration was approximately 2 minutes, which of course is quite the same.
The reports roughly from N towards S or SE. The reportsexcept for any variations then usual except for the second being 10 seconds, usually persist for 10 seconds, usually peri-odically to disappearance.
None of the objects have UFO characteristics that you may be especially concerned with as meteors, etc.
I hope this helps.if you feel any further study or follow up in that is needed, please indicate.
Sincerely yours,
