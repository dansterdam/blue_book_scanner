The image shows a black-and-white photograph of a rural landscape. The foreground contains a field of tall grass and brush, with a sign in the middle that says "SWINB REED." In the background, there appears to be a road or pathway leading to a distant structure or landmark, possibly a water tower or telecommunication tower. The image is annotated with an arrow and text that says "ORIGINAL PLACE OF SIGHTING."
