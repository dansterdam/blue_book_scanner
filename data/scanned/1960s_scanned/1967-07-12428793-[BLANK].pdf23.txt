Text extracted from the document:

In February 1949, "Project Sign," completed its evaluations of the 243 UFO reports which had been submitted to the project.

The report concluded that: "No definite and conclusive evidence is yet available that would prove or disprove the existence of these UFOs as real aircraft or unknown and unconventional configuration."

"Project Sign" was changed to "Project Grudge" on 16 December 1948 at the request of the Director of Research and Development. 

Project Grudge completed their evaluations of 244 reports in August 1949. The conclusions of the Grudge reports were as follows:

"Evaluations of reports of UFOs to date demonstrate that these flying objects constitute no threat to the security of the United States. They also concluded that reports of UFOs were the result of misinterpretations of conventional objects, a mild form of mass hysteria of war nerves, and individuals who fabricate such reports to perpetrate a hoax or to seek publicity."

Project Grudge also recommended that the investigation and study of reports of UFOs be reduced in scope, as had the Project Sign Report.

The UFO project continued on a reduced scale and in December 1951 the Air Force entered into a contract with a private industrial organization for another detailed study of the UFO cases on file.
