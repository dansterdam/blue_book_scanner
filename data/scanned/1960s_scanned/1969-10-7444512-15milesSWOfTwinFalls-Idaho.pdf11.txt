The image contains a compass rose diagram showing the direction and orientation of a sighting, as well as two smaller sketches depicting the sighting from the observer's perspective.

Transcribing the text from the document:

IF YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "&#49;" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHICH LAST BEEN.

POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "1" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. BE SURE TO DRAW THIS LINE STRAIGHT AS THAT IS ACCURATELY SHOWN WHAT THE MOVEMENT WAS, NOT A CURVED LINE.
