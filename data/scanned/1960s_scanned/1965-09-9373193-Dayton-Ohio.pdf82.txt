The image appears to contain a diagram or sketch, but no photograph. The text indicates that the task is to "Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made" and to "Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling."

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" the course the object (outline) has when you first saw it. Place on "B" the same course the object was on when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. 

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
