Mr. Raymond Gerald Seabrook
----------------------------------------------------------
The information received from you, relative to the sighting of a possible UFO, has been carefully noted and made a part of the files of Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official program for the investigation of UFO reports. 

Your report has been reviewed and evaluated in the light of all available information. Although there is still much to be learned about the nature and origin of unidentified flying objects, the evidence at hand does not indicate that this particular report represents an extraterrestrial vehicle. Many natural and man-made phenomena can account for the types of sightings which have been reported, and this appears to be the case in this instance.

We appreciate your interest in this subject and your willingness to share your observation with the Air Force. Please feel free to report any future sightings, as all such information is valuable in helping us to understand this complex problem.

Sincerely yours,
Major Hector Quintanilla
Chief, Project Blue Book
