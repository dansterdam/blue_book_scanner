Stars of Ophiuchus
By Ramona Patrice Andrews
When the Sun enters the constellation Ophiuchus about November 29, it remains there until about December 17. Though only the very latest astronomers have included this constellation in the zodiac, there have been legends about Ophiuchus connected with the heavens for thousands of years.
Ophiuchus is the Serpent Bearer, sometimes called the Serpent Holder. He is depicted as a man grasping a serpent, with one foot on the head of the serpent and the other on its tail. This strange figure, though not one of the 12 zodiacal constellations, is rich in meaning and symbolism.
