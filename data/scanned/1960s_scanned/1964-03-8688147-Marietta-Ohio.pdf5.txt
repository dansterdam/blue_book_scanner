The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter from Maston M. Jacks of the Public Information Division, Office of Information, in response to a letter about an unusual object observed on March 5, 1964. The letter provides details about the Venus planet that was observed at that time.

March 13, 1964

Dear __________,

This is in reply to your letter of March 5, 1964, in which you reported seeing an unusual object.

What you saw was Venus which at the time you observed it, was at 89.9% of full illumination. The planet, which has a magnitude of -3.7, will be visible throughout March, & might and its elevation & a little higher than at the time you observed it.

Enclosed is the latest Air Force Fact Sheet on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects, which we think will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
