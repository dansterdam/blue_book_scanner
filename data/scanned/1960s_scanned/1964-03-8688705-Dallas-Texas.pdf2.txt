TO: Hq USAF SAFOI PB (Mrs Gaiser)
WASH 25 D C

The following information is provided to assist your office in a reply to Mrs. Gaiser regarding the object he observed on 15 March 1964:

a. The Pleiades are in the west at about 40 degs elevation and Orion in the southwest (az 220 deg) at 55 degs elevation. The motion of the object was toward the southwest.

b. Consultation with Dr Robinson (FTD Astronomer) indicates a moving object of a magnitude similar to the naked eye. Therefore, it is assumed that the object was brighter.

Characteristics of this observation are similar to those sightings previously confirmed as "satellites". The arc-distance traveled and the fact that the object passed in five minutes are considered with our analysis.

As a satellite passes into the earth's shadow, it is no longer visible, would account for the sudden disappearance attributed to atmospheric conditions. We do not carry data on the flight path or height of these objects, other than Deboi I and Echo I. Both of these satellites are usually of the first or second magnitude. Therefore, the sighting is probably one of the many satellites visible to the naked eye.
