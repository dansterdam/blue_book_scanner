The image contains a diagram showing the motion of an unidentified object or objects. The diagram includes a compass rose with degree markings, as well as a sketch of a sunburst-like shape. There are instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object(s) and the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" the position of the object when you first saw it. Place on "B" the position of the object when you last saw it. Please on the compass where you first saw the object (ie. "north", "south", etc.).

28. Draw a sketch that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
