"two stopped. The objects had now formed an equilateral triangle. they seemed to have changed in size to, observe them when we went into the dense trees around down. When visible,the objects had been in a position about 25 degrees from horizon. I had expected these to be strung out in a line, but they appeared to be in the general flight pattern for missiles. It was obvious they were not airplanes. I don't think it was a balloon, the way they acted.Allowed

they were

\Lato t?**1ar{rain'

These are all the details about the two incidents I know remember: I have two sightings in all the time I have observed this action. If you can cause of these phenomena I would like to be told of it. Thanks

Sincerely,

P.S. The Second sighting occurred at 9:00 P.M. I am sorry they were from my position they would have been over the Gulf on the horizon."
