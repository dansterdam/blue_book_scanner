Text transcription:

On September 6, 1964, the observer, a private citizen, reported a novel aerial object, apparently luminous in nature, which was observed at about 11:15 PM, EDT, about 2 miles SW of Westford, Massachusetts.

The observer stated that the object was the size of a small automobile, and appeared to be luminous or illuminated. It made no sound, and moved at a speed estimated to be about 300-400 mph, traveling from west to east. The observer watched the object for about 10-15 seconds before it disappeared.

In view of the presence of radiation and because of the consistency of the description given, this case is considered to be a probable Unidentified Flying Object. No further investigation appears warranted.
