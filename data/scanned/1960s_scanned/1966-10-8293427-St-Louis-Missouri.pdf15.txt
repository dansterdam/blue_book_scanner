The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

USAF/UPS
Request for Distribution of Photo
8 June 1967

Mr. [redacted]
St. Louis, Missouri

Reference your recent photographs of the planet Jupiter which were taken on October 29, 1966. Project Blue Book is currently in the process of collecting various photographs for distribution to the general public. We would appreciate the opportunity to release one of your photographs in connection with this program. It is possible that this action might cause some annoyance with your name associated with the photograph, but this publicity might cause undue notoriety.

PETER C. MAXWELL, Colonel, USAF
Chief of Technology and Capabilities
