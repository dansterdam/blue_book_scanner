The image contains two sketches. The top sketch appears to be a compass rose or navigation chart, while the bottom sketch depicts a person standing in a landscape with a curved horizon, suggesting a wide or panoramic view.

Now, regarding the text in the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOU WERE FACING WHEN YOU FIRST SEEN (SIC) PLACE A SPOT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON.
PART II SKETCH A CHART OF THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. GET THESE SKETCHES AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DESCRIPTIVE THAN THE LARGER SKETCH.
