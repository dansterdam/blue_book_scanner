August 12, 1964

Dear Mr. -------,

Our Project Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has attempted to evaluate the two UFO sightings reported.

The landing of March 1, 1964, has tentatively been classified as an indistinct natural or man-made object, possibly a meteor or satellite.

The sighting of June 5, 1964, is more complex. It contains several sightings of multiple objects witnessed over a 45 minute period. While the observers' description of the objects and their observed maneuvers is detailed, no substantiating evidence such as aircraft and astronomical bodies are present.

It is possible that these sightings could have been caused by known or easily describable phenomena, however, the full details observed were not described in sufficient detail to enable analysis. 

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
