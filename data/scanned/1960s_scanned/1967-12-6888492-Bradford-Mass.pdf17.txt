"Horizontal cironomatics [sic] the wave - my car - there by it. - Sentonic: On Dec.14,1967 I arrived home about 9:30 p.m. - as I was crossing my lawn to go into my house, I saw a bright light in the sky, [redacted] that appeared to be hovering. It seemed to be about the size of a star and as I watched it, it suddenly went out. Then, it reappeared about 15 seconds later, approximately 3 degrees above the horizon and approximately 5 degrees to the right of the position where it had first appeared. It remained there for about 10 seconds and then went out again. This was repeated several times, each time it would reappear in a different position in the sky. Then, it suddenly shot out about 30 degrees to the left at a terrific speed and disappeared. When it reappeared, it was much farther away and much smaller. It seemed to be moving in an easterly direction. After observing this for about 5 minutes, I went into my house."
