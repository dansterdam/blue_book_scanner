The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The sketch includes a compass rose and instructions for the observer to mark the location and orientation of an observed object.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? About 200
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image also contains a compass rose with N, E, S, and W markings, along with angular measurements along the periphery.
