If were the kind of boy who imagined things I would
say this was so in this case. In the contrary he is
a very sensitive guy who realizes such influences with reality
and accuracy.

To kind information these so-called things six weeks prior
to this sighting but, was unaware as to what they were.
On the seoond sighting he did know they were not simply
lights and was not only shook up but very scared. He now
hesitates to lock skyward and hurries home from his newspaper route as quickly as possible.

I certainly hope he never sees these things again as I
too have seen them a year previous to his sightings and
it was Scorous.

He composed the letter and the drawing himself. He also
hopes his information will help some.

Should you want to question him further on this feel
free to do so as he does wonder as to the answer to this
mystery. Is there one?
