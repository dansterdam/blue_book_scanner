There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a questionnaire form with handwritten responses.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Ja, as in the sky disappear from sight.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)
1) moved behind: Yes    (NO)   Don't Know.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) 
1) in front of: Yes     (NO)   Don't Know. 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Went through the sky silently.
b. Color White and slightly luminous.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
About 1 inch.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please do not trace the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[The image includes a detailed handwritten sketch and description of the sighted object.]
