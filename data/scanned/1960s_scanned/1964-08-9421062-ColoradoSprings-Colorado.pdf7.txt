1. Reference your letter, subject as above, dated 25 Aug 64.

2. The sightings described have been analyzed and it is believed that the objects observed were apparently caused by well-known physical phenomena. The observers discussed at great length with each of the witnesses their observations and interpreted what they saw as follows:
a. The matter of the objects not apparently changing in size and position as observed would indicate that there were no great changes in their actual position. The observers were in agreement on this, and discussed this at length.
b. The apparent slow movement toward them and the "blinking" of the lights as they observed would indicate that these were distant objects, perhaps high-altitude aircraft, balloons, or satellites, which is supported by the fact that the observers did not get an impression that these were extremely close or large objects.
c. The fact that the objects did not get any larger nor could they provide any indication by other means that the objects were in fact closer than they appeared, leads to the conclusion that the sighting was of distant objects.

4. The two objects which disappeared behind Pikes Peak were considered the most significant and were definitely darker in color and made definite turning movements.
