In August 1959 Lt. Marano spoke with someone regarding his unidentified observation of last summer that he observed with Mesaretto. He said he definitely saw the object at about 9 o'clock. It was about 3 o'clock and maybe one or two minutes, but he was not sure. He was standing next to a wood with the object over the trees. The trees were about two-hundred feet high and the object was about 200 feet from him. The object was silver and didn't make any noise. It moved pretty slowly. Couldn't compare it with any objects. There was only one object. He went just in the front yard and ran in the house and then right back out. No one was outside. Lt. Marano asked him why they only took one picture and he replied "I don't know." Lt. Marano asked him if he had time to take more than one picture and he replied "Yes." He doesn't belong to UFO clubs and is now 13 years old. His phone number is redacted. Lt. Marano asked him why he didn't return the forms. "I didn't have time to return them." Lt. Marano asked him when his parents would be home "I don't know." Lt. Marano asked him if they are home during the day. "No." He then asked if they were home during the evening "Yes, and redacted parents are home during the day."
