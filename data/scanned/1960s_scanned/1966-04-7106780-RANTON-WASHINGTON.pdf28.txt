Dear sirs, 
there are so many things to tell about our incident and it is possibly more than i could write in detail. Many things are not clear and so many mystery and unanwered questions. It would take me days and days to explain all the details. I can't reveal many things here as they are. 

I believe if you'd like to know the results, i can further discuss - but extreme caution must be excercised, as the subject is rather sensitive.
