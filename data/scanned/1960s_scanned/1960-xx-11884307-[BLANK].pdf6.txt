The image contains a photograph, which appears to be a newspaper clipping. The clipping discusses the release of a "Flying Saucer Movie" that is scheduled for May 9. It also mentions that the Pentagon has confirmed the existence of "unidentified flying objects" and that the Air Force has released film clips of these objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

PENTAGON SHOTS SHOWN

Flying Saucer Movie
To Be Released May 9

HOLLYWOOD, April 24.—(AP)—A documentary-type movie on the flying saucer controversy is scheduled for release May 9.

Russell Rouse said at a press preview yesterday that the film, "Unidentified Flying Objects," shows that flying saucers are here.

Hollywood Producers Preview
Movie Of Illusive "Saucers"

HOLLYWOOD, April 24.—(AP)—A motion picture on unidentified flying objects was previewed for Hollywood producers today, and they received it with mixed reactions.

Producers Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse said their soon-to-be-released film is the first full-scale movie treatment of unidentified flying saucers.

The real meat of the 30-minute movie is a few seconds of a flying object against a blue sky. The movie declares the Pentagon has decided these objects were neither aircraft, balloons, nor birds—but classified them as "unknown." 

Clip No. 1 was taken by Delbert C. Newhouse, Navy chief photographer, on July 2, 1952. It shows a group of white objects which moved in formation and at the same distance from each other.

Clip No. 2 was photographed by Lt. Cmdr. J. L. Weaver, of the Naval Air Intelligence, on July 16, 1952. It shows a cluster of about 14 unidentified flying objects tracked on radar.

Aiding in the film were Albert M. Chop, former press information chief of Project Blue Book, and Major Edward J. Ruppelt, former chief of the Air Force's investigation of flying saucers. Ruppelt gave some of his first-hand impressions of the investigation of Project Blue Book.
