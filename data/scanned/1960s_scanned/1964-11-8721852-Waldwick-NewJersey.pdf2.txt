TWO COUPLES FLEE
A HOVERING LIGHT

Four people, who wished to remain anonymous, reported they saw a strange light hovering in the sky on the night of Nov. 2, 1964. The light hovered over the Pascadero nursery, and when they approached, the light suddenly flashed and moved back and forth. When it flashed again, the people felt it was about as big as a basketball.

Hulsen, 29, and Diane Myers, 20, the four witnesses, said the light then hovered over them. They fled into the house, saying they would have been "cooked" if they had stayed. Then the light went off.

Hulsen checked out the door, saw the light move back away, and then it went off. "Then it took off," said Hulsen. "I guess we couldn't go that fast."

He called Bureau of Forest Ranger Raymond Cavallaro, who called the police office. Deputies who arrived at the scene were unable to locate the light.
