The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a part of Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Dr. Fonnal: 

Your letter of 8 February followed up your telephone request to furnish a copy of the investigative report on the sighting of an unidentified object at your farm on 17 January. As you know, this report was prepared by Captain Philip W. Cabe, 8239th Air Force Reserve Squadron, who visited the site on 19 January. 

Captain Cabe's report, dated 22 January, states that at approximately 11:45 p.m. on 17 January, you and your wife observed a bright light in the sky about 20 degrees above the horizon in the southeast. The object was described as stationary, about the size of a car and brighter than the stars. After observing it for about 20 minutes, it suddenly accelerated, traveling in a horizontal path at a tremendous speed, and disappeared. No other witnesses were found in the immediate area.

If you are interested, please let me know and I will forward a copy of the complete report. The original is retained in our files.

Sincerely,
