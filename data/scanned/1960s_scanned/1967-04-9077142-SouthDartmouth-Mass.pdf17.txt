UFO form continued

It did look like a egg, and it moved around without any noise. It appeared to stop, hover, then move away. We were both watching it intensely, and it did not come any closer than described. The color was kind of a grey, and seemed to have a high polish or shine to it, almost metallic. We were both quite excited about it, and only wish we could have observed it longer, but it soon disappeared from our view. I hope this description is what you wanted.
