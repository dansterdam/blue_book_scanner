Dayton, Ohio

Dear Col. Friend:

I feel that it is first necessary to inform you on one of the group members of the new project we are starting on February 25, 1962. A report was made to the Honnerton Base which in turn was forwarded on to you. Through XXXXX, one of our group, we learned the report had been sent to him. When told by XXXXX that it had observed the object and also report the second observation to you.

I am very sorry that I am so late in sending this report have been working on a defense pair project on a scientific basis and started a project on my father's farm during the 1961 meeting at a saucer club at the South Florida Science Fair. I wish my report, for I photographed the object on three occasions while working on my project. I am sending you the report only as you requested.
