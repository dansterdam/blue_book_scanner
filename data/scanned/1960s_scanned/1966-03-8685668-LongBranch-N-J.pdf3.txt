The image contains a handwritten letter addressed to the Director of Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Denver, Colorado. The letter describes the sighting of an unidentified object on March 31, 1966. The observer went out to look at the stars around 7:30 pm and observed an elliptical object that was darker than the rest of the sky, spinning rapidly from left to right or counter-clockwise. The object had four alternating blue-white lights on the front, and two lights on the bottom. The observer tried to measure the object's position but it was about 50 degrees in the western sky and slowly moved away, eventually disappearing completely. The observer has enclosed a sketch of the observed object.

Dear Sir:

I should like to report the sighting of an unidentified object on March 31, 1966. These are the details:

Around 7:30 I went out to look at the stars, and was studying astronomy in school. I had not been out long when I sighted an object. It was long and elliptical, darker than the rest of the sky, and spinning rapidly from left to right, or counter-clockwise. The front were four alternating blue-white lights. On the bottom were two lights, the top one being slightly higher. 

We had intended to use a protractor to measure its position. It was about 50 degrees in the western sky. 

It was slowly waning and flying away into the west. After a few minutes, it was completely gone.

Enclosed is a sketch I have made of the object from memory. I would also be glad to answer any further questions.

Respectfully,
