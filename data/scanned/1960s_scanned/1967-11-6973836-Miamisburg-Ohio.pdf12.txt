15 jan 67. Mr. Quintanilla - please see my letter to you on an observation I made on 3 Nov 67 near Miamisburg, Ohio, at about 10:30 p.m. EST. I stood and watched this very unusual light for some 15-20 minutes before it disappeared. It seemed to pick up speed and just fade out of sight. I would appreciate any information you can give me on this sighting.
