OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
OCT 11 1966
Dear Mr. [redacted],
We have consulted our Project Blue Book investigative officer concerning the unusual sightings you referred to us in your letter of September 21, 1966. As such, nothing quite like this has been previously reported.
this usually your own best method would seem so utilize an optical illusion since it is most likely the cars attraction was caused by a motion (possibly beyond the range of human hearing) rather than a sighting, form. I am circulating a sighting report form. We cannot assure you that we will disclose her identity, but if this phenomenon should prove to be of sufficient interest, you can assure her, too, that we will not disclose her identity should she choose to submit a report.
Thank you for your interest and cooperation.
Sincerely,
GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
