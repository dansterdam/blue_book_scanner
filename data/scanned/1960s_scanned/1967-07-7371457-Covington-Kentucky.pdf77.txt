The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and text. The diagram appears to be an illustration showing the motion of an object or objects, with a radial compass-like illustration and instructions for the viewer. The text below the diagram includes a question about the number of objects observed and a phrase that reads "very Raphagard".

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon (skyline) where you first saw the object, an "B" on the same horizon line to where the object crossed, and a "C" at the point where you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you first saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
