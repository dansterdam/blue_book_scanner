DEAR SIR:
On the night of 8 October 1965, at approximately 9:45 p.m., I had an unusual experience of seeing a UFO that took place several miles southwest of Minnesota. I was driving from my place of employment, the Green Giant Cannery, when I noticed a bright light in the sky. At first I thought it was just an aircraft light, but as I continued to observe it, I realized that it was much larger and brighter than any normal aircraft light. 
The object appeared to be circular in shape and emitted a brilliant white light. It was hovering approximately 500 feet above the ground and approximately 2 miles from my location. The light from the object was so bright that it actually illuminated the area around me as I was driving. I watched this object for approximately 10 to 15 minutes as it hovered silently in the sky. 
After several minutes, the object began to move in a northeasterly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. As it moved, the brilliant white light suddenly changed to a reddish-orange color. Within a matter of seconds, the object disappeared from sight. 
I was very excited and amazed by what I had witnessed. I can assure you that this was no ordinary aircraft. The size, brightness, and manner of flight of this object were unlike anything I have ever seen before. I would be more than willing to discuss this incident with you in greater detail if you so desire. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely yours,
