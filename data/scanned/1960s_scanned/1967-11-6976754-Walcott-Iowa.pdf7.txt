The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing a form with various questions about a UFO phenomenon. The form includes checkboxes for different characteristics of the phenomenon, as well as open-ended questions about what drew the observer's attention and how the phenomenon finally disappeared.
