Vandenberg Sighting Report

Earlier on November 3rd, namely, that most of the radar targets were in fact birds. Individual birds, having a cross section approximately equivalent to that of one quart of water, would produce signal strengths consistent with those observed. The targets observed the night of November 8th, according to calculations made by Dr. Therriault, yielded a radar cross section of approximately 10 cm2. The velocities and coherent tracks of the targets also suggested consistency with the bird hypothesis. What had apparently been overlooked initially (and for a while it fooled the experts) was that, with the fourth-power law operating, the signal strength produced by a bird close in, with radars of the great power of the FPS-16 and especially the TPQ-13, would be very large, but it would drop off extremely rapidly with increasing distance. It became apparent, from examination of the data available from the tapes and the printouts, that the high signal strengths were associated with targets at close range. No attempt was made at the time of the sightings to associate ranges and signal strengths. Had someone asked: "When you get a 30 db signal, what range do you read?" the evening would probably have had a different conclusion. Operating procedures might, in the future, very well provide, when unidentified targets causing concern, that ranges and signal strengths be related to one another.

The author is not aware of the existence of any procedure to be followed that would lead toward the prompt explanation of unidentified radar targets of an unusual nature e.g. insects, side-lobe echoes, anomalous echoes from objects on the ground, etc. In the absence of such a procedure, the operators involved in this case handled the situation reasonably, and their performance is not to be criticized.
