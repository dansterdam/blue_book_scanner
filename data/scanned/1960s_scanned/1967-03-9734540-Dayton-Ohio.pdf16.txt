DEAR STR:

WHEN COMING TO WORK THURSDAY MORNING, AT 5:30 I SAW WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LARGE, WHITE, GLOWING CRAFT SALEM AVE TOWARD THE DOWNTOWN AREA WHERE I WORK. I SEEN THIS AIRCRAFT CIRCLING THE DOWNTOWN AREA. AS IT APPROACHED THE RED LIGHT ON RIVERVIEW DAM IT SHOT OFF A BEAM OF LIGHT TOWARD THE CITY, WHEREAS THE RED LIGHT ON THE AIRCRAFT WENT OFF, AND A WHITE LIGHT CAME ON AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE. IT SEEMED STILL FOR A MATTER OF 2 MINUTES, THEN MOVED A LITTLE SOUTH AND STOPPED AGAIN FOR A MINUTE WITH ONLY A BRIGHT RED LIGHT ON AND MOVED AGAIN GOING EAST.
