6:30 p.m.
The clear, moon 3/4.
The air was calm, air temp cooler and cooler as the evening wore on. I went outside and noticed a bright light in the S.E. sky, very bright, like Venus or some star. It definitely was moving. I changed my position to get a better view and could see it was moving like a plane, but much faster and very bright. The light did some zigging and zagging and increased in speed. It seemed to go out of sight behind some trees. I went inside and watched through a window, but could not see it again. It could not have been a planet or a star. I have seen a number of satellites and this was definitely not a satellite. It was an unidentified flying object.
