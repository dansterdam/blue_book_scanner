why can't you remember and what a point of depart here occurred from a 22 degree nar 26 north 147 west pacific area. As an ex air force veteran with an outstanding case hich is certain but it can stand out. We and the old navy pilots tho dint see too much when he flew over did report seeing circular things. I can conclude it wasn't military and i would say that it was a genuine case that no one can claim a simple cause since it is among the most impressive cases and the facts are undeniable. one can thin this simple case can be considered one of the main argument for the reality of the phenomenon.
