This object appeared to be pretty or disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. There was no time for a good look. When I tried to get a good look it went off very fast. I couldn't make out the details of anything. It wouldn't stay up the thought that this really was something that I had seen. My son brought home a book from the library and in it was a picture that most resembled what I was going to report. And it was from that book I got the details that I reported. No report on our was written and nothing else passed along or mentioned.
