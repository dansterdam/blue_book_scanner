10. CONCLUSION
Possible (METEOR)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted an object that was a bright red color in droping (like meteors or such) and it appeared to be trailing a long tail behind it. It was arking into the ground."  It was seen for 5 to 10 seconds and made no noise.
COMMENTS: The duration and flight path of the object are consistent with a meteor observation.  However the observer since no one else in the Dayton area reported seeing an UFO and because the characteristics are so similar to those of a meteor observation, this sighting is listed as a possible meteor.
