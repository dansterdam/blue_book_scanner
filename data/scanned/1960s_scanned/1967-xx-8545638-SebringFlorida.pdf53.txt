The object moved on an erratic course, although it moved in the same area of the sky. If you took out a half dollar and held it at an arm's length from your eye, you could have blocked the sight of this pulsating object during the entire hour that we watched it.
As we watched it, we saw it several planes. Now overhead going in a westerly direction. Although none of them appeared to notice the object, as they were going in a northerly direction. This plane had its lights on and went on. However, it was only in sight for a short time before the plane and its lights were completely out of sight.
I don't see how the light that we saw could have been a star because of its erratic movement, and I don't think it could have been a plane, to be man-made.
When we left at 06:15 G. M. T. the object was a very faint spot in the sky and farther than most of the stars, although the pulsing was still quite obvious.
I don't know what this was. Perhaps you do. And if you can explain what it was, I should like to know myself. We thought it might be a flying saucer, but the light was too close for an object that was flying away, hovering and moving all around. However, the object was far away as against being too close for an object that had to be as far away as this one.

Very sincerely yours,
