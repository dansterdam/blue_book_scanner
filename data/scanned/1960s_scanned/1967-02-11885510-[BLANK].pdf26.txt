The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document discussing radio contact as a method for exchange of signals between civilizations, and provides a tabulation summarizing the present situation according to L.N. Gindilis (1965). The text focuses on the distances at which radio contact is effective, the possibility of contact with civilizations in the Andromeda galaxy, and the discussion around suitable radio frequencies for interstellar communications.

(b) Radio contact is a method for exchange of signals which is now technically possible but the distances at which it is effective are very small in comparison with the size of the universe.

Only one way radio contact, of course, is not limited by distance. We may imagine a civilization in the Andromeda galaxy that sent out signals "to whom it may concern" a million and a half years ago. We would just now be receiving them.

(c) Possible contact by means of masers, lasers, and other modern electronic means.

L.N. Gindilis (1965) in his survey of the problem gives a tabulation summarizing the present situation. This tabulation is shown in Table I, where d denotes the distance between civilizations in light years, and tc the life time of a civilization. This tc, as has already been remarked is of a highly speculative nature. Shklovskiy takes it to be of the order of 10,000 years, Gindilis thinks it should be billions of years, that is, comparable to the life-time of the planets themselves.

The bulk of discussion in the USSR (as well as in the West) is on the selection of suitable radio frequencies and other characteristics of radio waves for interstellar communications. The hydrogen wavelength 21 cm originally proposed as having a special significance.
