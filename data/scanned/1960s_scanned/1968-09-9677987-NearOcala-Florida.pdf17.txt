C Yes, and, of course, the haze was not of such thickness that we couldn't see through it. You see, but this light was just hanging there, and it moved directly toward us and then turned and descended again, and it went lower than it was originally when we saw it. It went a distance, I told them 15 miles, but I couldn't tell the distance. It went some distance west of Ocala and he just parked out there, and sat there, and we flew on past it.
