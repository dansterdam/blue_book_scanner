Background:
Neighbors Carr and Sleico had been conducting their own private investigation of UFO activities in the area. Almost every night they would observe strange objects in the sky. Occasionally their craft would hover in the same relative position for about 10 to 15 minutes, then suddenly dart away at a high rate of speed. On this date, the witnesses called to report this latest sighting.
The Object:
The witness called to report that he and the other observer named Sleico had sighted an object in the sky that evening. He described it as a bright, star-like object that hovered for a time, then suddenly darted away at a high rate of speed. The object was also reported to have been seen by other residents of the area.
On the evening of the sighting, the witnesses stated that the object first appeared to the southeast and then moved in a northeasterly direction. The object was observed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.
The Case:
No further information was provided on this case.
