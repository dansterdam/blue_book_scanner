Dear Sirs:

In the July 6th, 1964 issue of the Clearwater Sun, you stated descriptions of the six mysterious lights spotted over Clearwater Beach, Florida, on July 4th.

The lights were first sighted at approximately 8:30 p.m. and were observed until 9:15 p.m. The object or objects that were observed were described as approximately eight to ten feet in diameter and they were observed to hover, change direction, and disappear and then reappear at various points in the sky. 

At one point one of the lights was observed to be much brighter than the others. The lights were suspended in mid-air, and hovering in a stationary position. They seemed to be a sort of reddish-orange color, for the most part, and varied in intensity from time to time. There appeared to be an area of blackness in the center of each light. After a period of time the lights would disappear and then reappear at another location.

That's about all the information I can give you regarding this incident. I hope this is helpful to you in your investigation. 

Sincerely yours,
