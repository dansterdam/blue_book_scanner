No Case (Information Only)
30 June 1960
Martin, Tennessee

To several stars - at the past few years, a circle appeared repeatedly on the ground, covered with grass, at various farms in the area. Miss Josephine Damron, who lived with her father and brother near Martin, Tennessee, told her neighbors that such circles had appeared in her field several times, the largest being about six yards in circumference. A flash of light accompanied the appearance of the circle and upon investigation she found that the grass within the circle was flattened, but not cut. In the center of the circle was a slight depression, about six inches deep and twelve inches across. Examination revealed no signs of digging or disturbance of the soil, and no trace of anything that might have caused the phenomenon. Subsequent appearances of the circle seemed to indicate that some invisible force emanating from a central point had pressed down the grass in a circular pattern, radiating outward. Although several other persons claimed to have observed the same phenomenon in the vicinity, Miss Damron's account is the only detailed report available. Since none have been explained, the cases remain somewhat puzzling.
