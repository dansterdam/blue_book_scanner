The image contains a diagram and illustration, but no photograph. The diagram appears to be a compass rose and some instructions related to describing the motion and direction of an unidentified object or objects.

27. In the case where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the arrow curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
