It. was sighted at 2:32 p.m.  I. vs. flying low and very slowly, and sighted a height in the sky, a1 was moving and heading in this direction, and this object that appeared to was inspecting the plant. He watched it very closely, and before 1 could complete an observation, it started climbing at a high rate of speed, and within approx. 20 seconds it was completely out of sight. the object was about the size of a football, and was dark in color, and appeared to be about 300 yards ahead of the observer. It took about 20 seconds to process and leave the area.

Sincerely,
