The object seemed to be red in color and was going at about 50-100 mph over Cartaret. It was seen to slow down, tilt and hover for a while. The object then started to rise vertically and went out of sight. Witness said it was a bright object compared to the stars in the sky. He believes the object was intelligently operated.
