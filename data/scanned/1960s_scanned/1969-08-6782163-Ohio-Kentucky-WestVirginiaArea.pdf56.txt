Father said he up 9p.n eastern around 
began watching new aircradt coming which was bright,
Diamond sizing of hanos. Seemed to be hover in air 
about 3 minutes. Good - very clear night. Brilliant object 
not like any aircradt I ever say. Told father I would report
this to proper authorities.
Resumed watching of object went another 3 minutes
and then it disappeared. Left no trail as far as we could 
determine. Moved up and down and seemed to vibrate.
Object was sighting or bright nite (not so bright as search 
light) and would appear to be nigh. Object disappeared into 
clouds, which were about half as high. 
This is what we saw. As I said, never seen anything
like it.
