(as has already been mentioned) as a communication signal has
not been accepted in the West. At any rate, this research may
be expected to shed some light on the nature of quasars.

Also, Kardashev and Pashchenko at GAISH (Shklovsky-Sagan,
P 475) will be attempting to detect artificial signals on the 21
cm hydrogen wavelength. The anticipated power of the signals should
be relatively great. A negative result from this search would
indicate that in our galaxy there are not civilizations with power
resources of the order 10^33 ergs/sec. The investigations on the
Andromeda galaxy, M31, will also be conducted. It is perhaps
noteworthy that nothing of this can be found in the second edition
of Shklovsky's book, and Sagan inserted this paragraph evidently
from direct contact with Shklovsky. Also, an equivalent to this
program does not exist in the West.

Nothing is known of the research programs in this connection
at the Pulkovo Observatory or at any other institution named in the
resolutions of the Byurakan conference.

In a book "Radio for 70 Years" (1965), Siforov (pp 11-23)
in an article titled 'Radio Role in Space Exploration" fails to
include in his scheme of five steps in the development of radio
communications the problem of interstellar communication where it
logically belongs. He devotes to this problem exactly two lines:
