Once again the witness contact the reporting authorities at the time same. More or less reluctantly related the following: 

Shortly after the sighting the following day, Mr. witness decided to look around the area where the object was first observed. This area was approximately 1 mile south of Sarasota, Florida, and close to the main highway. He went there out of curiosity to see if he could find any evidence that might indicate what the object was. To his surprise he found the remains of what appeared to be a small metallic object, approximately 30 inches in diameter. It was badly damaged and distorted, but he was able to discern that it was a thin shell, perhaps 1/16 inch thick, of a highly polished aluminum-like metal. The material was extremely light in weight and the edges were jagged, as if the object had been ripped or torn apart. There were no identification marks of any kind visible.
