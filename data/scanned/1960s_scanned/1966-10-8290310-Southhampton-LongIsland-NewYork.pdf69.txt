A report was received from a credible source who saw UFOS in the Suffolk area on Tuesday, October 20, 1953.

The informant stated that at about 10:10 P.M. on that date, while driving south on North Sea Avenue, Southampton, Long Island, New York, he observed 3 objects in the sky which he described as round or oval in shape, glowing with a fluorescent reddish-orange color, and estimated them to be about 50 to 100 feet in diameter. The objects were moving at a very high rate of speed and at an altitude of approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet. The duration of the sighting was about 15 to 20 seconds.

The informant further stated that the objects appeared to change direction abruptly, and at one point two of the objects seemed to merge into one. When the objects disappeared from view, the informant hurriedly drove to the Southampton Police Station and reported the incident.
