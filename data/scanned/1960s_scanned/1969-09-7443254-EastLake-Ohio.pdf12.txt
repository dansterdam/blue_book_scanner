UFO INVESTIGATION, 23 Sep 69

EAST LAKE, OHIO 44094

1. In reference your UFO sighting of 23 Sep 69. The information you have provided is consistent with reports we have received of satellite observations. These and similar incidents are common-place and can easily be attributed to the many satellite and space vehicles now in orbit. We can limit the observation to probably being one of the many satellites currently in operation.

2. Thank you for your cooperation and for reporting your sighting to the Air Force.
