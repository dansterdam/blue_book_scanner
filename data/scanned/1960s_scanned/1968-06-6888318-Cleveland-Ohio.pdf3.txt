Dear Sir: 
I am very much interested in the U.F.O. Sightings as an article in the Cleveland [Cleveland] Press during the weekend of the 24th of June 1968 was of great interest to me. The report stated that the military took the reports very lightly and did not even investigate the sightings. As belonging to a flying saucer watcher group, I was rather disappointed in this. As I am from my long standing program to study possible landings and behavior of UFOs.  I would appreciate any additional information you could send me from files on this particular sighting. I realize you are busy, but any information would be greatly appreciated.
