k. This particular report was called in to the O'Hare Base Operations Office. The geographical location is approximately six miles due east of Midway Airport. The surface winds at Midway Airport were out of the southwest. According to the report, the object was on a course from the northwest. It is impossible to determine with this information whether or not it could have been the same object observed at O'Hare, then turning northwest on a down wind leg for a landing on Runway 22.
