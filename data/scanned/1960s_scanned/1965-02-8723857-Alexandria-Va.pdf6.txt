21.From what I saw, this object seemed to be very high up. 
It looked as high, or higher, than an airplane would go.
The objects were small, much smaller than an airplane would be, but the brightness made the object noticeable.
The brightness of the object could or teen caused by the sun reflecting against it. But it is possible, also, that the object gave off its own light. These objects were directly above me. I had to look up in order to see them. I am not sure how many objects there were. I think there were about ten at the most. The way they flew was strange. They would stop in mid air at times. When I first saw these objects, they didn't want to leave the area they were in, but still they were moving. They would turn around and go back and forth, but each one had a path of its own. After a while, these objects started to leave the area, all heading in the same direction.
I have never seen anything like these objects before.
