The image does not contain a photograph. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

If reports are identified by local local air force base they are not forwarded to Wright-Patterson. To get the specific number of reports received it would take a little research. We have the information up to date as much as possible but with the publicity we have been having, which takes a lot of our time, it is hard to keep a running account of statistics. We have had inquiries regarding the sightings in Michigan, everyone has been calling about it. Have had very few calls regarding local observations. If reports from the Columbus area have been submitted to us we will give the information on them to him. Have him the statistics for this year.

PAUL BAABER, KING (NEW YORK) - Started with Michigan business. Said he had a wire saying that Major didn't really think it was swamp gas, nor did Dr. Hynek. Parker had a report from Mort Young. Major Quintanilla said that the wire was in error. Major looked it up (swamp gas) talked to chemists and researchers. It. Major Quintanilla had not spoke with Mort Young. Major Quintanilla said I interpret it to say that it was reassessed before or came to the conclusion. Parker wanted to know how these lights got in the swamp. You have fires (there is methane and it is a vapor). Major gave the statistics for this year. I have been in Blue Book for 32 months and I have satisfied myself that these objects are not extraterrestrial in nature. The vast majority of cases are misinterpretation of conventional objects. Nobody should expect me to identify 100% of the cases. We are dealing with other peoples experiences and interpretations. I have no indication that any advanced intelligence from outer space has visited us.
