UFO Almost Makes It to Pittsburgh
'Saucer' Flies From Ohio to

An Unidentified Flying Object (Flying Saucer to you, Champ!) almost made it to Pittsburgh yesterday, but an alert Ohio deputy sheriff took up the chase southeastward through Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the object sped away at speeds ranging from 50 to 100 miles an hour.

Deputy Sheriff Wayne Huston, who had first spotted the object south of Warren, Ohio, called in the chase to the Youngstown Police Department and to the Federal Aviation Agency at Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

Pilots were up in a few minutes almost immediately from the Youngstown base, but concluded that the object -- whatever it was -- had too much a head start to catch up with it by or.

Near Conway, Beaver County, they lost it. The deputy said he had followed hundr eds of objects over the years, but this time and calls were continuing to police switchboards as port and reporting agencies conferred on the subject. 

Deputy Neff, who reportedly believes in flying saucers, and who took up the chase southeastward, said the object, some 50 to 65 feet across the top and about 24 feet high, was first spotted south of Warren, Ohio, by County W. L. Neff, who gave the above description, about 8 a.m.

Neff added that the object, which seemed to be able to maneuver by itself, gave off a faint humming noise.
