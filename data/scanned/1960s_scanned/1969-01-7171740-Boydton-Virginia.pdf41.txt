The image contains a compass rose diagram and two landscape drawings. The compass rose diagram appears to be used to indicate the direction of an observed phenomenon. The two landscape drawings depict a person standing in a landscape, though the details are not clear enough to identify any individuals.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON AS FIRST SEEN. CONNECT THE X WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON AS DESCRIBED.
