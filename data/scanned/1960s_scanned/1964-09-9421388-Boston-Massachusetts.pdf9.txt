SUBJECT: UFO Sightings, 9 Sep 64

Wenhum, Massachusetts
Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

We are in receipt of your report of unidentified flying objects sightings on 9 Sep 64 in the Boston, Massachusetts, North Shore area. We have evaluated your conclusions on sightings there with your permission, since these reports are of identified objects and not unidentified.

The sightings or witnesses are over an area of two square miles and for a considerable time. This sighting presents some characteristics of a reflection search/other ground light. Verification of weather data to establish a cloud or haze layer and the presence of personal searchlight/spotlight in the area is also highly suggestive of this explanation. The second object was varying to different shape with fuzzy edges, no noise, dull grey color diffused with yellowish tint. This motion is also highly suggestive of this explanation.

Did James Washer have the feeling that the second object was trying to interact or catch the advertising plane? The Air Force wishes to thank you for your interest in aerial phenomena.

YOU - THE NUCLEUS OF SECURITY!
