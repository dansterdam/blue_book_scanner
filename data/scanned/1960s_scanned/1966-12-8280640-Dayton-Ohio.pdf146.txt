There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with a questionnaire about an unidentified object.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and estimate how much of the object would have been covered by the match head.

19. Please include in your reply an estimate of the size, distance, and location of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The text appears to be a survey or questionnaire regarding an unidentified object sighting. It asks the observer various details about the object's appearance, behavior, and movement.
