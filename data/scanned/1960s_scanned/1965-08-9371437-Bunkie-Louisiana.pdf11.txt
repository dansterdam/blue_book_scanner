The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter discussing observations of unusual celestial phenomena, possibly related to a UFO sighting.

The antices of subsat C. are most interesting. When C appeared from behind some saucer?, about three or more? easter?. The disappearances, you say, took place in a matter of seconds. This suggests a strange device of some kind. Do their radivous point?

I wish you would expand on the astronomical seeing conditions - and the thing? diminishing and enlarging as before and stopping the eyes. What was this that had no visible eye? Wasn't this to the extreme twinkling to the stars in the immediate vicinity? How does this tie in with CI and the lights moving at tremendous speed? What did they look like? Were these only focal images of the lights? What did they look like in focus?

By the way, I did not receive any copies of the photographs. Were these returned to you, and if not, who has them now?

And we object to: When the airplane came by, how many seconds did light remain off?

If it continues to warrant deeper investigation, I could say: one of my friends in the Los Angeles area may be able to assist you. Perhaps his investigation could be helpful.

He is extremely busy right now, but Mrs. Hynek would be delighted to discuss the facts you gathered with him. She would be glad to assist in any way she could.

I have a special theory for your experience and apparent that of many others. Are the other witnesses to your experience available for consultation?

Answering a few questions: I am just learning of your incident now I would be interested in any details which may supplement the information I now have. I understand in other cases I have investigated there have been complaints of the reluctance of witnesses to discuss their observations. I hope you will not find this to be the case.

Thank you again.

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Director
