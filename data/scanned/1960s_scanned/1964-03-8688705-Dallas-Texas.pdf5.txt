The text in the document reads:

"My investigation must find that the witness in this case is able to the fact that the object did move at a rapid rate of speed. The witness observation is that of 15 minutes duration. They matched and stated that the object appeared to be of apparent size of a full moon. It was dark and rather round and seemed to vary some in brightness. At one point there appeared a flame-like quality that seemed somewhat larger than the object, but this was very brief. The witness was rather definite in stating that the object was metallic in appearance and reflected the lights from the ground. The witness is positive that the object was not an aircraft, although no sound was heard. The witness further stated that the object maintained a relatively straight-line course with no deviation or erratic movements. The witness observation appears to be sincere and it is believed that the sighting is authentic."
