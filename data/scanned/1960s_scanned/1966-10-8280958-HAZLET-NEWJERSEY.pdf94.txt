Coming home from work, we saw what appeared to be a large, bright light in the sky off to the left of the highway. It seemed to be hovering in the same spot and was moving very slowly from left to right as we watched it. We drove on and it seemed to disappear behind trees. We drove on and it reappeared again. This happened several times as we drove along the highway. We were a little puzzled by what we were seeing but thought it might be some type of aircraft or helicopter. We drove on and it appeared to move away from us and gradually disappeared from sight.
