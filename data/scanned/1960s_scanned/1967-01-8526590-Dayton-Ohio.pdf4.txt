The image contains a sketch showing instructions for how to describe the motion of an unidentified object or objects in the sky. There is a compass illustration to the right of the sketch. The text asks the viewer to draw a picture that shows the motion of the object or objects and any changes in direction during the course.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? /_ohy Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
