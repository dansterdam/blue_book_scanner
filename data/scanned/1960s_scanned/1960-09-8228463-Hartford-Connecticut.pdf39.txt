Narrative of Sighting:
At approximately 9:25 p.m. on September 7, 1960, I was standing in my backyard observing the night sky. I noticed a bright, fast-moving object in the western sky. It appeared to be circular in shape and emitting a pulsating light. The object moved rapidly in a straight line and then made an abrupt 90-degree turn before disappearing from view. The entire sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.
