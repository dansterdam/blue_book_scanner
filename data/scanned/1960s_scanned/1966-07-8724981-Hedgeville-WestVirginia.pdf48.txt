Dear Sir:

An object like a 2 story star passed over, about 50-60 feet in diameter, and seemed to land or nearly land behind a hill near Hedgesville, West Virginia. The observer flashed a light on it, you have very nearly answered all questions. We appreciate your interest and assistance in this matter. By the way, a "blinking light" from the DID site gone.
