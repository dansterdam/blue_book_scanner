FLYING SAUCER 
On July 5, 1960, at 5:15 A.M., I observed from the terrace of my house a white form moving in the sky. This form was circular and white, and many in size. It was in sight. It was clearly defined borders like a disc, very bright on the upper. It can be compared to a telescope focused on it with a small telescope, focusing on the form of light emanating from it. My wife, who was sleeping at the time, also saw this form as I called her. This is not an airplane, nor a star or planet, as they are known to us, and the stars were visible. I live in a place where the sightings have often been big and impressive. 
The form was at an approximate angle of 40 degrees from the horizon, slightly south-southeast, and was observed by me at approximately 40 degrees from the horizontal. It disappeared completely at 5:54 A.M. 
I am an attorney at law, also a master sergeant discharged from the army. I had the rank of captain. There are remarks that have some training in observation and objective analysis. - a. l. cam- , San Juan, Puerto Rico.
