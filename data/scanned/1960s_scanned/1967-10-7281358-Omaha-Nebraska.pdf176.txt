Well if you have got this far and you are yet or have gone cross-eyed with my typing, I would thank you for your time and patience in reading and trying to cope with my (AHEM!) jokes.You are piled down with persons such as mine, and are trying all in the proper place, whatever that is.If any explainantion what this thing was I would any know about it. My address is below. Thanks again
