The image does not contain any photographs, but rather contains two hand-drawn sketches. 

The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and "B" marked on it, and a sketch of a landscape with mountains or hills in the background. The instructions indicate that this sketch is meant to illustrate the position of an object seen in the sky.

The second sketch shows a road or path leading towards a horizon, with two smaller sketches to the side that appear to be further examples of how to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
