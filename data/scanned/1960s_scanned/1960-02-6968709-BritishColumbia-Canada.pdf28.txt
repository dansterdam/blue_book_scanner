There are a number of factors which tend to discredit this report. The envelope is postmarked Davenport, Iowa (attachment nr 2) which is located over 1500 miles from the place of occurrence and would have been hard to investigate in 1959. Tribes would have ripped a watch through woods that could have been hidden by trees. The object was a possible a ball of fire or meteor. The statement that the Athabaskan Indian 'tribes are very primitive and superstitious' suggests that this report is a hoax, but an inquiry will be conducted to resolve this matter further.
