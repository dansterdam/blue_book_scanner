There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing text. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

mailed that letter.
All right, sure. It's simply Dearborn Observatory, or simply the Dept. 
of Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill. 60201.
I'll possibly be up in that area on vacation next summer.
Well, drop in by all means, and we'll talk about some other cases.
I'd love to come in and talk with you.  I have some relatives up in the
Illinois area and if I'm anywhere near by I will most certainly be in
touch with you and drop by and have a chat with you.
Good, and I will call on you if there are any cases that come up in your
general area.  How close to Atlanta is Albany?
I am about 175 miles from Atlanta.
Which direction? 
South, southwest.  I am approximately 80 miles from the Florida line and
maybe 75 miles from the Alabama line.  I'm down in the southwest corner
of the good old state of Georgia.  And we'd love to have you come visit
us here sometime.
Well, if you cook up, I shouldn't say cook up, wrong word, if a legitimate
case occurs down there again, maybe I will come down.
I'd love to have you. Thank you very much for your call Dr.
Well, thank you also, for your cooperation and I'll be expecting to hear
from you.
