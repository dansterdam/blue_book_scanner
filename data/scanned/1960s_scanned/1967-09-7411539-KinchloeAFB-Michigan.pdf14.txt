The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but rather seems to be a Fahrenheit temperature scale chart with a grid of numbers and lines. This chart was likely used as a reference or tool in the investigation and documentation of UFO sightings.
