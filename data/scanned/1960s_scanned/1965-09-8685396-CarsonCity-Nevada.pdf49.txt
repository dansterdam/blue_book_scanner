Air Force Investigator
Sky Sights Excite Big Area
By Jack Taylor
The weather bureau, said meteorologist had contacted the weather bureau and Tinker Air Force Base had reported strange objects in the sky over Oklahoma City Monday.
The objects, which were seen before dawn Monday, were reported over Oklahoma City and surrounding areas. Later, spokesmen from the Oklahoma City police said they also received several reports of the sightings.
A weather bureau spokesman explained the objects were reported as "targets", meaning they appeared on weather radar screens, but were not jets or other aircraft. He added that the "targets" were scattered over a wide area.
The brilliantly-colored objects were reported over an area ranging from Chickasha, Shawnee, Tulsa and Enid to Lawton and Altus, the weather bureau said.
The Lt. Gov. says he wasn't "concerned" and the reports came from reliable persons, but he couldn't explain the sightings.
Several state officials either confirmed the sightings or said they had received many reports of them. One civilian UFO investigator said he received reports of the incidents from various Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona air force bases.
An Air Defense Command spokesman at Tinker Air Force Base said the incidents were not under investigation there. He said the objects were "nothing unusual" and that his office had no further comment.
