2. Inquiry revealed that at 2056 hours, 26 August 1967, the Security Police Division, MCCV, received several telephone reports from concerned citizens; however, no one at the time was able to locate the objects. As a possible stimulus for those reported sightings, a newspaper article #SR183 035854 dated 25 August 1967 in the Sacramento Bee could be considered.
