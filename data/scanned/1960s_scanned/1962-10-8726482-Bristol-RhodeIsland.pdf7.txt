BRISTOL, RHODE ISLAND 20 October 1952 PLASTIC
Two youths, age 11, informed their science teacher at school that they had observed a strange object falling from the sky on 5 October 1952 with a parachute-like descent, and landing in a sand about 20 ft from them. One of the youths claimed that he touched the object and said it was cold. The weather bureau at Providence, Rhode Island, analyzed this and concluded that the object was then turned over to the Air Force for analysis. The samples were identified as light colored plastic objects about 2 inches in diameter, and were considered to be the plastic from balloons, probably from the manufacture of inexpensive toy balloons made of polyethylene. The appearance of these samples indicate strongly that they are the result of the separation of plastic forms used in the manufacture of these toy balloons under the proper atmospheric conditions and condition. The materials named above are all common and widely used plastic materials. There have indicated that more of these samples have been reported to space environments.
The material was compared with known waste material from extrusion processes of industries in the local area utilizing nylon, etc, in the manufacture of limited wire and cable, and found to be of similar appearance and consistency.
