Dear Sir:

In reply to your letter which was dated on 21 Jan. 66, I'm sorry to inform you that due to poor communications, I was unable to get the address of the variable star observers association on the Nurbin at 17 Jan. 66 and was unable to relay this information to your staff. I would appreciate being able to present this data as it may be of assistance, but I hope it won't cause you and your staff inconvenience.

I would appreciate being kept informed as to future occurrences. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Hector E. Quintanilla, Jr., Lt Col., USAF
