FIELDS

C3-F PAINS CAUSED BY GENERAL INFECTIONS

Observations of the fields of force have been made and as a result the field patterns ot' the human body have been analyzed and charted, These fields appear to be disturbed in certain diseases and infections. During general infections, there appears to be a decrease in the intensity of the fields, particularly over the infected regions. This decrease seems to be proportional to the severity of the infection, and when the infection is cleared up, the field returns to normal.

BIRTH CONTROL CHEAPEST
It appears that birth control can be cheapest of all controls. The annual birth rate of 20 in the United States costs the government about $6,000,000,000 annually! A very large percentage of this cost could be saved if all births were controlled and planned.

WEATHER COMPUTER FEES
FOR NON-PROFIT USE

WITH THE RAPID development of weather information and its increasing importance, especially to the shipping industries, the Weather Bureau has been forced to establish a new schedule of fees for weather data and forecasts supplied commercially. However, non-profit organizations such as educational institutions, libraries, and other non- commercial groups will still be able to obtain this data and service without cost.
