AFSWHC Scouting Group. State Agencies Join For Science Aerospace Education Conference

Three hundred outstanding New Mexico high school science and mathematics teachers were special guests of the AFSWHC Scouting Group of the Air Force Special Weapons Center, Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, at a conference on aerospace education conducted 3-8 April 1961.

The conference began with keynote addresses by Dr. Emile Zuckerkandl, Chief, Aeromedical Research Laboratory, Aerospace Medical Division, and Dr. H.C. Alexander, Chief, Armament Research and Engineering Division, AFSWC. They covered scientific and technical aspects of the space program and the Air Force mission in space research. 

Later in the week, the group visited the Test Pilot School, the Special Weapons Center, and other facilities which were the subjects of presentations by key military and civilian speakers. The program was designed to acquaint the teachers with the latest developments in aerospace science and technology, and to motivate them to incorporate aerospace themes into their regular school curricula.

The conference was climaxed by a banquet and an address by Mai. Gen. Wendell Kelley, commanding, AFSWC. General Kelley stressed that education is the key to the future of our nation's space program. He pointed out the need for competent scientists, engineers, and technicians to staff the ever-increasing number of jobs created by the expanding space program.

The AFSWHC Scouting Group is the education arm of the Special Weapons Center, which is the Air Force's principal laboratory for research and development of special weapons and associated equipment. The group conducts numerous educational programs and field trips throughout the state which are the highlights of the science curricula in many New Mexico high schools.
