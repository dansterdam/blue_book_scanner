The photographic analysis revealed the following information: The object (9 to 10 feet in diameter) possessed the sane appearance like an ordinary aircraft, except for a few differences noted. The shape of the object was round, with indications of a raised dome. Edges were indistinct, and the object appeared to be illuminated. The white light color contrasted with the dark background. The object possessed a similar brightness throughout its circumference, without noticeable variations. Its movement was described as hovering, with no specific directional trend indicated. The conclusion was that the object was observed and photographed.
