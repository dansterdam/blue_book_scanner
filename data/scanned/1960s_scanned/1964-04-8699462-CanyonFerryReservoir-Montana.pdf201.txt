Dear Sir:

I am writing to you about an incident that occurred on March 24, 1964, near the Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana. 

On that date, my son and I were fishing near the reservoir when we observed an unusual aerial object. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and was hovering silently over the water. As we watched, the object suddenly accelerated and climbed rapidly out of sight.

I am aware that the Air Force has an ongoing investigation into unidentified flying objects, and I felt it was my duty to report this incident to you. I would be more than happy to provide any additional information or details that may be of assistance to your study.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Pat Chaffee
