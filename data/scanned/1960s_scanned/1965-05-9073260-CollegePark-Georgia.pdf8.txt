Transcribing the text from the image:

"we were quiet. The 4th watched and discussed it as long as it was in sight. The objects moved at a fantastic rate of speed. then about two and one half minutes we watched it disappear. Its path was watched to the end though it followed a zig zag course while visible until it was too far away to observe. It seemed to be about 30 feet long and did not appear to have any lights or propelling devices. An strange materialistic body down nearer than the sky above but not nearer the ground. It moved from us and receded in the distance. 

P.S. We were not imagining things.
It was the last day of school and we were well, the last thing we would have thought about was "flying saucers".
I have enclosed a questionaire from the book "Flying Saucers from Outer Space" and a photograph from a magazine which I like the object we saw and I have 20 20 vision."
