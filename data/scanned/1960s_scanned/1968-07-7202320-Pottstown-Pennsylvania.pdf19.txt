k. Comments: The observer admitted the only possibility was a weather condition... Since this report was three days late in being received by this office, the chances of making an actual determination are slight. However, a local constable was notified of the sighting and told that the Air Force did not cooperate with Mr. [REDACTED]. I recommend that follow-up action be taken as far as possible to assure Mr. [REDACTED] we are interested in this matter and would appreciate any further information he might have.
