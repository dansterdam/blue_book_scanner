WHEN READING MY SIGHTING REPORT AND NARRATIVE I FEEL IT WAS NOT AN ORDINARY AIR CRAFT OR STELLAR OBJECT.IT WAS VERY CAREFULL Y STUDIED AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY BETWEEN THE CLOUDS.IT WAS DEFINETLY NOT A NORMAL AIRCRAFT OR STAR. I THINK THE OBSERVER COMPLETELY DESCRIBED HER SIGHTING. THERE CAME MORE MOVEMENT THAT LOOKED LIKE IT TURNED OR ROTATED WHEN IT LOST ITS SPEED AND ALTITUDE.IT JUST HOVERED AT A LOW LEVEL.THERE IS NO DOUBT IT WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL AND ATTRACTED A LOT OF ATTENTION WHEN IT APPEARED. THESE ARE JUST MY OWN PERSONAL IMPRESSIONS OF THE SIGHTING.
