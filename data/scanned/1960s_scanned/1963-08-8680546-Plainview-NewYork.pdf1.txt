PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP: August 1963
2. LOCATION: Plainview, New York
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Four
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 Seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: South
8. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes [ X ] No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [ ] Yes [ X ] No
CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION. Time of day/night not included. If sighting made during night and witness estimation of size is consistent with a close object, that pattern of report suggets BIRDS as the probable cause. Since the report is over 2 years old, it is not feasible to complete an analysis.
