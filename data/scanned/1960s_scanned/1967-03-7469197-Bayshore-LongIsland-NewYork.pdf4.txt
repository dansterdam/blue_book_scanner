There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a scanned document containing text only.

Now I have to tell you of two strange details connected with this "thing" so bear with me as it may be a little difficult to explain on paper.

As I said, the object traveled in a straight line. From where we stood observing it, we were facing directly East. This I know because that is where the sun comes up. The object had just passed this point, (where the sun rises), when from the bottom and I could almost swear the very center of the bottom fell a very small light of some kind. This was white and I mean small in comparison to the large object. It fell straight down for about the count of three and seemed to wink out.

At this point, the large object began to dim very rapidly and it seemed to ark up and back, (this is hard for me to say for sure, though). The dimming lasted for about five to eight seconds of time, then faded completely.

Now comes strange detail number two. The lights had just gone out when seconds later, (maybe three), they came back on again fully bright. This full brightness lasted about two or three seconds more and then began to dim again until it faded out completely, not returning anymore. Again as the object was dimming the second time, it seemed to make the same arking movement as it appeared to do the first time it began to dim.

FIND: From the time I first saw it until the second fading of the lights, a total of about fifteen minutes had elapsed. I guess, not too roughly, from 7:15 P.M. to 7:30 P.M.

I might add, there was no sound that we heard at any time. And, one more thing which my eleven year old said when she saw the picture. There is a rod or something at the tip of the thing, and my daughter said this, too, had a similiar rod at the back end on which she saw a red light.

Well, that is all, I've done my duty. My conscience is clear.

Sincerely,
