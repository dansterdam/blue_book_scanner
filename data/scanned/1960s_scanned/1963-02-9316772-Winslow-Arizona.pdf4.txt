NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)                   2 February 1963
ROBERTSVILLE, OHIO

ROBERTSVILLE, OHIO:(2 miles south) 2/2/63
TIME: 4:00 TO 4:30 PM - A husband and wife watched an object moving VERY SLOWLY and erratic. It was first 100 feet from the ground, then very bright bluish white light flashing irregularly and some times it would submerge in darkness. This object shaped like an egg. There were no sounds. We called the Akron-Canton Airport, they had no information on it.
