Flying Saucers' Visit Central Missouri Area
"Though the 'saucers' observed in this area, mostly at night, have been described as circles - as 'flying saucers' are conventionally depicted - the vehicles involved. A spokesman at the University of Missouri, in Columbia, reports that they have reportedly resembled giant diamonds, pear shapes, or rectangles in actual observations. While 'circles' may be an approximate description, it does not seem accurate for all the vehicles involved.

Some of the details reported are: The vehicles are silent, except for a jet-like sound as they move through the air. In some instances, a bright light at the rear of the craft is reported, and described as 'a ring of fire'. One eyewitness reported observing through binoculars at a range of 200 yards that the craft appeared to be about 50 to 70 feet in diameter. Another reported seeing 'thousands' of the objects moving swiftly, almost vertically, and at great speed. The flights have sometimes extended over a period of 2 to 3 hours.

Though the lights observed can be seen by the naked eye, in most cases they have been observed through binoculars, telescopes, and camera equipment. Numerous reports have come in from trained observers such as a former congressman, farmers, students, and other residents of the area. Even as long ago as 1897, there were reports of strange aerial phenomena in that part of Missouri.

Many scientific and other experts have stated that there is no evidence, to date, under scientific analysis, that would indicate the objects are extraterrestrial in origin. The University of Missouri has stated that there is no laboratory evidence to support the existence of 'flying saucers' and that the phenomena can be explained in conventional terms."
