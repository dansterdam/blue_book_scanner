AUSTRALIA
UFO BUZZES CAR
From the 17 August 1955 edition of
the Northern Territory News, given to
us by Mrs. A. Lawrence of
Northern Territory Pensioners Union, Australia.
The following is the story of their
experience with a U.F.O. on the night
of 27 Jul 55, Carnavon, Australia.  
It was 7.55 p.m. on July 27, about 70
miles south of Carnavon at the southern
end of the North-West coastal road. Mr. and
Mrs. A. Lawrence were returning to their
home in Carnarvon. A bright green object
seemed to dive straight toward their vehicle. It appeared to be
about 30 feet or so in diameter and there
appeared to be portholes or lights around
its edge, and a sort of central light. It made
a high-pitched whining sound and a
red-orange glow lit up the interior of the
car when the object was close. It stayed in
that position for about half a minute,
then shot away at tremendous speed out
of sight. Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence watched
it through their rear window as it went. The
object did two slow circles around the car
and then went straight up and out of sight
in about 5 seconds. It made no sound as
it went up. They are both certain that
this was no aircraft or any other normal
object. If it had been an aircraft it would
have been seen to land or take off in the
area. It came close enough for the
Lawrences to see details of shape and
lights, and they felt the warmth of the
red-orange glow in the car. So they are
convinced that it was a genuine UFO.
