Flying Objects Puzzle
North Georgia Residents
Persons in South Georgia who reportedly saw strange objects in the sky early last week are not alone, it appears.
Residents of the North Georgia area were also puzzled about what they saw in the sky early last week.
Last Monday a Toccoa, Ga., woman said she saw a strange object streaking across the sky about 11 p.m. She described it as a brilliant glow and an elongated object.
A number of Gainesville, Ga., residents also reported seeing a strange object in the sky early Thursday morning of last week.
Several persons in the Toccoa and Gainesville areas said they saw an elongated object with a brilliant glow moving rapidly across the sky.
The object was seen about 4 a.m. and witnesses said it appeared to be changing color. A number of persons in Elberton, Ga., also reported seeing the strange object.
The next Tuesday night, one week later, little Patty Upchurch came running into the house in what her father described as "a state of panic." She and a friend had been in the back yard and had seen something strange in the sky.
