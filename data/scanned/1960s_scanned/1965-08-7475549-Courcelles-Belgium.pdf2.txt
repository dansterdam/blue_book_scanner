There, I had asked the Good Lord in a prayer to see a flying saucer
And around 9 hours and 54 minutes, I was brutally thrown from my sleep by an unknown force. I was so afraid that I was shaking like a leaf. Upon waking up, I saw the dazzling object outside and acting on an interior solicitation, I was pushed to go to the window and I had visions, for example, on the forthcoming brutal disappearance of certain financial people by the Lady President of the United States.
