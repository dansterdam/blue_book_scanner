10 JUN 68 
NCIC

I observed these balloons at 2210 hrs Monday June 10 -- (My G-D, I hope they were the balloons). In case you have any cases come up for comparison, my sighting follows:

I was standing in the yard at ________ looking directly south. The temperature was 72 - 75, humidity very high, very hazy, with a high misty overcast. Only objects visible were jupiter, very hazy, and the full moon, rising very low, and very dim.

I noticed a star-like object rising slowly out of the South, heading North. It was about 5-10 degrees above the horizon, magnitude, and a steady white light. Its motion was slow and continuous, about comparable to 1/10 the speed of an aircraft at 20-30 thousand feet.

When this object had risen to about 20 degrees above the horizon, it began a course change, continuing on a course roughly parallel to the horizon. Then it slowed, finally remaining stationary high in the E. Then it began a slow descent, finally disappearing with an apparent upward motion in the NW.

At intervals of about 5 minutes, three other objects followed, covering the same path across the sky; the only difference being the last three objects did not blink. All objects continually drifted back toward the South and faded.  

These objects definitely could have given the impression that they were under positive control.
