Subject: First hand UFO report 1963 - sighting
March 1966 -

Gentlemen:

The attached is a UFO sighting report for your files.

Bright light streaked the extremely clear and object.
At its overhead and low horizon. Approached the Ground. 
Washington and San Fernando [down?] better ? but I do recall the other details for better than the date.

I have delayed this report purposefully (unsuccessfully) to have an occasion call for an answer on the phenomenon because delayed because of the confidentiality of the Air Force is studying the same time.

The report is self-explanatory. I would like to add the object moved quite slowly and changed from a point source to a larger irregular shaped light before disappearing below the horizon. I do have some additional details but do not wish to provide them at this time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
