POULTRY BREEDERS
MAYSVILLE, KY.
February 18, 1963

Dear Sirs:

On the night of February 11, 1963, my wife and I witnessed a very unusual aerial phenomenon over Maysville, Kentucky. It was approximately 8:25 P.M. EST when we first observed the object in the southern sky. It appeared to be very high in altitude and was traveling at a high rate of speed in a northeast direction. The object was glowing with a bright orange-red color and appeared to be cigar-shaped or elliptical in form. The glow seemed to be entirely self-luminous, without any visible exhaust or contrail.

After observing the object for approximately one minute, it suddenly accelerated to an extremely high speed and disappeared from view in a matter of seconds. Its speed was far in excess of any known aircraft. We were quite amazed and puzzled by this unusual sighting.

I would appreciate any information or explanation you might be able to provide concerning this aerial phenomenon. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,
