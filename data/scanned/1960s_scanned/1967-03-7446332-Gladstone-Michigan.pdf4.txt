This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

The text on this page is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  4 May 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This object that attitude-bearing and moving about made us realize this was not a star or aircraft of any kind that we were familiar with. And the fact that it could float motionless for a time and almost without any other shape or motion, seems only a little bit peculiar to military evaluations.
