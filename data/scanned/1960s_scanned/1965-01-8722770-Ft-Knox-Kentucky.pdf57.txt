The image contains a sketch or drawing that appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The sketch shows a diagram with angular lines representing the sighting of an unknown object or objects. There is also an inset image of what appears to be a compass or sun symbol.

Text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please mark an "A" on the object drawn, to show where the object first appeared to you. Mark a "B" on the object to show where it was when you last saw it. Please mark a "C" on the compass, where you first saw the object.
If there was MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
