Bellevue, Ohio
November 18, 1960

The capsule came into view about 10:30 p.m. and was visible for about 15 minutes. The object was a bright silver color and the shape was round. It appeared to be about the size of a large basketball when viewed from the ground.

The object was moving very slowly and quite low over the ground, only about a hundred feet or so up. It gave off a bright glow but there were no flashing lights or other unusual features. The object appeared to be solid and not transparent.

After a few minutes, the object began to ascend slowly and then moved off to the east at a rather rapid speed, disappearing from view within a few seconds. There was no sound associated with the object at any time.

There were two witnesses to the event, the writer and his wife. Careful observation failed to reveal any aircraft, balloon, or other conventional explanation for the object. It did not appear to be a satellite or any other known type of aircraft.

The writer is a reasonably careful observer who has seen many airplanes, satellites, and other aerial phenomena. This object was unlike any he has ever seen before and does not fit the description of any known type of aircraft.
