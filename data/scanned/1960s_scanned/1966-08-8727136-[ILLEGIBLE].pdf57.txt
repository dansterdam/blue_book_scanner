The image contains a diagram with instructions for a UFO sighting sketch. The diagram includes a compass rose, angle markings, and instructions for the viewer to imagine themselves at the point shown and draw the object's movement and location. There is also a section asking the viewer to draw a picture showing how multiple objects were arranged.

The text output from the OCR process is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Three
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
