11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer was a road when she noticed a group of lights that were "white, yellow, orange, and blue in color". The lights moved and changed direction rapidly. The lights would abruptly vanish when the observer would look away.
The description of the object could fall in the category of "unusual aerial phenomena" such as ball lightning. The object could not have been attributed to any known astronomical or meteorological phenomenon in a lack of data to substantiate them.
