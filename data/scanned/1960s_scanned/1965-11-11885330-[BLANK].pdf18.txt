The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing equipment and storage plans.

to collect all the obtained information, we have decided to have 
on-board storage in digital form, on magnetic tape. It will be very useful to 
include the possibility to mute, from the ground, on some parameters: gain and 
time constant of the amplifier, scanning speed, order to skip part of the pre- 
recorded program, to give some examples. To make it possible, a sufficiently 
good telemetry will be necessary, permitting to "waste" immediately the spectrum 
and associated with ground-command facilities.

The total weight of the equipment will be of the order of 1200 to 1800 lbs 
and we hope to be ready for a first flight in autumn 1966.
