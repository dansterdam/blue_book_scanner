The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The craft was circular, like a doughnut or cookie, and very large. The object appeared to be hovering over a wooded area and was still glowing, giving off a brilliant light. The object was disc-shaped, and appeared to have an open center. To the observer it looked like the lights around the outside were rotating. After a short time, the object suddenly accelerated and shot away, disappearing."
