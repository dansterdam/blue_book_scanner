August 17, 1960
Pikes Peak Ranger Camp
On August 17th at approximately 5:00 PM, I sighted up in the Northeast sector of the sky some very strange objects. They appeared to be approximately 5 to 10 in number, traveling in a diagonal pattern, and climbing steadily higher and higher. Their formation was not consistent. The objects appeared to be round and silvery in color. After observing them for about 5 minutes, suddenly one of the objects began to drop rapidly and erratically downward. It seemed to dive and swoop and then level off again. Another object suddenly accelerated and took an abrupt turn to the right. The remaining objects continued on their diagonal course climbing higher and higher until they disappeared from sight. This is as accurate a description as I can give. I hope this report will be of assistance.
