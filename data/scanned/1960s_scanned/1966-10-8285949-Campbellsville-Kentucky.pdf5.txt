Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This replies to your letter of October 13, 1966 concerning the possibility of a satellite or other similar space debris observed to the north 550 west on a northerly heading. This object appears to have been visible from your area. 

It is possible that you observed this particular satellite. However, without a more definitive identification, which you would provide by detailing the time, direction, and other characteristics in what direction did the object appear to be heading?

This additional information would be most helpful in making a final evaluation on your sighting. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
