Emmett Boys Take Flight In Fear of Flying Saucer

Two Emmett boys are certain beyond doubt that they beheld a peculiar flying object in the Boise basin last Wednesday. The object, which they had not seen for some 15 or 20 minutes, suddenly appeared over their shoulders and large heads.
The photographic proof with a small "swinger" camera is not very clear on details, but shows the object in question, which the boys describe as a "flying saucer." It is a disc-shaped luminous object, quite visible as a terrestrial object.
Told their parents and others here who believe them implicitly, the boys, about 10 to 11 years old, said the object was about the size of a basketball and moved swiftly at an altitude of 6,000 to 8,000 feet near Emmett, about 25 miles northwest of Boise.

An Overnight Hike
The boys had set off on an overnight hike and were somewhere between Emmett and the Payette River, about 15 miles from Emmett, when the object suddenly appeared. They stared at it for about 10 to 15 minutes, they said, and then it began to move away and disappeared.
The boys, who are identified, but whose names are not used here, had been hiking and camping for some time and had no thought of making a hoax. What they saw, they believe, was a flying saucer - a real one - and they were frightened by the experience.
They told their parents, who in turn told others here, and the saucer sighting was reported to authorities. This is the story of the two Emmett boys who encountered a flying saucer and were frightened by the experience.

FLYING SAUCER: Two Emmett boys are convinced they saw this peculiar, luminous object in the sky while on an overnight hike near Emmett. The disc-shaped object was estimated to be about the size of a basketball.
