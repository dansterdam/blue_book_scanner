Text from the document:

The case here identifies the features generally on the drawing but we have no visual record of the UFO. The object was described as being luminous and changing in color from red to green and white. It appeared to be elliptical in shape, and was observed for several minutes from 11:15 p.m. to 11:20 p.m. on August 6, 1960 in the vicinity of Winchester Bay, Oregon.

The object was first sighted by four individuals: Mr. A, Mr. B, Mr. C, and Elizabeth, a young girl of 12 years old. Mr. A was the first to see the object and call the attention of the others to it. The object was described as being luminous and changing in color from red to green and white. It appeared to be elliptical in shape.

The object was observed for several minutes, from 11:15 p.m. to 11:20 p.m. It was first seen in the northwest, then moved to the west, then to the southwest. It remained fairly stationary in the southwest for a period of time. The witnesses estimated the size of the object to be about 1/3 the size of the full moon. No sound was heard.

The case is listed as Unidentified.
