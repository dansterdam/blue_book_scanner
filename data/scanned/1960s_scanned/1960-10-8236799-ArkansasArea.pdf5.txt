The HANOVER "BALLOON" 
By George C. Capoville

The story of a famous Unidentified Flying Object sighted over Hanover, New Hampshire, on July 19, 1950, has been a subject of controversy and speculation for many years. It has been described as one of the most puzzling and dramatic UFO cases on record. The facts, as they are known, reveal a strange and unexplained aerial phenomenon that has defied satisfactory explanation to this day.

On the evening of July 19, 1950, hundreds of persons, including police officers, saw a brilliant white light in the sky over Hanover, New Hampshire. The light appeared to be about the size of a basketball and was hovering at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. At times it displayed a pulsing or flashing quality, and observers noted that it seemed to change colors, fading from white to orange, then to red. The phenomenon was first sighted at about 9:00 p.m. and was observed for over two hours, finally disappearing from view around 11:20 p.m.

Numerous attempts were made to establish the true nature of this strange aerial visitor. It was tracked on radar, photographed, and even pursued by a military jet interceptor. None of these efforts, however, provided a satisfactory explanation. The object remained unidentified and the subject of intense speculation and debate.

This case has been the focus of much study and analysis over the years. It is considered one of the most well-documented and puzzling UFO incidents on record. The Hanover "Balloon" remains an enduring mystery, a reminder of the limitations of our understanding of the world around us and the need to remain open-minded and curious in the face of the unknown.
