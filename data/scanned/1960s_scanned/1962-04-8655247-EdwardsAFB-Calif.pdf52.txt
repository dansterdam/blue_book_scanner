JOHN GLENN AND HIS DAY OF MIRACLES

Still a pilot, John Glenn, was the "Flying Marine" who became the third American to orbit the earth. He was not only the first American to orbit the earth, but also the first astronaut to make an emergency landing at sea and the first to hoist a pinned-in pilot of a disabled plane into his own cockpit. 

Glenn's first orbital flight came on February 20, 1962 when he circled the earth three times in his tiny Mercury capsule named Friendship 7. His heart pumped steadily under the pressure and several times he almost blacked out from the intense G-forces, but he completed the flight.

In 1959 he entered Muskingum College, Ohio, and became a Marine Reservist on the football team. He soon ended most other activities to concentrate on flying. His first solo flight was in a Piper Cub operated by the Navy's program for civilians at Port Columbus, Ohio. In 1941 he joined the Marines and thereafter rose to the rank of Colonel in the Marine Corps. 

During World War II and the Korean War, Glenn flew long hours and displayed great skill. But it was his flight in 1962 that brought him worldwide fame and recognition. However, less known is his exploits as a fighter pilot and daring rescuer during the wars.
