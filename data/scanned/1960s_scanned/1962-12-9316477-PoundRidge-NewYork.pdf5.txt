Gentlemen:
Enclosed is a clipping taken from the Wilton Bulletin of December 19, 1962. I thought it might be of interest to you to know I also sighted the same object from Wilton at 5:32 P.M. December 14th, falling in a southeasterly direction toward the town of Weston, Connecticut. Very truly yours, - name redacted -
