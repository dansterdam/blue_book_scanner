On Jan. 6, 1965, at approximately 6:45 pm EST, I observed an object in the sky that appeared to be a UFO. It was sighted about 2 miles north of Pleasant Hill, Ohio, on Ohio Route 48 while I was driving my car.

The object was hovering at an estimated altitude of about 1,000 ft. and was about 200 ft. in diameter. It was white in color and was emitting a bluish-white glow. The object remained stationary for about 2-3 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and made a vertical ascent at high speed, disappearing from view within 7-10 seconds. There was no noise associated with the object.

The weather at the time was clear with visibility of about 10 miles. I had a very good view of the object for the entire time it was in sight. This incident was reported to the Air Force MATS detachment located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio, the next day.

I have no other comments other than a complete and thorough investigation of this incident should be made.
