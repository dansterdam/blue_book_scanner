The letter describes the size, brightness, and movement of the UFO, but does not provide any visual depiction.

Dear Sir:

I wish to report a U.F.O. sighting on July 31, 1968 at 9:50 PM on Deweyville, Texas. Its size was similar to various stars. It gave off a whitish-blue light and was as bright as a star of the first magnitude. My father said it was moving in a north or south-south-east direction and we could not estimate its speed. We lost sight of it after a few minutes later.

Yours truly,
