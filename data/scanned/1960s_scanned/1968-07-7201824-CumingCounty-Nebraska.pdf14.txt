Kalashnikov built a high-frequency induction magnetometer in 1944. This began a active research program on the flux changes produced by the earth's magnetic field. He constructed a 200-turn and a coil of insulated wire of several meter turns attached to a fluxmeter which actuated a recorder. The fluxmeter was constructed to measure changes in the magnetic flux as small as 10^-5 oersteds. He permitted detection of fluxes as small as 10^-7 oersteds.

The induced e.m.f. in the coil was proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux. In 1945 showed that the sensitivity of the method could be increased by a factor of 10^3 over that of the ordinary magnetometer. The flux of 10^-4 oersteds, 0.5 per cent of the earth's magnetic energy, would induce a voltage at the terminals which could be converted into a frequency shift for radio transmission.

Kalashnikov believes that in a region(?) for this to occur is to the appearance of a front through which magnetic field lines are abruptly upset. Although the disturbances observed on the ground, or a deviation of the compass needle, be a sign of the magnetic disturbance, Kalashnikov found that the induced e.m.f. in his magnetometer coil was a strong indicator of the visual motion of the disturbance. This frequently was seven to ten minutes in advance of any visual observation.

And produced a radio noise at a frequency of 1 - 3 kc/s. This electromagnetic radiation was not conducted but radiated into space. And conducted similar experiments with more sensitive equipment. These results were essentially confirmed radio observations from meteors and from - to -1 magnitude in the frequency range from 1 to 30 mc/s, suggesting that this disturbance correlation obtained by Kalashnikov meteors and further investigations.
