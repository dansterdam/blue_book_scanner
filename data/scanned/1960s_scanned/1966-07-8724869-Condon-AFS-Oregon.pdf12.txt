35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the investigation:
When first sighted, the object appeared in front and to the left up in the sky. It did not appear to be very high, but it seemed to be moving rapidly to the right. After it had moved a little to the right, it suddenly turned to the left at the intersection and it appeared only a little that came appeared as far as to move much like a star. It continued a little to the left and ahead of me for approx 5 miles, the distance from me stayed constant. After I went in to call home, when I came back out, the object was gone. The action was similar to the moving at first more to the left.
