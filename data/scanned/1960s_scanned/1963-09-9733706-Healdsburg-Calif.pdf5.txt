Dear Mrs. --,

This is in response to your recent letter in which you reported sighting an unidentified object in the vicinity of Healdsburg, California.

The object you sighted has all the characteristics of an "indirect" reflection on the camera lens, rather than an actual observed object. It appears this was likely caused by the intense brightness of the object, which caused it to leave a brief impression on the camera lens. This would explain why the object was invisible since it was only an artifact of the camera.

Sincerely,

MASLON M. JACKS
