"BUT I'M NOT QUALIFIED." Dana admitted, "I'M MORE INCLINED to think it was a UFO sighting." 
ALL STARTED last night when Dana, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Lacktis, pointed to a light in the sky. 
Both boys want to be astronomers and have geared their curiosity toward the sky.
"Dana, look over there," Vincent recalled telling Dana, "I've seen that before,"
Dana responded, "There's a light over there high as to be 10 miles above the earth. A part of it came down like a parachute,"
It seemed like it was burning and traveling pretty fast, faster than the speed of sound. It headed toward the earth, Dana said.
SCIENTISTS, Air Force spokesmen and others explained the thousands of flooded police and newspaper switchboards resulted from the fact that this was the most widely seen UFO incident in recent years.

The object was sighted over a wide area and observers are certain that it was not an experimental aircraft or satellite. The object changed in appearance as it was observed and was seen by numerous witnesses.
A 1952 report estimated that 500 million Americans have sighted what they believe were UFOs. Most of these sightings, however, could be explained as known aircraft or celestial phenomena.
The Air Force listed the object as a "probable satellite" and therefore a lot of people saw it.
STORY: REPORTS said the object turned from white to bright as it passed over the area.
