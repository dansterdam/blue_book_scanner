There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

TDDT/UFO (Mrs Quintanilla/Ato916/ms 13 Oct 67)
Radar Cheff 

Mr. *** Stevens Point, Wisconsin 54481

1. Reference your letter of September 13, 1967 in which you submitted an unidentified sighting. The sentry that you sent to the Aerial Phenomena Branch has been identified as radar cheff. This machine which dropped in military service is confusing radar operators as to the position of the plane. Stevens Point, Wisconsin, is a small town of Trust field.

2. We are returning your sample and also have included a copy of Project Blue Book which you may find interesting.

JAMES C. MAHATTY, Colonel, USAF
