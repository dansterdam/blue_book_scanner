We arrived a little after 2:00 am. At first it appeared to be a flat light in the distance, but as we approached, the light seemed to expand and take on a definite form. It was an oval object, 40-50 ft in diameter, with a dome on the top. There was a bright light on the bottom of the object which seemed to illuminate the ground beneath it. As we got closer, the light became less intense, but the object itself appeared to be metallic and reflecting starlight. It was hovering 50-75 ft above the ground, and as we drove closer, it moved off rapidly to the southwest, accelerating very fast. As it accelerated, it gave off a bright white light like a magnesium flare, and in a matter of seconds it had disappeared from sight. We followed it as far as we could, but it was gone. The night was clear, and there was no aircraft anywhere in the sky at the time. This is one of the most remarkable things I have ever seen, and I certainly have no explanation for it. I wish there had been some way to get a photograph, but it all happened so quickly that we didn't have time. I wonder if anyone else in the area may have seen the same thing?
