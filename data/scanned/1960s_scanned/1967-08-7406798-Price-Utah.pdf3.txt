TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

TEST/UFO (May Quintanilla/70916/ths/30 Sep 67)
UFO Observation, August 23, 1967
Shawnee, Kansas 66203
Reference your unidentified observation of August 23, 1967
which you reported in your recent letter.
1. As you indicated, the balloon in question is over thirty days old, we do feel that you possibly observed this balloon.
2. There have been numerous cases of plastic clothes bags being mistaken for balloons. The balloons in unusual sizes seen as UFOs may be plastic bags from five to fifteen minutes, and when the wind dies down to the point where the bag stops moving, it usually stays aloft from five to fifteen minutes and when the wind picks up again, the bag goes down or out and pieces of it may also be seen.
3. This is not an observation on fighting this, only a description of one of the more common causes of sightings this summer.
Enclosed is a DD Form 1396 which you can complete and return this office in the enclosed envelope if you wish the Air Force to investigate as your original report. We may be unable to act, however, if the report is not kept over thirty days.
GEORGE C. MANATT, Colonel, USAF
Director of Technology and Systems
