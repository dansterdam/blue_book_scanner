The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. There is a large compass-like diagram in the center, and two smaller sketch-like illustrations below it. The text at the top instructs the viewer to "PLACE A 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO".

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A DOT AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND THE DOT WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON.
