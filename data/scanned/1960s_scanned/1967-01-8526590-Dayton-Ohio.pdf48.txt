The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram or sketch. The diagram shows various shapes and lines, but does not contain any identifiable human faces or individuals. Since the image does not contain a human face, I will proceed to extract the text from the document as requested.

The text in the document reads:

"O form continued 
The direction it had been. BUT SAID THING MORE."
