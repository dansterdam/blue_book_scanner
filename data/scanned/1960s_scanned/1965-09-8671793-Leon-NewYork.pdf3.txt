1. We have received a letter from Mr. -- regarding an observation on the night of 6 Sep 1965. The following information is provided:  

2. The description of multiple lights is similar to an observation provided from the New England area to the "speedway" (refueling area) near Center, Indiana. This involved a flight of approximately 12 objects described as moving with a "jerking" motion. The observer reported that they were over western New York at the time of the report. The information provided in his letter was not included in the original letter. The weather included a mist or drizzle and high winds which could have been condition to attribute the sighting to the refueling operation on the limited data presented. However, the description is similar to a report with a Form 16* he sent to Mr. -- which he feels is not a plausible explanation.
