NEAR LANDING IN GEORGIA: A series of exceptional sightings of which a number occurred in Georgia during the summer of 1963.

This particular report concerned a sighting that occurred about July 8th. In the evening, the family was sitting on the porch when they noticed a strange object in the sky. It did not appear to be an airplane or any other known object. 

The object was moving slowly and noiselessly. It descended gradually until it was only about 50 feet off the ground. The object remained hovering for several minutes, illuminating the area with a bright light. 

Suddenly, the light on the bottom of the craft was turned on, apparently for the purpose of illuminating the ground below. After a short time, the object turned off the light and suddenly disappeared from the scene.

The object had no exhaust and moved silently. The green spotlight seemed to be focused upon the object itself, leaving no doubt in the minds of the witnesses that they were looking at a solid craft resting on or close to the ground. The witnesses, a family, reported a tingling sensation during the sighting and are of the opinion that the object may have had a damaging effect upon them.
