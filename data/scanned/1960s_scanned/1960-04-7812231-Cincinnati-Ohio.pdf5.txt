Dear Sirs:
I wish to report a sighting of some unidentified flying objects. I saw four such objects on the night of April 9, 1960 from 8:30 to 8:43 p.m. This was bright and thin objects flying slowly and disappearance behind cloud cover. The objects appeared and then disappeared again. The telephone number are at the end of this report.
At 9:30 p.m. I saw a red light in the sky stationary in the northeast. It was on for several minutes and then disappeared. Then another one exactly the same appeared and then disappeared again.
I am submitting this report as I feel these sightings were unusual and should be recorded.
Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
