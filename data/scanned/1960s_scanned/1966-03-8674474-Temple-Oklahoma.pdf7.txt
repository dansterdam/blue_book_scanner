18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Can't use match it head compensated - say 85' - it rest can support a sphere above the side. 

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects.
