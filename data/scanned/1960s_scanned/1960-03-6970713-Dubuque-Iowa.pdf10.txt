The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Quoting the text from the document:

"(A) Robert Hoffman, Airport Manager, Dubuque Municipal Airport: 'I have checked and no aircraft in the area at the time specified.'

(B) Michael Gladish, Public Relations, Boeing Airplane Company: 'Our ground observer program has checked most carefully. There is no record of any formation of three or more aircraft over there on March 4, 1950. Our jets are not scheduled for night flights ever and we have no record of any 707 formation flights over that area during the time in question.'

(C) G.W. Graves, Convair Division, General Dynamics Corp.: 'As far as we know, there were no Convair aircraft in the town of Dubuque, Iowa on March 4, 1950. Our best aircraft here in San Diego have delivered a few B-36's to Dakota Air Lines, but they are all accounted for.'

(D) A letter to Douglas Aircraft Company is, as yet, unanswered.

In closing, let us say that one cannot simply discount the opinions of a trained pilot and chief intelligence officer who feels that the objects were not aircraft, for experience shows that there were no aircraft."
