The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It seems to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report.

The text in the document is as follows:

The object was seen first by two persons, a husband and wife, around 10:30 p.m., while driving on a country road in southern Michigan. It was shaped like a disc, very bright, and emitted a yellowish, reddish-white and blue glow. It hovered several hundred feet above the ground. They said it appeared for about 15 to 20 seconds and then disappeared suddenly. 

Sightings by others in the area indicated the object was seen for a longer period, sometimes for a whole night. Generally there is no sound, except the typical sound of aircraft equipment. The witness seemed to be convinced of what they saw, and described the object as maneuvering in a most unusual manner, which could not be duplicated by any known aircraft.

The glow of the object seems to be a significant part of the description, and the fact that it apparently hovered for a considerable period, though not continuously over one location, would seem to rule out conventional explanations. When a precise measurement of the size can be made or when additional corroborating evidence is obtained, the scientific analysis may well provide an identification. However, in this case the report must remain unidentified.
