Dear Miss _____,

This is in response to your letter to the President concerning an object you and your friends recently observed.

We regret that we are unable to give you a more definitive explanation concerning this incident. The instructions have asked that I reply to your inquiry.

We believe that you very likely observed the passage of Satellite 1958 ALPHA 1 on July 29, 1964, as it appeared in the New York City area. This satellite is known as ECHO I and was launched on August 12, 1960 and orbits the earth at an altitude of about 630 miles above the surface.

Your interest in this matter is understood.
