SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

IT HAS A PEAR LIKE SHAPE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF HIS APPEARANCE. IT COMES AND LANDS AND TAKES OFF IN ANY DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING. 

IT COMES ANGULAR DIRECT FROM ABOUT AN ALTITUDE OF A CROWN HEIGHT, SUCH AS 6 FEET OR 8 FEET, AND IT COMES DOWN TO ABOUT 4 FEET, AND THEN IT GOES BACK UP AGAIN.
