The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a diagram and illustration related to a UFO sighting report. The diagram shows an illustration of the horizon and compass, as well as a handrawn drawing of the motion and path of the observed object(s).

Here is the text contained in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

90° 75° 60° 45° 30° 15° 0° 15° 30° 45° 60° 75° 90°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

TRAIL ROAD, STATION

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
