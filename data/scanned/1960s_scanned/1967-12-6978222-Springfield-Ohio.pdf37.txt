The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of UFO reports. The text on the page consists of a questionnaire or form with various fields to be filled out, such as "WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON?", "WHAT DIRECTION WERE YOU MOVING?", "HOW LONG WAS THE PHENOMENON IN SIGHT?", and others. The form appears to be used to collect information about a reported UFO sighting.
