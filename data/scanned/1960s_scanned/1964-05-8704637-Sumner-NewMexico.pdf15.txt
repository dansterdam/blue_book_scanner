Sussex, England
12 May 1964

From the "Major Night Observer of May 12": a "brilliantly coloured" unidentified object was sighted by three guests in the evening (May 12) hovering in clouds in the Ditchling area. The object "seemed to be moving very slowly and seemed to be very bright and defined and it seemed to grow dimly brighter and dimmer". The witness said "I would have recognized an aircraft and I have seen a satellite which was much smaller twice the size of the evening star and much brighter."

A spokesman at R.A.F. Tangmere said no unidentified objects had been reported.
