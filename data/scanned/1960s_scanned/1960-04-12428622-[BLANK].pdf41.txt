Text extracted from the document:

It appears to me that this would put things in a different light. I do not believe that anyone can doubt the importance to the armed services of an understanding of how reports like this get generated. For example, someday a report may be interpreted which will cause an ITEM to go flying across the oceans.

The Soviet government is extremely interested in these ITEMS, as part of the armed services is a rapidly growing concern. Certainly such surveillance crews must be informed on how reports of strange objects get generated, and, too, they must be aware of all types of natural phenomena astronomical, meteorological, radiological, etc. which in themselves can give rise to such reports.

This emphasizes again that such a panel might not concern itself with the UFO problem in general, but only with a few selected instances, and then entirely from the standpoint of a serious and calm study of the manner in which the reports were generated. Such a study might well yield valuable data not only in psychology and public relations, but in adding to our knowledge of atmospheric occurrences, and the many facets of physics.
