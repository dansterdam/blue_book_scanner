The letter discusses a visit by Dr. Dilbouille and Roland to NCAR, and mentions a balloon-borne experiment by the Belgian government to study the solar spectrum in the 1.2 to 5 microns region. The letter also mentions that NCAR telemetry and ground command facilities will be used to support this experiment, and offers to provide any additional information that may be needed.

30 July 1965.

Dr. W.O. ROBERTS
Director, National Center

Dear Dr. Roberts:

Dr. Dilbouille and Roland told me how instructive has been 
their visit to NCAR, and how good are the facilities of the Palestine Base.
As you already know, we are preparing now, with the support of 
the belgian government, a balloon-borne experiment to study the solar 
spectrum, at high resolution, in the 1.2 to 5 microns region. 

You will find, here enclosed, a brief report about these plans.
I officially apply to receive the assistance of NCAR to fly our gondola,
at your best conditions ? We actually hope to be ready for a first flight at
the end of this autumn 1965.

NCAR telemetry and ground command facilities will fulfill
perfectly our requirements, enabling us, in fact, to increase the flexibility
and the efficiency of the first planned instrumentation.

If this demand receives your attention, we will be pleased, of
course, to provide you any suitable additional information.

                        M. MIGEOTTE.

MM/jd.
