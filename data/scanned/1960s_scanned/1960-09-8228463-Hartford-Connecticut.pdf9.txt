Transcription of the text in the document:

"It was suggested that the material be presented and forwarded upon request to the National Aeronautics and Space Agency Washington DC Director T. Keith Glennan.

The deputy Director of the 2nd Fire Dept checked material with Geiger Counter and found no radioactivity.

- Trinity College, where a canvass of the campus was begun, in an effort to locate a professor who might have information as to the strange sighting. Several witnesses were interviewed on the case, however those questioned could shed no further light on the incident in question as to the said college, where some would seem to cast doubt at least on any satisfactory conclusion.

Said man was questioned, and thanked for his cooperation in this matter.
