We called the Miami County Sheriff and he gave us a copy of the report as he received it.

We contacted the control tower at Vandalia. Mr. Shumaker, the controller, looked in the log, and found no comments about any thing unusual. Neither the tower nor the airport knew anything about this incident. 

The two aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. At approx. 11:19 pm a DC-3 made its approach from the north. At 11:26 pm an Eastern Airlines DC-7 left Vandalia heading NW then N. At 11:29 toll:30pm an American 727 came along the approach and made its approach east of Van City. The two inbound craft would have been at about 1800 ft altitude and probably had their landing lights on. The types could have been between 1200 and 300 ft. and probably did not have landing lights on. DC, and the controller on duty at the time of the sighting.

There was no evidence that any landing occurred, either in the field or on the road. Galion and Zanesville counties testing showed no increase in radiation or other telltale signs as compared with other areas (office, etc.)
