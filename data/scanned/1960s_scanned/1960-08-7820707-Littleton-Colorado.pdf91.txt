Isn't it true that someone in the area at the time traveling through called in somewhere and reported more or less, confirming your reports of the same object? Yes, two people from San Francisco called today to report that they had seen the object in the area at that time as they were passing through on highway 80 E.

How many people would you say saw the object that you know of? We have no idea. There was at least 5 or 6 of us at that time. However, the people we talked to within 24 hours of reporting that they also saw the object. Of course, this happened and we were talking to some of the residents of the area and they said too that the also spotted the object. (narrator)

Well, gentlemen, since time is running out I would like to take the opportunity to say thanks for a day's work with press and with the office work and so forth. I would like to thank you a lot for taking the time and coming out here. To me this is a fantastic story. I think it is just fabulous and like you said, "I am glad you weren't in alone because it I were in the position I would feel the very same way." 

We have officer Scott and officer Carson here. Highway Patrol, Red Bluff Office.
