From the Sidnig Times of September 17, 1965, came the following report:
"A local family in the Graham's Town, Grahamstown, area on the night of September 17 saw a strange light in the sky. It was in the shape of a mushroom and was glowing. It was just like a silver or white balloon expanding and contracting in size, and appeared to be traveling at a very high speed, according to their account."
