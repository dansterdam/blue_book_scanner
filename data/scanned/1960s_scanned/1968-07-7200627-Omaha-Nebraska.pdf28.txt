TO THE CASE REPORT SERIAL 2, WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXACT COPY OF THIS REPORT, WAS REPORTED TO BE MISSING FROM THE BLUE BOOK FILES. 
RADAR TRACK STATION OBSERVANCES DURING FLIGHT TESTS AT NAS OMAHA, NEBR, JULY 7, 1968. TRACK SHOWN ON MAP CURVED DUE TO THE FACT THAT SCOPE WAS GREATLY MAGNIFIED TO PROVIDE BETTER RESOLUTION FOR ANALYSIS. IT IS APPARENT THAT THE OBJECT WAS ACTING IN A MANNER FOREIGN TO NORMAL AIRCRAFT OPERATION AND WAS FASTER AND MORE MANEUVER ABLE THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. THE UNUSUAL FLIGHT PATH AND MANEUVERS ARE TYPICAL OF MANY UFO REPORTS. NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT OR VEHICLE COULD MAKE THE FLIGHT PATH SHOWN. THE OBJECT HOVERED IN ONE POSITION FOR SOME TIME, THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND GAINED ALTITUDE IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. PILOTS REPORTED THAT OBJECT APPEARED SUDDENLY, MOVED RAPIDLY, AND THEN DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY, INDICATING ABILITY TO HOVER, ACCELERATE, AND TURN OFF LIGHTS OR BECOME INVISIBLE.
