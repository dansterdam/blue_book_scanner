The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   6   4   66
Day   Month   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Have since learned that several reliable observers also saw UFO which I clearly witnessed. It was clearly visible and distinct for several seconds, about 1/2 to 1 minute in time. There actually appeared to be several others simultaneously over the same territory. It did not resemble any conventional aircraft, and whatever propulsion system it employed was entirely unique, silently and quickly disappearing over the horizon.

Best saw it was only momentary at the same time and at about the same location as I did. Small, round, and quiet, and appeared to be stationary for a brief period of time before rapidly disappearing toward the northeast.
