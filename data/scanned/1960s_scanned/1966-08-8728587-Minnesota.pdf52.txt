Request for UFO Information and Sightings.

HQ USAF (SAFGDI) SEP 2 7 1966
Reference the attached letter from providing information on unidentified flying objects. The following is a suggested reply to his letter: 

a. It was most interesting to learn your views on probable causes of UFO sightings. As you point out, many such observations are merely a result of abnormal atmospheric conditions. Such an abnormal condition could have occurred the night of 16 August 1966 however, we cannot believe that this alone is the cause of your observation.

After conferring with the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, we find the object you described in your letter is a Rocket reentry observed tracking stations subordinate to Fort Churchill. This rocket reached an altitude of approximately 247 miles; at a time when low level clouds covered the area. This caused a variation in the color which changed to a violet. This was followed by and ending with a diminishing trail.

We wish to thank you for your interest in the UFO program and appreciate the information received from you.

FOR THE COMMANDER
