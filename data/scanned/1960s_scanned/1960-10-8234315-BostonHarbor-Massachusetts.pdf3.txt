The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a textual document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

Boston Harbor, Massachusetts, February 12, 1960
About 9:15 PM 

Flight or close to 20 minutes

About as bright as Polaris

True bearing apparently from compass bearing 6 degrees, plus or minus about two minutes

March to South

It would come around a degree and a half 

Sincerely,
