THREE HUGE UFOS PACE U.S. AIRLINER
Three enormous flying objects, computed to be about 1,000 feet 
in diameter, paced a U.S. airliner over the Gulf of Mexico last month, according to a first-hand report by an American flying officer on active duty in the U.S. Air Force.
The witness, whose name is withheld to protect his identity, reported the incident to NICAP through official channels. He stated he was copilot of the airliner at the time.
The incident occurred on Jan. 3, 1965, while the airliner was flying from Japan to the U.S. and was over the Gulf near the Florida panhandle. The witness said the three giant UFOs suddenly appeared, pacing the airliner at the same speed and altitude. The objects were about the size of the airliner, which was a four-engine type and measured 150 feet in length. The giant discs maintained their position off the wings of the airliner for about 10-15 minutes. The pilot and flight engineer also saw the UFOs. The witness said the UFOs appeared metallic and disc-shaped, with no visible means of propulsion. The discs suddenly accelerated to high speed and disappeared from sight. The witness made an immediate report when the airliner landed.
NEAR COLLISION REPORTED
The sighting was still being investigated by NICAP at press time. For reasons of security, the U.S. Air Force has not released the name of the pilot and flight engineer or the name of the airline involved.
The sighting occurred at dusk, Jan. 3, 1965, as a four-engine commercial airliner was flying over the Gulf of Mexico between Houston and Miami. An unidentified object was first reported by the pilot, and the flight engineer and co-pilot confirmed the sighting. The object paced the airliner for several minutes, at one point coming so close that the pilots had to take evasive action to avoid a collision.
The pilots reported seeing a black silhouette-like object, apparently metallic, which matched the airliner's speed and altitude. When the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view, the pilots were convinced it was under intelligent control.
The incident occurred near the Panama Canal zone. The military has been investigating the report, but no further details have been made public so far. NICAP has this report under investigation, and will publish further details when they become available.
