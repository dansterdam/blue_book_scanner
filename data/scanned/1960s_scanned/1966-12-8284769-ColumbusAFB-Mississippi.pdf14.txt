The image contains a hand-drawn sketch showing the direction of an object's movement. The text mentions that the observer was asked to draw a picture to show the shape of the object or its characteristics, such as wings, proportions, etc. The text also states that an arrow was placed next to the drawing to indicate the direction the object was moving.

The text found in the document is as follows:

1/32 of the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
