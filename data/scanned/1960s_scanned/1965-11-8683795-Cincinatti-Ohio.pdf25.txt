"Sighted for about 15 seconds, they stated moving at 150 miles per hour zig-zagging all over the sky. The object was large, appeared to be elliptical (sic) in shape, and emission of light (s or other) were observed distinctly. No sound was heard, but it was probably to high to be audible. The object was seen disappearing in a east (sic) to west direction.

If you have an option, a confirmation of this report is someoneexamine, would appreciate it.

P.S. This is a description of what is said to be a observation of 1963-8-5 or 6."
