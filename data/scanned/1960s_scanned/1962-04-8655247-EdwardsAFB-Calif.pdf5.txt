Record X-15 Flight Brings White Now
Event At SC: O. Rssrt M. White, s..sd

X-16 pilot, set a "white" aaw record during a flight on July 17. He soared to an altitude of 59,430 feet, far exceeding the previous altitude record of 54,200 set by the same plane in a flight last May 16.

His more obvious accomplishments
Included bauting the record for the highest speed yet attained by an X-16: 3,538 miles per hour. He also achieved the longest time of powered flight in an X-15 - 11 minutes, 16 seconds. And, as it had before, his flight provided important data for the X-15 research and development program.

The mission, originally scheduled for July 18. was successful beyond all expectations on July 17. Major White's previous best mark of 54,200 feet, set on May 16, thereby became obsolete.

The historic flight elevated Major White to a new stature as a pilot, placing him in the forefront of today's space age developments.

After the flight, with an attitude of 59,430 feet, Major White was flown to Washington, D.C. where he was greeted by President John F. Kennedy on the afternoon of July 18. The President and Mrs. White posed for photographers on the White House lawn.

On the same day, President Kennedy signed an executive order awarding Major White the Distinguished Flying Cross for his achievement during the flight. The ceremony marked the first time that an X-15 pilot had been so honored.

During the time of peak excitement
around his flight, Major White exhibited an almost complete indifference to the publicity and honors showered upon him. He remained modest and calm amidst the turmoil, his thoughts seeming to be concentrated on the continuing X-15 program and the problems yet to be solved.
