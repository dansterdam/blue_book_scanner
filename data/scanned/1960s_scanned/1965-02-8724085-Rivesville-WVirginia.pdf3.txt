SHERIFF SOUNDS WARNING

Richmond, Va. (AP) - February 3, 1965 - Three Disbelievers in flying saucers are about to encounter the reality of them at first hand.

Sheriff J. Joyner of Rockingham County, Va., says his office has received several reports of flying saucers and unexplained objects hovering in the sky. But anyone carrying firearms in the county without good reason, will be dealt with according to the law.

"If these things are real, and I think they are, we don't want to take any chances of someone trying to shoot them down. We've got the right to protect our lives and property, but if they're not hostile, we don't want to stir them up either," he said.

But for the record, a spokesman adds: "Our cases are never Continued for investigation. Continual re-investigation would be fruitless."
