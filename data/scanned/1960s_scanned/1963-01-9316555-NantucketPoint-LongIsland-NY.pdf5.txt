Transcription of the text in the document:

Wanted aspects a series of events, flying object and manoeuvres, all directions, no more than 2 minutes. At first lower down than before, not more than 2 or 3 feet, than go up again to an estimate level of 50 to 75 feet.
The object be steady no sign of any propeller or jets. Slowed as if motionless, then a sudden burst away in a direction almost straight up for maybe, may be three quarters of a mile. Then stopped, hesitated for a few seconds and moved slowly back over the same path.
There are 3 or 4 other persons who saw the object of the night with me and I have talked to them, they got the feeling of strangeness and wonder like I did. It was a bright object, much brighter than a star, almost like full moon size. We watched and watched until it disappeared from view, may be over 300 yards away, one of the most unusual sightings I have ever witness.
I did not hear any sound, and the object itself should have made some sound if it was mechanical. The object did not blur or flicker in anyway and the size seemed to remain the same. This is a well established fact and I did not want this to be overlooked.
