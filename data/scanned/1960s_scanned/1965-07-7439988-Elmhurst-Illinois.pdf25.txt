The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten report or document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

"whether they were successful in their quest. One official questioned whether or not the whole thing was stag-ed with intent to make some point or raise some questions. The object remained stationary, hovering, and then disappeared or moved so fast that it was lost to sight very quickly. It had the appearance of some kind of metallic or silver object, circular in shape and about the size of a hub cap. The witnesses were adamant that what they saw was a real and meaningful sighting. The persons making the report requested that their names not be used, as they feared ridicule or criticism for having made such a report. They were merely people with no particular interest or expertise in such subjects, but felt impelled to report what they had seen, since it was a highly unusual and inexplicable experience for them. It would seem that this report, like many others, merely adds to the general mystery and confusion surrounding the UFO phenomenon. There is little concrete and definitive information to be derived from it, but it is included in the file as one more example of the many reports which continue to come to the attention of Project Blue Book personnel."
