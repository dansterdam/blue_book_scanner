UAO'S UPPER TV RECEPTION

Volume 11 of the UFO reports
indicates in May, 1963 that on
the 15th of September, 1962,
several people watched an object "fly
across the sky and disappear over the
trees. This occurred around 7:30 p.m.
on the 15th of September 1962.

Two Airman Tom Looney, 19, said the
object flashing on and off like an aircraft light but it was many times bigger
and brighter and moving slower than a
plane. His friend informed his parents who
in turn informed their parents who spread the
word. A party of six persons journeyed
to Woodside Park Research Society headquarters
to investigate. The following is the
Information related here to Arthur J.
Rodeffer, editor of the Murfreesboro
newspaper reports. 

John Lanner added to his statement:
"The object was traveling in the sky
at a tremendous speed. We all lost it
for a few moments as the haze
covered it. I ran inside to the wife and told
her to come on out, that a flying saucer had just
flown over. When she came out and had a look she changed her
mind."

Doyle Grubbs, a truck driver from South
Nashville, said he was returning home about
that time and while the object was still flashing on and off brightly, the strange object moved over the trees and disappeared. During the 30 minutes it
was about, every TV set in Woodhesll
and South Nashville suffered temporary interference. Some persons reported a double picture, others only
lines and some saw just "snow".

newspaper reports. John Waters, 17-year-old student, saw two objects on Saturday night. One appeared first,
traveling in an arc but not stopping and
the second object came over a little
later and followed the same trajectory.
