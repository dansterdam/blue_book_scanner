Dear Major Quintanilla,

On the problem about the data (s), this is the triangular shaped object I saw on June 3, 1967. It might have a mistake on the data of another object. It seems fairly certain it was June 3, 1967, & my correction is to move the date forward direction (-).

I have goofed the direction, it was east.

Sincerely,
Mr. [REDACTED]
