Two mysteries
The Daily Mail of September 28 reports that an unidentified flying object was sighted over Corpus Christi, Texas, on the evening of September 19. Two students reported seeing a strange bright light in the sky, hovering and then darting rapidly away. The "object" appeared to be making a humming sound, and was seen for about 15 minutes.

A few days later, on September 23, another sighting was reported in the same area. This time two young men saw a "huge bright object in the sky" which appeared to be moving slowly and silently. It was in sight for about 10 minutes.

G.P. Brame, reporting the incidents, states that "both reports have the ring of truth about them." There has been no explanation from the authorities.
