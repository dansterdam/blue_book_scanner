Looked like amazing figures on the skyline from my backyard in San Luis Obispo, California. The objects were very clear and distinct and appeared to be triangular or V-shaped. The motion was very smooth and the objects would occasionally stop and hover, then continue on. The objects appeared metallic and were definitely not conventional aircraft or anything I had seen before. The size was difficult to estimate but they seemed quite large, perhaps 50-100 feet in diameter. The color was a silver/metallic hue. There was no sound associated with the objects.

21. HAVE YOU BEEN AFFECTED IN ANY WAY BY THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF? (ANIMALS OR MACHINERY IN THE VICINITY ALSO.)
