Dr. Wall stated that he and his wife were standing outside their home when they observed a light in the sky that appeared to be moving in an erratic manner. He stated the light appeared to be "hovering" and moving up and down and from side to side. Dr. Wall stated that he was able to observe the light for a period of about 10 to 15 minutes.

Dr. Wall stated that the light was yellowish-white in color and was about the size of a basketball. He stated that the light did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion and did not make any sound.
