Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Since writing you in regard to a probable error in the orbit I sent you, I have given considerable thought to the matter. In fact, the corrections for curvature and zenith distance are so enormous, thatthe tables for the letter are far from accurate when the object's present is practically on the horizon, and the longitude corrections are so great, that this case. Also what you are interested in is the path in the atmosphere. The heliocentric orbit I tried to calculate had no reality, and was indeed a waste of time. Also with corrections to radiant's position so great, in any case it would be most uncertain.

In view of these facts, I am asking that you destroy page 3 of my original paper, and substitute enclosed page 3. This will in no way make the paper less use for your purposes, and I.on mature consideration, will feel much more comfortable when the uncertain and wholly hypothetical case is suppressed.

I regret troubling you with these changes, but the present form will be much more suitable, and less likely for criticism.

Most sincerely yours,

American Meteor Society
