The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a map or chart. The map shows various flight paths and navigational information, but there is no photograph present in the image.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

FLIGHT PLAN
ATLANTIC - NEW YORK - LISBON
FLIGHT LOG
FLIGHT NO. P.S. 220 
DATE 8 SEPTEMBER 1962

This flight plan presents information about the flight path between Atlantic, New York, and Lisbon. The text includes details such as the flight number, date, and the route between the three locations. The map portion of the document shows various navigation lines and flight paths across the Atlantic Ocean.
