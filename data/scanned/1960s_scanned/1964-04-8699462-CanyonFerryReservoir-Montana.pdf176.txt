UFO form continued
Dear sir,- my daughter, a tiled 15 stopped in, telling me that while they were out in the yard they had seen a strange looking craft in the sky. It was about 40 feet in diameter, silver in color and perfectly round, with a dome in the center. It hovered without a sound for about 5 minutes, then took off at a great rate of speed, going straight up. The whole thing was witnessed by my daughter and son-in-law and several of their friends. They were quite excited and frightened by the experience.
I do not understand these things, but thought you should know about this. We have had no radar contacts or other unusual occurrences in this area that I know of, so this would seem to be an isolated incident, at least as far as this location is concerned.
I am concerned that more and more of these things are being reported. If they are from outer space, I hope their intentions are friendly. Do you have any information that would help explain or reassure concerning these matters? I would appreciate hearing from you.
Sincerely,
