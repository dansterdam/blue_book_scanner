The image appears to contain a handwritten report with diagrams and sketches, but no photograph. As an OCR system, I will now output the text found in the document:

Propulsion characteristics, as approximately determined for this apparent aerial phenomena.
1. Apparent static spin of object.
2. For the attitude - desire to point nose toward higher atmosphere - seems to suggest a gravity propulsion system.
3. The size view - would indicate the object to be a low mass, high fineness ratio vehicle, thus could explain ability to maintain hover from a very low power source.
4. Met typical physical sizes of known projects, but much more substantial internal structure - typical of advanced propulsion system.
5. The apparent disappearance or transition to some less perceptible state - could indicate use of gravitic shielding technology.
