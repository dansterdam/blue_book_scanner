The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains handwritten text, but no photograph. As an OCR system, I will proceed to output all the text found in the document:

Dear sir, 
would a note of the sightings of UFO in the area be of any use to you? If so, I would be glad to furnish any information I can regarding the many sightings that have been made here in the Memphis area during the past few years. No specific cases come to mind at the moment, but I would be happy to give you a brief rundown on some of the more interesting ones if you feel the information would be of value to you.

There have been several sightings of strange aerial phenomena in this area which have defied conventional explanation. These sightings have been made by reliable observers, including some with military and scientific backgrounds, and have been reported to the proper authorities. However, I am not aware of any definitive conclusions having been reached regarding the nature or origin of the objects observed.

If you feel the information I could provide would be of interest or assistance, please let me know and I will be glad to furnish whatever details I can recall. I would be most interested in learning of any conclusions or findings your agency may have reached regarding UFO activity in this region.

Sincerely yours,
