The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text in the image is handwritten and states:

"The sighting I have reported of the Unidentified flying object occurred at 3:30 PM, January 24, 1967, and it was about 3 minutes or less. It was of the same size and appearance as a school bus, and hovered about 100 yards above the ground for the entire time of the sighting."
