we were seeing something. Reliable report, of being a sighting of a few seconds duration. It seemed to be an unusual object, can't recall the exact shape, but it was brightly lit. Following us a disrepected some distance, and then move upwards at terrific speed, enough to practically disappear to our sight in just a few seconds. It was flying or a quiet, calm manner, no smoke, no flames, just a bright object moving at phenomenal speed. It is unbelievable my nephew, who observed it also, his story check exactly with mine. I am quite puzzled enough to wonder just what I have seen. All I can say it was an object high in the sky, moving with tremendous speed, far beyond the capacity of any aircraft of that day.
