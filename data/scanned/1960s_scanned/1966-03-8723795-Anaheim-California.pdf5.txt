Dear Sir,

Reference your recent letter addressed to the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., regarding an unidentified object information in your letter. The information is not sufficient for evaluation. Request you complete and return AFSD Form 164, and return it in the envelope provided.

We are also forwarding a copy of "Project Blue Book" which describes the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects. We hope that you will find this becoming interesting.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
