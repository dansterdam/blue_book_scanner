There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document containing detailed text.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

The text states:
This case appeared to be authentic, even though the description of the object was very sketchy. The witness was a good observer and related a credible account. He claimed the object was a brilliant light source that made no noise, and hovered for ten minutes about 500 feet in the air. The UFO was observed by Charles, who was working in the field, and by his family members.

He was completely baffled by Charles' report and made routine inquiries. No further developments occurred.

Mr. Kelly believed the witness to be truthful, but emphasized that this was strictly a routine investigation and nothing more. It appeared to be a legitimate report, but there was insufficient data to draw any definitive conclusions.
