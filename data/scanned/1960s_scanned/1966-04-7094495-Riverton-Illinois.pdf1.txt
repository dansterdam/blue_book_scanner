11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Witness sighted a bright red light moving SE from his position. Object then appeared to slow in mid air and reverse direction and proceeded to the NW. It disappeared gradually to the NW. No sound was heard.
The lights conformed to standard aircraft lighting. The sound emitted by an aircraft would not be heard due to the strong surface wind at the 1000 FT level blowing the sound away from the area. Many light aircraft travel over that area.
