The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

PLEASE GIVE YOUR ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT, INDICATING THE DURATION, DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, APPARENT SPEED, MANEUVERS, AND FROM WHICH DIRECTION IT CAME.
THE OBJECT WAS A BRIGHT CLEARLY OBJECT WHEN IT FIRST APPEARED LOW ON THE HORIZON TO THE EAST. IT CLIMBED RAPIDLY AND THEN STOPPED, HOVERED IN ONE SPOT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO AND THEN DISAPPEARED RAPIDLY UP TOWARD THE NORTH. IT WAS VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES.
I COULD SEE NO CONVENTIONAL OBJECT FEATURES AND IT GAVE AN IMPRESSION OF SOLIDITY AND POWER NOT AT ALL LIKE AN AIRPLANE, SATELLITE OR OTHER KNOWN AIRCRAFT. IT WAS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE STARS OR PLANETS IN THE AREA AT THE TIME.
