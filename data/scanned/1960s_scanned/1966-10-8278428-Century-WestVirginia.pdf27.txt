There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a diagram and handwritten text.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the survey where the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the survey to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you last saw it. Place an "A" when you first saw it and a "B" when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? The first one was still there when the others came into view according to what you saw and a second one came close to the first, making two in all. They seemed to disappear and we saw no more.
