There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

WHEN THE LIGHT DISAPPEARED IT APPEARED TO DISAPPEAR OR FLASH APPROXIMATELY 4 SECONDS.
THE OBJECT WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE TO SEE FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE WEEKS. THE AREA NORTHWEST OF THE AIRPORT WAS SPARSELY POPULATED FOR A DISTANCE OF BETWEEN 20 AND 30 MILES. THERE WERE SOME TOWNS, AND I BELIEVE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN INDIVIDUALS REPORTING UFO'S, AS IT WAS I WHO WAS THAT.
