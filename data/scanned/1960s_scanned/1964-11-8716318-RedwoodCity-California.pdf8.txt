Lieutenant William: "Yesterday afternoon, at about 3:45 on the 5th, my eye was attracted by a shiny object in the sky which appeared to be a large balloon. It was round, flat on both sides, and appeared to be approximately 40 feet in diameter. It was traveling at an extremely high speed - much faster than any jet aircraft. I watched it for several minutes as it traveled towards the southwest. At first it appeared to be descending, but then it picked up speed and climbed to a higher altitude. It was silvery-white in color and appeared to be metallic in nature. The object gave off no exhaust or vapor trail, and made no sound that I could hear. After traveling for about 5 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. I have included a rough sketch of what I observed, but it does not do justice to the actual object."
