This image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The top sketch appears to be a compass or navigational diagram, with labels indicating cardinal directions. The lower sketches depict landscapes, with one showing a person standing on a road or path surrounded by hilly terrain, and the other showing a more panoramic view of a horizon with hills or mountains in the distance.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE AS AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION VIEWED. CONSIDERING POSITION OBSERVED, PLACE A POINT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH LIGHT SEEMED TO COME. PLACE A Y ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH OBJECT SEEMED TO MOVE.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, MAKE SKETCHES TO ILLUSTRATE POSITIONS AS SEEN APPROXIMATELY FROM THE GROUND. THESE MAY GIVE SOME IDEA OF 
THE ELEVATION OF THE OBJECT ABOVE THE HORIZON AND ALSO INDICATE ITS APPARENT SIZE IN RELATION TO SURROUNDING TERRAIN FEATURES. THE LARGER SKETCH.
