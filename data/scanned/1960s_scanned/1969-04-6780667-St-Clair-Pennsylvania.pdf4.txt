ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING:

It was a normal night. I was standing outside my home watching the sky when I noticed a light moving across the sky. It appeared to be very bright and was descending rapidly. As it got closer, I could see that it was a solid object, not an aircraft. It hovered silently for a few moments, then shot off at an incredible speed. The whole incident lasted less than a minute. I am not sure what I saw, but it did not seem to be any kind of conventional aircraft.
