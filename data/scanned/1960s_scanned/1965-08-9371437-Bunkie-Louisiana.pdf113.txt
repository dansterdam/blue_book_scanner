Most of the report was inconclusive, but the story went asfollows:
The landing occurred on August 17, 1965 at about 1:00 a.m. near Bunkie, Louisiana on the Johnnie L. Martin farm. The witness, a white male, 39 years of age, was awakened by a strange glow outside his window. He went outside to investigate and observed a large, round object, approximately 30 feet in diameter, hovering silently about 3 feet above the ground. The object was luminous andappeared to be a bluish-white color.
The object remained hovering for about 10-15 minutes, then began rising vertically with a pulsating glow, slowly disappearing from view. The witness stated that the object did not make any noise, and seemed to defy the laws of gravity.
The witness expressed concern over the sighting and was hesitant to report it, fearing ridicule. The Air Force investigator who interviewed the witness found him to be very calm and intelligent, and said he appeared to be telling the truth to the best of his knowledge.
No physical trace evidence was found at the landing site, and no other witnesses were located. The case was classified as "Unidentified" due to lack of any conclusive evidence.
