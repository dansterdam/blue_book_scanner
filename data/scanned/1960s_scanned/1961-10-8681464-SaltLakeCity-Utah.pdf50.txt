Project Blue Book
Special Report No. 14

This report is a summary of the work done on Project Blue Book at Headquarters, United States Air Force, from its inception in 1947 through 1969. The report covers the investigation of unidentified flying objects reported to the Air Force during that period and the conclusions reached as a result of these investigations.

The purpose of Project Blue Book was to determine if unidentified flying objects (UFOs) represented (a) a threat to the national security of the United States, (b) evidence of an advanced technology, or (c) a phenomenon which could be explained and be of scientific interest.

After a review of the available evidence, it is concluded that:

1. No unidentified flying object reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security.

2. There has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as "unidentified" represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge.

3. There has been no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as "unidentified" are extraterrestrial vehicles.
