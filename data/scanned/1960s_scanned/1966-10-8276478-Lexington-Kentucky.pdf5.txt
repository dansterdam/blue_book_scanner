Dear Dr. [Redacted],

Thank you for the information regarding your observation of Capella. With studying illustrations, I would like to send your letter to Dr. Menzel at Harvard Observatory, as he has been studying illustrations of this type and is very interested in the observations for instructions for interpretation in the vivid description of your observation.

Thank you again for your most gracious letter.

Sincerely,

[Redacted], Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
