"The de detaily he i8ty t of the observed orvects as ithey appeared to the observer.

The object first came into the witness field of vision appearing to cone straight up from behind a hill or rise some distance away. It hovered Just ibove the treetops for a short time, then moved off to the west at what the witness describes as a very high rate of speed. Its shape was described as being round or eliptical and its color as white or light gray. No other details of its appearance were noted.

The witness, who is a resident of Northeast Harbor, Maine, reports that he was standing on the porch of his home at approximately 10 PM on the evening of August 9, 1965, when he first observed the object. He stated that he watched it for only a matter of seconds before it disappeared from sight. The weather at the time was reported as clear and the sky was free of clouds.

Subsequent investigation by this office has failed to disclose any known aircraft or astronomical phenomena which could lave accounted for the sighting. The witness is considered to be a reliable and sincere observer."
