Dear Sir:

At approximately 8:30 P.M., July 4th, my family and myself noticed the red objects five to ten miles in the Gulf at around 15,000 to 25,000 feet elevation. 

This air space where this sightning occurred is normally occupied by aircraft of the Air Force and Navy. They were circled by a white object of a much smaller size in a counter-clockwise direction. The white object flickered out and dropped into the Gulf. Minutes later, another three similar white objects flickered out and dropped into the Gulf. Then number one or two minutes later, the circling white object dropped out, the circle of the white object would shrink.

A calm attention went back to the fireworks of the fourth, we did not get happened to the white object.

Yours sincerely,
