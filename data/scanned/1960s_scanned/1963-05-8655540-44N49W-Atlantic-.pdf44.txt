ASTRALIAN SIGHTNG SAUCER - - -
Canberra, NSW, Australia
The new sighting occurred on May 31, 1963.
A mysterious orange object was seen to cross the sky. The witness was unable to establish the speed or altitude. The object appeared to be rotating and it "swayed" from side to side as it crossed the sky. It was observed for about 30 seconds. The witness said it did not lose its brilliant orange light until it disappeared from view beyond the horizon.
The witness is a world authority on the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon and his competence is not questioned. However, he said he could not make a definite identification or classification of the object seen.
