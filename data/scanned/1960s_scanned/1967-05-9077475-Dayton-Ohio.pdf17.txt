The image contains a sketch and a compass image, but no photographs.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you saw, at the point shown, Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. These are the angles on the compass that you first saw the object and last saw the object (on the compass, show you saw the object first at 80° and last at 30°).

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
