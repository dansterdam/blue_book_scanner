The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The letter is addressed to someone in Auburn, Maine and appears to be a response to a reported UFO observation on February 15, 1966. The letter states that the information provided was not sufficient for evaluation, and thanks the observer for reporting their observation.
