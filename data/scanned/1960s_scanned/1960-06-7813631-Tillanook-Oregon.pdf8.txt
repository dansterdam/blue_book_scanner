The image contains a photograph, which appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. The photograph does not contain any human faces, so I will describe the contents of the image without identifying any individuals.

The document appears to be a report on a sighting of a "lighted object" with details on its movement, elevation, azimuth, flight pattern, and duration. The report includes information such as the time, location (Tillanook, Oregon), and details from the Air Traffic Control Tower and civilian witnesses.
