Dear Sirs:

Although I am only 13, I'm very interested in the investigation of U.F.O.'s. I know I should have an open mind in this matter but I'm very much convinced that U.F.O.'s (from outer space) exist. I have done much research in the matter and am writing to different sources of information on this matter in the hopes of learning more.

U.F.O.'s is because I've seen 3(with 3 other reliable people) I called the Air Force (Otis Air Force Base) and told them what I saw. The instructor and told them about the description of these strange objects in the sky.

Note 1: The seen: 7:15-7:20: all white light turning into a larger red light and moved upward across the sky. It no course at all. Disappeared went no sound. About 2 or 3 times larger than a star.

Note 2: THE SEEN: 7:15-7:30: All colors; moved very slowly; Little larger than a star; made no sound.

Note 3: (Oct. 3, 1966): (white light): Moved very slowly; size of a star; no sound.

I read this article you wrote in the Science Digest, December 1966 and I'd like to say that I am very nervous, but happy when I saw this object I did not panic.

Sincerely,
