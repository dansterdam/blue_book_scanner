There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is a questionnaire form, and the relevant section states "This report filled out by OD/FTD" indicating it was completed by someone from the Office of Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, and the Directorate of Information Services, which were part of the United States Air Force. The rest of the text on the form is legible and appears to be a fill-in form, but does not contain any additional information beyond what is visible in the image.
