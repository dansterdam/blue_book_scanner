Fear Sirs:

While on vacation in Valentine, Nebraska, I saw and photographed some of the UFO'S that were seen in the middle-western states on the night of the second and third of September, 1965.

I have been a member of the Los Angeles Astronomical Association for several years, and a keen observer of the sky. However, we have never been able to identify anything like the objects I have seen during this occasion. If you are willing to examine my report and photos, please notify me, and the date will be determined.
