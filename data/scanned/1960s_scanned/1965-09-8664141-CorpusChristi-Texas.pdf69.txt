A NEW NOISE

An add from Jimmy Gurlier came me the story of Mrs. Glenn McLain, who was visiting the area from her home in Corpus Christ during the Thanksgiving holidays in 1964 when she heard a strange noise which awakened her about 3:30 a.m. 

Mrs. McLain's attention was attracted by a sound described as a "hissing roar" which seemed to come from outside her motel room. She went to the window and saw nothing unusual, but the sound continued for some time. She was afraid to open the door, fearing the sound might be that of an airplane about to crash. 

Mrs. McLain could not sleep after the incident and she reported it to the motel management the following morning. The manager stated that no other guests had reported hearing any unusual sounds.
