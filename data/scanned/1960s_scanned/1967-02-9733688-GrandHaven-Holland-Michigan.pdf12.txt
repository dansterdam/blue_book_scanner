Sightings at Grand Haven and Holland, Michigan  
February 29, 1967

William T. Powers

In response to news reports and telephoned reports to the Grand Haven Observatory, an investigation was conducted into reports of an unidentified object in the Ottawa County area.  

There were reports of other sightings as well, which were not directly investigated.

A meeting was set up for March 3 in the Ottawa County Sheriff's Department offices, with the above-mentioned officers present. The three men had given their stories, visits were made to each point where a sighting was made, and later photographs were taken from locations containing angle measurements.

At Grand Haven Airport and FAA controllers at Muskegon County Airport (38 miles north of Grand Haven) were interviewed to establish the nature of the object in question. The results indicate that an object was sighted which was not the planet Venus and not aircraft with its landing lights on, but enough ambiguity remains to conclude that what was seen was unconventional.

On remanding it, when a call was heard over a monitor radio in the dispatcher at Ottawa County Headquarters was asking, then in a patrol car in Holland, whether he could see an object.
