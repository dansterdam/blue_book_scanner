There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a page of text from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Here is the text that I was able to extract from the image:

"It is reported to us by the Major, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, who thoroughly investigated the sighting, that at approximately 7:15 A.M. on 9 February 1967, a family of four reported seeing two unidentified flying objects moving rapidly in the sky over Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.

The objects were described as round, flat, discs, approximately 8-10 feet in diameter, and silvery in color. The objects were observed to be moving rapidly in a northwesterly direction at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. The sighting lasted for approximately 20-30 seconds.

The observers were the father, mother, and two teenage children, all of whom were deemed to be reliable and unexcited witnesses. There was no evidence of hoax or hallucination, and the witnesses were considered to be sane, normal individuals.
