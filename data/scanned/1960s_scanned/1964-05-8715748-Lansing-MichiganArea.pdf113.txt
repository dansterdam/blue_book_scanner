Here is the text from the document:

To Saginaw Highway. As they turned onto the road from the driveway they noticed a light over the field towards them. However, they realized that it was not a car because there were no headlights approaching them. The light seemed to be hovering about 5 - 6 feet high and covered width of the road. It was about 15 - 20 feet long and seemed to have a hazy glow around it. The light disappeared and reappeared several times. When it reappeared it seemed to come closer and then disappear again. At this time the light disappeared completely. The incident lasted about 10-15 minutes. Sgt Moody and Mr Powers were accompanied to the scene shortly after they saw the light. They also saw the light but could not determine its source. It was dark and the area was heavily wooded. They could not find any tracks or evidence through which the road passed. Adjacent to this opening was a heavily wooded area and the light seemed to come out of the woods and move across the road, then disappear as it reached the other side. As they approached the area, the light seemed to move back into the wooded area. According to the distance where the car turned onto the road, it was estimated that the light was about 30 feet from the edge of the road. The light was said to be silent and to shine in a steady manner, not blinking. Sgt Moody said that he could not determine if this was the presence of ground fog from the pond.
