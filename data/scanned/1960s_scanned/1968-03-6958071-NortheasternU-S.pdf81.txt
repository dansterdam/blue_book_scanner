MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subject: UFO Observation, 4 March 1963
Saw an unidentified object at 9:45 p.m. for three minutes, saw a cluster of starlike objects which reappeared in the southwest and leaving a trail behind, going northeast. At about 45 degrees elevation. Watched them till they went way up to the northeast, they got down over some houses and weren't quite as bright. White star like objects. At first thought they were shooting stars, however, they were too long. It was like the trail was burning. Seemed like six or eight objects together.
