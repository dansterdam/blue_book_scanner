Dear Mrs.
I want to thank you for being so kind to write to me about your sighting of a strange object in the sky on March 30 at Ely, Nevada.
I was very interested in your description of this sighting. Please let me know if you have any other information or observations to pass along. It would be most helpful to me in trying to evaluate this incident.
Perhaps we can meet sometime and discuss this further. I would be most appreciative of any other details you can provide.
Thank you again for your letter. I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely yours,
