Dear Sir:

I would like to report the sighting of a UFO. It happened on November 13, 1968 in Sommerville, Ohio. My wife, my two daughters, and myself were driving North on Jacksonburg-Gratis Road toward State Route 4002. We may have seen more than these, but I do not believe in any type of science fiction or other wild type things.

We noticed this light in the sky. It caught our attention immediately. We all looked to the "lights", and they were saying "it's us". These lights turned down the cars, and we began to look back with our lights on the car, and we could see five lights attached, but we could not distinguish the shape because of the reflection of the lights on my dashboard. The lights still turned off, and they were still on - the lights on my dashboard turned off. The lights still remain, shining around in the sky.

By this time I had driven perhaps one-half mile, and the lights were beginning to disappear and turned down near the windshield and began to pull down the corner of the windshield. As we reached the house, the lights became a huge size object. The lights would come on and off. It remained that way, it would turn off, and it would remain a huge size object. The lights were blinking around very fast.

I looked at it for quite a while, but I never got the nerve to stop the car, and keep going because I was so shook up about the sound of the engine on my car. Presently, I came to the end of Jacksonburg-Gratis Road and stopped. The lights by this time had practically disappeared. We got out of the car and stared, but nothing was left. Writing is seems to be a logical way I would put it. It hovered over us, and turned off and on many times, and I could hardly believe my eyes.

I turned to the right, and looked ever to my left shoulder. The next thing I saw turning to my right, and the light get BLINDING. The thing disappeared, and I turned very quickly because it frightened me in my life. I tried to outrace it, but it kept perfect pace with me.

I got home, and my wife and daughters were out of their minds, screaming and everything. At the first I didn't know what it was, and in Gratis, I turned right again. We drove on far a block, parked the car, and got out to watch. By this time the directions had just ceased, and we saw it it pretty well in the direction of Eaton, due North, and we saw it didn't seem to be in the direction of Eaton.

Of course, this is an extremely true story the way I saw it, and I can't explain it the way I would want to. I knew what it was, if only I knew I hope I never see it again. I had the strangest sensation it wanted to communicate with me, but I sure didn't want any part of it.
