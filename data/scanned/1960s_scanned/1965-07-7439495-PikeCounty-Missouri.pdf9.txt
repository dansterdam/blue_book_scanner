The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely part of a Project Blue Book report from 1965 related to a UFO sighting in Pike County, Missouri.

Capt. This was about a  
object that was seen one night to 
south no light seen on it
looked to man 12 miles or
so out to slow over fields and  
trees it was a bright object,  
did not flash, and might had  
been a mile high and of a  
fairly large size. This fellow in  
the car could not give an exact   
distance that it was away from  
him, but when it left after several  
minutes going toward the Southwest  
it left a very bright light on the  
horizon, bright enough almost to  
light up the country side around it.  
It seemed to go straight up and  
away from him at a terrific rate  
of speed. He said this was a most  
unusual thing he had ever witnessed.  
I must have looked at this man  
seriously for he remarked that he had  
no reason to make up any story about  
this, that he actually did see this  
strange craft in the sky.
