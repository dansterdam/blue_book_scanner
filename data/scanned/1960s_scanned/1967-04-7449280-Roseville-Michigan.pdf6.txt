I was awakened shortly after 10:30 P.M. on March 15, 1967 by a bright light shining through the bedroom window. I arose to investigate and observed a luminous disc shaped object hovering about 50 feet above the ground. Its brightness was that of a large spotlight and it seemed to be rotating slowly. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. The object hovered motionless for about 2 minutes and then accelerated at a terrific rate of speed, climbing at a steep angle and disappearing from view in about 5 seconds, and made no sound whatsoever. There were no other witnesses that I'm aware of, and this is the first and only such experience I have had. I am a registered nurse and am quite familiar with various aircraft operations, and I can assure you that this was no conventional aircraft of any kind. I hope this additional information is of some value to your investigation.
