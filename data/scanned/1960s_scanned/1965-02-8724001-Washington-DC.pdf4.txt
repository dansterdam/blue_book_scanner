PAGE 4 REEDSAA7215 UNCLAS

TO WHOM MR. ---- INITIALLY REPORTED HIS SIGHTING. PRIOR TO CONTACTING MR. ----, THE DUTY OFFICER ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE IF A WEATHER BALLOON HAD BEEN RELEASED, WITH AFFIRMATIVE RESULTS. DURING THE PERIOD OF CONTACT WITH MR. ----, THE DUTY OFFICER MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO LOCATE THE OBJECT, AT THE OBSERVERS REQUEST, BUT COULD NOT SIGHT IT. CONTACT WAS THEN MADE WITH MONAD SPADE?, WHO ASSERTED THAT NO VISIBLE SATELLITES WERE IN THE AREA, AND SOUNDED RELIABLE AND THOUGH HE DID NOT AGREE, IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE SIGHTING WAS OF THE WEATHER BALLOON RELEASED AT WASHINGTON AIRPORT. AT THE VERY END OF THE CONVERSATION MR. ---- REPORTED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT.
