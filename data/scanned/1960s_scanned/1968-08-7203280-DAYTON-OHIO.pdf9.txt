The image contains a compass-like diagram in the upper portion, as well as two smaller sketches in the lower portion. The compass-like diagram appears to be a tool for approximating the direction of an observed object. The two smaller sketches depict landscapes with a silhouetted human figure in the foreground.

AFR 80-17(CI)

THE FIRST SKETCH SHOWS WHERE PERSON IS STANDING WHEN LAST SEEN. THE SECOND SKETCH SHOWS THE AZIMUTH OR DIRECTION IN WHICH HE SAID HE SAW THE OBJECT. BOTH SKETCHES SHOULD BE DRAWN TO SCALE AND TO SHOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS SEEN, AS FOR EXAMPLE: BUILDINGS, TREES, ROADS, ETC. EVEN TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL. IN DRAWING THE LARGER SKETCH, PLACE A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE ELEVATION OF THE OBJECT.
