FAMILY BESEIGED BY DISCS
Besieged - (continued from Page One) 
According to the report, a family in Tioga, Florida, was forced to leave their home because of the machines hovering above an area near their home for an extended period.

After forty minutes of this discomfort and fear, the witnesses, who had contacted authorities, reported that the object at the railroad tracks about a mile away suddenly vanished. The objects that had been hovering over the home also departed shortly thereafter. 

The family went out and they followed the lights off in the distance as they departed their home. After returning home, the house and yard were saturated with a strong sulphurous odor, providing information for onsite physical services. The presence and departure of the discs was corroborated by a number of other people in the area between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m. on the night of the incident, had reported seeing a formation of lights in the sky that then departed. The objects were reported to be leaving their area.

The presence of their heat and odor, this corroborated man's testimony concerning the discs leaving, and showed that the time the incident took place as true, especially as far as the size and reputation for honesty of the family involved.
