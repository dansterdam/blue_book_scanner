There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document containing handwritten text.

Mr. . has kindly passed along a clipping to me, dated May 21st, concerning a mysterious flying object which passed a car, where he was a passenger, on a country road at about 9:30 p.m. when he saw a brilliant light about 1000 yards ahead of the car. The light was brilliant and appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter. As the car approached the light it seemed to move away rapidly and then disappeared. The driver of the car slowed down and they both observed the light for about 5 minutes before it disappeared. The clipping states that the light was a metallic or aluminum color and was very bright and clear. There were no sounds associated with the sighting. The observer stated that the light was much brighter than the headlights on the car. The light was observed for several miles.
