3 IN FRONT OF YOU  TO YOUR RIGHT OVERHEAD (Near or far)
E. SPECIFY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS, ETC. FOR TERRESTRIAL ILLUMINATION, SPECIFY SOURCE.
No Illumination, with exception of object. 

12. DESCRIBE IN DETAIL WHAT YOU SAW, INCLUDING ANY REFLECTED LIGHT OR SELF-LUMINOUS AND WHAT COLORS YOU NOTICED. DESCRIBE YOUR IMPRESSION OF WHETHERDobject (as the moon), with a trailing of mist at sides
and behind; there were rays of light shining from object through mist (as the sun shining through clouds). After perhaps 2 minutes the object diminished in size and appeared to be entirely encircling it - the mist as the light was an illusion as the object diminished in size. I do believe this was an illusion as the mist was an illusion as the object diminished in size.

Object did not appear to change shape or size, merely dimmed in brightness.
