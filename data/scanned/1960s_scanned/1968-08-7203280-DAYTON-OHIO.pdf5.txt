M2MO FOR THE RECORD
14 AUGUST 1968
SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 12 August 1968
Road, Kettering, Ohio, called the Aerial Phenomena Office on 13 August 1968 to see if they had identified the object he observed on the night of 12 August 1968. Mr. said that the report had been phoned in by himself on the night of 12 August.
Lt. Marano informed Mr. that we had not received the report from the city officer as of yet; however, could he provide some of the details over the phone.
TIME: 1130 - 1200 pm, EDT
DURATION: thirty minutes
ELEVATION: 30 - 40 deg above the horizon, SSW
The object appeared as a white light with red and green flashing lights. It was motionless, it seemed to move out of sight in a straight line from where he first saw it. It kept dropping a little lower on the horizon. When Mr. first saw it, it was very clear with many stars and the moon visible. When he last observed the object there was a little bit of a cloud (hazy or streaking cloud coverage) in that area. To the naked eye it had the appearance of a star. With binoculars "I could see that appeared to be self-illuminating light." There were regular intervals of flashing or revolving or pulsing, fairly distant from Mr. Ford. said he had to use binoculars to even see any of it. It was completely motionless for twenty minutes. "When I was on the phone my little girl saw it and said it just seemed to drop slowly, faded out."
