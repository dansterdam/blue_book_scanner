SUMMARIZED REPORT OF INVESTIGATION OF SIGHTING
OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT NEAR CANTON, OHIO
ON 8 MAY 1961

ON 8 MAY 1961, AT 2150 HOURS, AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY MRS. JOHN DOE AND HER HUSBAND IN THE VICINITY OF CANTON, OHIO.

THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO BE HOVERING 75 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, AND APPROX. 500 YARDS EAST OF THEIR RESIDENCE. THE OBJECT WAS DISCOID IN SHAPE, APPROX. 100 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND EMITTING A BRIGHT BLUE-WHITE LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINATED THE SURROUNDING AREA FOR 200 YARDS.

UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION, ROTATING LIGHTS OF RED, BLUE, AND AMBER COLOR WERE OBSERVED ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CRAFT. THE OBJECT REMAINED RELATIVELY STATIONARY FOR 12-15 MINUTES, THEN ACCELERATED RAPIDLY IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS.

THE OBSERVERS REPORTED NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT, AND NO EXHAUST TRAIL OR OTHER VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF PROPULSION SYSTEM.

THE SIGHTING IS CONSIDERED UNIDENTIFIED, AS NO CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR OTHER KNOWN OBJECT CAN BE REASONABLY EXPLAINED. THE SIGHTING IS CLASSIFIED AS A LEGITIMATE UFO REPORT.
