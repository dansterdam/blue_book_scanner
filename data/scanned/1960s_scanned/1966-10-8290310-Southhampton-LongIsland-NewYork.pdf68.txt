Swarming UFO Sights - Brickbats or Threat on L.I.
The New. York Sunday Journal-Tribune, May 8, 1966, reported that some residents of Southampton, Long Island, N.Y., sighted a "swarm" of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over several hours on May 1, 1966. Witnesses claimed the objects seemed to be attacking certain houses, and some residents were described as being "hysterical." The Air Force later explained the sightings as the result of meteorological conditions and the presence of "brickbat" satellite debris reentering the atmosphere. Despite this official explanation, the incident has remained controversial and the subject of speculation and debate among civilian UFO researchers.
