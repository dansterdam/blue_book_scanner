Moline Policeman Takes Movies Of 'Boxcar' In Sky

Sneer if you will. You are not going to convince persons in this area who sighted unidentified flying objects that they are candidates for the "booby hatch."

No matter if the reports vary from "saucer-type" to "boxcar"-this is in the area, F. W. Coulson of Rock Island County and Robert Powell of Geneseo, state police, have full reports of their sightings.

A Moline woman, Mrs. Georgia Larson of 2222 6th St., and her neighbors, also reported seeing the UFO through binoculars.

"What we saw, while light" Through the day and just before the last game at Rock Island High Schools, started traveling 40 to 45 miles an hour when we first sighted it after the sun had gone down," said Miss Bertha Melvin of Sunset View Trailer Court, reporting that she and her uncle had watched a "white light" in the sky for several minutes which disappeared behind a hill. Rock Island County sheriff's deputies who were notified confirmed the sighting and rushed to the area, but by the time they arrived the light had crashed behind the hill.
