1. Reference your letter of February 15, 1963 with regards to unidentified sightings from September 1962.
2. We have checked our files for sightings from Oklahoma for September 1962, and were unable to find any records of such sightings. While we do receive sightings from other sections of the country, we did not receive any for Oklahoma during that time.
3. Therefore, as stated in your letter, we will have no further information to provide.
If in the future, if you should observe another UFO, please report it to the nearest Air Force Base.
