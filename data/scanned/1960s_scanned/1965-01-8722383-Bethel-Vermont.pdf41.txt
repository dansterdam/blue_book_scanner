Extracted text from the document:

The first possible explanation is that the object observed was a large bird, or possibly a small plane, which had made a rapid pass near the observer. However, the observer is confident that the object was not a plane, and the size and speed of the object makes it unlikely to have been a large bird. The object was observed for a period of about 10 to 20 seconds.

Another consideration is that the object could have been a reflection of some kind, possibly from the sun, although the observer does not believe this to be the case. The observer feels certain that the object was a real physical object, and not a reflection or illusion.

The object was described as being elliptical in shape, with a bright light or halo surrounding it. It appeared to be hovering, and then accelerated very rapidly, disappearing from view within 10 to 20 seconds. The observer reported that the object did not appear to be controlled by any visible means of propulsion.

The document also includes some technical details and calculations related to the observed object, such as its estimated size, speed, and altitude. Overall, the report appears to be a detailed account of an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed by the witness.
