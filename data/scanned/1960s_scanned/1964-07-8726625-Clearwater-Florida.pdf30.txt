Dear Mrs. Harry:
Your about seeing your unusual phenomenon on June 25th at Clearwater, Florida caught my attention.
As a science writer our goal is to find out the facts about unidentified flying objects. Therefore, I would like to obtain more details from you about the object you saw.
From your description, the object appears to have been very close, about 250 degrees in size, and traveling at a high rate of speed low across the horizon. We hope this accounting will be of some help to you.
Sincerely,
Deleted, P.I. 33534
