The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram related to the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The diagram shows an angular measurement scale with various angular degrees labeled, as well as instructions for the observer to draw a picture that will show the motion and path of the observed object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon (skyline) where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the skyline where you last saw the object. Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
