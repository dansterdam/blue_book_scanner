Dear Dr. Hynek,

I called Ridge Ave. Monday night (June 10) to ask your permission to go out after the object described in the enclosed clipping "X". You said you'd come out of town so I did what you'd expect me to -- I went after it anyway.

After I talked to you, I called this object. She seemed intelligent and willing to discuss the sighting. Before long, she was giving me a description of an object which certainly did sound like "jelly/jam" and "falling leaf." There were eight observers with two pairs of binoculars.

Meanwhile, another person had called -- saying he had seen the same object in the same location the week before. He was driving at the time and decided to track it down. He came to the High School (11 miles away) and observed the object through high-powered binoculars. It was then that he noticed the "jelly/jam" and "kite-flyer." Seems there was an eccentric little fellow, about 50, who lives in a rented room high school grounds, running around like a Montey Python crummy). He built the kite and transports it to the school grounds via city bus (1). The boy's 12-20 inches high; several feet long; and has wide plastic streamers for tails -- the longest tail is 250 feet long. The enclosed drawing was made by this person. She said the dimensions given seem to fit with what they had noticed the previous Sunday. They had undoubtedly seen the same object.

Only thing left is to verify with the kite flyer that he was actually flying it on June 2 at 1900, but I don't know how to reach him. As far as I'm concerned, I consider the case closed.

Glad I solved this one so easily, but worry it wasn't a good juicy UFO which I personally observed from a distance of 10 feet. Better luck(?) next time.
