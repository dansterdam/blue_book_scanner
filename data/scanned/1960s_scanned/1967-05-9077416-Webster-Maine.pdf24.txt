Gentlemen:
I am writing you because I have not had results or conclusions on the investigation of the UFO on May 13. could you please send me the results of the investigation or the progress of it? Also, could you please be interested that during a recent project or mine of making a star chart using photographs, I observed on several nights "V" signs or lights. At first, I thought they were just lighting, but they seemed to have a pattern to them. I even managed to catch one on film, but I did not focus in the constellation Orion, 2 degrees east of M42. If you can photograph I will send it at your request. It can be seen as genuine by the sharpness of both the lights and of the constellation. Indicating that it was not very close.
Thank you for your valuable time.
Sincerely,
