PROJECT BLUE BOOK INFORMATION OFFICER
USAF (SAFETY)
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20330

Gentlemen:

In a fact sheet sent me recently by your public information officer, I was asked by one Capt Gerber to observe anything which I believed to possess the qualifications of a UFO. I should have mentioned this earlier to the Air Force, but the report was not requested directly by yours truly and two others for the first and one other occasion.

I am writing to request two (2) UFO report forms from that which I have believed in the phenomena, and I say it is very credible. The flight which I saw - and on the sight I will not comment as unlabeled as present - was not lacking in some, but the report will contain some technical details on the other hand as improbable as any other sightings observed by me. Some of the more astronomical phenomena and aerodynamic capacities as well as more forms of aircraft under test were the other characteristics.

Besides the same, I would also appreciate any information on my request, including pertinent background and sketches, which you please answer this request.

Thank you.
