Transcription of the text in the document:

"The light seemed to be hovering a short distance above the ground. It was roughly circular in shape and slightly luminous, although not intensely bright. It remained practically stationary for several minutes, then suddenly shot up into the sky out of sight, moving away at great speed. The light did not seem to be intelligently controlled, but rather to be a natural phenomenon. There was a distinct humming sound which seemed to emanate from the object. It gradually diminished in volume as the light ascended and disappeared. The 2 witnesses felt that they had seen something unusual and worth reporting for investigation. The object was sighted on the night of October 11, 1966 at about 9:30 P.M. PST, and lasted for approximately 5 minutes. The observers were Mr. and Mrs. Henry L-----."
