Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text on the page:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "X" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

90°
75°

28. Draw a line that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction that the object made.

A - north 
east
west

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
