which was on a landing approach to Hanscom AFB. It was dark gray or other appendagaes were observed, No noise, No exhaust trail. It hovered momentarily and then departed at high speed. There was no physical contact and just before the sound barrier was broken, a low hollow sound was heard for a few seconds. It has been estimated that this object was about one quarter mile in diameter.

In accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 20 July 1962 and amended on 30 July 1963, would you please send me the USAF fact sheet on the well-publicized New Mexico UFO sighting by Captain Joseph C. Meier on 23 May 1964. Your office making available to the public "will be appreciated" concerning information on this case.

For official use only, but would those reports cleared by your office to be made available to the public and what procedures would I have to go through. We would have to put on a distribution list for future releases or would I have to ask for specific cases and am dependent upon UFO information through UFO organizations, newspapers, magazines, professional societies and others.

The Director of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force would be officially notified and the investigations and conclusions concerning UFO's would be made available as much information as possible to carry on and continue to be public as these objects.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Yours sincerely,
Raymond E. Fowler
