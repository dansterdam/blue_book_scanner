The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. 

The text in the document is as follows:

SEE THE PHENOMENON
IS IT A STRAIGHT LINE?
IS IT BRIGHT?
IS IT ROUND?
IS IT FAST OR SLOW?
IF IT IS FAST, DOES IT JUST DART AWAY?
IF IT IS SLOW, DOES IT PICK UP SPEED AND THEN DISAPPEAR?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
LEAVE A TAIL?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
LEAVE A TRAIL?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
LEAVE A FOG?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
TO WHAT DID YOU PAY YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
