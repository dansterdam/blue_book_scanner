6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "7" AT THE POSITION OF THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "7" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "7" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. THIS WILL FREQUENTLY SHOW THAT THE COURSE WAS NOT STRAIGHT, BUT CURVED. A MORE COMPLICATED EXAMPLE OF HOW TO CORRELATE THE ROSE AND SKETCHES IS GIVEN.
