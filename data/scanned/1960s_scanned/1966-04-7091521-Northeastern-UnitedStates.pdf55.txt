YOU OIS
UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT OBSERVED IN SKY OVER WEST SPRINGPIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, APRIL 7, 1966.

At approximately 2300 local time on April 7, 1966, an unidentified object was observed in the sky over West Springfield, Massachusetts, by a group of four persons.

The following is a summary of the incident as reported in the official project Blue Book file:

The object was observed by four residents of West Springfield, Massachusetts, for a period of approximately 45 minutes, from about 2300 to 2345 local time on April 7, 1966.

The witnesses described the object as a round, glowing mass of light, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object was stationary at first, then began to move slowly, stopping and starting at irregular intervals. The object did not appear to have any lights, windows, or other distinguishing features. At times it appeared to change color from yellow to white to blue-green. The object was at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. No sound was heard associated with the object.

The witnesses included a married couple, their daughter, and a neighbor. All four persons independently reported the sighting and provided similar descriptions of the object. The Air Force investigator concluded that the object was a genuine unidentified flying object (UFO) and could not be explained by any conventional aircraft or other known object.
