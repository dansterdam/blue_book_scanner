REPLY TO ATTN OF: IDEW

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

TO: 1st USAF BAR-CIPF
WPAFB, D.C.

1. Reference the attached letter from Lt. Col. _______________ regarding information on unidentified flying objects.

2. Without taking a position, the eyewitness accounts in this letter relate to a meteor-type sighting. The objects, which a number of witnesses claim to have observed, allegedly depicted the following characteristics:

a. An apparent material decay, northeast or southeast.
b. Detaching characteristics by a breaking up of the object.
c. An apparently greater duration than a meteoric event.

3. The duration is much greater than a meteor sighting, for example, an estimated 27 minutes. The visual decay of 1960 was observed from Florida to Maine and lasted in excess of four minutes.

4. A case summary of the 1 Aug 1963 sighting in Fairfield, Illinois is attached. It should enable you to answer the questions raised by the attached letter.

a. At no time did the Air Force attempt to convince the witnesses that they had not observed something of significance. However, it is difficult to establish any facts which would substantiate or negate the sighting. This evaluation is based on lack of confirming evidence and/or objective data to support the contentions.

b. There are many reasons for station on a car radio, for example, a shifting forward or rearward radio association was established between the UFO and static in this case. However, it is difficult to evaluate or correlate such data in relation to this case.

c. There are no information regarding a "guiding sighting" in relation to this case.
