MEMO FOR THE RECORD
24 JUNE 1963

SUBJ: UFO OBSERVATION, 11 JULY 1967

In response to Dr. Hynek's criticism of the evaluation of possible aircraft, I feel it best to point out that:

1. "Though it was a falling star at first-then leveled off."
Since the object was seen for several minutes, it certainly couldn't have had the angular velocity of a meteor. It is quite possible that an aircraft while descending flight levels might turn his landing lights on, especially if there were any other traffic in the area. Also the duration is more suitable to that of an aircraft.

2. "No planes were in the vicinity during the sighting." The TWX only lists those planes that landed at Warner Robins AFB. It is unknown if there were any planes arriving at Atlanta. Atlanta is one of the largest airports in the United States and is about fifty miles Northwest of Macon. (Note: Light disappeared toward the Northwest.)

There is also a small airport near Ft. Valley (approximately twenty miles away).

It is also interesting to note that although the observer said that the object produced a sound like a train heard in the distance, his wife said that it emitted a jet airplane."

3. "Description of blue-white glow does not fit aircraft evaluation." This is completely false and I suggest that Dr. Hynek go look at a landing aircraft with its landing lights on.
