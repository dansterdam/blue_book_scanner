SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
REPORT OF SIGHTING OVER BRITISH HONDURAS, CENTRAL AMERICA

On the evening of 8 July 1962, an observer reported seeing a bright object in the sky over British Honduras, Central America. The object appeared to be oval in shape and was accompanied by smaller objects. The larger object was estimated to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and the smaller objects were approximately 6 to 8 feet in diameter. 

The objects were observed for about 10 to 15 minutes before they accelerated and disappeared from view. No sound was heard and no landing was reported. The weather was clear at the time of the sighting.

This report was investigated by the U.S. Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, the official study of unidentified flying objects. The case remains unresolved, as no definitive explanation could be determined for the sighting.
