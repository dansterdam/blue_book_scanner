Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Your letter of 13 August 1960 to Captain Lee Walrod, Ohio Civil Air Defense Coordinator at Wright-Patterson AFB, concerning unidentified flying objects you sighted, has been referred to me.

Your insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore I request you fill out the attached Air Force questionnaire and forward it to the address at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio for their evaluation and analysis. Two witnesses to this sighting are also mentioned in the event there is another.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
