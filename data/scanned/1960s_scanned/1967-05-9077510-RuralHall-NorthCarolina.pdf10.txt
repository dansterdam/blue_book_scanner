The image contains a compass-like diagram and a sketch. There is no photograph present in this document.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.
28. Draw a line that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a series of how they were oriented, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
