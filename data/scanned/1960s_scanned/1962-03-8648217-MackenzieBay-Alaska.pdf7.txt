Springtime Stars Appear
With the arrival of March, new groups of stars typical of the spring season appear in the night sky. These constellations are moving westward and are becoming more prominent. During the early part of March the Jewel Box is prominent in the southwestern sky, almost at the meridian. The star Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens, is low in the southwest. Moving northward, the star Betelgeuse can be seen, part of the constellation Orion. As the evening progresses, the constellations in the northern part of the sky are moving northwestward - these include the familiar "Big Dipper," which is high in the northwest. At this time of year, the Pleiades can be seen in the west-northwest, and just below it the Hyades, with the bright star Aldebaran, the "fiery eye of the Bull." Following Orion to the east, Perseus and Auriga are seen, each with one of the bright stars of early spring - Capella and Mirfak. Farther to the east, the Lion, Cancer, and Gemini can be spotted. To the south, Canis Major with Sirius, and Canis Minor with Procyon are near the meridian. Overhead is the Great Square of Pegasus, and to the east, the Head of Draco and the Little Dipper are prominent.
