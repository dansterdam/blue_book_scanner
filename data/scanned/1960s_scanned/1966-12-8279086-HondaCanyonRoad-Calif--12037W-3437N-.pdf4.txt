Analysis by preparing officers: A visual check of the area by helicopter pilots disclosed nothing visually that could be attributed to the reported UFO. This could have been due to the lapse of time (over 12 hours) from the time of the sighting to the time of the visual check. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the object observed was a round vehicle that was traveling up Honda Canyon Road.
