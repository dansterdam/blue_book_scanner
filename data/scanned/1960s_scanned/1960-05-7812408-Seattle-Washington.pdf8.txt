SAFOI-34/1 "Col Tucker,

29 July 1960

Dear [redacted],

With your returning your photographs and negatives submitted with your letter of July 1960 concerning the flying objects, the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center has determined that these are definitely pictures of light fixtures reflecting on a window.

For your information I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on the subject of unidentified flying objects. It plainly states the Air Force's position in regard to this subject.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
