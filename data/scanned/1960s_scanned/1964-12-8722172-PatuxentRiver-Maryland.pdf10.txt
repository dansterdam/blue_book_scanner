M/R 6 Jan 65
Called Major Miller, meteorological liaison officer, and requested a full report of this incident. Received from him P.O. Box 9190, Dec 64, to AFSSC REPORT: 
Contacted Captain Bretthauser and requested an official TWX from the area which was given in the phone on 5 Jan 65.
Letter Category: AFSC (SCT) called. People there were bugging this sighting. Told him we did not have an official report as yet. Significance of this sighting could be determined from various tracks in area.
At approximately 1113 we contacted Lt Vol at Patuxent. The investigation at that time was being conducted by APRO (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization) and they were not sent out. The reports that were released are quite inadequate and should contain more data. Several tracks were observed on the ground which started near the beach and the house and moved out to sea. This was evidently started by a rumor with someone (younger) talking about lights in the area and their interest was heightened by an article written by(Major) Mr. Donald E. Keyhoe in "TRUE Magazine" in Dec 1964 which people had seen and telephoned.
Lt Vols at this time told Information Office at AFSSC that this matter is still under investigation and I am awaiting further report (analysis) had been made. And that information provided was confidential, incomplete and incorrect.
(As an interrogatory 1130 we notified SAFOI (SAFH) of the above and gave her the above information.
