The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter regarding a reported unidentified flying object observation.

Proposed reply to letter from
Dear Mr.
Reference your recent letter reporting your 22 August 1966 
observation of an alleged unidentified flying object. The late 
date of the report prohibits a detailed scientific investigation. 
We request that an individual report his observation as soon
as possible after its occurrence. This enables Project Blue Book's
analysts to check the necessary factors in determining, if possible,
the cause of the sighting. If you had reported your observation
to the Air Force shortly after the date of your sighting, a meaningful
scientific investigation would have been undertaken. Your report
will be filed for information purposes only.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
