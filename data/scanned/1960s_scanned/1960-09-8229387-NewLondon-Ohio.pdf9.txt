Gentlemen:

I would appreciate it if you could send me any information on a certain aerial object that I saw tonight.

The object travelled at a very rapid pace from southwest to northeast at 7:40 P.M. This object gave off a continuous glow or aura which was about 30 and of it's light and because it was single.

Two airplanes did cross on the route between 8:05 on the same night. I an also positive that it was not a meteor. 

This object travelled so fast that I did not have time to get its visibility. I first noticed it at 7:42 P.M. (EST) when it was closest to the zenith and tracked it for THS IS ONLY A ROUGH ESTIMATE.

I am writing to you because you handled the "Sookane Case", and I thought you might be interested in this for me.

Thank you.
