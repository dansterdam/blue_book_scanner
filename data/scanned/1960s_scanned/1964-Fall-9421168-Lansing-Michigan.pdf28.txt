PROF. MANEY AND UPON

The Professor went to articles on UFO's carried by Crescentsi newspaper regarding the Gibbons incident at Lansing, Michigan on October 11, 1964. Manc spoke with the witnesses, John Jackson, 18, and Lonnie Jackson, 16, and obtained additional details. The two brothers reported that at about 2:30 a.m. that morning, they suddenly saw a strange object descend at a 35 degree angle into a field behind their home. It was described as having a red light on top, a green light in the center, and a white light on the bottom. The object appeared to be about 60 feet in diameter and made a loud humming sound as it hovered about 10 feet above the ground for several minutes. Then it shot straight up and disappeared from sight. The Professors investigation indicated that this was a legitimate UFO sighting worthy of serious consideration.
