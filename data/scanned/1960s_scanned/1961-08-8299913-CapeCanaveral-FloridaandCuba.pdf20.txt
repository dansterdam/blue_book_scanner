PART III. REVIEW OF THE REMOTE OPTICAL TRACKING INSTRUMENT (COTT)
AND INFRARED GROUND OPTICAL RECORDER (IGOR) FILES OF TEST USDC
AND CORRELATION OF THE INFORMATION WITH TRAJECTORY DATA LED TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT MRS. 
AND S/SGT. 
OBSERVED SEPARATION
OF THE BOOSTER IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE IONIZATION CLOUD FORMED BY
THE MISSILE. MRS. 
STATED DURING INTERVIEW THAT IN HER OPINION
THIS WAS WHAT SHE SAW. PART IV. IT IS THE PTD OPINION THAT THIS
MARINE WITNESSED OBSERVED THE MISSILE. THE DISTANCE OF
THEIR VANTAGE POINT FROM THE MISSILE, APPROXIMATELY 550 NAUTICAL
MILES, CAUSED IT TO APPEAR LOW ON THEIR HORIZON. THE MARINES
PROBABLY EXPERIENCED THIS IMPRESSION THAT THE MISSILE WAS CLOSER
THAN IT WAS DUE TO MISTAKING BRIGHTNESS FOR NEARNESS. PART V. THE
OBJECT VIEWED BY MR. 
AND MAJORS 
AND 
REMAINS UNIDENTIFIED DUE TO THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT DATA. UTILIZING
THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MR. 
AND ASSUMING AN ALTITUDE OF
70,000 FEET THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE A TRUE SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY
250 KNOTS. THESE PARAMETERS FALL WELL WITHIN THE CAPABILITIES OF
USSR RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT. HOWEVER OTHER FACTORS TEND TO RULE
THIS OUT AS A POSSIBILITY. AT THE HOUR OF THE SIGHTING 0515 THE SUN
WAS TOO FAR BELOW THE HORIZON TO ILLUMINATE AN OBJECT AT 70,000
FEET. ALL RADAR UNITS IN THE AREA REPORTED NO TARGETS AT THE TIME
OF THE SIGHTING. THE TYPE RADAR EQUIPMENT LOCATED IN THE AREA
INCLUDES AN FPS-20, FPS-6, FPS-24, AND FPS-6. ALL POSSIBILITIES OF THIS
OBJECT BEING ONE OF THE KNOWN ARTIFICIAL SATELLITES WAS RULED OUT
