UFO Sighting of 20 July 1962 (Ocean Springs Sighting)
30 January 1963

Dear Sir,

I am writing from Wright-Patterson where the boys are trying to close up the 1962 UFO sightings. They would appreciate it very much if you could send them an account of the sighting on 20 July 1962.

I believe you said you had talked to these people and had communicated with the director. Some of them have been in correspondence with Lt Col Robert Friend, AFSC TD-3 (UFO) WPAFB, Ohio, as you know the sighting might have some bearing on the whole matter.

I hope to see you in Las Cruces.

Cordially,
