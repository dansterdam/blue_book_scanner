UFO form continued

A time indicator then began to move away for me. The object was close enough to make out the details of the surface and texture. It was pale blue greyish color and was shaped like a flat-topped round object about 30 minutes in diameter. On the surface were lights that seem to be portholes or some kind of openings. The object then started moving slowly to the right and dipped below some trees in the distance. I had not heard any sound from the object at any time.
