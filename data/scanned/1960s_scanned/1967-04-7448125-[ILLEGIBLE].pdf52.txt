The image contains a diagram that appears to be a schematic representation of a UFO sighting. The diagram includes a compass rose and angles to indicate the position and movement of the observed object. There is also a question asking the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion and changes in direction of the object during its course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a sketch of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
