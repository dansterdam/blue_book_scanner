At first it looked like a bright star at a great distance, but it was moving and its light was definitely reflected in the lake, like the moon usually is. When it came closer I could see that it was not a star, rather it was a large, irregularly shaped object. It seemed to be composed of a number of lights, some of them pulsating. It made no sound as it moved over the lake, and it proceeded at a very low altitude, perhaps 200 to 300 feet above the surface. When it was over the town it appeared to be a tremendous size. It would stop and hover, then move off in a different direction, then stop and hover again. All the lights did not seem to be on constantly, but would go on and off irregularly. Finally, it moved off slowly in the distance and seemed to disappear.
