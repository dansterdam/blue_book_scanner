10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Daughter told father that old house was observed to move o/h 100 ft in diameter and 100 ft in diameter, flew slow east to west at 300-400 ft elevation and disappeared. Hovering height estimated at 800-1000 ft. Obj (light) was observed by daughter & father said obj (light) was still in sight.
