CASE NO.    67-1583
LOCATION:  Bergenfield, New Jersey
DATE:       14 March 1967
REPORT MADE BY: Capt. Raymond F. Fixler
OCCUPATION: Air Force Officer
SUMMARY:
On 14 March 1967, while on patrol, I observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Bergenfield, New Jersey. At approximately 2200 hours, I noticed a bright light in the sky, which appeared to be moving in an irregular pattern. The object seemed to hover, then move rapidly, and then hover again. I followed the object for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view.
I reported this incident to my commanding officer, and it was subsequently forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation.
