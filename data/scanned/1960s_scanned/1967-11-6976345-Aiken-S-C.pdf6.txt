There does not appear to be any photographs present in this document from the Project Blue Book UFO report. 

THE FOLLOWING AGENCIES WERE CONTACTED TO DETERMINE IF THERE WERE ANY FLYING FOUND AGENCIES, COLUMIA AIRPORT/DIVINE, SAVANNAH RIVER PLANT-NONE, AIKEN MUNICIPAL AIRPORT-NO FLYING, 2ND SENIOR DIRECTOR NO FLYING, SHAW AFB SO. CALLED SHAW AFB AT 0912 AM LOCAL. OPERATIONS STATED THEY WERE FLYING FROM 1023 LOCAL LAST NIGHT ALL NIGHT, THAT SOME FLIGHTS OVERFLEW THE AIKEN AND COLUMBIA AREA. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS FURTHER OBSERVED IS NOT A RELIABLE WITNESS, THAT NO UFO'S WERE SIGHTED, THAT INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE FROM OBSERVER, THAT OBSERVER WAS RELUCTANT TO GIVE NEEDED INFO SUCH AS HOME PHONE, PARENTS NAME, DIRECTION OF FLIGHT, AND EXPERIENCE IN OBSERVING AERIAL PHENOMENON. THAT THE SIGHTED OBJECTS WAS CONVENTIONAL JET AIRCRAFT, THAT THE REASON FOR NO SOUND WAS BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHT OF THE JETS. I CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS NOT A VALID UFO SIGHTING BUT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT AND THAT NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED.
