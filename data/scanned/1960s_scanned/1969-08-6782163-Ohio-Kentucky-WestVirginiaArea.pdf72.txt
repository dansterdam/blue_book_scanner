A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN. AND A "B" AT THE POSITION ON THE COMPASS WHERE THE PHENOMENON WAS LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE APPARENT MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON.
IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE APPARENT MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. REFER TO SMALL SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE SKETCH.
