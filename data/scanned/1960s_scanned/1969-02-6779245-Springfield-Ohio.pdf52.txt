"Blinding' Sky Fireball Roars Across Southwest

CHIHUAHUA, Mexico. A blinding blue-white fireball streaked across Southwest Texas and Mexico and the southern US at 7:15 P.M. Monday. Astronomers at McDonald Observatory and witnesses near El Paso, Texas, said the light was so brilliant it seemed to turn night into day for a moment. 

According to the report, a Chihuahua newspaper editor, said "They say this is an extraordinary thing that the world has never seen before." Witnesses in El Paso and other areas described the fireball streaking across the sky from west to east, leaving a trail of light in its wake that lasted for several seconds.

The report states that the light was so bright "we had to hide our eyes." Residents in several small villages near the point of explosion said the light was so intense it penetrated deep into the surrounding countryside, illuminating the area for a few moments. No aftereffects such as explosions or noise were reported, though some said there may have been sounds drowned out by the local commotion.

REPORTERS FROM such mountain towns as Portal, Sergio Guerrero da Gro and Guerrero all reported seeing the fireball, and residents of those areas said the light was bright enough to reveal "the smallest details of trees and houses." The report concludes that the fireball was "much brighter than Halley's comet.""
