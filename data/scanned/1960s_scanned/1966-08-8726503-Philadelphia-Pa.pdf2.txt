35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
are not adequate, so I'll try to explain here. I was sitting in my car at night when I noticed something in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but as I watched it, I realized it was moving. It was round and a very bright, whitish-green color. I started talking to my passengers and we looked up again and saw a moving light object, which then seemed to split into two objects. The objects moved around in the sky and I informed all who were with me. We watched them for about 10 minutes before they disappeared from our view. They moved in a very erratic manner, zig-zagging and sometimes seeming to stop and hover. I could not make out any definite shape or size, and I was unable to hear any sound from the object(s). We tried to estimate the distance, but since we had no reference points, we could not be sure. The objects did not seem to be too high in the sky, perhaps around 1000 feet. I have no idea what they were and I wish I could have had a better look. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else reported seeing something similar in the area that night. I have no explanation for what we saw.
