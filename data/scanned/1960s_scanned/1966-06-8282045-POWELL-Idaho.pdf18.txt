Gentlemen:

I am sorry I am not a better artist. The sketched drawing I sent you in the same envelope was somewhat distorted. Although I have witnessed things like this on several occasions I was not able to give you an accurate representation. Compared to a bowling ball of pure ebony, Venus, never levels its beauty. There were clouds that seemed to be linked together and without wind, but the moon also changed the scene. I regret I cannot give you a better sketch, but the chilly bite of winter on my left cheek, but the chilly bite of winter, is enough.

I was wondering if perhaps you had any records of similar sightings at that approximate position and time, about 12:30 A.M. on June 15th.

Yours very truly,
