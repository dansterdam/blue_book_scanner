Dear Sir, 

This is a summary of a report received concerning a UFO sighting last night. The informant was most concerned over the strange movements and actions of the object he observed. He is a reputable citizen and his report seems credible. 

The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes at around 8:30 PM. It was sighted hovering at an estimated altitude of 200-300 feet above the ground. The informant described it as a bright white light, approximately 30 feet in diameter. It moved silently, making rapid and erratic maneuvers, darting back and forth and up and down. At times it appeared to be hovering motionless. Then it would dart off at great speed, only to return moments later and resume the hovering pattern. 

No sound was heard from the object, and it displayed no visible means of propulsion. The informant states that he has never seen anything like it before, and is quite perplexed by the experience. He is requesting that the authorities look into this sighting and investigate further.

Please advise if any additional information is required. This report is being forwarded for your review and consideration.

Sincerely,
