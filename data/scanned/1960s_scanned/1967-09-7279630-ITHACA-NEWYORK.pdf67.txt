Dear Major,

I would like to report an unconventional aerial object which I saw on Saturday, Sept. 30, 1967. It was about 11:00 a.m. I was walking with a friend on a bridge in Ithaca, N.Y.(14850) As we were crossing a bridge in Ithaca, he pointed out a luminous yellow dot of light moving across the sky at about the speed of an echo satellite. It was in sight for about one minute during which time it passed in front of a tree. At one point I stopped a man who told us that he couldn't explain it either. It finally gave the appearance of disintegrating when it dropped three or four smaller yellow pieces, which burned out before they reached the ground, until it was "used up".

It was about the brilliancy of an airplane's running lights at night and didn't change speed or brightness. The outline was like that of a bright star. It was at about a 20 degree elevation and west of us then moved to the north. It seemed to be about a mile away. There was no exhaust evidence.

Please don't tell me that I saw an airplane. Planes make noise (this object was silent) and have red and green blinking lights. It wasn't anything more than a few miles away, either, because there was a very hazy curious cloud covering over the whole sky.

I don't think it any kind of balloon because the only place I can imagine that would launch one would be the Cornell University campus, and there was no wind or disturbance that I could see or feel. I hope you can give me some idea of what I saw.

Sincerely,
E. Syracuse, N.Y. 13205
