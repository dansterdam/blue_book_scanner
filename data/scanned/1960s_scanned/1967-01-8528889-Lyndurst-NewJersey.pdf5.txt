DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
HEADQUARTERS 4235TH AIR BASE GROUP (MAC)
MCGUIRE AIR FORCE BASE, NEW JERSEY 08641

SUBJECT: UFO Observations

TO: Headquarters Foreign Technology
Division (Col James C. Manatt)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. We are in receipt of two UFO letters and photos that may be of interest to you. Due to the dates of the observations and the areas covered we feel it is too late for an interview with the individuals concerned.

2. Major was personally interviewed by Major Ross, approximately 2 years ago. When the Base Operations Officer, Major sent photos he had taken at that time but were of the same quantity as the photos included so they were returned to him. There was no action taken at that time.

3. If you feel additional information is needed I shall be only too happy to help in any way possible.

FOR THE COMMANDER
