The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page is as follows:

(4) Velocity: 10 miles.
(1) Sighted in clouds over highway (occasional blinking in clouds southwest).
(2) Disappeared into temperature 75Â°.
2. No unusual activity or conditions which might account for the sighting.
3. No intersection or identification taken locally.
4. No local information available as to air traffic or balloon releases which could possibly have accounted for the sighting in this area.
1. Use to distance from the area in question (approximately 3 1/2 miles) indicated that this object, unlike meteors, did not have the speed and acceleration characteristics of meteors or other objects commonly classed as meteors (did not develop to larger size or break up into smaller units).
2. Apparently this was considered a bona fide sighting and thus no interpretation or explanation offered in the report. The report is simply a factual account of the events as reported by the observer.
