Description of the incoming light at approximately 8:00 p.m. on August 28, 1966. The light was first observed in the southwest by the observer and several others at the time. The light remained stationary for a few minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed to the northeast, where it disappeared from view. The light appeared to be about the size of a basketball and was whitish-yellow in color. It did not appear to have any blinking or flashing lights. The observer stated that the light appeared to be much higher than an aircraft and was unlike any aircraft he had ever seen before. He indicated that the light's acceleration and disappearance were more rapid than any aircraft he had observed. The observer concluded that the light was an unidentified flying object.
