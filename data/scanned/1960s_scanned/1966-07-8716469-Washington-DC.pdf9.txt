The image does not contain any photograph, it appears to be a handwritten document from an old UFO report.

The text in the document is as follows:

"34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object was a solid saucer shape and was illuminated from within. It moved silently and with no apparent disturbance of the air or ground below.
It appeared to be under intelligent control and maneuvered in a manner impossible for any known aircraft.

Please feel free to consult me on this matter if you need any further information."
