Dear sir:
May 15, 1967 received information that....
Several factors including lack of additional evidence make impossible to add significance
to the witness testimony.
Indicate that facts do not warrant further investigation
The report does not warrant additional effort in view of insubstantial nature of information given....
An in-depth analysis would not provide sufficient additional data to permit a conclusive evaluation.
The information was so limited, investigation could add very little....
Therefore it is concluded that the case does not warrant further investigation and the file will be closed. The

Thank you for your cooperation at this time.
Sincerely yours,
