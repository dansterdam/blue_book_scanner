The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch appears to be a compass rose with a line drawing of a landscape below it. The text in the image is part of an old UFO report document and gives instructions for the observer to fill out, including sketching the motion of the observed object and indicating the direction it was moving.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course of the observation.

29. IF there was MORE than ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
