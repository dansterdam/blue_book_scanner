The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, with handwritten responses to various questions about an unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

(Handwritten response)
A figure - path - bright light - disappear more - brighter after 1-2 seconds

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

(Handwritten response)
Circular - full bright changing to dull and was somewhat larger than star and with greater intensity

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object could have been covered by the match head?

(Handwritten response)
Covered from a little less than a full match head and was somewhat brighter and larger than a star

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

(Handwritten response)
No - the object remained in sight - became dimmer and disappeared

24. In order that you can give a clear picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

(Handwritten response)
Nothing I have ever seen before. Something totally unusual. Appeared to be lighted up and came to a point at the top and bottom. Not a star, plane, satellite or known object. Seemed to have no known form or shape of any known object but had the appearance of a flying object, lighted in some unusual manner never seen before to me. Moved in an unusual manner.
