The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text in the document reads:

Frankly, I don't see how they could miss it.(Then again, it was seen it since I reported it Sunday night.) Actually, my sighting was at no time able to make out the shape that was with the lights. I had the object at very much closer from a distance. I took no telescope or pair of binoculars identically, there were good sightings in this last fall, although I did not see any of them myself. They were seen to the north of my location. I hope this will be of some value to your work. Being a not
scientist, I do not think some additional study of unexplained phenomena.
