The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an affidavit or official document related to a UFO sighting by an individual named Alexander Hamilton.

The text in the document is as follows:

see the cursed thing, with its big lights and hideous people.
I don't know whether they are devils or angels, or what; but
we all saw them, and my whole family saw the ship, and I
don't want any more to do with them.

Hamilton has long been a resident of Kansas and is known
all over Woodson, Allen, Coffey and Anderson counties. He
was a member of the House of Representatives. He staked his
sacred honor upon the truth of his story. An affadavit
follows: As there are now, always have been and always will
be skeptics and unbelievers whenever the truth of anything
bordering on the improbable is presented, and knowing that
some ignorant or suspicious people will doubt the truthfulness of the above statement, now, therefore we, the undersigned, do hereby make the following affadavit: That we
have known Alexander Hamilton from one to thirty years,
and that for truth and veracity we have never heard his
word questioned, and that we do verily believe his statement
to be true and correct.
