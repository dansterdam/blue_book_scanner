The image contains two diagrams. The larger diagram on the top appears to be a compass or direction indicator, with various compass points labeled around the edge. The smaller diagram on the bottom appears to be a landscape illustration, showing a figure standing in a field or landscape with mountains or hills in the background.

AS NOW IMAGINE WHAT SHAPE THE OBJECT IS AND HOW IT MOVED, INDICATE BY A DAUB AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND INDICATE BY ARROWS THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THIS BE DONE ACCURATELY, FOR THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWS WHETHER IT WAS ROTATING, OSCILLATING. OR MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE, ETC.
