The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or document from Project Blue Book, describing an incident where the pilot of an aircraft observed unusual lights and weather conditions. The text describes the pilot's observations, noting that the lights were not part of the aircraft and that the overall flight was normal, except for a 15-second period when the aircraft appeared to be in a "light seam".

The text from the document is as follows:

PAGE 2 RUNWAY WAS UNCLAS BILITY WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 MILES IN OBSCURED OR HAZE WEATHER CONDITIONS AT APPROXIMATELY 2143 LOCAL TIME. THERE WAS NO ACTUAL SIGHTING OF ANY OBJECT OR OBJECTS BUT WE DID NOTICE THE SURROUNDING OUTSIDE AREA LIGHT UP. THE CO-PILOT THOUGHT THAT THE PILOT HAD TURNED ON THE LANDING LIGHTS, WHICH WAS NOT SO, AND THAT THE LIGHTS WERE REFLECTIONS ON THE HAZE. WEATHER CONDITIONS TO THE PILOT, WHO WAS NOT UNDER THE HOOD, IT SEEMED SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE, WITHOUT ANY DIRECT BEAM, BUT AS IF THE ENTIRE AIRCRAFT WAS IN A LIGHT SEAM. THE ILLUMINATION WAS NOT BRILLIANT ENOUGH TO CAUSE BLINDNESS AND LASTED THE MOST FOR 15 SECONDS. THIS WAS THE TOTAL SUM OF OUR OBSERVATIONS AND THE REST OF THE FLIGHT WAS NORMAL.
