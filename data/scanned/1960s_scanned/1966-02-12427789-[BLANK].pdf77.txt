SUBJECT: Analysis of Metallic Sphere

TO: TDEW (Sgt Moody)

1. On 17 Feb 1965 Sgt Moody of the FTD delivered a metallic sphere to the Materials Engineering Division for analysis. Examination of this sphere is as follows:

a. Consists of two hemispheres held together with 4 set-screws.

b. Approximately 9" in diameter (OD).

c. Weighs 23.99 pounds.

d. Wall thickness approximately 1".

e. Density is such that it would readily sink in water.

f. Sphere is an aluminum (195 casting alloy) casting that has been machined and polished. External finish was a black paint. Set screws are steel, 1/4 diameter; 28 threads per inch with Allen wrench head fittings, recognized as Standard American. Steel alloy is of the 4130 series type.

g. This container was apparently designed for compressive loads. The design is such that it would not be suitable for internal gas pressures because of the relatively weak method of closure.

h. There are no external connections, hooks, eyes, entry ports or markings other than the machining tool marks.

i. There is evidence that a gasket had been used at the closure flange although no gasket material remained.
