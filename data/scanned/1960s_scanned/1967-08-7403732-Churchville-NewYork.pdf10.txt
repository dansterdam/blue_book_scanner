SINCE WE ARE UPON THE AERIAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT COME TO SEE WHAT WE HAVE WITH HIS REGARDING THIS IMPORTANT MATTER, I DECIDED TO WRITE TO YOU AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IF THE GOVERNMENT WOULD CONTACT ANY INVESTIGATOR OR CIE, I BELIEVE THEY WOULD FIND IT ALL MOST INTERES-TING AND REAL. 
IT IS VERY HAPPY TO THINK SOME ONE WILL AT LAST LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
