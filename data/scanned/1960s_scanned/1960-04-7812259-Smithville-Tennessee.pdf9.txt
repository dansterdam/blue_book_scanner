On April 24, at Plymouth a large group of persons sighted a bluish-green flying object, saucer-shaped over Cape Cod and eastern Massachusetts. 

The UFO was described as a large saucer-shaped object with many bright lights. It suddenly appeared to the south and receding rapidly towards the north. The object was said to be much larger than a jet aircraft and was brightly illuminated.
