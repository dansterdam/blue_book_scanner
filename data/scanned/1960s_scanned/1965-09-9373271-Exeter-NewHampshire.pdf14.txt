Mobley's Report: Do We Have Visitors from Outer Space?
BY JACK MOBLEY

WILLARD LIBBY, Nobel prize winner, former University of Chicago professor, new Dean of the School of Engineering at the University of California at Los Angeles, stated in the September Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that "it is my considered belief that life on other stellar systems is very common".

The report describes an unidentified flying object sighted in Exeter, New Hampshire on September 3, 1965. It was reported by a columnist, Exeter police officers, and others. The object was described as bright red and flashing. It made a buzzing sound and performed maneuvers. The police officers tried to approach it but it moved away quickly.

The report also mentions an earlier sighting on the same date in Exeter, where an unidentified object was spotted by a woman. It was described as silvery and wobbling. When police arrived, the object had disappeared.

The report includes statements from the officers involved, including Officer Bertrand who described the object and his attempt to approach it. It also mentions that there was no noise or wind associated with the object.
