The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a detailed description of a UFO sighting. The text describes an oval-shaped object 50 to 60 feet long, emitting a white light with five bright lights blinking in between. The object had a vapor trail with sparks and five flames that emerged one at a time, with the largest one disappearing last. The object was observed at a 105 angle south of the observer, and flew horizontally towards the sea for about 3/4 mile before disappearing instantaneously.
