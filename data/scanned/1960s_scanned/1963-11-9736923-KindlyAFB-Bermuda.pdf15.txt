Dear Mr. Harvey:

The Air Force has completed an investigation made at your request, of an unusual aerial phenomena reported in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, area on November 12, 1953. 

U.S. Air Force Technical Information Forms were furnished to Deputy Sheriff's Robert Baker and Harold Clark in order that they could provide an account as detailed as possible of the sighting. Upon receipt of their reports, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director, Dearborn Observatory, Northwestern University, and civilian observatory consultants to the Air Force on the UAP program, talked by telephone with Deputy Baker. As a result of this conversation, and of Deputy Baker's reports, it is believed that the sighting was a helicopter. While efforts to identify a specific helicopter proved negative, one had been observed during daylight hours in the area, and their stories of the observations were carried in local newspapers.

Sincerely,
