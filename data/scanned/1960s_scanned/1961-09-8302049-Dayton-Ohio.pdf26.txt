This image does not contain any photographs. It consists of two sketches - one showing a curved line and scattered objects, and the other showing a person on a road with buildings and mountains in the background. The image appears to be part of a Project Blue Book document from 1961.

The text in the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
