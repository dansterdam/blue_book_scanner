4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
7. COURSE: 
8. SPEED: 
9. PHOTOS: None
10. CONCLUSION: Visual: Possible Other (BLANKA) Possible Other (BLANKA)
There was no radar contact or known air traffic in the area at that time. The object was first sighted and its distance away examined for over 3 minutes. However, a definite size appreciation cannot be obtained due to the lack of known points for comparison. No sound was heard nor physical evidence left. Briefly summarized, the phenomenon was about 3 ft in diameter and about 200 ft away when first sighted. The object's speed was estimated by the observers at 1/4 to 1/100 of a second. However, there is some question in the minds of the observers as to the accuracy of this estimate because the object displayed a pulsating or fluttering motion reminiscent of auto headlight reflections.
