1. At the request of Colonel Smith, Technology Division (DMAUG/UFO), he has reviewed the sighting report on the UFO sighted on 15 Mar 65 at Lincoln AFB. There was a scheduled weather balloon release between 1925 and 1935 on 15 Mar 65.

2. It is the opinion of Colonel Smith that the sighting reported can be attributed to the scheduled weather balloon and that the object observed is consistent with the characteristics of that type of equipment. There is no evidence to indicate that this was an extra-ordinary or unknown aerial phenomenon.
