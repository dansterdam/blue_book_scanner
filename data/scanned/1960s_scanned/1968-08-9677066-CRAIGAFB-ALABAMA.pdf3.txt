1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report that occurred at Craig AFB, Alabama on 15 August 1968 at 0538 GMT, 10332.

2. Approximately 20 flight line personnel sighted a white light near runway 14. The light remained in a stationary position for several minutes, then moved rapidly up and down the runway, then climbed at a 45 degree angle and disappeared from view. The light was observed at approximately 2 to 3 degrees above the horizon and remained in view for approximately 2 to 3 minutes.

3. We understand that you had a rocket launch at 10:30Z. We would like to know if your activity did launch a rocket launch at this time. If it could appear similar to the description given by the observers, and if you feel that it could have been observed from Craig AFB (420 nautical miles away).

4. Thank you for your assistance; it is appreciated.
