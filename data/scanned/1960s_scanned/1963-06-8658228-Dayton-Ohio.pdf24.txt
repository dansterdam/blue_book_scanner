June 1963, Case 13 - This happened especially since it occurred in Dayton, a little more digging, the committee was shown the complete film record of object, even though no film was used, that probably corresponds to the time of launching or weather
Otherwise, in the first part of June, 1963, the committee is in remarkably good agreement. The arrangement is good. I wish we could have no meeting this week since I was in New Mexico and the father of one of the committee members died - Nancy Van Heussen family back on the ball this week and try to finish up this year fairly soon. Then back on the schedule like to come.

Cordially,
J. Allen Hynek
