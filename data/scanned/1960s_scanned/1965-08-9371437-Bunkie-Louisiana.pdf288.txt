AF Chased UFO
EDITOR'S NOTEâ€”Mrs. Wm. Goldberg, 8022 Laurel Hill Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif., has submitted the following letter regarding a UFO sighting over Bunkie, La., on Aug. 22, 1965. Her husband, David L. Goldberg, an aerospace engineer, observed the occurrence.

DAVID L. GOLDBERG writes: That's not just a snap of a formation of lights. It's real, and it's the Air Force chasing a UFO over Bunkie, La., on Aug. 22, 1965.

My wife and I were visiting in Bunkie, La., and about 10 p.m. we saw a bright object hovering in the sky. Within a few minutes, two Air Force jets with search lights attached came along and started chasing the object. They followed it for about 20 minutes, making several passes at it, but it evaded them each time. Finally, the jets gave up and left the area.

As we watched this, we realized we were probably witnessing an authentic UFO incident. There's nothing to indicate that this is just a hoax or that the Air Force was playing games. The jets were in hot pursuit of this thing, whatever it was.

Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official UFO investigation agency, has never been able to identify or explain many such incidents. I believe this is one that they will have trouble with.

There is nothing to indicate that what we saw was a hoax or a natural phenomenon. It was clearly a structured craft, intelligently controlled, that outmaneuvered the jets with ease. The Air Force obviously took it seriously enough to scramble jets to chase it.

I'm a 42-year-old aerospace engineer with a good technical background. My wife and I have always been skeptical of UFO claims, but we are convinced now that there are things in our skies that we don't understand. This was a dramatic, undeniable incident.

The sighting was reported to the local sheriff's office and the Air Force, but I don't know what, if anything, they did about it. More people should come forward with their UFO observations. An impression is being created that sightings are rare, when actually they are quite common - mostly in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.

Sightings like this should be carefully investigated by competent authorities. If the Air Force has aircraft that can outmaneuver our best jets, we had better find out about it. And if it's something else, we had better find out about that, too.
