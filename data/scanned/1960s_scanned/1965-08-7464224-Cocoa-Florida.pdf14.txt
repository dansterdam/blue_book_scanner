Mr. Yeah, I am. I'll just take a couple of napkins.
It. Yeah. This is very interesting. There are a couple of other little points that I would like to cover. The size of this diamond formation. I was just about to ask that, if you held your hands - you know - stretched your arms out and opened your hands, would your thumb have covered this diamond formation?

Mr: No - (rest inaudible)

Hr: It was larger than xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx a finger, then, larger than a thumb?

Mr: I don't think it covered it.

Hr: Your hand would have?

Mr: Yeah, my hand would have.

Hr: So, that's good to know. Now, were all the lights in the diamond formation the same brightness, or were some brighter?

Mr: No, they were about the same.

Hr: About the same, yes. And the light that seemed to move from it - how many times the size of the diamond formation did it get away? About/one diamond, two diamonds?

Mr: Well, you see, I didn't - it was about one move from it.

Hr: Oh, you didn't?

Mr: No, to me it was the diamond formation. And that was the one that was off in the west/east the fixed position that I had seen in my headlight.

Mr: How far west? From the thing was it?

Mr: Pretty far - pretty far over.
