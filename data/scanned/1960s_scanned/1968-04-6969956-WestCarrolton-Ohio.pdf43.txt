35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

At about 9:00 oclock I stopped and started to roll for my hogs they came home from my field. I put a big light very bright and so big that I was watching for a plane to come about no matter no noise at all and the light went back and forth and the light was strong only a plane could make a light like that. Clean mind to light the tree's and houses.
