The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document with handwritten text.

a set of bright lights seen as the electric are furnaces at 11:50, and recognition alarms went off at 11:52.

I do not know what this event or sighting was, but I have transcribed the handwritten text from the document as follows:

"a set of bright lights seen as the electric are furnaces at 11:50, and recognition alarms went off at 11:52.

I do not know what this was, but I have phoned it in.
