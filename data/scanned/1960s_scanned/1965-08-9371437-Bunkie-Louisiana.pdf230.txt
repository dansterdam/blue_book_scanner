NON-SCHEDULED NEWSLETTER #24 - August 15th, 1965

TRUCK DRIVER CHASED BY FLYING SAUCER: One of the widest incidents of the current world-wide flap occurred on August 23, 1965. Approximately 10:45 p.m. on Highway 15, carrying a cargo bound for Lincoln, Nebraska, when all of a sudden all of his lights went out. A flying saucer passed over the truck, which at the time was about 2 miles north of Bunkie, Louisiana. The saucer was hovering about 100 feet in front of the truck. Tennopissi screamed on his brakes, thinking the saucer was going to land on the road, but it moved off to the side and about 100 feet in front of the truck. Tennopissi started his motor again. The saucer moved off to the southwest and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. Tennopissi said that it seemed to be about two feet thick, with a four-foot-high hump or some such middle condition may have had an influence. The driver's statement is that he was completely mystified by the experience.
