They called some adults, who arrived in time to see the UFO, which was by that time hovering about fifteen feet above the land. There it remained for several minutes before taking off toward the horizon at an altitude of 500 yards. All the witnesses agreed that the object was shaped like a disc and was about 25 feet in diameter.
