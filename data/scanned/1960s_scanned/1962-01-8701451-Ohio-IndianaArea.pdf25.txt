Report on sighting of flying object
Jan. 3, 1962.
Position seen: Right. Several degrees under E. 6 AZ of N.
Apparent course: W.S.W. - straight line, horizontal.
Disappearance: Sudden. 10 to 15 above horizon W.N.W.
Elapsed time of observation: 3 seconds.
Apparent shape: Round. 
Apparent size: About 1/3 of full moon area. 
Constant diminution to about 25% of original size
at disappearance at which time it was about still several
times larger than Venus at that time of night. 
Color: Brilliant white with narrow green border along outer
edge surrounding a red hot center brilliant core. 
No trail, no sound, no discernible appendages. 
Physically reported by me to Ohio State Highway Patrol. Greenville C
Continuation: Radically different in everything except good farm
motor I have ever seen, including to range on jet or piston and
appearance much stranger. The size, brilliant color, lack of
sound, abrupt appearing and vanishing, added to the apparent
high speed, are quite startling.
