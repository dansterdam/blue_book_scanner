The image on this page of the UFO report document from Project Blue Book does not contain any photographs. It consists of two sketches - one showing a curved line with an arrow pointing to indicate the object's movement, and another larger sketch depicting a road with buildings and a horizon. The second sketch has two smaller inset sketches, one showing a person standing on the road, and the other showing a larger view of the horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
