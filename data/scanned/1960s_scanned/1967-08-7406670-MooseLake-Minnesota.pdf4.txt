AS IT IS A SERIOUS MATTER. WE FEEL WE MUST REPORT. ON AUGUST 7. 1967 AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 P.M. 
WE SIGHTED A LARGE OBJECT HOVERING OVER MOOSE LAKE MINNESOTA. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 40 TO 50 FEET IN DIAMETER AND ILLUMINATED BY A BRILLIANT LIGHT. 
IT APPEARED TO BE METALLIC IN CONSTRUCTION AND HOVERING SILENTLY OVER THE LAKE. 
WE WATCHED IT FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES BEFORE IT SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.
WE ARE REPORTING THIS IN THE INTEREST OF ACCURACY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FACTS. SINCE THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER, WE FEEL FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED.
