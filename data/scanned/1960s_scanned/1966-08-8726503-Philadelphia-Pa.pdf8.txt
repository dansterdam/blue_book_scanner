The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
The object appeared to have gone out of range to the south.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. 
If you answered YES, then tell what: 

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. 
If you answered YES, then tell what: The object flew behind some trees or buildings and then continued on its way.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound The object was silent.
b. Color White.
c. Brightness It was very bright to be seen.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and indicate relative size without trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
It looked like a bright star. Now would not the way to draw this be a simple dot? How would one be able to give the exact shape or size of something so small and distant? It was moving very swiftly.
