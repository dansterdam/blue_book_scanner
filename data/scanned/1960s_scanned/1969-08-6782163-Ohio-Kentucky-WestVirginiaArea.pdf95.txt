Your name has been given to the Aerial Phenomena Office as having reported a sighting called a "fireball" in the early morning hours of 5 August 1969. It is true we would like to complete the investigation of your sighting and return it to us in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. Your report alone with others will then be forwarded to Dr. Charles Oliver who is the head of the American Physical Society. The data contained is then reviewed with those experts who have completed the trajectory of the fireball and the probable impacted point of the meteorite under consideration. Thank you for your cooperation.
