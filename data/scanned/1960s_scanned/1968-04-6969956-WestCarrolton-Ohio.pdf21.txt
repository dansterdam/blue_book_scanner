MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: Balloon Launch (Accidental), 2 Apr 63
At 1230 hours, Lt Col Hippie, AFSPTA, called regarding a balloon that got away at the Holloman AFB. It was a big "V" shaped balloon and may have appeared to be two sausages shaped objects connected at the balloon. He thought that we might have some reports on it since there were plans going around it and following it. The PFI had been notified that it was loose and was in air route. It got away at approximately 8 am local, MST, and was expected to impact around 1230 hours, local. It had gone up to altitudes of 30,000 and at 1230 hours, local was at approximately 15,000 ft alt. If we needed further information we could get it from the balloon launch facilities at Holloman.
