The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, with some text describing an observed object.

The text at the bottom of the page states:
"Spot fix. It was at a 75 high altitude but the object was as up and down so fast it was hard to get accurate measurements. There was a definite light visible at the front end of the object. It hovered at times then moved on."
