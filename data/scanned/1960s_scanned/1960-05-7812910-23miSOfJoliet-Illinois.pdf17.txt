Description: With the exception of the Sun, Jupiter is the largest member of the Solar System. It is a giant gaseous planet, much larger than the Earth. Its diameter is nearly 11 times that of the Earth. Jupiter's shape is elliptical with a polar flattening of about 1/15 its diameter. The latitude of Jupiter is about 44% which means a high reflectivity of incident light making it often the brightest object in the night sky. It is yellow with several narrow parallel belts of different color. A slight darkening of the limb farthest from the sun can be observed.
