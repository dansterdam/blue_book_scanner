SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object

TO: ATIC-AP-2

The following describes information from Cape Farrell's report dated 25 Nov 59:

1700 hours, received a call from Sgt. Brock who stated, 3379th, that while on patrol near Bellingham he sighted a greenish-white round object, approximately 20-30 feet in diameter, that was very bright and seemed to have a dull hazy glow around it. The object shot straight up and then accelerated off to the south and disappeared in 2-3 seconds. Capt Farrell investigated the sighting and found Sgt. Brock to be a reliable observer. Brock stated that the object was around 1000 yards away and seemed to be around 500-600 feet in altitude. Brock had 15 minutes prior to this sighting seen another unidentified object in the same general area.
