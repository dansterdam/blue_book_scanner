The image contains two illustrations:

1. The main illustration is a compass rose diagram, which appears to be an instructions guide on how to indicate the direction of an observed phenomenon using a compass. The diagram shows the 16 cardinal and intercardinal directions labeled.

2. The bottom portion of the image contains two sketches depicting a person's field of view when observing a phenomenon. The sketch on the left shows a wide panoramic view, while the sketch on the right shows a more focused, close-up view.
