The image contains a sketch diagram, but no photograph. The diagram shows a curved line with angles marked on it, as well as a compass rose. The text instructs the viewer to imagine they are at the point shown, and to place markers on the curved line to indicate the height and direction of an observed object above the horizon.

Project Blue Book Text:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a figure that will show the motion of the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
