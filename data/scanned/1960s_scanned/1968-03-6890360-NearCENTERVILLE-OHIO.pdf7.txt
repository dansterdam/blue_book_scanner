The image appears to contain a scanned document or page from a UFO report. There is no photograph present in this particular page. 

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object appeared to slowly disappear through the haze. It seemed to fade out of sight.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:
The object never moved behind anything that I noticed.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:
The object remained stationary during the sighting.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: No sound that I could hear.
b. Color: Appeared to be white or light grey in color.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you have determined this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The object appeared to be quite small, perhaps covering only 2 or 3 degrees of the field of view.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially show the direction the object was moving.
[A hand-drawn sketch is provided, showing the object as a simple sphere-like shape with a dotted trail or vapor trail.]
