No Flying Objects Seen in Tehama County Last Night
RED BLUFF, Calif. (AP) - "Those, a sonic boom. None was heard." 
Jack Stewart, a San Francisco newspaperman, his and his wife saw mysterious flying objects "like luminous meteors" near here Sunday night. But state highway patrolmen did not make an appearance last night. The county sheriff's deputies said they never did make an appearance on an "official call" Sunday night.
"The only clue-type spokesman said they never saw any searchlights near Mineral, just west of Red Bluff.
"Almost every week, local citizens report seeing "flying objects" flitting at "terrific" speed without making a sound. 
Almost two dozen others said they were with Stewart and his wife when they saw the objects last Sunday night in the Mineral area. TV newscaster Gonzales said the things flew in a circular formation, brilliant white with a red spot or spots. He said they were traveling unbelievably fast and moving at simply unbelievable speed - so fast that "they didn't make a sound." 
If an object exceeds the speed of sound it will create a sonic boom.
