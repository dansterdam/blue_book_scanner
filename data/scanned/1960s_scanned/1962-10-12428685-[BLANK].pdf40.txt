There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

As we night, Meteors have been observed during the day as well as at night. Trails of smoke have often been left during the day. But this is not always the case, the observers state.  

Bolides are a class of meteor that are either heard or seen to explode. If accompanied by sound, the sound may be likened to a "whoosh" or rumbling, humming or descriptive word that indicates the sound is distinctive, but does not resemble thunder.  

The sound may not always be associated with the bolide, and the observers decide to disregard the sound for the sighting. The sight alone may be used to classify the sighting.There are occasions when a change of direction may be noted for several of the bolides.

3. Stars and Planets

Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and even the moon and stars (under a variety of circumstances) have been reported as UFO's. Again it should be emphasized that the most frequent reports are of unidentified objects that have an extremely long duration with little motion. It is likely that the observers look for the object at the same time on succeeding nights. Reports of short duration do not seem to establish themselves as identifiable stars or planets.

4. Other Causes  

Ball lightning, mirages, parhelia and parasiolenes, and comets and aurora are some other phenomena which may be mistaken and reported as UFOs. These and certain other rare or unknown natural phenomena are often viewed under unusual circumstances and reported as an UFO.
