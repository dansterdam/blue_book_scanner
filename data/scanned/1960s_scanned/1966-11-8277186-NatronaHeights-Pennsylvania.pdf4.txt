I was driving home from work at about 2:00 a.m. when I noticed a strange light in the sky. At first I thought it was an aircraft, but as I continued to watch, I realized it was not an ordinary aircraft. The object was stationary and seemed to hover in the sky. It was circular in shape and had a dull glow. I stopped my car and observed the object for a few minutes. It then suddenly shot off at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight within seconds. I made no sound during this time. When I arrived home, I called the local police to report what I had seen, but they did not seem very interested. I have no other information to add, except that I am a rational person and have never seen anything like this before. I hope this report is of some use to your investigation."
