The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, specifically a "WINDS-ALOFT COMPUTATION SHEET (LAND-STATION FORM)" that includes a table with various data fields such as Elevation Angle, Distance from Observation Point, and Observed Speed.
