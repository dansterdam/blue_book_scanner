THE PERSON SAID THAT HE NOTICED THE OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE TREES AND STOPPED HIS CAR TO OBSERVE IT. HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ROUND OR CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND WAS A DULL SILVER OR GREY COLOR. HE SAID THAT IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY TO SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER AND THAT IT WAS HOVERING AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. HE SAID THAT IT SEEMED TO BE ROTATING SLOWLY AS IT HOVERED. 

HE SAID THAT HE WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND THAT DURING THAT TIME IT MADE NO NOISE AND DID NOT SEEM TO BE PROPELLED BY ANY VISIBLE MEANS. HE SAID THAT WHEN HE FIRST OBSERVED IT, IT WAS HOVERING MOTIONLESS, BUT THAT IT THEN BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. HE SAID THAT AS IT MOVED, IT MAINTAINED THE SAME ALTITUDE AND THAT IT APPEARED TO BE GLIDING OR DRIFTING RATHER THAN POWERED FLIGHT. HE SAID THAT AFTER MOVING FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE, IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

HE SAID THAT HE WAS VERY SURPRISED AND PUZZLED BY WHAT HE SAW AND THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT THAT WOULD MATCH THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HE SAW.
