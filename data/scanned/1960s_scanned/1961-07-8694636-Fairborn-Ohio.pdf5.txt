The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. The text on the page contains various questions and instructions related to observing and describing unidentified objects or phenomena. Some of the key elements described include:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion path of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction along the course.

21. If POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One:): a. Pea, b. Head of a pin, c. Dime, d. Nickel, e. Quarter, f. Half dollar.

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you would construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which would give the same general impression as the one you saw.

The rest of the text on the page appears to be a survey or questionnaire related to the observation and description of unidentified objects.
