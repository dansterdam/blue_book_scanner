Dear Sir:

Concerning your investigation into the sighting of an unidentified flying object on Dec. 6, 1963. 

I would like to report an object I saw can the evening of Dec. 7, 1963.

Special sheets to provide to people who have seen these things. Is it possible to fill one out?

Thank you very much for your time and trouble.

Sincerely yours,

P.S. I am sorry to delay this so long, but the events of the following day delayed this, and it has been delayed until now.
