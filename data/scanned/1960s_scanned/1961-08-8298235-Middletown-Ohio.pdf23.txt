The image does not contain any photographs, but rather includes two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marked on it, and instructions on how to use the sketch to determine the position of an observed object relative to the horizon. The second sketch shows two larger sketches, one depicting a person standing on a road with buildings and mountains in the background, and a smaller inset sketch showing a silhouette of a person against a landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
