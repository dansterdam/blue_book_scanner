"SATURN SHINES IN SOUTH"

The text describes the visibility of the planet Saturn and the star Vega in the evening sky during the summer. It provides details about their positions in the night sky and the brightness of Saturn.

The two maps or charts show the positions of celestial objects, likely related to the observations described in the text. One chart appears to depict a broader view of the night sky, while the other is a more detailed view of a specific region.
