E. SPECIFIY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR STEET LAMPS, ETC. FOR TERRESTRIAL ILLUMINATION, SPECIFY DISTANCE TO LIGHT SOURCE.
PHENOMENAL APPEARED TO BE SELF-LUMINOUS, EMITTING A LIGHT OF THEIR OWN 

12. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT APPEARED TO MANOEUVER, HOW IT APPEARED TO COME INTO VIEW AND HOW IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. ALSO INDICATE ANY PECULIARITIES OR COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR OTHER KNOWN OBJECT OR LIGHT.
Phenomenal appeared to be self-luminous, emitting a light of their own. Considered to be somewhat larger than a star, very much brighter, and seemed more to remain in a position, faint the entire time for approximately 20-30 seconds, and then just seemed to vanish. So it was much slower in movement than a shooting star or meteor and seemed to possess a glow rather than a spark as a shooting star. Scenery illuminated by this "glow" could be observed, indicating the light source was very close to the ground.
