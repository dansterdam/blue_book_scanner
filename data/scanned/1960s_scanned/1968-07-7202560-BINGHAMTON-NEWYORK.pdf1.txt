CONCLUSION:
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted an "oblong object" (1) that had a dropping light. COMMENTS: The observer submitted his report on a AF Form 117, but does not need to be run and GRAPHIC separately. The report itself is somewhat confusing. A Form 117 was not submitted to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) as there may be no evidence to confirm the sighting carried out as investigation.
