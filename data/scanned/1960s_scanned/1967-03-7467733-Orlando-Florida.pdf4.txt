The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

H. The local planetarium reported the planets Mars and Jupiter both red in appearance, were in the area of the sightings.

I. N/A

J. None reported.

K. NCOIC, Ground Training Section, Operations and Training 13500th Air Base Group, Orlando AFB, Florida. The investigation at the Central Florida Museum and Planetarium of Orlando. The planetarium did not actually observe the objects covered by the report, he felt certain the two objects reported were the same as Jupiter that have been actually observed at the time of year and location. I believe the sightings were the planets Mars and Jupiter.
