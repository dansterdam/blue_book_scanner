Parent New Swiss Drug
Used for Leprosy Patients

BASEL (DPA) - The Swiss pharmaceutical firm Geigy has developed a new drug, "Dapsone", to fight leprosy. The drug is said to be a hundred times more effective than the hitherto customary preparations and also works against tuberculosis.

Dapsone has already been used successfully in the USA and in Italy for leprosy cure. In Switzerland it is to be tested for the first time in the Basel Leprosy Hospital. The drug, first used in 1954, is practically free of side effects and, unlike other drugs against leprosy, does not cause poisoning, first noticed on humans in Switzerland.

The drug called Dapsone is in Basel, Switzerland, effectively used to treat leprosy and tuberculosis. It is said to be 100 times more effective than previous preparations and has fewer side effects.

Parlor Game of Feinting
No "Harm" for Players

PAINTING is Britain is now a parlor game. The object is to try to get the sitter to "faint" from the tediousness of posing as a model for the painter.

In the British Medical Journal, Dr. J. T. Boughey cites cases of the "parlor game." He says that painting sittings may produce an hysterical reaction in the sitter, especially if he or she dislikes art or the artist. The strain of keeping still for long periods, the monotony, the lack of social intercourse may lead the sitter to feint, or pretend to faint, according to Dr. Boughey. He comments that he has not come across any serious after-effects from this harmless "parlor game."
