UFO REPORT From the 351st NORAD Region. Date: 7 August 1965. Time: Approximately 0250Z. Location: Whiteman AFB, Missouri. Observed an object round in shape, appeared to be white or lighthit, resembled a clear glass or crystal ball. Altitude 8-10 thousand feet and about 3/4 mile southeast. Objects color red, green and white, high intensity of light source very slowly at approximately 10 knots. Observed in the area for about 20-30 minutes then it disappeared. The object was too fast to be identified as an aircraft. It was moving at an extremely fast rate of speed. The object showed a blue-white pulsing or flashing light high and to the rear (west?) Bearing approximately 210 degrees. Velocity fast enough to present an arc when observed. Size estimated between 9-100 feet and two or on duty in the control tower and this report was submitted as it was observed and recommended for investigation. 1) 036 degrees to 105 miles from Salina, Kansas: Still holding 12,000 feet. Indicated altitude 10,000 feet. Slightly evasive, heading 085 degrees 1.7 miles Indicated speed 550 knots. 2) 084 degrees to 95 miles from Sioux City, Iowa - Very bright white light pulsating at 2-3 times per second altitude and heading unknown. Indicate that you may or may not have seen it. No, it might have succeeded to have first started observing it described to be moving in a certain direction. Now it's holding steady on a southeasterly heading. I don't think that this would happen on its own. OK. Thank you.
