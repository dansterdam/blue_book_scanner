"an effort was made to do some more measuring byt the field was quite wet and too rough for a very good reading. there were no shots of the object at this time but a number were taken later when it had moved to another position. the object appeared to be at about 1200 yards range and to be hovering at an altitude of about 300-400 feet. it was rough,irregular in shape and seemed to change in outline - it was a dull color and not shiny or metallic in appearance. rather it appeared to be of some dull,dark material. the object seemed to be quite substantial and solid, not like a balloon or cloud or other such object. it simply hovered,changing its outline slightly and moving in a somewhat erratic fashion - it would move rapidly for a short distance then hover and then move again. at one point it made a jump or sudden movement of about 100 yards. this jumping or jerky motion was quite different from the gradual drifting motion it had shown previously. there was no sound at all from the object. after the shots were taken it continued to hover and move about for approximately 30 minutes and then seemed to become dimmer and dimmer until it finally faded from view and could no longer be seen."
