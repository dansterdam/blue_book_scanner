Gentlemen:
My name is [redacted] and I would like to submit the following report.
On August 22, 1966, at approximately 7:30 p.m., my [redacted] and I were observing the moon with my telescope in our back yard. As we glanced into the sky we noticed that appeared to be a star moving very rapidly. As it came closer we noticed it was no star. It seemed to be an unidentifiable object. My friend noticed the object had two lights on one side, one white and one red. The object was oblong in shape. As it passed over us, I noticed the main rectangular part of the craft. It seemed to give off a greenish-white light. When the object was nearest to us, I noticed the main rectangular part of the craft. It seemed to give off a greenish-white light. When the object was nearest to us, I noticed the main rectangular part of the craft. After it was past us and starting to go away, I noticed the two lights, still one white and one red, on the object. The object then began to speed up and was soon beyond the range of the telescope. It curved and finally disappeared beyond the horizon.
Very recently I reported this sighting to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and this committee was very interested in the report.
In order that the object might become more clear, I have drawn a diagram I hope will illustrate the sighting. Would you please give me your personal opinion of the sighting?
Yours truly,
