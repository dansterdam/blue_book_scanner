As soon as it went down behind the trees, we got into my car and drove over to the tower. We could find no sign of it after that, although we watched for it for quite a while. It was dark, so we couldn't see it very well without lights. For we were hardly out of sight of the tower, where we were trying to drive out to. The light seemed to possess the same puzzles as before. When they are in the air I usually hear them before I see them. They are several lake control flights in the Bloomington area. I have carried on a private investigation, making frequent trips to the airport. That was perhaps a month ago. This wasn't anything out of the ordinary.
