THE VISUAL OBSERVATION DURATION WAS ALMOST INDEFINITE AS AT THE BATTLE AREA WAS VERY DARK AND MANY STARS WERE VISIBLE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY AND EMITTING A HIGH-INTENSITY LIGHT ON THE OBJECT ITSELF. WITNESS REPORTED THAT BUDDY AIR CREW MEMBERS FROM ANOTHER AIRCRAFT ALSO OBSERVED AND REPORTED IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO GET ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OR IDENTIFICATION DETAILS WHILE AIRBORNE. DATA OTHER THAN THE TEMPERATURE INVERSION WAS REPORTED WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO VERIFY. THE CONDITION OF NIGHT VISION CAPABILITY WHICH WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THIS PARTICULAR OBSERVATION WOULD INDICATE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED UNLESS OTHER "UFO" SIGHTINGS ARE REPORTED.
