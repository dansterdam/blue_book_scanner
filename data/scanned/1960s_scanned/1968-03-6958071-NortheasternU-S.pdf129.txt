MEM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968 

The observer was flying over London, Kentucky, VOR at 10,500 ft (about 13:1 miles south of Cincinatti VOR) wherein first sighted the objects to the west at what appeared to be 18,000 to 20,000 ft. The time was 0500 pm and the object was in sight for about 8 minutes duration. When the objects passed in front of the observer they seemed to be about 60 deg single with the horizon. Others seemed to be along side, and one was trailing the others. The observer compared the sightings to lights shining on contrails. When first seen there were numerous lights but some of the lights went out after they had passed. It seemed like the observer was passing well below the objects.

The course of the objects was at about a 75 deg heading. The objects just seemed to fade out of sight before going over the horizon.
