Air Force UFO form continued 

I planted my car and went on to a near-by field where I could get a better view. As I watched, the object was hovering, motionless, about a mile away. There were no lights visible on it. I observed the object for about 5 minutes before it suddenly shot straight up at a very high speed and disappeared. I called the local police station to report what I had seen, but they told me there was nothing they could do about it. I am convinced I saw a flying saucer. The object was disc-shaped and seemed larger than a car. It made no sound that I could hear from the distance I was viewing it. I called the Air Force base near here, but they said they had no record of the incident and were not interested in investigating it further.
