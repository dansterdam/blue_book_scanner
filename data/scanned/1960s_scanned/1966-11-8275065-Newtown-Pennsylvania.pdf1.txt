10. CONCLUSION 
Astro (Sirius)
At the time of the sighting Sirius was rising. Observer noted a glowing red-green light in the eastern sky. Object was sighted about 25 minutes and disappeared, then came back down to the original spot, repeating this cycle. The Big Dipper was not in the sky at the time of the observation. The disappearance of the light and reappearance was consistent with the apparent motion of Sirius, the falling point of which could account for the "bottom of the dipper" appearance.
