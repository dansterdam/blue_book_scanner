The image shows a black and white photograph depicting a night sky with some faint stars visible. There are three distinct streaks of light that appear to be moving across the sky, suggesting the presence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The background appears to be dark, with no clear indication of any other objects or landmarks.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969. This image appears to be a page from one of the reports produced as part of that investigation.

UFOS OBSERVED AT APALACHICOLA, FLORIDA 
OBSERVATIONS: At approximately 10:30 pm, EDT, on 6 August 1967, three elongated lights, traveling in a straight line and at a constant speed, were observed moving across the sky in a general NE to SW direction. The objects appeared to be at a high altitude and were observed for approximately 60 seconds before disappearing from view.
The lights were described as being elongated in shape, yellowish in color, and emitting no trail. The objects maintained a constant speed and direction throughout the observation period.
EXPLANATION: No explanation for the observed objects is offered. The objects did not conform to the characteristics of any known aircraft, satellite, or other natural phenomena. The objects were viewed by several reliable observers, and their descriptions were consistent. The report is considered to be of sufficient credibility to warrant further investigation.
