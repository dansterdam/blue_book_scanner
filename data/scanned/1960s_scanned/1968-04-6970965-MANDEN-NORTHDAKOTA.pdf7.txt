Metal Falls on Area Farm
Route, Mandan, has a curious piece of flat, aluminum-like metal that fell on the farm of C. "R" Watkins on his farm, Mandan, Wednesday night according the U.S. Weather Bureau in Bismarck who looked at the fragment.
HAVERKAMP, a fireman at the Mandan plant north of Mandan, has three miles north of Mandan.
"My wife says this particle fell like a drop of water, when she was backing out of the yard to go to get me at work," Haverkamp said.
It was glowing about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday.
"It was glowing just like a falling star," he said.
The next morning Haverkamp said he was hunting trapped gophers in the area where this had landed this on the ground about 25 feet from the house and in the same direction that his wife said she saw the glowing fragment fall.
Haverkamp said there was an imprint on the ground where the piece fell. He said he had been over the area a few days before and he would have spotted the fragment if it had been there then.
THE FLAT PIECE is about 14 inches long, 8 inches at the thickest part, he said, describing it, and shaped and sawed into the metal and it has a silver shine under its scratched exterior.
Haverkamp says he doesn't know what it is. But he said he plans to find out if possible. He said the plan is to send it to Bismarck Junior College for examination or send it anywhere where analysis can be made.
All this point, he's not speculating on what this piece of a "flying saucer."
