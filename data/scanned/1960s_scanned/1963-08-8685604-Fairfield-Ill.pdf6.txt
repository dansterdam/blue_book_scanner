Gentlemen:

I am writing this letter for two reasons, to give and to receive information. I want to report two unidentified flying objects which were sighted in Wayne County Illinois.

I was about 2 miles northwest of St. Elmo, Illinois, on Highway 33, on Saturday November 2, 1953 A.D. The time was approximately 6:15 p.m. Central Standard Time. The objects were about 25 degrees above the southwest horizon. They were visible for about 10 to 15 minutes. They were traveling in an undulating or oscillating motion, going up and down at irregular intervals. They did not blink or show any lights. The objects appeared to be metallic in color and were the size of a B-29 bomber. They were separated by about one half mile and showed no vapor trails.

As they passed overhead, I did not hear any sound. At one point, the compass in my car is unreliable. Not having any other instruments, I would say the object obtained a characteristic glow from it. We watch it for around 15 minutes until they passed out of sight.

Now I would like to know some things about the August 17, 1953, sightings in the Fairfield area. I will appreciate any information you can give me. However, I do not seem to have done such a good job in my observation as I would like. Therefore, I am turning to you.
