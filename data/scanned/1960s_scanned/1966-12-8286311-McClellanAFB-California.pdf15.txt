The image contains a technical diagram and instructions related to observing and describing unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The diagram appears to be from an official U.S. Air Force document, likely related to Project Blue Book, the historical program that investigated UFO reports.

The text output from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Make an "X" on the compass rose to show the direction from which the object came.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? MORE THAN ONE. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
