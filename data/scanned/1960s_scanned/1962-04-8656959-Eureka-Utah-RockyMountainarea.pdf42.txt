SOURCE: WITNESS ONLY KNOWN
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES
NARRATIVE: At approximately 2020 hours on 15 April 1962, a woman reported observing an unidentified aerial phenomenon in the Rocky Mountain area near Eureka, Utah. The witness stated that the object appeared to be a long cylindrical shape similar to a "cigarette" and was illuminated. The object appeared to be in the distance and hovered for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view.
ANALYSIS: The reported observation appears to be that of a rather common phenomenon, possibly a meteorological or astronomical event, rather than an unusual or unidentified aerial object. No further investigation is considered necessary.
