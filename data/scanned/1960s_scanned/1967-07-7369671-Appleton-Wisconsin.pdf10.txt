RE: UFO Report, Appleton, Wisconsin, 7 July 1967

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Attached find a copy of the report received by us from Greg Verhoeven, which you will note he reports on 9 July 1967 at 10:00 P.M. (Presumably when he made the observations which he would like to report.) We can offer no explanation for the phenomena, nor have we had any other reports at that time on a UFO being sighted.

Sincerely,
E.O. Wolff
Chief, Appleton Department of Police
