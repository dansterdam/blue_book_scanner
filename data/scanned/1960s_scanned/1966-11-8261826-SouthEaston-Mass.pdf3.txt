The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

This is a text document that includes the following text:

"This refers to a U.F.O. to which you were called recently. I feel so sorry because I will find a conclusive proof on these objects.

I would appreciate it very much if you could send me more information on the subject of U.F.O.'s by address is below. Please send this quickly as possible. THANK YOU FOR YOU TIME.

Yours very truly, 
Massachusetts"
