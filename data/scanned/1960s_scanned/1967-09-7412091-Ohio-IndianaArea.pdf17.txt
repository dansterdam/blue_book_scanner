MEMO FOR THE RECORD
21 December 1967
Called SPADATS and talked to Lt. Canitelli.
Object 293L, Oes 176 debris, decayed on the 13th at 2000 Z ; approximately 12 hours; this satellite has a maximum of 72.9Â° inclination. However, the analysts didn't think the object would break up into two pieces. They did not have accurate enough records to plot the trajectory to find out if the object passed over Indiana at or near the time of the sighting.
Certain information on the debris is classified. Lt. Canitelli requested that we send a copy of the case to Lt. Levin when we are through.
