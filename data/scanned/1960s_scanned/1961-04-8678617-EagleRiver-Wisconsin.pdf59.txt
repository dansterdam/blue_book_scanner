RECENT UFO SIGHTING

SUBJECT: LANDING IN WISCONSIN FARM FIELD

On November 17, 1961 at approximately 9:45 P.M., Mr. and Mrs. M reported that they observed an unidentified flying object land in a farm field near their home in Eagle River, Wisconsin. 

The sighting began when they noticed a bright light in the sky, which appeared to be descending. The light seemed to hover or maintain a steady position for a short period of time, then landed in a nearby field.

The witnesses stated that the object was circular in shape, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and emitted a bright bluish-white light. They reported that the object remained on the ground for about 10 to 15 minutes before taking off at a high rate of speed.

The couple indicated that they heard no unusual sounds associated with the landing or takeoff of the object. They also stated that no other witnesses or reports of the incident were known to them at the time.

The Air Force investigation determined that the description of the object and its behavior was consistent with reports of similar unidentified aerial phenomena. However, no definitive conclusions could be drawn regarding the nature or origin of the observed craft.

The case was classified as "unidentified" and added to Project Blue Book's files for further analysis and study.
