DONNYBROOK, NORTH DAKOTA 
8 AUGUST 1966

On the evening of 8 August 1966, at approximately 2230 hours, a local resident of Donnybrook, North Dakota reported seeing a UFO near his home. The witness described the object as circular in shape, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and hovering about 100 feet off the ground. The object was said to emit a bright, pulsating light that illuminated the surrounding area. 

The witness observed the object for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. No other witnesses were reported, and no physical evidence was found at the scene.

This incident was subsequently investigated by Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's UFO study program, but the case remains unresolved. The witness's account and the lack of supporting evidence make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about the nature of the observed phenomenon.
