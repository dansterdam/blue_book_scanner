The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text describing a sighting.

When it first appeared, the distance it seemed to appear as of 5 red lights in a flat plane.
All during the sighting there was cloud - none met in each of the object.
