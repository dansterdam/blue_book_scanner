This is in reply to your letter of January 12, 1964 in which you request information concerning an investigation of a flying object by your organization.

Based upon the information received, there appears to be some confusion and increased this sighting. In order to make an evaluation of a report such as this, it is necessary to have complete data such as description of the object, observations, etc.
