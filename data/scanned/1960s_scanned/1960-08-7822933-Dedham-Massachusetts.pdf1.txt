The text in the document describes a sighting of two bright, pear-shaped objects that were observed in the sky over Dedham, Massachusetts on August 5, 1950. The objects were reported to have moved silently from east to west, and their color was described as grayish white. The duration of the sighting was around 30 seconds. The document provides some conclusions about the possible nature of the objects, including that they may have been a balloon or an aircraft, or possibly an astronomical phenomenon, but there was insufficient data to definitively evaluate the sighting.
