"Ye Sir got the Thdm PA about Manders There is an open yard just this side of Manders and Across this spot up the road about 1/4 to 1/2 mile there is a silo and a small barn. In front of the house I could see a tower or antenna over the roof of the house. I thought it was about 40 to 50 feet high and about 50 feet from the house. I saw a large and very yellow object hovering about 1/4 mile away and 1/4 to 1/2 mile up the hill. They looked to me like they became larger and smaller and then went down the hill. It you can use this part of the report one of these entries wrote on it to the have out by those Mowrey. Her article is called 'Stillian' and the paper is called Humanoids and this may be what happened to them and around there when this object went down the hill."
