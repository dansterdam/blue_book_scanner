(1) At this time have been unable to arrive at a probable cause of this sighting. The three observers seem to be stable personnel, especially the two patrolmen. I viewed the area of the sighting and found nothing in the area that could be the probable cause. PEASE AFB had 5 B-47 aircraft flying in the area during this period but do not believe they had any connection with this sighting.
1. None.
