This page in the old Project Blue Book document contains three photographs. The top photograph appears to show a close-up view of a rocky, irregular terrain, possibly with some sort of crater or depression visible. The middle photograph shows a more distant, panoramic view of a desert or arid landscape, with some vegetation and hills in the background. The bottom photograph depicts a close-up view of a rocky surface with irregular patterns and textures.
