The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? NO, IT APPARENTLY CHANGED INTO A RECTANGULAR SHAPE.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? YES, DON'T KNOW.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? IN FRONT OF, YES, DON'T KNOW.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: 
a. Sound and size: SILENT, 20-25 FEET ACROSS.  
b. Color: LIGHT GRAY/WHITE DULL METALLIC.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object the match head covers. The head of the match may then be measured at .273 inches. If you hold the match in this manner, what size object would it cover? FIVE INCHES HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH WOULD COVER THE OBJECT.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc... and especially about trails or vapor trails. Indicate with an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. SKETCH ATTACHED.
