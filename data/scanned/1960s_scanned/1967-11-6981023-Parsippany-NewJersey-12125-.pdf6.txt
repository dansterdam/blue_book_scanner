REPORT OF INVESTIGATION 

INVESTIGATOR: WILLIAM D. BRIDGES

DATE: NOVEMBER 6, 1967

LOCATION: PARSIPPANY, NEW JERSEY

TIME: 12:25 A.M.

On the night of November 6, 1967, at approximately 12:25 A.M., I received a call from Mrs. Jane Smith, who reported seeing a bright, elliptical-shaped object in the sky over her home in Parsippany, New Jersey.

I immediately responded to the scene and interviewed Mrs. Smith. She stated that she had been looking out her bedroom window when she noticed a bright, glowing object in the sky. The object appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was moving in a steady, level flight path. Mrs. Smith stated that the object had no visible means of propulsion and made no sound.

I was able to observe the object for several minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. I was unable to determine the nature or origin of the object.

This incident has been recorded in the Project Blue Book files as case number 12125.
