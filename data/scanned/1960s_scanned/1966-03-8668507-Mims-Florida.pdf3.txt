The whole episode covered perhaps 4 or 5 minutes. During this time no cars approached me from either direction nor did any pass me in either direction for perhaps 5 or more minutes after the incident.

I believe I have set forth all of the details that I remember. If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to ask. I am employed by NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

Very truly yours,
