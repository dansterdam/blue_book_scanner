20 JUNE 1961

Dear Mr. ---------

Your letter of 26 June was addressed to the attention Technical Information Branch and has been referred to me.

ATIC has investigated the sighting you reported. based on all the information available, thie sighting was probably of a natural phenomenon.

JAKE SANK (was radio. incident of nautical diver equipment. SUBJECT SANK RADIO). SUBJECT SANK BELOW SAID UNABLE TO GET BACK ON SURFACE account DIVER EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION. SUBJECT NOT INVOLVED OBJECT SIGHTING.

ATIC investigation is that the object you saw nothing unusual, more than likely the planet Mars. This time of year, Mars is frequently mistaken for a "flying saucer" by the uninformed.

The possibility of this being an actual extraterrestrial vehicle is extremely remote and unwarranted. The balloons which are frequently mistaken for "flying saucers" are not related to any aspect of national security.

I hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN
Acting Chief Officer
