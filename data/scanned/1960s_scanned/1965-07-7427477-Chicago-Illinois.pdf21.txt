An investigation of our observational capabilities of this unit case.

At 8:20 a.m. C.S.T. on July 24, 1965, this station received a report from a civilian source that three luminous round objects the shape of pilots' helmets, "bright green in color," were seen over the Chicago area from the angle of elevation of 35-40 degrees and above stagnant, motionless for approximately 5 minutes. The objects were "about 6-8 inches in diameter and approximately 1000 feet above the surface."

The report mentioning took place three days later and was conducted as follows:

At 9:35 p.m. C.D.S.T., the writer of this report, in company with two other civilian observers, observed the same three bright green luminous round objects through telescopic lenses, approximately 800 to 1000 feet above the surface and at an elevation of 45-50 degrees. The objects appeared to be "sharp clear, about 6-8 inches in diameter, and made no sound whatsoever." The objects remained stationary for 30 minutes, then accelerated and disappeared from view.

This report is an attempt to scientifically evaluate this sighting and to determine if it represented an unidentified aerial phenomenon. All described characteristics point to an unusual celestial event in the sky over Chicago on that date. The described brightnesses, shapes, motions, and other parameters are consistent with a fairly common atmospheric optical phenomenon known as "mock suns" or "sun dogs." These are caused by the refraction of sunlight through ice crystals in cirrus clouds at high altitudes and are often observed during certain weather conditions. In this case, the temperature and humidity levels were conducive to the formation of such an effect.
