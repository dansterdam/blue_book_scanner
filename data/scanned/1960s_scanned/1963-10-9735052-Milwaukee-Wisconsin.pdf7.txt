The image contains a page from an old UFO report document, but there is no photograph present on this particular page. The page appears to be a questionnaire or report form with various questions about the observed UFO event.

The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. Was the object round or of some other shape? About how large was it in terms of a known object and how many degrees of the sky did it cover? How much of the object appeared to be self-luminous? If you had compared its brightness to that of a known object, what would it be?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
