However, sighting at extremely low level should have been reported immediately for further questioning on certain details: No mention of how time figured, extremely low altitude, motion or course, no sonic boom, unusual duration, etc., indicates need for more complete evaluation. Such low level sightings, extremely close to the observer, should have more complete information to evaluate properly.
