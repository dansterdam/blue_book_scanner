There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old unclassified Project Blue Book report. Based on the text, this appears to be an interim report prior to the final detailed report being submitted after the investigator interviews Mrs. Groves.

VISIBLY SHAKEN BY THE SIGHTING. THIS IS AN INTERIM REPORT. AFTER THE INVESTIGATOR INTERVIEWS MRS GROVES PERSONALLY, THE FINAL DETAILED REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED.
