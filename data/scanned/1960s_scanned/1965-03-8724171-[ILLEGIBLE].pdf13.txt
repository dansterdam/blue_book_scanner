MT. AIRY, MARYLAND
8 MARCH 1965

At approximately 1940 EST an observer and his son came out of a barn and noticed six red lights estimated to be about 1300 feet from the observer moving at a speed of about twenty miles per hour, toward the NE. The lights appeared to be in a straight line and at times seemed to blink. An aircraft with a white light appeared flying perpendicular to the lights. Another witness was summoned from the house and then all three observers viewed the lights. The witness stated that as it looked like a flying wing: It was a very dark night and there were no stars out. The flight was in a straight line toward the hills, two miles away. All of the observers thought the objects were aircraft and disappeared over the horizon. The lights passed between the barn and the house at an altitude of 100 - 500 ft, and again in view for a total duration of three minutes. To stimulate the sighting, one witness would take a dirigible or blimp-equipped device and place it three times of red lights along it.

COMMENTS
The outstanding factors in this sighting are the very slow speed, the flight characteristic, and the limited data available. The portion of the available data is characteristic of a balloon with a scientific payload. Attempts were made to put either of the two in the area but to no avail. The wind was out of the northwest which also conflicts with an evaluation of a balloon. With the existing data the case is listed as "unidentified" by the Air Force.
