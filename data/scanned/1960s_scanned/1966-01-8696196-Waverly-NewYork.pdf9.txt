 the traffic control tower at Waverly. Was notified that there was an unknown object that was maintaining a hovering position approx. 3 miles east of the Waverly VOR at approx. 2,000 feet altitude. This object was observed for approximately 15 minutes by the crew of a United Airlines flight, as well as the duty air traffic controller at Waverly. The object was described as metallic in appearance, circular in shape, and approximately 25-30 feet in diameter. It was hovering motionless and silent for the duration of the sighting. After approximately 15 minutes, the object accelerated rapidly, climbed vertically at a high rate of speed, and disappeared from sight.
