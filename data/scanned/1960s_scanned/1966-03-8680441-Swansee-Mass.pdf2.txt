March 31, 1966

Dear Major Russell:

My husband and I were greatly pleased to see the article on life about Project Blue Book. Until we read it, we had not realized that we had an experience which might be of interest.

In the early morning hours of June 27, 1964, we were awakened at around 2:00 a.m. by a brilliant light outside our bedroom window. This light was stationary, round, and about the size of a basketball, and was very bright, almost blinding, and hovered about 6-8 feet off the ground.

We watched it for about 20 minutes, and then it suddenly shot straight up out of sight. It moved with incredible speed and without any sound. There were no clouds in the sky and the moon was bright.

What people would believe it? We have never mentioned this to anyone for fear of being considered cranks. Would it be of any interest to your files? If so, how would we go about getting it recorded?

I hope you can find the time to answer my inquiry. I would be most grateful.

Sincerely yours,
