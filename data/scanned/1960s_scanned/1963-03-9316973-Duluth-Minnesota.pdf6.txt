NO CASE (Information Only) 6 March 1963 Wimbledon, London England

The text in the document is as follows:

"At 6.40 a.m. I saw an object in the sky. It was a fairly bright light, roughly circular in shape and appeared to be revolving slowly on its own axis. It was white in colour, but after about 1 1/2 minutes, it turned a distinct orange-red. It then seemed to fade away and disappear. The whole phenomenon lasted about 4 minutes.

The object appeared to be at a great height, and remained stationary throughout the observation. It could have been as much as 5 miles away. I do not think it could have been a conventional aircraft or any known astronomical object. It is difficult to estimate the size of the object, but I would guess it was about 1/2 mile in diameter.
I am a professional man and normally a quite sceptical observer of unusual phenomena. But I am quite certain that what I saw on this occasion was a genuine unidentified flying object."
