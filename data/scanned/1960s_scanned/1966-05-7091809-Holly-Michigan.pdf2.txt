Gentlemen:

On May 1, 1966, at approximately 10 P.M. I observed an object. This object appeared to have 4 lights on it. These lights went out and went on again a couple of times. A light seemed to come from inside as seen through a porthole. Around this light was a bluish-green halo. This light stayed on around 2 minutes or two. Then this light seemed fading. The object seemed to be 60-70 feet in front of me and about 50 feet up. I snapped a picture of this and if you are interested in the picture and more details have someone contact me. I will be willing to give any information I have.

Sincerely,
