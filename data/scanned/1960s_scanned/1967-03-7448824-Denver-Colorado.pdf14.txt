This page appears to be a form or report from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. government program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image does not contain any photographs, only text.

The text on the page appears to be a standardized form or questionnaire for documenting the details of a UFO sighting, including:

(1) What first called the attention of observer(s) to the object(s)
(2) Angle or elevation and azimuth of the object(s) when first observed
(3) Angle or elevation and azimuth of object(s) upon disappearance
(4) Description of flight path and maneuvers of object(s)
(5) How did the object(s) disappear?
(6) How long was the object(s) visible?
(c) Manner of observation, including any optical aids used
(d) Time and date of sighting

The form appears to be incomplete, with several fields left blank or marked "still visible - about 15 mins".
