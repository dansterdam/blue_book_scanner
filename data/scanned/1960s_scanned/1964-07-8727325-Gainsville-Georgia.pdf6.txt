The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter dated August 31, 1964 from Maston M. Jacks of the Office of Information, Major, USAF, to an individual in Gainesville, Georgia.

The text of the document is as follows:

August 31, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reference to your recent letter to the Smithsonian Institution on the subject of some unusual phenomena which has occurred in your area.

The July 13th sighting of an "oil spray" to the Air Force. However, an analysis of the sample indicates they contain nothing unusual from that normally found in nature. This finding does not mean, however, that the facts of the newspaper account of this sighting were much distorted, but rather the newspaper report itself was misleading.

The newspaper article of the Turnerville sighting indicates that the Air Force has evaluated this report. No official report was made to the Air Force. One report that was made to the sheriff's office is being evaluated at this time.

Inclosed is a summary of the manner in which the Air Force investigates and evaluates unidentified flying object reports. We think this brochure will help to explain the UFO phenomena.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
