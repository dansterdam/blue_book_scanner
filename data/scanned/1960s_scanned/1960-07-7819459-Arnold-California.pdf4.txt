FILE: 1955
ROLAND/DJS/73276/JDH
4 AUG 1960

Dear : In response to your letter of 24 June 1960 requesting information on unidentified flying objects, the following information is provided.

The Air Force position on UFO's is stated in Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Memorandum to the Secretary of the Air Force, dated 20 September 1951, a copy of which is attached. There is no authenticated evidence to prove the existence of Interplanetary spaceships. The Air Force will investigate any reports from reliable sources and maintain a continuous review of the subject. However, the Air Force cannot assume responsibility for investigating reports from individual citizens.

Article from the working air information service of 16 August 1960, subject: Evaluation of Unidentified Flying Objects Sightings, is attached which covers the policy in this matter. If the reports submitted appear to have sufficient merit, they are investigated to the extent necessary to establish identifiability and to avoid duplication.
