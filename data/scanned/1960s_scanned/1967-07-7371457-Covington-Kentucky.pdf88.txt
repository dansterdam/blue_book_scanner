There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old document, likely a report from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a response letter from the Air Force regarding unidentified flying objects observed.

AUG 8 1967

Dear Mr. Wright:

Reference your letter of July 11 in which you described the various unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which you have been observing since December, 1966.

At this late date, we would be unable to undertake a meaningful scientific investigation of your earlier observations. However, if you would like us to investigate your letter and your earlier observations, please indicate this, and we shall be glad to take a detailed investigation into your observations.

In the interim, if you should sight any further unidentified flying objects, please contact the nearest military installation at the time of your observation. The UFO investigating agency at your nearest military installation will be happy to assist you in their continuing investigation.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.
Sincerely,

ROBERT B. YOUNG
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Directorate of Information Division

Mr. Gene Starfield
