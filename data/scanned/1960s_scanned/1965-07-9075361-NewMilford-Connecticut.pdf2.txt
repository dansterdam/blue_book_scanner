Dear Sirs:

Enqugly, d thru seven thirty p.m.,suggest ing of our local news paper, this unsucce ssed about an onidentified fly ing object was 
noticed along the area of New Milford by several residents,it appear ance was like a plane, I thought it over and more look strange and different from any other planes that I had ever saw or heard before, - This object was getting higher and higher, and successeed iny sown down, - I called my son and told him to look up at the sky and he dicorered it right away, - Can you please let me know what was this object and is it something that I could have been seeing, - I would like to know what your department opinions is on this matter, - I am sure that it ws not a regular known plane.

Yours truly,
