Bristol saucer
Mr. W.L. Whiteman of 48 Penn 
Avenue, Bristol, England, was witness to a strange incident on Wednesday, January 24th, 1962. While returning home from work at about 5.45 p.m., he saw a silvery, disc-shaped object hovering over the houses in Penn Avenue. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was estimated to be at a height of about 200 feet. The object appeared to be flashing and glowing with an intense light. It suddenly moved very rapidly in an easterly direction, accelerating at a terrific speed. The witness watched it for a few seconds and then it disappeared out of sight. He telephoned the police immediately to report the incident, but they said they had received no other reports about the strange object. The object made no noise and was perfectly silent. Mr. Whiteman also stated that the object appeared to be rotating as it moved. He felt that the object was completely under intelligent control.
