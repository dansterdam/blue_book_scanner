The image contains three sketches or diagrams, but no photographs. The first diagram shows a curved line with points "A" and "B" marked on it, illustrating how an object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen, and how it appeared below the horizon when it was later seen. The second and third diagrams show larger sketches depicting the position of the object, with instructions on how to complete the larger sketch.
