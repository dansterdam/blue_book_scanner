This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the NICAP publication, discussing the "UFO evidence" and the continued attack on the Air Force UFO program. The text in the document is as follows:

The NICAP publication, "THE UFO EVIDENCE", has reviewed and criticized the Air Force's public position on UFOs. The publication contains many reports, correspondence, and other evidence all designed to prove the validity of UFO reports and to counter the Air Force's public relations program. This document indicates that the Air Force's public stance is a continual attack on the UFO program and that the NICAP publication is meant to provide a rebuttal to the Air Force's position.

Sincerely,
