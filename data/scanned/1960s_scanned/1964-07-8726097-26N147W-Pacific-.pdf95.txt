Dear Sir:

I am writing in answer to your request for information on the red lights. The red lights were of character DASCALBAR's seen on the evening of 2 July at 0430. It was probably 5 to 10 in quantity and a similar white light also appeared to circle the red lights. The intense light proceeded somewhat to the southeast. This was pattern heading south west. The rest followed in direction later.

Respectfully,
[Signature redacted]
