SUBJECT: This matter was reviewed and it was felt that: Although this sighting has been classified as a hoax by this office, there are some aspects of this case that seem to warrant further inquiry.

1. The sighting was witnessed by four persons, all apparently responsible and reputable. Their description of the object and of its movement do not seem to be that of a hoax.

2. Although this sighting was classified as a hoax due to the lack of tangible evidence to substantiate it, it is felt that the the nature of the sighting is such that it should be held in abeyance for possible re-evaluation at a later date should additional information become available.

It is requested that the file on this case be retained as an open case in the office of the COLLECTING & COLLATING AGENCY.
