At this time you weren't using binoculars?
No, I did not use binoculars. I didn't look through them at all. I was just OK sir, I think that will be all.
Would you give me your name and address, sir?
My name is [redacted]
May we have your address in [redacted]
And what is your occupation, sir?
I'm an industrial banker.
And do you have a private license?
No, I do not have a license.
You don't have any flying time?
I have no flying time but I fly a good deal in private planes with rentals and sometimes hire a pilot such as this trip I'm on now. I do have a lot of time in the air as a passenger.
When you observed the object was that from the office here?
Yes.
And could you describe the shape?
Well, it's a little hard to describe. I did watch it for a few minutes through binoculars and it appeared to me to be round the color of a football, a silvery color, without binoculars and I could see it - as I say it looked like the sun was reflecting on it and it blinking as though it were a metal like the sun blinking on it and then as it disappeared to those people who were watching without binoculars it seemed to disappear more like a light going out than it did like an object flying away.
At the time when it looked like an oval would that have been a full oval or a?
That would be what I would call an oval like a football.
Can you compare this with any known object? Such as a football or something like that?
It was shaped like a football when the sun shone on it and I saw it one time when.
