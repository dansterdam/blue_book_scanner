The Buenos Aires Sighting

On the night of July 18, 1965, several persons were watching various lights in the sky over the city of Buenos Aires. According to the news item, camerasmen of two newspapers snapped a photo of an object in the night sky which later developed into a round luminous object. As the first object disappeared, a second object appeared on the photograph. The included object showed as a point of light. In the second photograph the second object appeared larger and brighter. The witnesses reported that the objects moved very rapidly back and forth in the sky.

The object was apparently seen by many people, radio and television switch boards were jammed for quite some time with calls reporting the object's presence. Newspaper clippings showing the object reported by APROFE were clues which showed various points of light which apparently are stars and the "typical line" of light which could be described as a pulsating glowing medicine capsule. The glowing object also fits the general description of the object seen over the Buenos Aires Weather Bureau on the 11th.
