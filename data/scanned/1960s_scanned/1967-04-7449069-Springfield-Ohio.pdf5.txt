Text from the document:

I wanted to let you know what I observed last evening. I was doing my routine patrol at 11:50 p.m. when I noticed what appeared to be an unfamiliar object high in the sky. It was a bright, round object that emitted a very intense light. I watched it for approximately 12:30 a.m. It moved very slowly at first, then suddenly increased in speed and disappeared from sight. I am not saying that this was necessarily an extraterrestrial craft, but it was certainly unlike any aircraft I have observed before. I would be interested to hear if anyone else in the area reported seeing this object. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
