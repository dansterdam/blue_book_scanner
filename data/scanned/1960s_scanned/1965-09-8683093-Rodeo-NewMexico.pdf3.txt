The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

K. CHIEF, COMBAT INTELLIGENCE BRANCH, 9:30_WMKG. ALL CONVERSATION
WITH THE OBSERVERS WAS BY TELEPHONE. THE DOCTOR SEEMS TO BE A
RELIABLE OBSERVER. A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT IS RULED OUT BECAUSE
OF PERIOD OF STABILITY RELATIVE TO AUTO AND SUBSEQUENT SEPARATION
OF THE LIGHTS. A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION WOULD BE TWO HELICOPTERS.
HOWEVER NO RUNNING OR ANTI-COLLISION LIGHTS WERE OBSERVED AND THE
OBSERVERS HEARD NO SOUND WHATSOEVER WITH CAR WINDOWS OPEN. ADDITIONALLY THE INVESTIGATOR HAS BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY HELICOPTERS.
