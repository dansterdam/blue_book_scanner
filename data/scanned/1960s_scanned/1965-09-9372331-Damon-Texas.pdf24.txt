STATEMENT OF DEPUTY SHERIFF BILLY E. McCOY

Deputy Sheriff Goode and I were driving south on Highway 36 from Damon, Texas, to Waller, Texas, on Sunday, September 6, 1953. When we first noticed a purple light stationary on the horizon about 3-5 miles away and southwest of our position, the light appeared to be very bright. As we drove closer, the light seemed to split into two distinct positions before becoming stationary. The lights then flickered up and down in a synchronized motion. The lights were quite bright and featured other characteristics besides the two bright lights. We turned the car around and Deputy Sheriff Goode discussed the lights through binoculars. We decided to travel closer to get a better view. After traveling about 3/4 of a mile on Highway 36, we slowed down, Goode saw his light and called down. We slowed to almost a stop off the edge of the highway and while watching the object, lost sight of it for a few seconds. The object came back into view and appeared to travel west at a tremendous speed. We traveled back to Damon, Texas, and while traveling at a speed up to 110 mph, the object came up behind us and its brilliance apparently caused by its movement away from us. After arriving in Damon, we discussed our experience with the object.
