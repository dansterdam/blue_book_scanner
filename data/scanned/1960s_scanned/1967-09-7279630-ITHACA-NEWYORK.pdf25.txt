The following is a report of an unidentified sighting: 
At approximately 8:00 PM on September 7, 1967, Mrs. Bess observed a bright light near the horizon to the east of her home. At first, she thought it was an aircraft, but it soon became apparent that it was not an airplane or any conventional aircraft. The light appeared to be hovering and did not seem to be moving. It remained in view for approximately 15-20 minutes before suddenly disappearing. There were no other witnesses to this sighting. 
Bess is a reliable witness and her report appears to be sincere. The report is considered to be genuine and is forwarded for any evaluation or investigation that may be deemed appropriate.
