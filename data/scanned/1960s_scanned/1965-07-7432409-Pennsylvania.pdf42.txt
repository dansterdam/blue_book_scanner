The image appears to be a black and white photograph that does not contain any human faces. The photograph shows a largely empty landscape with a horizontal line in the middle that could be the horizon. There is a handwritten note at the bottom of the image that says "EU Project Bluebook The United States Air-Force Dayton, Ohio".

Project Bluebook:
The United States Air-Force
Dayton, Ohio
