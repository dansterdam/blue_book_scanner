TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

At about 1:30 p.m., March 9, 1967, the observer sighted an object he at first thought was a Government helicopter. It appeared clearly to be metallic and was moving at a high rate of speed. The observer could see no propelling devices and it appeared to be under intelligent control. It was first seen to the northwest and finally seemed to dart away toward the northeast. A second object was then observed which appeared and disappeared in a similar manner, moving at a high rate of speed. The entire incident lasted approximately 1+3 p.m. CST. The observer managed to report the sighting to the local air traffic control tower.

Surface winds were northerly at 12 knots, gusting to 24 knots. The descriptions, durations and flight characteristics were similar to that of a balloon. The 8mm film failed to reveal any information that would corroborate this evaluation.
