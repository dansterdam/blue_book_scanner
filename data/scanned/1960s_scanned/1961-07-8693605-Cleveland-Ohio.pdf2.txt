The image contains a black-and-white photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The photograph shows an elongated, dark-colored object that appears to be in motion. There are no other discernible details or features in the image besides the UFO-like object.

THIS IS MY STATEMENT IN REPLY TO THE STATEMENT RELEASED BY MAJOR HECTOR QUINTANILLA, USAF, CHIEF, PROJECT BLUE BOOK, CONCERNING MY REPORT OF A SIGHTING UPON HEARING THIS STATEMENT, I MADE CONTACT WITH MR. ROBERT WISEMAN OF CLEVELAND, OHIO, WHO HAS INTERESTED HIMSELF IN RESEARCH CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. I HAVE BEEN FLYING SINCE 1942 BOTH DAY AND NIGHT, AND CURRENTLY OPERATE A SPITTING BUSINESS 2[REDACTED] WITH HANGARS AT HOPKINS AIRPORT IN CLEVELAND, OHIO. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING IN ALL TYPES OF WEATHER.

IT IS MY SUPPOSITION THAT MYSELF AND TWO OTHER PILOTS ON THE FIRST DAY AND ONE PILOT ON THE SECOND DAY AT AROUND 11:30 P.M. EASTERN STANDARD TIME SAW A STATIONARY OR SLOW-MOVING LIGHT THAT HAD A GLOW EMANATION OR STROBE CHARACTERISTIC OF SOME SORT. IT IS MY OPINION THAT WHAT I ACTUALLY CALLED AND DESCRIBED TO MR. WISEMAN AS PASSENGERS THAT THE OBJECT CALLED 'UFO' WAS ACTUALLY CAUSED BY ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND NOT BY ANY EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLE. HOWEVER, THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN THE OBJECT REAPPEARED IT FLASHED BRIGHTLY AND APPEARED TO CHANGE DIRECTION AND SPEED, DISAPPEARING TO THE NORTHWEST.

I WILL END MY STATEMENT TO WIT--THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A STAR, PLANET, COMET, OR ANYTHING THAT I DOUBT ANYONE ELSE HAS EVER SEEN, AND I AM AS NO STAR OR ANYTHING WAS IT A REFLECTION.
