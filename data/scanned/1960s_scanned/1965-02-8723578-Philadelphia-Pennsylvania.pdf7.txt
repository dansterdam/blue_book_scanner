Gentlemen:

On the night of Wednesday, February 5, 1965, at about 9:00 block of Bustleton Avenue, I had never seen before. 
It was a formation of white lights except for one red light on the last in the line.

It's size was a middle 500-600 feet wide and at least 500-600 feet long. This would make it about 200 feet in winding row.

I do not think this is a planet or any kind or a mirage.

Could you please send me any information about this and a list for any possible reports from 1945-1964. This would aid me in a report.

Thank you very much.

Very truly yours,
