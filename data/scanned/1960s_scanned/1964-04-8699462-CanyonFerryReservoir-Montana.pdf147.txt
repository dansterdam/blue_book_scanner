Dear Capt. Holder,

As a result of our recent investigative quest information about the April 24th UFO sighting made by Socorro police man Lonnie Zamora, we would appreciate you sending all possible information. If, for any reason, you are unable to send information, we would like a statement from you explaining the exact reason for your act of withholding information.

If you do not answer this letter, we will assume that it is a deliberate attempt to censor information. 

Hoping to hear from you soon, I am...

Yours in research,
Keith Jenkins
Secretary-Treasurer of F.S.R.O.
