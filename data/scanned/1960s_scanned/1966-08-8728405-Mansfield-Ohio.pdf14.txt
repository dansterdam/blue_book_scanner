The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text on the page describes the investigation of a reported sighting of an unusual event on the night of August 16th. The report mentions that the announcement brought in around 20 letters, most of which were related directly to the sighting. The letters and telephone interviews provided considerable insight into the way in which random witnesses reported very unusual events that they had never seen before. The performance is described as credible, and the results seem to show that if enough reports can be obtained, it may be possible to sift out of all the varying descriptions a good picture of the appearance of what was seen. The text also discusses how witnesses' interpretations of what they saw can vary greatly, and how this can affect the apparent characteristics of the observed phenomenon.
