Dear Sir,

Last night I stopped out of my house and was looking up into the sky when I saw an object which gave the impression of flying in a straight line at a rapid speed. This object was round in shape and gave off an extremely bright light like the one seen on an aircraft at night. It seemed to be controlled and seemed to accelerate and travel at a very high rate of speed. This object was bright enough to be seen from a considerable distance, that's why I decided to call the police and report this sighting.

When the Chicago police arrived, I have seen objects similar to this one flying in the Chicago area. But none were as bright or at such a high rate of speed. I'm not sure what this object was but it certainly was not an aircraft I'm familiar with. I would appreciate it if you could investigate this matter and let me know what you find. If you have any questions, please let me know.

Sincerely,
