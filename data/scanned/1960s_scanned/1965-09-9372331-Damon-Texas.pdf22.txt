CONCLUSIONS:
After talking with both officers involved in the sighting there is no evidence to support a UFO sighting. However, my investigation failed to uncover any facts that permitted me to concur with my investigation knowledge or such opinions as were furnished to me. The persons capable of sound judgment and reasoning- Chief Deputy Sheriff McCoy would qualify as reasonable position for their sighting. It appears considerable ridicule from their contemporaries and the some have attempted to possess the facts of their sighting.  Furthermore, the sighting has stirred up considerable interest in the local newspapers, radio and television outlets these additional circumstances.
