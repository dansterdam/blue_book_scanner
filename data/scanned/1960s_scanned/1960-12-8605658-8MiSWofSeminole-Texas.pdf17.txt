1. The object observed was visible from approximately 6:00, while my
father waVenroute home from work, continuing on about 6:10. It was brow
ish in color, seemed round in shape, and was hovering in the area. It
made no noise, and had no visible means of propulsion. It was slowly
moving in a northeasterly direction. This was a clear night, and the ob
ject was clearly visible. All sightings were made from a 1952 Chevrolet
automobile, and reported to the Air Force the following day.

2. The nearest town was Seminole, Texas, which is approximately 8 miles
south of the location where the object was sighted. Seminole is the co
unty seat of Gaines County, which is sparsely populated. There are no
large industries or military installations in the immediate area. The
sighting took place on a clear, calm night, with good visibility for a
radius of several miles. There was no unusual activity or noise in the
area at the time. The object was seen by two adults, and they are in
agreement as to what they observed.
