The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, which is an investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force.

The text on the page reads as follows:

"TO: Major Hector Quintanilla USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

This is to report a call I made to Mr. [redacted] on Sunday, August 15, 1965.

[redacted]was doing his own business called [redacted], which is not only a business of interest-earning and giving, but is also connected with computer services to institutions, etc. Until he began his own company he was a nuclear physicist at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, working on nuclear rocket propulsion.

I have a long talk with him. He is not only scientifically oriented, but he is also a member of the Pittsburgh group. He apparently gets into some hot arguments with the local group, however, to take his story. At any rate, his interest and devotion to this subject is claimed to be a member of these up-with. He believes in a case, reported to USAF, of one of the Pittsburgh scientists having been hassled by a bright ball of light that rose directly overhead and then faded from sight.

On all three cases the objects were bright, apparently very much brighter than Echo, when they first appeared. And on fading out, they faded very rapidly, much faster than satellites, so far as motion was concerned, was good except for the final fade out, where the motion was from east to west. There seems to be about this, since he little altitude and attitude."
