FLY-IN FISH BOIL in mid-July
The SKIN DIVER will find fascinating underwater rock formations. There are numerous sunken vessels to be found in the Death's Door passage and other locations.
The season begins with the perch run about mid-April, just as the ice leaves the harbors. Northern Pike, Rock Bass and Small Mouth Bass thrill the fisherman from spring through autumn in the natural spawning grounds of this area.
The harbors and forests are great places to explore. For the nature lover, the woods abound with wild flowers, a variety of song birds, animals and wild game. An added dividend is finding the rare Calypso Orchid - LOOK but don't TOUCH these delicate blooms.
From childhood, the natives are taught dances and take pride in the Scandinavian Festival in August. Islanders are noted for their delicious cooking as exemplified in Scandinavian - homeland foods.
Should you miss the annual festival, the Scandinavian Dances are offered for your entertainment on Thursday evenings at 8:30.
Gorgeous foliage, migrating birds and cool crisp nights make September and October ideal vacation months for those seeking perfect rest.
Potato Harvest Season presents its own rewards as everyone joins in the picking.
A fresh, peaceful over Washington Island is a sight you will long remember.
On the Island, you will experience a warmth of friendliness, so rare in the hustle and bustle of city life. Symbolic of Scandinavian hospitality is the huge coffee pot near the ferry dock, hand-painted with the Norwegian inscription "COFFEE IS THE BEST OF ALL EARTHLY DRINKS".
For the airborne, fly to the Washington Island airport - it's lightest Telephone.
