The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

The object seemed larger, than would be expected from a normal plane, having apparently a rather tubular shape with a slight taper toward the rear. It was moving in a relatively straight line, at approximately the speed of a normal jet aircraft, but appeared to be at a relatively high altitude. There was no sound or exhaust trail observed. The duration of the sighting was approximately 10 to 15 seconds.
