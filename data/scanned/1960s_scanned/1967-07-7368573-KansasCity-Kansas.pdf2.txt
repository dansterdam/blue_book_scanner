SUGAR COULD BE MADE -- IT FLEW A STRAIGHT COURSE CROSSING THE STATE LINE FROM BLOCK SOUTH OF OUR VANTAGE POINT. 
THE AIR FORCE DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OTHER REPORTS, TO OUR GROUP SO FAR, THEY HAVE NOT MADE PUBLIC THROUGH ANY EVIDENCE, THAT CAME TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THROUGH ANY DOCUMENTS TO THE AIR FORCE -- WHAT CHANCE EVER TO 
CONVICT THESE WAS NO LONGER THAN IF IT HAPPENED AT THAT VERY TIME AND THERE. 
MY COMMENT -- NEITHER THEY WERE LYING OR THEY WERE HAD BETTER OVERHAUL AIR BASE (RICHARDS GEBAUEN) WHEN IT EXPLODED AND IT WENT BETWEEN OUR HOUSE AND THE AIR BASE.
I PRESSED THE AIR FORCE AS MUCH AS I COULD INTO A SEARCH FOR THE PARTS BECAUSE -- HERE WAS SOMETHING CHANCE TO OBTAIN POSITIVE EVIDENCE. A SIMILAR PLEA TO MR. GOODFELLOW, OUR DEAF GROUP FOR ACTION APPARENTLY FELL ON DEAF EARS.
SUMMARY OF ACTION AFTER SIGHTING
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SIGHTING AND EXPLOSION OF THE U.F.O. -- THE WRITER PHONED RADIO KDAP-TV. NO OTHER REPORTS HAD BEEN MADE BUT BOARD WAS LISTENING, INTERRUPTED OUR CONVERSATION SAYING THAT THE SWITCH BOARD WAS LIGHTING UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE, HE HUNG UP. 
I CALLED JOHNSON COUNTY (KANSAS) SHERIFF - HE ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS, GOT MY NAME AND ADDRESS.
THEN I CALLED RICHARD GEBAUER AIR FORCE BASE - AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES I GOT A PARTY TO TALK TO -- LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES DELAY - WHILE HE LOOKED FOR THE REPORT FORM -- (WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN FIVE PAGES LONG, THAT WOULD LIE CONVERSATION.
MY NEXT ACTION WAS TO SEARCH THE AREA (IT WAS DARK BY NOW) BY CAR AND INTERVIEWED PEOPLE IN THE AREA - ATTENDANTS AT DRIVE-IN, ETC. - NONE HAD SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING.
I FIGURED THAT IF THE CRAFT WAS OUR WITNESS, THE AIR FORCE IN EITHER CASE WOULD BE ALL OVER THE AREA LIKE A SWARM OF BEES -- MILITARTY PERSONNEL AND EVERYTHING.
I RETURNED HOME - ONE-AND-A-HALF HOUR LATER TO FIND THAT THE SHERIFF OR OTHER REPORTS -- THOUGH WE LEARNED HE GAVE SAME MAN HAD TOLD A NEIGHBOR THAT THEY HAD GIVEN SAME MAN HAD TOLD A NEIGHBOR THAT THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING.
