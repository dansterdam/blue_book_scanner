Sir,

Regarding your letter of October 16, 1967.

(1) I have no recall of a report which I submitted to your office. It appears to be a Camp Type 8-24, 112 500 N., 660 W., reported to triangulate around an object and suggest that contact with other aircraft.

(2) I have followed a detail with my eyes which it seemed to be oscillating, but I didn't expect to record or tell about, not detail except to a certain man on top. I was with my boy and 2 men and was afraid of a dark area and I left immediately.

(3) I never followed a satellite with my eyes which it seemed to be a fiery wire.

(4) I shall still avoid reporting unwise things. I was eager to read your comment more than to write now for the words appear me as tone saying it for an object changing direction in the sky to rally, could send some of other rockets over unlikely to be at Houghton, and have a certain altitude wonderful and too warn sunset on me. I was down here and dent to understand, but this letter will establish that I've done for a mysterious reason my lot for information that was over before, big, look
Sincerely,
