The image contains a diagram and instructions related to reporting UFO sightings. The diagram shows a curved line labeled "horizon (skyline)" and a compass rose. The instructions ask the observer to draw a picture of the motion of the object or objects seen, and if there was more than one object, to draw a picture of how they were arranged and indicate the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass where the object first appeared, and a "D" on the compass where the object last appeared.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
