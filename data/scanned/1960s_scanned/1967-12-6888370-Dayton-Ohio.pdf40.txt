MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJ: UFO Observation, 24 December 1958
On 14 March 1959 Mrs. *****, Dayton, Ohio, 45405, phone *****, called to inform us that she had observed an unidentified object on 24 December 1958 at approximately 5:30 or 5:45 am. She wanted to know if we had received any other reports for this date. Explained to Mrs. ****** that are filing equipment was being repaired at present and that we would check into this on Monday, 16 March. Mrs. ****** said she wanted to report her observation, however, some of her friends said to and others said not to because she might be laughed at. I assured Mrs. ***** that we do not laugh at witnesses and also that same would not be released to the newspapers. Mrs. ****** then described her observation.
She saw a bright light, comparable to the north star. She saw the object first through her window and watched it for a long time remembering that it was the day before Christmas and the story of the bright star. The huge star all of a sudden came down, like it was descending towards the earth, then it went back to the same place and then it moved slowly across the sky. Mrs. ****** took time to go outside and watch it for it intrigued her. When asked the total duration of the sighting she said it must have been a long time about three or four seconds. When asked the second time about the time, she again repeated three or four seconds. Mrs. ****** compared the brightness to the bright north star. Mrs. ****** said she was not sure of her directions and thought maybe be it was in the northeast or north but said she couldn't tell directions very well. Will forward AF Forms 117 to her to complete, however, I did inform Mrs. ****** that we may not be able to make an identification since it was a brief sighting.
