There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document page from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
Day / Month / Year 
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific part of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
See my letter of June 28, 1967.
This describes the movement of the object or vehicle in greater detail. Also -- in that letter I state they are much larger in this report than had been noted on our earlier calendar form when I wrote to be unable to see the vehicle clearly.
In section 15 above, the size of the vehicle appears as a sort of an entry in the rear 25 the vehicle. In a written letter that followed, I mention that we saw two or three separate vehicles, that the first was witnessed on the evening of June 26, 1967 sighting. The second one -- right after that -- seen that same evening, as a smaller disc-like vehicle in the sky not hovering, but moving rapidly across the sky. The third vehicle was witnessed on the following evening, June 27, 1967, which I was unable to describe in detail on the calendar form when I wrote to be unable to see the vehicle clearly.
