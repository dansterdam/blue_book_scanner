THE MAIN INVASION WAVE
Wynnewood, Oklahoma July 31, 1965
At 1:05 a.m. on the morning of 
July 31, 1965, an unidentified flying object 
was observed approximately 5 miles west 
of Wynnewood, Oklahoma. Witnesses 
stated that the object was circular in shape, 
about 100 feet in diameter, and glowing 
brilliantly. The object moved slowly from 
Wynnewood toward Oklahoma City at an 
altitude of approximately 2,000 ft. The 
UFO then moved to the west for approximately 10-15 
minutes and returned to its original position. 
The object appeared to have a center core 
and seemed to flare or pulsate. The UFO 
appeared to have three times as much 
brilliance than the morning star Venus. 
After remaining stationary for several 
minutes, the UFO began to move again 
and was sighted by highway patrolman 
N.L. Buchanan of KWTV Channel 9, 
Oklahoma City. Buchanan stated that it 
was lost again a short time later.
