Computation of Actual Size of Object Based on Apparent Size
Apparent size of elliptical part of object: 3/16 in.
Actual distance of object: 116.5 miles
Actual size = 615.5331 feet = 116.5 miles
2.0 feet = arm's length
By proportions:
.0056 : 2 = x : 615.5331
2x = 3.4575
x = 1.7287 feet diameter
By varying observers' angles:
Actual distance = 20.5 miles = 108451 feet
All other factors remain constant
By proportion:
.0056 : 2 = x : 108451
2x = 1.2552
x = 0.6276 feet diameter
