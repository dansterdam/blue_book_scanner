Transcription of the text in the document:

"Here was a light around as broad as 6 inches wide which was very brilliantly illuminated, appeared to be incandescent light. This circle became larger, its dimensions constantly increasing, shooting out from its center over to the right - and then disappearing to the left. The light seemed to go off then come back on again very rapidly - now this bright light went to the left rapidly and then to the right. This was orange-white light.

Sketch of y light was at first just a small point of light, increasing in size to a full circular shape - then diminishing. - Beam of light was a violent white - lasted only 1/2 second. Looked like a spark hit water and then went out.

So unusual how this light world have been covered. It was just too close to cover anymore than that."
