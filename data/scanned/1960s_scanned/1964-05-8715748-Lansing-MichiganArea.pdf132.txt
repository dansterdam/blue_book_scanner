The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text and annotations. As an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I will transcribe all the text found in the document:

Subsequent to their observation they had received numerous telephone calls from residents of the area reporting similar objects. These included children who observed the objects, and persons, extremely loud, who had called the operator to report the objects and described the manner in which the object left the area. Extremely loud. They had received a call from a nurse at the Lansing City Hospital who had observed the object that same night. 

It should be noted that a child a few months old was the one that was awakened by the noise. The noise of the object did not disturb the sleeping child. All the children observed the object and described the manner in which the object left the area as like a silent telephone.
