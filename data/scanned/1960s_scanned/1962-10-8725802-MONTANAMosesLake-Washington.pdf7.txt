Chinook, Montana  
5 October 1952

Dear Mr. Hoover:

This letter is to inform you that a flying saucer sighting was taken from the Great Falls Montana Tribune of October 4, 1952. This was of interest to me and is one of the reasons which has the people worried. 

During this past summer while airborne, I noticed this object or flying object each as this one described, which appeared to be larger and which appears similar to other reportings.

It was described as a tear shaped object. It was a small parachute made of light blue colored nylon to which a small light is attached. Attached to this small light is a small shaft or rod which appears similar to other reporting.

I carried this flying object from the ground and kept it for several hours to examine it, but then it was missing. 

Flying objects or flares, such as those, could be released from flying aircraft, and when carried by the wind could be reported as flying objects or flares.

Informed people know that Rabbit Visuals' statements in newspapers and defiance of our government or military are not considered seriously. These flying objects would vary, would be evaluated from our standpoint (perhaps location, observations) and people are doing just that.

With best regards, I am
