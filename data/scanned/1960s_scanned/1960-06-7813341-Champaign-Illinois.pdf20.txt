The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter regarding a film strip related to a UFO sighting.

8 July 1960

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your recent submission of a film strip to the Air Force which evidently showed a UFO on several frames. The sighting took place on 7 June 1960 at Champaign, Illinois.

The object on the film is a genuine photographic image. It had a luminous appearance and considerable intensity, due to its being entirely visible within eight degrees of the sun. Its high angular elevation could not be determined by the angle of the camera, but this motion precludes any analysis of object configuration. However, the high velocity and brightness indicate that the object was probably a meteor of the "fireball" class.

With your permission, the Air Force would like to retain the film strip in this case for the official file. If this is not possible please let me know and I will return the film to you immediately.

Thank you very much for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Lt. Colonel, USAF
