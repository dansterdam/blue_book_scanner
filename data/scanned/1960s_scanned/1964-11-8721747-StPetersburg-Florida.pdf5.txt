Dear Major Quintanilla:

Herewith attached is a log of our observations of an unidentified object.
Dr. Raymond G. Bowers suggested we forward this to you.
We have been unable to reconcile these sightings with the available schedules for some I and GCBF 11. 
We would appreciate your advice as to the identification of this object.

Yours truly,
Joan Whittneour
