The image appears to be a handwritten document that does not contain any photographs. As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Another strange object moving in a northeasterly direction over a point at a rate of speed since we had witnessed the last observation of the object through the binoculars. The object appeared to be travelling at a tremendous rate of speed and was difficult to follow. It appeared whitish in color and seemed to be surrounded by a sort of luminous glow. The object was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and we could tell it had no running lights as an airplane does, we took three exposures with our camera, which is a Rolleiflex, all of which were rather poor being that the object was traveling at such a high rate of speed. The following day and thereafter some of the individuals who were present during the observation were sceptical about what we had witnessed, but the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that what we observed was not an ordinary aircraft and must have been some kind of unidentified flying object.
