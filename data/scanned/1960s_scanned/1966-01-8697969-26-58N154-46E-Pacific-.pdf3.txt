DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING

On 8 January 1966, at approximately 1630 hours, the aircraft commander and navigator of a C-130 aircraft on a routine flight from Guam to Manila, Philippine Islands, reported sighting a bright, metallic, circular object at a distance of approximately 40 miles northeast of the position of the aircraft (estimated position 26-5BN, 154-46E). The object was described as approximately 60 feet in diameter, and appeared to be traveling in a westerly direction at an estimated speed of 700-800 knots and an altitude of approximately 45,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute and then disappeared from sight. The aircraft commander and navigator stated that the object appeared to be metallic, reflecting the sun's rays, and that it was definitely not a conventional aircraft. No further details were provided in the report.
