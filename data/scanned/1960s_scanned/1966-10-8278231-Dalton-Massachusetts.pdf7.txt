Another night one appeared around the clock at about 1:40 AM while this clerk patrolled about a block. There were smaller objects rotating at a lower altitude some and white lights circling at a lower altitude-gaining more ground--getting larger as they got nearer. I saw the air force had 2 jet interceptors out but my estimate I might say was about 200-250 mph speed and at an altitude possibly 5000 ft. This encounter lasted for about 10 minutes. The air objects were a little oval and green, and seemed to give off a little glow out of the bottom. More adult left the sighting that night. She saw that my light. The air force had a poor tracking on this information and did not check it out more fully. I have since been told one can never tell them all you know so well I ac TRATE of planeation for them. We have had a couple of nights of a similar lot of activity about 9:00 PM but no more than 3-4 objects at a time. Not one person looked up--
