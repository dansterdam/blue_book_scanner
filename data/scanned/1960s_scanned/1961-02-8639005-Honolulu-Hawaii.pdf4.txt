Mars and Venus Still Prominent

February's brilliant night sky features the constellations now attracting greatest attention. Once more Venus and Mars, James Stamley reports. Mercury and Jupiter appear below the horizon. Saturn and Uranus are visible in the early evening.

Mercury Soon Above Horizon
Mercury, the smallest and swiftest of the nine major planets, will soon be visible in the evening sky. It will be at its greatest eastern elongation on February 12, when it will set more than two hours after the Sun. At this time it will be the brightest object in the evening sky, outshining all the stars. As Mercury moves rapidly around the Sun, its visibility in the evening sky is limited to about three weeks before and after its greatest eastern elongation.

The text appears to be describing the positions and visibility of the planets in the night sky during the month of February, with a focus on the planets Mars and Venus. The maps show the relative positions and movements of these planets.
