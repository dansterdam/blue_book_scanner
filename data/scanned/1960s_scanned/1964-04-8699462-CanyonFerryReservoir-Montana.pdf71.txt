was visiting his father the night of 25 April at La Madera, New Mexico. He saw an object rise out of a distance about a hurricane that emitting blue flames horizontally from the sides. This lasted about one minute and the object then disappearance. This object was from 1000 to 1200 feet from the point of observation. The next day he went to the area where he had seen the object and there was a scorched area about 10 feet by 25 feet. This area, which was just off the side of the road, was lifted with the roots of small bushes and other debris. It was stated that when he looked at it on Monday the 27th, I could see no marks that resembled the four imprints I observed to crvisor Vega of the New Mexico State Police; there were some markings or prints of an odd nature. These consisted of a circular area about 13 inches in diameter with two smaller circles in front of this which were about the size of a dollar. I saw some marks on the ground and the general area, which were about the size of a dollar, that seemed to be foot prints or something smelled of alcohol. It was stated that at 1230 and when I last him off about 100 yards, the Socorro incident and the liquor he apparently had consumed was too much for him. In checking with the radar site, they reported no unknowns for the night of 25 and 26 April.

Attached is a diagram of the area with some pictures taken of the burned area.
