Dear Sir,--
This may have no bearing whatever on the article... ...which reached me mentioning noises and strange vibrations, especially mentioning sounds coming out of the sky between five and five-thirty Saturday morning. there just might be some connection with these space radios. 
I live in one of the small hillside village on the mountain side which is a mile south of town and just on the other side of Portneuf River. with peace and quiet. No so much as the birds and the roar of cars since I sleep on enclosed porch in front of cottage.-- I live alone ill sums.

Here, I was awake at the time the voices woke me. First it sounded like two persons talking on the road.-- I heard no car so it was very quiet of coarse, Just a distant murmer. It broke off quiet suddenly as if the persons had just stopped walking on this road. Then I plainly heard that the voices were not on the road but coming from the sky. The dog did bark at strangers. Only a few. At the time I doubted if anyone else heard it as I have no radios. I got up and loked out but no one there went back to bed but it seemed to be a long time before I could sleep again. It was eerie and I was worn thinking of what it could be.

I am my nephew's dependent. He works at the local place for me. He heard nothing but his cabin is in trees and bushes. 

I don't know the cause but it seems to me to be something around aeroplanes and yet so strange that no one can understand them. It's puzzled.

My nephew heard nothing but his cabin is surrounded with trees and bushes. I am the aunt who made the tower yesterday. We do not account for the voice or tell anyone as some may think we are silly. If there is something in the towers we do hope the towers are sailor have some use.

Please let me know if you find anything that might throw any light on this. I am on high hill in.
