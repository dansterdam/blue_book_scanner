2. Unfortunately, we do not have any meteor reports for 19/20 March 1968. However, if we do store any for these dates, we will immediately forward copies to you.

3. We have a UFO report for 12 April 1968, 2330 EST, from Warren, Ohio. The witness sighted several greenish-white lights that seemed to hover and dart. The observation lasted three to four seconds and were seen from four to five seconds. The lights did not conform to any "fly" formations and were disappearing before your report could be submitted.
