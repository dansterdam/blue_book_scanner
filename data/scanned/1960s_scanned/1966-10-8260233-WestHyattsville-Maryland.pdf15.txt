This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is an Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects. The text on the page appears to be a proposed reply to a letter requesting information on unidentified flying object sightings related to the New York blackout in November 1965. The reply states that the Air Force has received no reports that could be related to the blackout, and that any information on reported sightings will be added to the present data base, although sightings outside the continental United States are not considered.

Proposed reply to letter from
Dear Mr. ____

Reference your letter requesting information on unidentified flying object sightings in connection with the New York blackout in November 1965. The Air Force has received no reports that could be related to the blackout.

In regards to the reported sightings, the information will be added to the present data base; however, a comprehensive investigation is not possible since the sightings are outside the continental limits of the United States.
