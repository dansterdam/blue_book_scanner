11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Two witnesses reported a big red circular object east from Sale City to Moultrie, Georgia. The object was on the west side of the road and seemed to be high, hovering or floating. They revealed that in order for the object to be in sight, must be a great distance away. It seemed to be a great distance toward the north. When first sighted it was very small, but it seemed to be getting larger as it moved toward them. He then said that various lights appeared in front of him and shined lights to the object, and afterwards continued in the same direction. The object apparently had some thought on the object being strange, and stated that he shined the passenger if she had witnessed the same thing, and she had. The moon is approaching them at the FTD line as this case.
