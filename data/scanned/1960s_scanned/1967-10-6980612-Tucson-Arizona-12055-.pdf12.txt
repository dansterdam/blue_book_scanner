REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
Tucson, Arizona
12 October 1967
1. On 6 October 1967, this office received a report of an unidentified flying object which had been observed on 3 October 1967 near Tucson, Arizona. The report was submitted by Mr. JOHN DOE, a resident of Tucson, Arizona.
2. According to Mr. DOE's statement, he was driving approximately 12 miles southeast of Tucson on State Route 83 at about 8:00 p.m. on 3 October 1967 when he observed an unidentified flying object hovering about 100 feet above the ground. Mr. DOE stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape, about 30 feet in diameter, and was emitting a bright blue-white light. He further stated that the object made no sound and was motionless for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before ascending rapidly and disappearing from view.
3. Mr. DOE reported the incident to the local police department, who in turn notified the appropriate Air Force authorities. This office was subsequently contacted and requested to investigate the matter.
4. A thorough on-site investigation was conducted on 10 October 1967. The area where the object was reportedly observed was carefully examined, and numerous interviews were conducted with local residents. However, no physical evidence or additional eyewitness accounts were obtained to corroborate Mr. DOE's report.
5. Based on the information gathered during the investigation, this office concludes that the unidentified flying object observed by Mr. DOE was most likely a conventional aircraft, possibly a helicopter, engaged in some type of training or survey operation in the area. The bright light and hovering characteristics described by Mr. DOE are consistent with the known capabilities of certain military and civilian aircraft. No evidence was found to suggest the presence of any extraordinary or unidentified vehicle.
6. This case is therefore classified as "Insufficient Evidence" and is being closed.
