There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report containing text only.

Wall, this is why I/Watson called me he said: "I wouldn't ordinarily call you up but I wanted to show you my case". And as I say to him: "I wouldn't know how to analyze, and I say to him "what is this a case of?"
"As a matter of fact, he couldn't explain it", and I said "where was a thing of this kind before?" and I said "no, the cloud that looks like an unobligating cloud." I don't know the proper name of the color. There is an antique blue, and someone writes to me "there is a dark, tall thing, and there is a lot of information about it" but I know that is exactly the same color.
Sort of a tarnished capper? It is definitely said, but it appeared that the light was being emitted from the cloud rather than reflecting. I think this was because on the shrunken rib cage or vapor trail, and that was when it diminished, as in an abruptly withdrawal.
And the whole thing subsided about 7 minutes, he said, "the head itself - the whole thing just faded out the longest what would wait say the angular extent of that was."
I find that I would not simply say that this appears to be the kind of thing that I would expect by inference, the head of the big upper part: a reference, the head itself would not appear nearly that size 59 that it would, but perhaps a reflection.
At least ten degrees? Oh, yes. That vapor trail appearing portion of it extended off into the distance.
You know what would be an interesting thing here would be to describe in a medical journal where tropical storms come from. I think it might be that of being and you can ask me to describe this because -- in fact, why don't you tell me, if you can write it up and you can't know, I can't make sense of what's going on --, uh, the corner, uh-.
