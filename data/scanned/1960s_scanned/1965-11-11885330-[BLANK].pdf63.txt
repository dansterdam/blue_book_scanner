Followed by a target, followed by the wide plate spark chamber, and finally a set of radiators to identify electrons, as in the first flights. Particles which are identified as high energy protons can be considered to have a straight orbit, as an aid in calibrating the emulsion measurements. With a series of three or more emulsions, in the spark chamber-emulsion module, it is possible to establish the stability of the emulsion structure, as well as measurement techniques. Deviations from straightness for the high energy protons must result from emulsion measurement error, mechanical mounting error, and Coulomb scattering. In fact, if things go well, some estimate of the energy of individual protons might be made on the basis of the multiple scattering of the proton between emulsions. A check on the efficiency of the wide-gap spark chamber, the tracks found in the upper half of the chamber could be traced into the lower half of the chamber to make sure no tracks are lost. Another point of interest would be the chamber's ability to detect the individual members of the narrow central cone of pions (those moving forward in the center of mass system). The minimum angle or separation between two resolvable tracks would be established. These flights would serve as pilot runs to the final experimental configuration. All the major experimental components would be present, and the data analysis system could be applied to data of these flights. Moreover, the physics data available from these relatively simple flights would already be far superior to that presently obtained by conventional emulsion methods.

Flight 5 and beyond
The fifth flight would probably be the earliest possible flight to carry a superconducting magnet. Among the numerous tests in this flight would
