Time does not permit me to continue these tales. There were also a number of cases during this interval involving encounters with occupants of the craft that had landed.

Descriptions from all over France were remarkably alike. Small men, in diving suits-like costumes-all non-hostile but ready to protect themselves. Frequently it was reported that automobile motors and lights went out when the object was nearby, and promptly came back into normal operation when the object had left.

This brings to mind the famous Hopkinsville case in Kentucky, investigated by a chap who was, quite inadvertently and unknown to me at the time of his hiring, employed by me in the satellite tracking project. As time went on I got the full story from him and indeed I could have spent the entire hour tonight telling this tale, a tale so incredible that no sober scientist would care to be caught within ten feet of it. Yet it is one of the reports-and I stress again, reports, because my friend saw nothing himself, but merely interrogated, he having been at that time the announcer at their local radio station.

I have here some drawings that my friend composed from the descriptions given to him, independently, by the highly untuotored people who reported they had had this outlandish experience. This brings to mind the report of rather full New Guinea in which he stated that he waved to some creatures in a flying saucer and that they waved back!
