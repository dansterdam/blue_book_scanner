The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document, possibly from Project Blue Book, discussing a "mystery object" that was tracked over the Pacific Ocean on January 13, 1961. The document states that there was no advanced international warnings as in previous Soviet Pacific shots, and that Russian ships were a "day's sailing time from the impact area", but there was no splash noted and no further visual/electronic reports, suggesting the object could have been a UFO or another one of these objects from outer space.

Here is the full text from the document:

No Case (Information Only)                      13 January 1961
Pacific Ocean

On January 13, 1961 a "mystery object" was tracked over the Pacific
Ocean by a USAF radar station on Shemya Island, off Alaska. As there was no
advanced international warnings as in previous Soviet Pacific shots, as Russian
ships were a day's sailing time from the impact area, as there was no splash
noted and no further visual/electronic reports, this object could
have been a UFO or another one of these objects from outer space.
