UFO Sighting, Pike County, Missouri 

TO: HQ USAF SAFOTC (Mrs Hunt)
WASH D C 20330

1. Forwarded is the attached unidentified object report from 25 July and 1 Aug 65 sightings of objects over Pike County, Missouri, as a follow-up to our files of helicopter observations. The slow flight, including operations of hovering, the vertical ascent and the apparent erratic fluctuation of the red light is characteristic of these reports.

The similarities to the flashing of the lights to a strobe light effect, when the light shines through the "bubble" or open portion of the craft, is quite likely what was observed. This, coupled with the observation that the object is located on aviation station charts, is used as a reference point in cross-country flights.

2. We had no unusual reports from Pike County, Missouri during this period. The ANG reported no unidentified tracks from their radar.

Helicopters on flights of this nature could be flown by the Air National Guard, USAF, Army and/or other military units within a radius of 150 miles. In view of the reported characteristics, this incident does not appear to be an Unconventional Aerial Phenomenon.
