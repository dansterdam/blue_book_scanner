Gentlemen:
I am sorry to say that the following U.F.O.'s can be analyzed as the objects are identified as man-made and not of the nature or space or extraterrestrial origin.

On 5 November 1955, at about 5:00 p.m., on the drawing of Dec. 5, 1955, a huge, noiseless, cigar-shaped object about 3-10 miles away was seen for about 10 minutes. It was at about 10,000 feet and going about 400 mph. There were about 30 persons who saw it and it went above the clouds. It was about 200 feet long and 30-50 feet in diameter.

On 30 July 1960, at about 10:55 p.m. on the night of 1 July 1960, a bright object was seen. It was silent. It was visible for about 30 seconds.
