UFO Observation, May 13, 1957

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Ventror, New Jersey which occurred at 9:10 pm on 13 May 1957.

2. The observer described the object as a "yellow, white, flattish oval" having "vertical lines of light", one in the center. There were horizontal lines of light between the vertical lines behind it.

3. Were you operating in the Atlantic City area on or near this date? If you were not in the area at the time, do you have other advertising planes that were?

4. Thank you for your assistance.
