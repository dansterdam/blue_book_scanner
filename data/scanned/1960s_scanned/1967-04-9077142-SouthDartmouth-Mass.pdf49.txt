ATTN OF: 1-21  

SUBJECT: UFO Photograph

TO: DEPUTY COMMANDER, Ohio ACOORD, Ohio 44330

1. Reference is made to your letter, 1-20-67, subject photograph, which was forwarded to this headquarters.

2. The photograph does not show anything conclusive about the nature of the object. It does not contain sufficient detail to permit reliable interpretation or photographic analysis. The edges of the object appear blurred which would indicate that the object was moving during the exposure.

3. Ground observers should be instructed to attempt to estimate the size, distance, and direction of flight of unidentified objects, and to obtain more than one picture, if possible, in order to provide a sequence of exposures. Also, the exact time and location of the sighting should be recorded.

4. Lighting, from camera to object, as measured on the light meter, should be recorded, as well as camera settings used (aperture and shutter speed). This information may be helpful in interpreting the photographs.

5. The incident does not appear to warrant further investigation at this time. Please forward any additional information or sightings to this office.

6. I have reviewed the available information, and a sketch of the photograph is attached.
