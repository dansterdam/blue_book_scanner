The image contains two sketches or illustrations, but no actual photograph. 

The first sketch appears to show the trajectory or flight path of a high-altitude object, with the object being described as being above the horizon when first observed. The sketch includes annotations such as "BA" and "There was no change."

The second set of sketches shows a perspective view of a landscape, with a person standing on a road or path in the foreground, and another smaller sketch of a more distant horizon or landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point marked "A" and that the curved line is drawn to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, the object was in the position marked "A" when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
