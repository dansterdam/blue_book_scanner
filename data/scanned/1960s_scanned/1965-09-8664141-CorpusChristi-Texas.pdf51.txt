CHILE- 
The pilot who allegedly saw the UFO was interviewed by L. Nacinr when he returned home from the president's office.
Comments: Many sightings have been reported in the northern area of Chile. Special conditions in the atmosphere and meteorological factors may account for an unusually large number of sightings. To the observer's advantage, the area in question is sparsely populated, fortunate enough to catch sight of one.
