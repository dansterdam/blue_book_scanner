Patrolmen Report
Sky Lights

On 15 September 1962, At 10:22 p.m., two patrolmen of Hawthorne Police Department, Hawthorne, New Jersey, saw two strange "gigantic" lights in the sky. The lights seemed to be located in the direction of the Haledon, New Jersey area. The patrolmen, Sgt. Vincent Lemming and Ptl. Ray Berwick, were on desk duty. Lemming went outside the building and observed the lights. He said "they were about a mile apart" and hovered over the area for a while. The lights then began to move, flashing fast and heading out over the ocean, where they eventually disappeared.

Disc Illuminates Area

William Evans of Lebanon, R. I. recalled the following incident: On Thursday evening, 6 September, at approximately 8:30 p.m., he observed a disc-shaped object hovering over the area of his home. The object was high lighted as if it were illuminating the entire area. When he became aware of the lights, it hovered over his home briefly, then slowly descended and from side to side and then turned around. As it turned around, it seemed to be illuminating the ground with a bluish-green light. This is one more of many sightings of objects seen under similar circumstances.
