Captain Edward Rourann, Staff Navigator furnished the following information:
Venus - 12 degree elevation at a 290° degree bearing.
Jupiter - 60 degree elevation, 90 degree bearing.
Saturn: 300 degree elevation, 100° bearing.
These planets are in a fairly bright magnitude.
Dr. Light-Patterson AFB on U.C.ta could not place bright satellites in the area.
At the present time, I have not been able to determine what the object was. It was observed by several individuals whose reports tend to agree on color, size, speed and maneuver. Since I have been unable to obtain more specific information.
