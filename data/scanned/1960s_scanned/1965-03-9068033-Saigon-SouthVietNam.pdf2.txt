The image does not contain any photograph, it appears to be a scanned document with text only. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

Dear Sir:

Thank you for your letter of 23 March. I quite agree that the picture looks like some familiar object that I took with a 35mm camera. However with the excellent prints that I now have I can clearly see that it was something quite different.

Therefore, I am enclosing three negatives that I took at the same time and the following data:

1) The camera was a Japanese Minoya Autowide C-7000 III L/VBL
2) Exposure time was 1/500 sec
3) From the pilots window of a C-46
4) Locality was near the Plain of Jars, Laos

I will be leaving for home vacation on May 15th. So I would like to know that your reply be sent to the address.

Sincerely, 

Capt. [redacted]
USAT, Painesville, Ohio
