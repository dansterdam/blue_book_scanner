BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The case details an observation of two objects over Lewisburg, Ohio, that were thought to be astronomical in nature, specifically the planet Jupiter. The investigating officer, Sgt. Jones, concluded that the objects were not necessarily unusual and likely reflected the position and refraction of Jupiter. The report mentions that consultation with Dr. Hynek led to the conclusion that the objects were inconsistent with a low angle of elevation in the sky, suggesting they were more likely aircraft. However, the report states that the objects "necessarily have to be a low angle of elevation in order to reflect the position and refraction of Jupiter."
