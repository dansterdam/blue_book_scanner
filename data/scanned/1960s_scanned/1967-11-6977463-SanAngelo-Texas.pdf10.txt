The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left appears to be a compass rose with directions labeled around the perimeter. The instructions ask the viewer to place an "X" on the compass to indicate the direction of the phenomenon being observed. 

The smaller sketches on the right appear to be landscape drawings. One shows a person standing in a landscape with distant mountains or hills. The other shows a similar landscape with what looks like a bright object or light in the sky.
