There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a document that contains text describing the spectral sequence and characteristics of stars.

"As we move along the spectral sequence from stars of type O to stars of type M the temperature of the surface layers changes continuously. Other characteristics of stars, for example, their mass, their luminosity, etc., also change continuously. But the rotational velocity changes continuously only for stars of the early spectral classes from O to F2. Around the F2 class the rotational velocity changes sharply, almost stepwise. The equatorial regions of those stars that are hotter than the F2 class rotate with a velocity greater than 100 km/sec. Stars of the later spectral classes G, K and M practically do not rotate at all; their equatorial velocity is several km/sec. We have the impression that, for some reason, in the process of their development the stars of these spectral classes have lost their initial angular momentum, due to which their velocity is significantly reduced. It is curious that the magnitude of the lost momentum for the stars of the same type as the sun corresponds to the angular momentum of our planetary system. From this we can make a very plausible conclusion that the loss of angular momentum is connected with the formation of planetary systems around the stars in a definite stage of their evolution. One possible mechanism for transferring the angular momentum from a star to the forming planets, in which the role of the transfer agent is played by a magnetic field, was proposed by the English astrophysicist Hoyle."
