UFO OVER SOFIA

Trud, no. 275, 24 Nov 67, p. 4. col. 3.  

The following information was transmitted from Sofia on Nov. 23 by telephone from the Bulgarian newspaper "Trud". At sunset, against the light, a metallic object suspended in the air with the shape of a spacefilm. It should be noted that this so-called flying object was observed for approximately 30 minutes. It is objective, the flying object looked like a ball or, more precisely, a hemisphere. It lacked any noise or flame. The Institute of Hydrology and Meteorology, said that it observed the object and therefore cannot give thorough data. But it is possible to suppose that it had its own engines. Apparently, it flew at 30 km altitude. It is interesting that it did not cause any static in the radio network.
