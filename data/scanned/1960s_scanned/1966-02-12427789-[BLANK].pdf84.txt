The document discusses an analysis and interpretation of a specimen submitted by Major Quintanilla, which appears to be related to material allegedly dropped from outer space.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

The following summarizes our analyses, interpretations, and suggestions on the specimen submitted to us recently by Major Quintanilla. This is the material allegedly dropped by a visitor from outer space. Much of this information was reported previously but is included and supplemented here for the sake of completeness. We have divided our comments into several categories.

1. Composition of Fiber

The sample is composed of plant fibers from the bark or the leaf of one or more of a number of plants. A wide variety of plants of this general type grow in this country and abroad, and some species are not distinguishable from one another in fiber form. Of the more common ones, we believe the sample contains types resembling fiber from the following: cotton, ramie; it could be fiber from abaca, sisal, kozo, hemp, or a similar but less common plant.

Exhibit A includes photomicrographs showing botanical similarities of fibers from the unknown sample and from two known reference materials. It also includes photomicrographs from our files of a number of known fibers maintained as reference materials for the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry.
