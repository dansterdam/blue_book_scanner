(S) Simultaneous loss of the target by several radar and visual observers, and loss of the intelligence signal which would ordinarily have been recorded to confirm and changes in attitude can sometimes be attributed to the geometry of the reflecting or refracting pattern.

(S) The presence of the Soviet crawler is not believed to play a role in the cessation, if the sightings originated in this manner the presence would be expected to provide further additional data, which would tend to validate the observation. Obviously, this does not eliminate the possibility that the satellite solar panels could have produced the visual sightings, but the passage and the presence would not be logical and probably not be considered.
