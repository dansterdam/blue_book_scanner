SUMMARY UFO SIGHTING
(CONFIDENTIAL)

WITNESS: John Hoxtord
ADDRESS: Boxford, Mass.
PHONE: 

LOCATION OF SIGHTING: Ipswich Road, Boxford, Mass.
DATE: January 10, 1967
TIME: Approximately 7:00 AM
DURATION: Approximately 1 Minute

SIGHTING:
The witness noticed a red light coming up from the horizon and approaching his home. The object appeared at first as a flash in the kitchen window. The object appeared to be round, solid and silver in color with a white stripe about its midsection. The object displayed no lights. No sound was heard.
The object passed from the witness' line-of-sight at the kitchen window out of his living room to see if the object was now visible from this (the kitchen) window. He did not catch sight of the object which had apparently gone by this time. The witness then went outside to the kitchen window to see if he could see the object again, but it was gone.
The witness felt fairly certain that the total viewing time was about a minute. He did not seem to be able to judge the size of the object. Although he stated that the object was about the size of a Christmas ornament, the witness was uncertain of its actual size and distance. The object seemed to be traveling at high speed and at a high altitude. The witness was alone at the time and was not seeking publicity as he demands his name be kept confidential.

EVALUATION:
The witness struck me as being sober, intelligent and of average capability as an observer. He obviously was not seeking publicity as he demands his name be kept confidential.
