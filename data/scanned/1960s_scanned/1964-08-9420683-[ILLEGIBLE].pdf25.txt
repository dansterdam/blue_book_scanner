The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"SAT-LLI/PsO/ON/77617/
SERIAL: 09/29

10 SEP 1964

This is in response to your recent letter concerning information on several recent satellite observations. The information you provided is currently being evaluated by our laboratory.

It is indicated a date of July 2, 1963, as the time of your first observation. It appears that the satellite you observed was not one that we have recorded in our files, and it may be that you observed a satellite launched after that time. I regret that I cannot provide you with more definitive information concerning your observation.

For your information, both SAO and GSFC have made more precise observations of satellite orbits, and data is available for those satellites processed by these agencies.

Because of security classifications, I am unable to provide you with specific details on the satellite you observed. Your interest in this matter is appreciated.
