There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a document page from Project Blue Book containing a letter.

Proposed reply to letter from Mrs. I_________________, 10 September 1966

Dear Mrs. I_________________:

Reference your letter of 10 September 1966 in which you stated that you had photographs taken from the surface of the moon into a sunset.

A photographic analysis of your color transparencies revealed the following: The photography provided indicates central core fraction with an undetermined number of secondary refractions or reflections of the iris diaphragm in and on the optical system. The circles within the images appear to be diffraction patterns.

This is a perfect textbook example of a camera imaging its own lens diaphragm.

We wish to thank you for enabling the Air Force to review the photographs.
