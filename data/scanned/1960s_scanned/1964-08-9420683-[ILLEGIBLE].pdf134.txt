"PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT

SUBJECT: POSSIBLE UFO REPORT 
LOCATION: Biloxi Air Force Base, Texas
DATE: 27 Feb 64

PURPOSE: This report covers a sighting from Major Quintanilla, the photography containing images which might possibly be UFO's. 

INVESTIGATION: An investigation was made of the photographic negatives submitted. The following was found:

1) There are 2 color slides, each 4 x 6 inches, approximately. The subjects appear to be ground formations known as "puddles" or "ponds". There is no evidence of any structure or object that could be considered a UFO.

2) The quality of the photography was poor, with blurry definition. It was evident that the subjects were distant and that the photographs were made under unfavorable conditions.

ANALYSIS: Due to the poor quality of the photography and the nature of the subjects, which appear to be natural ground formations, it is the opinion that these photographs do not contain evidence of any unusual or unidentified aerial phenomena.

RECOMMENDATIONS: It is recommended that this case be classified as "No evidence of UFO" and the photographic materials be returned to Major Quintanilla.
