The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches and diagrams. The sketches seem to depict the motion and trajectory of some unidentified objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the survey (skyline) to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
