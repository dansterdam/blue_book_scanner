This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I have extracted all the text from the document:

I am very observing and after seeing the object called the nurse on duty with me that they wouldn't believe this as they hadn't seen it themselves. At this time it was beginning to get dark and also the intern came at some time as I knew they wouldn't believe me they seen it once in awhile after that then it disappeared out of sight and my hand keeps twitching as that light hand corner of the strip which seems to have been closed and then it immediately vanished.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron 37 May 1967 Subject,Mo.
