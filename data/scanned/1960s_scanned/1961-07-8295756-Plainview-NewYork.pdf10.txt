SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
THIS SPECIAL REPORT WAS PREPARED BY CAPT. GREGORY AND MAJ. QUINTANILLA, USAF (RET.), FROM THE BLUE BOOK FILES.

ON 27 JULY 1957, A CIVILIAN OBSERVATION REPORT OF A FLYING OBJECT WAS RECEIVED FROM PLAINVIEW, NEW YORK. THE OBSERVER, MS. MARY HYRE, REPORTED THAT SHE OBSERVED THE OBJECT AT 3:43 P.M. ON JULY 23, 1957. THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE.

DESCRIPTION: THE OBJECT WAS TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE, SILVER IN COLOR AND REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS. IT MADE NO SOUND AND REMAINED LEVEL WITHOUT CHANGING ALTITUDE DURING THE PERIOD OF OBSERVATION. THE OBJECT'S SPEED WAS VERY RAPID AND IT DISAPPEARED GOING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION.

CONCLUSION: A. THE OBSERVATION WAS PROBABLY OF A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THE SHAPE, COLOR, SPEED AND FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS ARE TYPICAL OF A JET AIRCRAFT.

B. DETERMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT'S IDENTITY WAS IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO THE LACK OF ADEQUATE INFORMATION. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO CONTACT THE OBSERVER FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS BUT SHE COULD NOT BE LOCATED.

C. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS MOST LIKELY A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
