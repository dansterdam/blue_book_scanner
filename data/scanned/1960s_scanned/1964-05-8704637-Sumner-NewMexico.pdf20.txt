Text from the document:

That same night (May 15, 1964) at 11:51 P.M. EST, a pilot and copilot of a commercial airliner, reported seeing a huge object rise from alongside 15 Rt. 150, near Greenfield, Ohio. It hovered, then shot upward and disappeared and these sightings were reported to the Civil Aeronautics Office in Ashbabule. Pix Gary Setzer went to the scene and made a thorough search and radiatively - and found it, near a small ditch.

In the Akron area, unpublished sightings which were never-theless popularly reported were made that same May 13th night.
These observers saw two, slow-moving objects-moving very slowly in the clear western sky. At the moment when they were becoming invisible, one of them increased tremendously in white brilliance. Then it dimmed quickly into invisibility. Seen for 11 minutes - time: 10:40-10:51 EDST.
