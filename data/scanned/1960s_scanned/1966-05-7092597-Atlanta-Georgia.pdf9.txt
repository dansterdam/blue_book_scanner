For a few seconds after seeing the object I thought it seemed to be flying at a tremendous speed, then as it got closer it appeared to slow down a bit. It was gray in color and seemed to shine like aluminum or other metal as the light struck it. I then noticed the objects pointed out in the sketch - the North South wings were about 20 feet long and twisted up to a point in the middle. The object seemed to give off a light pulsation effect from the bottom center in a beam about 10 feet wide and extending about 25 feet below the object.
