INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:
On September 9, 1964, at approximately 11:00 PM, a local resident reported observing a bright, unidentified aerial object hovering over the town of Glassboro, New Jersey. The object was described as being approximately 40 feet in diameter, glowing with a reddish-orange hue, and emitting a humming sound. 

Several other witnesses in the area also reported seeing the object. One witness, a local police officer, was able to take a series of photographs of the object before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The photographs were subsequently analyzed by Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects. The analysis concluded that the photographs did not provide conclusive evidence of an extraterrestrial aircraft, but the origin and nature of the object remained unexplained.

The case was classified as "unresolved" and added to the growing archive of unidentified aerial phenomena documented by Project Blue Book over the years.
