The object was oval and a bright light, about the size of a basketball, moving at a rapid rate of speed, and some distance away from me. There was no sound, and some smaller lights traveling along with the main object. The object was traveling west to east, at an altitude of 3,500 to 4,000 feet. As it passed over me, it seemed to change to a reddish light, then it changed to a red light as it continued on its way. It had the characteristics of a U.F.O. traveling past me, but I could not get close enough to determine its exact nature. It traveled faster than any known aircraft, and the lights I saw were not the running lights of an aircraft. I feel this sighting was of a U.F.O. of some kind.
