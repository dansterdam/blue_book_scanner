23 January 1963
Arica, Chile

In and around Arica, the northernmost city of Chile, a great many sightings were made during January. On the night of January 23, 1963 a crack light blue-green object was seen crossing the sky at high speed. This object was seen by numerous observers. The object approached Arica from the north and disappeared in the east in the night sky. Those observing the object claim it was only about 500 feet in altitude and that it had a strange luminous glow. Some also claim to have seen flames coming out of the rear of the object, and at times it appeared to be accompanied by smaller objects.
