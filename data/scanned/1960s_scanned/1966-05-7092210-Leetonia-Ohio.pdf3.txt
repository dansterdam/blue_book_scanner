Text from the document:

Dear Major - In the course of an investigation into a report of unidentified flying objects sighted in the Leetonia, Ohio area on 11 May 66, I interviewed the witness, Mrs. Dotty Hassell, and obtained the following information:

Mrs. Hassell reported observing three bright, metallic-appearing objects in the sky at approximately 9:50 PM on 11 May 66. She stated the objects were hovering in the sky, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. Mrs. Hassell stated she had never seen anything like this before and was quite shaken by the experience. 

I am not aware of any other similar reports from the Leetonia area on this date. If you have any additional information or would like me to pursue this matter further, please let me know.

Sincerely,
(Signed) (14j)
