Akron Flier Tells Of Strange Green Light in Air
Akron, Ohio, July 7.—(AP)—An Akron flier said today he saw a bright green light hovering in the sky near Akron Wednesday night. 
He said it appeared to be about 2,500 feet away and was brighter than a searchlight. The unidentified flier, who was not named in the report, said the light moved south at a rapid rate of speed and then disappeared.
The flier said he was flying his private plane near Akron when he first spotted the mysterious light. He said it appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was hovering about 1,000 feet above the ground. The light, he said, was so bright that it cast a reflection on the ground below.
After watching the light for about 10 to 15 minutes, the flier said it suddenly moved off to the south at a "terrific rate of speed" and then disappeared from sight. There were no other visual or electronic indications of the object, the report said.
The flier said he was a licensed pilot and flight instructor and had been flying for 10 years. He said he was certain the light was not an aircraft, meteor, or any other known object. The report was made to officials at the Akron-Canton Airport.
