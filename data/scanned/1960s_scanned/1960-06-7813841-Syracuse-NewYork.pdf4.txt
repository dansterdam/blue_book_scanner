I. PURPOSE
To determine the composition of material sent to ATIC from Syracuse, New York. 

II. FACTUAL DATA
1. Two samples of foreign material were received and assigned Physics Laboratory Numbers 6177 and 6178.
2. The samples were analyzed by emission spectroscopy, infrared, and X-ray diffraction.
3. Emission spectrochemical analysis provided these data:
   Principal - Calcium
   Majors - Silicon, magnesium, manganese, aluminum, iron, titanium, chromium
   Minor - Barium
   Traces - Nickel, copper, sodium, silver
4. The infrared spectra of the samples were recorded and placed on file. The spectra revealed no significant absorption bands. All carbon-hydrogen linkages were very weak.
5. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the material is non-crystalline in structure and appears to be glass.

III. CONCLUSIONS
Both samples appear to be of the same chemical composition.
