There is no photograph present in this image. Instead, the image shows a handwritten document, which appears to be an official U.S. Air Force form. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

The reaction I observed was that a UFO was going to work and a UFO driving a different route and was unfamiliar with the area as it did not question the observation until it returned. The observation lasted 10 to 15 minutes and it filled the entire field of view. What was encountered was a brilliance of the windows. It seemed all of the witnesses were pouring steel (red glow) but if so, it would vary in brilliance. After thinking about it for 3 days, I finally arrive at the conclusion I recalled but could not tell my profile.
