The page appears to be a questionnaire or form used for collecting eyewitness accounts related to unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings as part of Project Blue Book, a historical US Air Force program that investigated UFO reports.

The text found in the document is as follows:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't know If you answered YES, then tell what.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc, and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
