Dear Sir,

This is to notify you of the observation of a UFO incident that occurred in the Roxbury, New York area on July 9, 1964. The estimated distance of the object from the observer was 200-225 yards, and it was observed for approximately 5 minutes. The object was described as a brilliant incandescent sphere, estimated to be 30 to 35 feet in diameter, hovering about 75 feet above the ground. It was then seen to ascend rapidly and disappear from view.
