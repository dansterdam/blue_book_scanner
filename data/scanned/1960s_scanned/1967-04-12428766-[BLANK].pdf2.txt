AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWSPAPER EDITORS
NEWBOLD NOYES, JR. 
WASHINGTON STAR 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20006

May 3, 1967

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
TDET/UFO
Headquarters AFSC (AFSC)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I was out of the office all last week, hence the unconscionable delay in getting this letter off to you. But I (all of us) do want you to know how very much we appreciate your appearance before the American Society of Newspaper Editors.

I'm sure you must have had a great interest of the editors in what you had to say. I myself heard many favorable comments on your performance.

As we had anticipated, the scientists got what little heat there was from the questioners. But it meant a great deal to me to make an occasional statement that you were a good sport to take part and give us the official word.

Once again, thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to help educate the press. You did us much good.

Faithfully yours,
Newbold Noyes
