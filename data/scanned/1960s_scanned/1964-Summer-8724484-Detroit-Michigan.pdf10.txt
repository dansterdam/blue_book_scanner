"Project Blue Book
R.C. Ruigrok
Cleveland, Ohio
November 6, 1964

During the brief pause the colors of the lead object became much brighter. Land police and radio observers in the immediate vicinity had previously observed the phenomenon from the time it was first noticed. It was found that the police and observers verified the experiences of Miss Ventura later phoned the colors. The Police station report states - "The object became brilliant - almost as bright as the moon." Miss Ventura asked her mother who was present to "Look at the blue green light on the object." This was visible to the mother, but she could not confirm the illumination of any other colors she had seen. The mother went out to an unmarked car to investigate the matter and was told by the driver that he could clearly see the blue and green luminescence on the object.

The officer told her he would call the Cleveland Police Station and have them send a car. No other police car arrived on the scene that evening. The man who had called, she phoned from himself. She conversed with the caller who claimed the police would do nothing about the matter. Miss Ventura was the key witness to this incident. She had no reason to falsify any part of her report which was filled out and submitted at the police station in Cleveland. The police records verified her report. For many years experts in such things and therefore it would be unwise to disregard Ms. Ventura's report as it provided the primary source data for the incident. The officer, whose response seemed indifferent and evasive, refused to verify the incident and tended to give a consistent and indifferent attitude on the matter of such public interest."
