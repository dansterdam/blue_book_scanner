The image appears to contain a photograph of the landing area in Socorro, New Mexico, taken on April 25, 1964. The photograph shows a rugged, rocky terrain with no obvious distinguishing features.

April 25, 1964, when on the previous day at Socorro, New Mexico, a policeman, Mr. Lonnie Zamora, reported sighting an object on the ground a mile south of the town at approximately 5:45 p.m. Lonnie Zamora said the object was white, egg-shaped and supported on girder-like legs. He heard a roar and saw smoke and flames coming from underneath the object. The UFO rose to a point about 15-20 feet above the ground and then landed. He stated that the object remained stationary for several seconds and then flew off in a southerly direction, following the contour of the terrain. On several occasions he wrote Lonnie Zamora concerning his sighting and never received a reply. It was also unable to reach him by telephone. Investigators from their project office at Wright-Patterson AF Base sent investigators to Socorro to interview Lonnie Zamora and determine what the object was.
