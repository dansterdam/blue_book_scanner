During the late afternoon of 8 September 1965, at about 1600 hours, a commercial airline pilot flying a Convair 880 jet enroute from Tacoma, Washington to Portland, Oregon reported sighting an unidentified flying object. The pilot stated that the object was sighted approximately 15 miles northeast of Tacoma at an estimated altitude of 35,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was observed for about two minutes before it disappeared from sight.

The pilot's report was received by the Tacoma Radar Approach Control and relayed to the 25th NORAD Region Control Center at McChord Air Force Base, Washington. An investigation was immediately initiated by the 25th NORAD Region.

The pilot was interviewed by NORAD personnel and stated that the object appeared to be rotating or spinning as it moved at a high rate of speed. He also stated that the object seemed to reflect or emit a bright light. No other aircraft were in the immediate vicinity at the time of the sighting. The pilot's report was confirmed by the Tacoma Radar Approach Control.

The 25th NORAD Region investigation revealed that there were no known aircraft, satellites, or other objects in the area that could have been mistaken for the object sighted by the pilot. All available radar and visual sighting information was gathered and evaluated by the NORAD investigators.

After a thorough analysis of the information collected, the 25th NORAD Region concluded that the object sighted by the commercial airline pilot was an unidentified flying object. The incident was forwarded to NORAD Headquarters, Colorado Springs, Colorado, for further evaluation.
