The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

On 1-29-'66 at about 8:00 a.m. while standing outside my home at 3624 Sherwood Way, Sacramento, California, I saw an unidentified flying object. It was round, silver in color and about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It was traveling in a northwesterly direction and seemed to be about 2,000 to 3,000 feet altitude. The object was moving at a very high rate of speed and was completely silent. I watched it for about a minute before it disappeared from sight. Shortly after seeing this object, I was interviewed by two Air Force officers who examined my eyes for night blindness, checked my background, and took down all details of my sighting. I was quite impressed by their professional manner and by their apparent interest in obtaining all possible information about this sighting.
