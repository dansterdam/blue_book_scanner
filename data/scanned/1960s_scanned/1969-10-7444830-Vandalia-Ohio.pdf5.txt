This page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document contains a questionnaire titled "Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire". There is a sketch or diagram in the bottom half of the page that appears to show an angular or curved profile of an object in the sky relative to the observer's position. The text in the document is as follows:
