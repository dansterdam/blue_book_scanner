The image contains a sketch depicting the motion and trajectory of a UFO object. The sketch includes a compass rose and instructions for the viewer to mark the position of the object. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "S" on the point where you first saw the object, and an "F" on the point where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
