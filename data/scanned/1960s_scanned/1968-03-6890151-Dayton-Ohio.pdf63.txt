The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a blank page from a Project Blue Book document, with instructions and a question about estimating the size of an object in the sky based on the size of the match head.

Text from the document:

APRIL 20-17(C)

13. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HELD BY A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF YOUR SUBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE THIS ACCURATELY AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE DIAMETER OF THE OBJECT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN.
