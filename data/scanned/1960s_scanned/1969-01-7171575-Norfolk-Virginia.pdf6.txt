STATEMENT OF

On or about 1935, 10 January 1959 my wife and I were leaving our house to go to the shopping center in Portsmouth, Virginia. I happened to glance up at the sky and noticed that it was a very clear night and that all the stars were fairly visible. As I looked up in the general direction of the 300r, I noticed a strange light in the sky, which seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. At first I thought that it might have been a white light on the top of the tower, however, on the top of the tower observation that it was not in the same area as the tower and that all lights were extinguished on Tower #5.

About the best description that I can derive of what I saw was an elongated light of the type used on aircraft, however, this particular light did not have any blinking or pulsating action, unlike the usual type of lights observed on aircraft. Also, it remained stationary and did not move like a helicopter, because it remained practically motionless, except for a slight swaying motion. The time of my second observation was about 2120, 10 January 1959. I reported my two sightings to the Naval Radio Station (D), Driver, Virginia.
