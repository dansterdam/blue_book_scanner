1. Reference your intelligence data. The object observed by AIC David R. Mosley and other personnel at Roswell, New Mexico is characteristic of an astronomical sighting (Capella and Arcturus) with the exception of the reported downward motion from the northeast to the northwest. It is requested that a film strip of the object be maintained and a time sequence of the flight path of the object in terms of degree of elevation and azimuth be obtained and forwarded to this office.
