AFR 80-17
ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1968 I WAS SENT ON A FIELD TRIP WITH ONLY A FEW HOURS NOTICE TO THE MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE AREA TO INVESTIGATE A SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT THAT HAD BEEN REPORTED. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE NAVAL AIR STATION AT MILLINGTON, TENNESSEE HAD PICKED UP THE OBJECT ON RADAR AND THAT IT HAD MANEUVERED OVER THE MEMPHIS AREA. I WAS ABLE TO INTERVIEW SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY HAD SEEN THE OBJECT AND THAT IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. HOWEVER, I WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OR OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO CORROBORATE THEIR CLAIMS.
