Transcription of the text in the document:

UFO LANDS AT AIR FORCE BASE
Holloman AFB - White Sands Proving Ground Integrated
Test Range.
The loudspeaker at Main Control blared these electrifying
words: "The get a UFO!" It was April 30, 1964, just the day
after Lonnie Zamora spotted the landed object at Socorro.
Upon being questioned, the B-57 pilot replied: "It's egg-
shaped and white." "Any markings?" asked Control. "None
as Socorro," the pilot said. "We lost sight of the object. It
seemed to be making another pass." 5.7 minutes later, the
B-57 pilot told Main Control, "It's on the ground."
Then radio communications ceased. Photo crews were asked
to stand by.
Ground observers concluded that a UFO was in landing at Holloman
under heavy guard.
Other unidentified lights had been sighted on the Range,
during April, prior to Zamora's sighting. Another involved a
guard who saw a UFO on the ground at night. Helicopter pilots
reported seeing lights, the attempted to side arm at the object.
they then fled, with the UFO seemingly in hot pursuit. He reached 
Base HQ and was so badly shaken, he was hospitalized.
Attempts by the Lorenzens to verify the rumors have been
unsuccessful.
Visual Observation on May 15, between 11:30
A.M. and 12:15 P.M. Surveillance...Radar as well as TV-16
cameras at Stallion Site, tracked two objects in the area North of
Socorro. The objects were described as "white or light in color,
circular in shape, side-by-side flight, separating, then rejoining
each other, and accelerating and up and down (zigzag) maneuvers."
Visual confirmation was made by a trained radar operator
who saw the two objects he described them as brown and football-
shaped. The objects "were flying at low altitude and disappeared
beyond buildings at the instrumentation side where the radar
operators are them visually.
