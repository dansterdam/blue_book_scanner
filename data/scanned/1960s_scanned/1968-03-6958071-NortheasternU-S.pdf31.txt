Dear Sir,

I was thinking about our conversation last night. I am Fred S. Gray of Stamford, Conn, and I have some information that I think might be of interest to your organization. I was in the newspaper office of this publication a couple days ago concerning a sighting of an unusual light that occurred on Saturday night, February 3, 1968.

I did not see anything myself, but I was in the newspaper office when a couple of people came in to report what they had seen. They described seeing a very bright light in the sky over the Long Island Sound area around 8 p.m. on that date. The light was described as being much brighter than any star or planet, and it maneuvered in a very unusual manner, suddenly speeding up and then hovering, changing directions rapidly. This event lasted for 10-15 minutes.

The newspaper staff was quite interested in the report and planned to investigate further and possibly publish a story. I am passing this information on to you in case it might be of interest or value to your organization. Please treat this information confidentially. 

If you have any questions or would like any additional details, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

P.S. It was forwarded to me by N.E.T.O. N.L.O. Adviser.
