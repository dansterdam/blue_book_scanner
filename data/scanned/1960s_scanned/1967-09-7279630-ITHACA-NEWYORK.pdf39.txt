Here is the text transcribed from the document:

"(12 CIVIL CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, 1967)

RESOLVED, That this Convention make room for protection to all religious sects and denominations, and allow no inequality among them, and to all others who shall demean themselves peaceably as good citizens, and that the clergy of the several religious denominations throughout the State shall be eligible to seats in the Convention.

Any person of proper faith, sect, or group belong to a religious organization, and in common with theological doctrine and moral requirements of the membership thereof said persons shall be, and are hereby, declared to be eligible.

ANY MEMBERSHIP LIMITATIONS as to women, children, owners? No.

Beyond that certain or unusual groupies), thisway of living?, of community, organization or denomination shall not be abridged on ground of race, color or previous condition of servitude.

Is the South any particular or peculiar to the result of unconstitutional conditions, national in character, of a distinctly separate nature as compared to the North - as far as the circumstances of life and property rights, and the facilities for education and training for the young and the aged poor and infirm are concerned? Conditions in the states are so different and the causes so varied, that a general system applicable to all is impracticable.

You state in the first paragraph & list that the actual human beings in the group or sect have no limitation as to women, children, owners? No. 

Beyond the text there is no further description or context. The document appears to be discussing issues of religious freedom, membership, and treatment of different groups, but without more context it's difficult to say definitively what the full scope and purpose of this document is.
