The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report. I will now act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and produce the text found in the document:

MOVE IS A STRAIGHT LINE
STAND STILL ABOUT 4-5 SECONDS AND THEN MOVE AGAIN
OBVIOUSLY SPEEDS UP AND SLOWS DOWN
STARTS TO VIBRATE AND THEN WON'T LAST
GIVE OFF SPARKY
WOULD REACH TREMENDOUS SPEED
FLASH ON FLICKERSI DEFINITELY AND DEFINITELY
MADE A NOISE
LITTLE OVER- ALLISOULDN'T TELL, MOTION EDITION TO THE PHENOMENA

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
SEEMED TO JUST GO FAR BEYOND MY SIGHT AND THEY SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS SO DARK IT WAS HARD TO SEE IF IT WENT BEHIND SOMETHING BUT IT SEEMED TO JUST DISAPPEAR INTO THE DISTANCE.
