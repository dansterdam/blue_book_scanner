From the 3 
Good Morning - I wish to report that I was observing an object in the sky this morning at approximately 10:15 a.m.

It was circular in shape, appeared to be metalic (sic) in color, and was traveling in a northerly direction.

ENS to USN as
observed a similar object some time ago. Thought this may be of interest to your department.

Thank you for your attention in this matter.
Sincerely,
