The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a letter or report, from the Institute for Aerospace Studies at the University of Toronto.

I appreciate the fact that the object may have been a very high altitude aircraft, although the speed with which it travelled and the absence of any sound would indicate that it probably was not. I would be interested to hear if you have any further explanations to offer, which might lead to a better understanding of this observation. I hope that I can be of some assistance in this matter.

Sincerely,
