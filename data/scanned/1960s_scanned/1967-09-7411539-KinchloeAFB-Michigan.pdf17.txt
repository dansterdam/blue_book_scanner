REPLY TO
ATTN OF: 507WG-CIO     28 September 1967

SUBJECT: UFO Message of 12 Sep 67.

TO: FTD (TD-ET/UFO)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45438

1. Reference telcon of 26 September 1967.

2. To clarify my message of 12 Sep 67 on the UFOs that were picked up on Kincheloe AFB RAPCON:

a. Between the hours of 0342Z and 0501Z, a total of seven (7) unidentified flying objects (UFOs) were sighted by SSgt Michael Burns on the MPQ-14 radar at the RAPCON site here. Mr. Melvin message indicated (16) UFOs, but according to Sergeant Burns there were 17 (he must have skipped one when he was reporting the sightings to me over the telephone).

b. On two (2) instances there were two (2) UFOs on the scope at one time. First, at about 0412Z, (items c and f under B-3 in my message) one UFO at 230 degrees tracking 030 degrees for twenty miles and then changed its heading to 360 degrees. At the same time another UFO at 280 degrees tracking 100 degrees for 20 miles turned to 180 degrees where it met the other about 30 miles east of Kincheloe. The two then proceeded side by side on a eastbound course at 2000 mph.

c. The other instance of two UFOs on the scope at one time occurred at 0500z (items 6a and 6b in my message). These two UFOs did not fly together or intercept each other like the two UFOs did at 0412z. 

3. If there should be any other questions please do not hesitate to call.
