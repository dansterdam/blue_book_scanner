k. Position title and comments of the preparing officer: CHECKED AS PHASE 3 PROJECT: USAF, BASE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS - Comments: ON 23 AUG 1966- USAF BASE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS was interviewed and the case was determined to be NON OF INTEREST. THIS SIGHTING WAS RESOLVED TO BE THE REFLECTION FROM BRIGHT MOONLIT CLOUDS. HE WAS NOT SEEKING PUBLICITY OR SENSATIONS AND THAT HIS OBSERVATION THAT NIGHT WAS SINCERE AND IN GOOD FAITH. THERE IS NOTHING DEFINITE TO SUGGEST THAT THERE WERE TWO (2) SETS OF THREE (3) FLASHING LIGHT OBJECTS OBSERVED, NOR IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHED FACT THAT THESE LIGHTS WERE SEEN BY SEVERAL PERSONS IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND THAT AN AIR FORCE CREW CHIEF AND OTHERS SAID THEY SAW THE LIGHTS FROM THE HILLSIDE FROM THESE DEPRESSIONS APPROXIMATELY TEN (10) SECONDS BEFORE THEY WERE OBSERVED ON THE BASE. CREDIBLE MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO HAVE OBSERVED THE PICTURES OF THE AREA AND WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH WILD GEESE, WILD DUCKS, AND OTHER FORMS OF LIFE COMMONLY OBSERVED INDICATE THAT OBSERVATIONS OF THESE REPORTS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED EVIDENCE OF PHENOMENA UNEXPLAINED DUE TO ANIMAL LIFE.
