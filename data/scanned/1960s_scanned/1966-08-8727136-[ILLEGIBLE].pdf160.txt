Dear Sir,

I have just received a newspaper article which appeared in your issue of 12 August 1966. The accompanying provided various descriptions of unusual lights observed by persons attending the Stephens Postage Stamp Convention.

As Assistant Chief of Project Blue Book, the Air Force office concerned with the investigation of unidentified flying objects, I have carefully examined the details contained in your article.

After having spent a full day in investigating, I offer the following comments:

There were a total of 13 B-52 and KC-135 bomber and tanker aircraft participating in a night refueling mission approximately 15-30 miles northeast of Louisville. These aircraft were participating in a night prefueling mission that occurred at the same time and in the same general area as the Stephens Postage Stamp Convention. Maneuvers of the jet aircraft could account for the various colored lights observed in this east-west direction south of Louisville.

A ground-light effect, which would have accounted for the "pulsating" feature of the lights, is believed to have been caused by the aircraft. These aircraft would account for those colors being observed.

During the mission, they definitely should have, since these aircraft were participating in the exercise. The distance would account for the various intensities of the lights.

Sincerely,
W. J. MARKEL, Lt Col, USAF
Asst, Chief Project Blue Book
