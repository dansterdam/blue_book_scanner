Gentlemen:
May I inform you that on 18 April 1962 at approximately 10:00 p.m., a friend and I observed an unusual aerial object approximately 1/2 mile from our location. The object was hovering and then suddenly accelerated to a very high rate of speed and disappeared. I would appreciate it if you could investigate this matter and provide me with any information you may have concerning this incident. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I will be glad to provide any additional information or answer any questions you may have.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
