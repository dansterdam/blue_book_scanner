Dear Sir:

This letter is in regard to your letter of September 27, 1967 to ... regarding an unidentified flying object sighting over Chicago, Illinois. 

I am employed by Mr. ... and take all incoming telephone calls for the Pal-Waukee Airport during the hours 11:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M. About 1:00 A.M. on 10 September 1967, a girl telephoned this past summer (don't recall her name) who lives in the Illinois area. She said that she and her friend had completed their working shift at 11:00 P.M. The observed this lighted object in the sky to the southeast. She said that it had to be over Pal-Waukee or Chicago and asked if we could see it.

I could see the object she was speaking of and told her it looked like it was directly over the city of Chicago.

I am familiar with aircraft displaying landing lights. The lights are pronounced and the aircraft can readily visible. From the information she gave me, it was between 3,000 to 5,000 feet directly over the Chicago Loop or to an area one or two miles inland. It had an outline similar to one and one half times as large as if looking at an aircraft with lights on. The lights were within the confines of this outline however. Her description of the lights gave me the impression light bulbs, perhaps 15 to 30 minutes, and being exhausted it again retire.

I was positive it could be seen from her area, and I could observe it as vividly from Pal-Waukee. I was positive it could be seen by the O'Hare Tower personnel or some time pilot.
