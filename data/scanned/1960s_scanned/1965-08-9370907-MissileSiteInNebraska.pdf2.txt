1. Reference AFIR 200-2, as amended. The following described unidentified flying objects are an addition to our report of 6 August 1965:

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS: The reported objects are plotted on the attached maps with descriptions as referenced in subparagraph 2. below.

2. Reported by 2d Missile Division, Eglin AFB, Florida. First sighting occurred at approximately 1430 hours on 29 August 1965. The objects were described as bright spheres and the second sighting occurred at approximately 1640 hours the same day with the observation of two objects approximately one mile apart, moving at a high rate of speed at an angle of about 30 degrees.

3. Reported from Radar Section, Cape Kennedy AFS, Florida, and observed by nine military personnel. See plot number 2.

(1) The first sighting was of an object the size of a star which appeared to be traveling at a high speed, disappearing in about 10 to 15 seconds. Very fast, and disappeared.

(2) The second sighting was of two objects near the north of the observation station. One object had a brightness approximately equal to the station's navigation beacon, while the other was dimmer and seemed to be a little slower in speed. Both objects changed direction in a zigzag manner, at times appearing to stop, then continuing on. The last object was visible for about 10 minutes.

Objects reported by ATIC to the Geophysical Survey Team, who observed them with the aid of a telesonic (equivalent to a 40 power telescope).

(1) Object appeared to be elliptical in shape, appeared the size of a pinhead, and maneuvered in a complex and erratic manner. See plot number 1.

In the middle of the field of view, a diffuse or hazy object was observed. This object was larger and had less definite form, and was indistinct as shown on plot.
