The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a handwritten document or report. As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

About a quarter of a mile west of Kamiah, Idaho, on June 6, 1966, at approximately 2320 hours, two Idaho State Police Officers, while on routine patrol, observed an unidentified flying object. The object was described as being round, with a red glow around the outside edge, and a white light in the center. The object was observed to hover over the area for approximately 60-90 seconds and then rapidly accelerate and disappear from view. The two officers reported the sighting to their dispatch office and the report was forwarded to the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book.
