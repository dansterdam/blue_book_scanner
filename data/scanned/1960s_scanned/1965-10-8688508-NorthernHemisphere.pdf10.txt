Newly-Sighted Comet Visible Here
The newly-discovered comet, for which astronomers have been searching, first sighted it Sept. 18, has now been identified as a definite visitor to our northern hemisphere. This amazing celestial visitor will be visible here in the Dayton area suburbs every morning this week before dawn. It will be visible low on the eastern horizon.
Comet At Xenia
