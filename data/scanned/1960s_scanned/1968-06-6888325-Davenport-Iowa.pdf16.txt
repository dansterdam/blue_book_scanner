DAVENPORT, IOWA - 6888325 - JUNE 6, 1968 

THIS CASE WAS ORIGINALLY CLASSIFIED AS AN UNKNOWN BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK. HOWEVER, ON THE BASIS OF FURTHER ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION, THIS CASE HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED AS A PROBABLE SATELLITE OR SPACE DEBRIS REENTRY. 

THE WITNESS REPORTED OBSERVING A BRIGHT, FAST-MOVING OBJECT CROSSING THE SKY. PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN, BUT DUE TO THE POOR QUALITY OF THE IMAGES, LITTLE DETAIL CAN BE DETERMINED FROM THEM.  

BASED ON THE WITNESS DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION, IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT THE OBSERVED OBJECT WAS A SATELLITE OR SPACE DEBRIS REENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE AT HIGH SPEED. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THIS WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN.
