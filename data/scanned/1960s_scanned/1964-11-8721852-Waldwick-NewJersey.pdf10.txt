NEW "PHYSICAL EVIDENCE" - Dr. J. Krain, a trained psychologist, and parapsychologist, has examined the strange thread-like substance which he discovered while driving his car some time during 1964. This substance, according to Dr. Krain, is "considerably stronger than ordinary thread," and was lying in a small clump on the highway. Dr. Krain took samples of it which he had analyzed by an independent laboratory specializing in this type of material. The analysis showed "remarkable" findings. The substance was found to be identical with a material previously reported by two American scientists to have been found by them also on a highway. The earlier analysis of this substance had shown it to be of unexplained or "unknown" origin. Dr. Krain could not identify the substance or determine its origin, and gave it to Dr. Eugene Schwartz, one of America's leading parapsychologists, for further study and analysis. The material is reminiscent of angel's hair, but is not the same. Since angels' hair is composed of silicate material that is normally woven, this substance which Dr. Krain has discovered is a completely new type of material for which no scientific explanation is available. Whoever finds such material should immediately give it to a chemical laboratory for scientific analysis, as it may prove to be a significant discovery.
