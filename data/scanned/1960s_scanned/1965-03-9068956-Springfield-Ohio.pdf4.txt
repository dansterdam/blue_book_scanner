The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with a form that includes questions about the observed object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
    a. Sound
    b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times the object's diameter would equal the match head. If we had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the size, proportions, etc., and especially whether trails or vapor trails were observed. Place an arrow beside the direction of the object's movement.
