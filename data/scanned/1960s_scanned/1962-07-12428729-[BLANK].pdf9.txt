OFFICIAL FILE COPY

Unidentified Flying Objects
Hq USAF SAF-01 3b (Mrs. Wells) 
Wash 25 DC
1. Congressman Carl Vinson requested information from the USAF regarding the Unidentified Flying Objects program. Attached is a copy of the proposed reply to Congressman Vinson which we forwarded to AFNIN for passing to SAFLL.

2. Mr. Vinson 1's letter forward by an appeal for a Congressional hearing which was made to him by John Pourioy Speights of USAIL Bradford Associates, North Carolina. Mr. Speights requested information on UFO's from the Air Force on two previous occasions and was properly answered each time. 

3. Apparently Major Keyhoe's appeal to the members of NICAP, through the organization bulletin "UFO Investigator," to write to their Congressman requesting hearings has at least one response. We believe that the SAFLL staff should be apprised of this situation and preventsattempts by Major Keyhoe to discredit the USAF and bring about Congressional hearings on the UFO program.
