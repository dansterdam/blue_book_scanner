NEAR NEWTON, GEORGIA
November 23, 1968

This sighting was investigated and evaluated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Air Force Scientific Consultant on UFO's. The following represents a brief summary of his analysis and conclusions regarding this sighting:

Witness says a bright light above the road about 200 feet ahead of him and 50 to 75 feet off the ground as he rounded a bend in his 1957 Chevrolet. The area was brightly lighted. There was no definite object, just light. The car radio faded into static. The light itself emitted a beam downward that illuminated nearly trees.

Light then was retracted as if the beam were a ladder; it was five to six feet wide and well-defined. Main light was fuzzy on the edges. Now the engine cut out as did the radio. Main light appeared scintillating with a suspended arc of several degrees. 

Light then disappeared after a few seconds, going straight up. Engine started by itself, and car had been left in drive gear.

CONCLUSION: Unidentified
