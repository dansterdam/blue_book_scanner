JUL 29 1965

Dear Mr. Spaulding:

Reference is made to your specific question regarding the sightings of unidentified flying objects at Economy, Pennsylvania, on May 28, 1965.

The information received indicates that several persons reported seeing an object described as round or circular in shape, silent in operation and displaying no lights. This object was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes and was first seen at around 9:45 p.m. on May 28, 1965. No further details are available concerning the object or its movements.

In view of the lack of substantiating evidence, we are unable to offer any definitive conclusions regarding this incident. The file has been placed in our inactive files, pending receipt of any additional information that may be developed. 

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
