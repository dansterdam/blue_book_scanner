The image does not contain any photograph or visual depiction. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. I will now proceed to extract and output all the textual content present in the document:

On July 25, 1966 at approximately 0840 GMT I noticed two extremely bright objects approximately 5-7 degrees overhead. The one on the right proceeded a little higher than the one on the left. They appeared to speed in a Southerly direction. The color was a bright white. No sound was heard.

On July 26, 1966 at about 0735 GMT I was called out to note an object that had characteristics that led blinking upon it indicating a pulsing or flashing type light with a steady glow. It remained stationary during my observation which was based on the criteria. It remained stationary during my observation which was of a relatively short duration.

On July 27, 1966 I have nothing to contribute that has not already been stated by others.
