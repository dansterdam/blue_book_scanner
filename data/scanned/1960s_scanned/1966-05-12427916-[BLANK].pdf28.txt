There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document titled "Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO)". The text appears to be the regulation establishing the UFO program, including details on the program's responsibilities, reporting procedures, and definitions of key terms. I will now transcribe the full text of the document:
