NARRATIVE:
On September 9, 1964, at approximately 7:00 p.m. CST, a bright white light was observed in the sky near Soudan, Minnesota, hovering over Lake Vermilion. The light was described as being round or oval in shape and approximately 100 feet in diameter. It remained stationary for about 5 minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view. Numerous witnesses reported seeing the object, which included local residents and employees of the nearby taconite mine. An on-site investigation was conducted by Air Force personnel, but no physical evidence was found, and the case was classified as "Unidentified".
