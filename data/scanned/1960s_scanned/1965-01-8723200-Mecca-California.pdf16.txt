AFDASCA/241

The following is a summary of letter dated 2 February 1965 and sent to IPIOBECT BLUE BOOK, Information Officer, USAF (SAC-EDII), Washington, D.C., by Mr. ---, Rome, Italy.

The writer describes himself as a 40-year-old resident of Rome, a butcher by trade and for many years has been an amateur astronomer and owns a small telescope and a library of 300 books on the subject.

On 13 January 1965, the writer's sighting took place while visiting a cemetery in Verano, at 11:00 a.m. According to his summary, he sighted a luminous object in the sky which appeared for a few minutes and then immediately disappeared. He thought it could have been a star or a planet due to its position in the firmament.

"After some moments a second object detached itself from the first and steadily gaining altitude around the CICCI and then suddenly disappeared at great speed."

"A third object detached itself from the original but did not circle about the first but sped away with astounding velocity, also to the westward."

The sighting perplexed him and, as he states, although he has sighted strange objects at night, the daytime sighting concerned him and he calculated the height at 20,000 meters and the escape velocity of the objects as being that of the "CICCI" satellites. The direction of departure flight of the second and third objects was from east to west.
