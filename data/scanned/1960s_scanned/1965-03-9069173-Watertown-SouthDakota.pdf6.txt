Dear Sir:

Last night I noticed a peculiar occurrence and since you deal with this kind of work I was hoping you might be able to provide an explanation as to exactly what it was I saw. 

I had just arrived home from some errands and stopped to look up at the sky. It was a clear, starlit night without any noticeable cloud cover. As I paused to watch the sky, for a moment there was suddenly a bright flash almost directly overhead. I realized immediately that it wasn't a meteor because of its high rate of speed, unlike that of a meteor. This lasted only a few seconds and I was alone, but I would appreciate confirming it with you.

Sincerely yours,
