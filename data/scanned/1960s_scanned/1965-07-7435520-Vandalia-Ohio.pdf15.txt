MEMO FOR THE RECORD: 19 JUL 65

He observed two unidentified objects at approximately 2300 hrs on 13 July. According to the report, the first object looked like echo around 1100 mph except that it made a curve to the south. First, it was observed west to east, then to go 45 to 50 degrees of arc, observed for three minutes, was orange in color. The second object was not easily distinguishable over the telegraph lines, therefore we cannot be sure that a more detailed description could be made. I cannot say that would be alright.
