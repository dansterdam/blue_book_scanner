SURVEYOR LANDING GEAR

Project Surveyor is a scientific task with the end requirement of successfully accomplishing a landing on the moon. The lunar vehicle landings on the moon is incorporated in each leg to dissipate some of the touchdown energy and to store the balance. NWL is responsible for the design, production, and testing of this unit which was originally initiated in 1959.

The design parameters are very severe. Temperatures range from + 275 F to - 300 F, pressures inside the unit is up to 15,000 psi, and pressures outside the unit drop to 10-14 torr. The required damping profile is both a function of unit velocity and unit stroke position.

The unit contains a gas charge at 1500 psi and will retain such a charge for 12 months. External mounting parts are encapsulated by flexible metal bellows. The unit uses a special grade of titanium (13 CR 11V 3 AL) heat treated to 185,000 psi minimum. A very detailed and comprehensive reliability program controls this product. 

By the nature of its' end usage, the production of the shock absorbers will be small. However, the engineering, product know-how, and special experience requirement are very large. This unit typifies NWL Company's capacity for small production runs on sophisticated hardware.
