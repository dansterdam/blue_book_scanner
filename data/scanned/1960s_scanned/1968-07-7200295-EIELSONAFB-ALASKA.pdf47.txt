MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone call of 13 Nov 63 to Minot AFB, North Dakota

On 13 November 1963 we called Minot AFB for Col Verlich, however, we could not reach him at either of his telephone numbers. The base telephone said that they were having an exercise at the time and couldn't bother their phones. We had wanted to request information on the weather.
