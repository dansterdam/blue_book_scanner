There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED BY BLINDING FLASHES THAT WERE VISIBLE JUST BEFORE THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:
IT MOVED BEHIND A CLOUD

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):    Yes    No    Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:
IT MOVED IN FRONT OF A CLOUD

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: SILENT
b. Color: BRIGHT WHITE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
NEAR THE SIZE OF THE MATCH HEAD

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
