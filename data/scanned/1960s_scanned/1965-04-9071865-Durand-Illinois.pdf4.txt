Dear Sirs:

I'm reporting an UFO that I saw April 15, 1965, at 7:35 pm on a farm southeast of Durand, Ill. I thought at first that I was seeing a meteor because the object appeared to be dropping straight down and was flashing at a dizzy speed (like speed could have been 100 feet per second). As it cleared some trees I saw that it was fluttering very low, a couple of hundred feet perhaps. As it cleared some trees I saw jets or flares coming from behind, or it may be emitting flashes which were reflecting on the trees. The best way to describe it would be with a sketch which I am enclosing. I'm not at all sure of the details, but it seems that there were faint blue-green lights in two circular areas (like spot could have been 15 inches in diameter) which I think gave the white outline to the fire part.

It soon went out of sight for about the count of 5 or 6 seconds that it vanished as it went back into a wooded area. I'm not a person given to "seeing things" nor having visions, but I'll have to admit that I found myself not believing my eyes on that one.

A now confirmed believer in Martians.
