The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a questionnaire form from Project Blue Book, titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE". The form contains several questions about the details of a UFO sighting, including the date, time, location, and description of the phenomenon. There is also a sketch area where the witness is asked to provide a drawing of the observed object.

The text in the document is as follows:
