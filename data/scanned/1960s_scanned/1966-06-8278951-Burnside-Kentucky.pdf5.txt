Dear Major Quintanella:

This letter is to report an incident that occurred on June 16, 1966 between 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM E.D.T. I observed this incident while at home with my family. The sighting occurred immediately, and it looked like a bright object that seemed to be hovering or stationary in the sky. This object discharged some form of light that appeared to be flashing or pulsating in a pattern that repeats itself. I am forwarding this report to you, please accept my apology.

Yours truly,
Robert Burnside
Burnside, Kentucky
June 16, 1966
