Dear Sir,

I write to Mr. Conlon at the University of Colorado November search about the project office, UFO sightings are closed.

We sent you your address.  This is not a report of an individual sighting such as anyone may have. They appear in such numbers and so frequently anyone can see them.

Apparently they congregate there.
