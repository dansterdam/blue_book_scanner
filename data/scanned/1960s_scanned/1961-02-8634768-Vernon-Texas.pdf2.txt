There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a letter regarding the Air Force's policy on reporting unidentified flying objects.

The text of the document is as follows:

27 February 1961

Dear Mr. ---------,

I read with interest your letter of 18 February 1961, in which you outlined the purpose of your new organization, the AARC/AISS. As stated, we are just as interested in your organization and will be happy to assist you in any way we can.

The Air Force policy is to encourage people who sight unidentified flying objects to report these to the Intelligence or Operations officer at the nearest Air Force Base. If on 27 February 1961, you were doing as the Air Force would like you to do, we would be happy to receive your reports which would be of great value to us in our continuing effort to identify such objects by radar.

For your information we are enclosing the latest Department of Defense Fact Sheet on UFOs. This clearly states the position of the Air Force and the Department of Defense on this controversial subject.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM M. MACE
Captain, USAF
