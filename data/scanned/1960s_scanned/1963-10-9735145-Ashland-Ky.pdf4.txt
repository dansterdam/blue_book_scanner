The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of UFO reports investigated by the United States Air Force.

The text in the document reads:

The Office of The President has asked the Air Force to provide you with information concerning your sighting of unidentified flying objects which you reported.

We are unable to determine from your drawings just what you have been sighted. If this was an actual sighting, we will be glad to go into this matter further with you and try to furnish an explanation if we can. On the other hand, if this was not an actual sighting, but merely something you possibly can, and then passed the story to me, there is little we can do to further the matter.

We hope that you will disregard the entire matter as an unfounded story, and will not give this any further publicity. If, however, you have additional information that you wish to submit, we will be glad to receive it from you.

Sincerely,

CHARLES T. VAN VLIET
Colonel, USAF Information
Chief, Project Blue Book
