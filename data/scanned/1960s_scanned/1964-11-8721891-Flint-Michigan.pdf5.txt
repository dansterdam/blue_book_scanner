Dear Sir
This is the report concerning the sighting I made the other day.
I was in my backyard with my nephew when we spotted a strange bright light moving across the sky. It was moving rather fast and seemed to be larger than usual. We watched it for several minutes as it moved to the northwest. At one point it seemed to shoot off a smaller light which quickly went out. The main light continued on its course until it disappeared.
I thought you should know about this incident.
Yours truly,
