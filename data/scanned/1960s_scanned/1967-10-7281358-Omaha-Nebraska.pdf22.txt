The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report about a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on Wallops Island.

Text from the document:

Mrs. Annalan also saw the Wallops Island rocket display and said that it didn't look anything like this. The time is pretty accurate as she was hurrying to get to something like Desmond. After she discarded the object it showed her pictures of the Irinidad Island UFO. She immediately identified it as the same thing she saw.

I checked the area during the daytime to see if there were any signs on high poles or other things that may have given the appearance described when illuminated at night. There was nothing that even remotely fitted the description of the object seen.

I have known Mrs. Annalan for almost three years (she's my mother in law). She is not an excitable person, and I can vouch for her reliability in general.
