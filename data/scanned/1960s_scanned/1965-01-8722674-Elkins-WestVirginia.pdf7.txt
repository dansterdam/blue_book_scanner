Dear Mr. Fitzgerald:
Reference is made to the unidentified flying object which you observed as a passenger in an aircraft on 22 January 1965 over the airma of Elkins, West Virginia.
Your observation has been evaluated as a solar image by Project Blue Book. While rare, this unique phenomena has been reported before and on one occasion it was photographed. This phenomena occurs only at certain angles with the sun, and the reflecting surfaces is a thin layer of ice crystals in the atmosphere. This layer is transparent and not visible from the aircraft.
I am enclosing a copy of the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force's project on unidentified flying objects. I hope this report will be of interest to you.
Sincerely,
JOHN F. SPAULDING
