MEMORANDUM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION (Major Godwin) 
OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE LIAISON

SUBJECT: Reply to Congressman Reuss in Behalf of Constituent - REF: PBB UFO CASE

1. Before providing the draft of a suggested reply to Congressman Reuss in behalf of his constituent concerning this case, two independent investigations of the facts have been conducted by the U. S. Air Force:
  a. Special consultant on matters of this type, Dr. J. Allen Hynek. The results of this independent analysis by Dr. Hynek are attached.
  b. AFC Materials Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio for scientific analysis. The results of this scientific analysis by the AFC Materials Laboratory indicated that the object was made of tin and was a fairly common natural phenomenon and not of an extraterrestrial nature.

2. The detailed description given in the inclosed newspaper article coincides with the testimony given by the witness. The press release from the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory, Madison Division, indicates that the results of their analysis were inconclusive.

3. Based on the above, it is the opinion of this office that this case could be attributable to a natural phenomenon and it is not considered to be of extraterrestrial origin. It is recognized that there may be cases of this type which could be injurious to the mental health of the individual. In such cases it is assumed in an Atmosphere of objectivity that if necessary, the individual concerned would be referred to qualified medical authorities. No evidence has been found to indicate that the witness received any hallucinations or experienced any mental disturbance as a result of this incident. Most individuals who experience these hallucinations understand them or do not make them a matter of official record.
