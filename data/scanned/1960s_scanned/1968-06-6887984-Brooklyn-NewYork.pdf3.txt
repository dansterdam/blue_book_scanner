The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that discusses a set of black and white prints forwarded to the UFD (Unidentified Flying Object) for analysis. The document describes the imagery and comments provided by the analyst regarding the prints, but does not include any actual images or photographs.

SUBJECT: UFO - MANHATTAN ISLAND
ANALYST: Chapin
DATE: 16 May 69

1. The following comments pertain to imagery described by -- Jr., Brooklyn, N.Y., on two black and white prints forwarded to PID for analysis.

2. There are at least five of these images in addition to the particular one on each print. These are identified by the sender as a U.F.O. An overlay was constructed for print Nr. 1 with tick marks over each image including that identified as a U.F.O. When this overlay was applied to print Nr. 2, the tick marks correspond perfectly to the images present.

3. Due to the fact that there is a definite pattern of like images throughout the field of view, it is felt that there was a pattern or grid of lights constituting the images or sightings. This is further supported by the fact that the grid overlay is being forwarded with the returned prints to PID/UFO.
