4. The density of the sample is 2.891 g/cc.
5. The index of refraction is 1.4683.
6. Despite the low silica configuration, the sample does not fuse at 1200Â°C. The sample figures on the plate surface cause it to act as a low quality type of glass.
7. An x-ray diffraction pattern of the sample showed a crystalline material consisting of calcium oxide and silica, confirmed by infrared analysis in the 3-5 micron region.
8. Exposure to a 3-watt beam for fifteen minutes caused a brown discoloration to occur.

III. TOTAL DATA:
a. The sample is of crystalline silica and high concentration of calcium that this type of glass is a low quality type of glass.
