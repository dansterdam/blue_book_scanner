UFO Observation September 30, 1967

2. Syracuse, N.Y. 13057
1. This replies to your letter of December 30, 1967 in which you requested information on your unidentified observation of September 30, 1967.

2. The description that you provided on your observation is consistent with other reports that we have received of plastic segments glowing object that is red, orange, yellow or white in color, and usually uses brightness candles for a heat source. After the candles burn down, the stage or platform on which the candles are mounted can be seen falling from the object. Shortly after the fiery pieces fall the light dims and disappears.

3. We have requested that our analysts date the data from your observation for September 30, 1967.

4. If the object that you saw was going in the direction of the surface winds is seems very likely that it was indeed a hot air balloon that you observed.

4. Included is an extract from AFR 80-17 regarding dissemination of information to the public. (Section B, AFR 80-17)

5. We hope that the enclosed plus took brochure will be both interesting and informative. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
