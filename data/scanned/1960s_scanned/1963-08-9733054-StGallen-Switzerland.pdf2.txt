ST. CALLEN, 16th August 1963
Clos of Green 41

Dear Sir,
We are living in St. Callen, Switzerland and have observed on Tuesday 13th August something as a missile or satellite flying at a flight of about 30 seconds. It seemed to be self-luminous and left a trail of light. The color was greenish-white and the same and several times it seemed to get brighter in the same way as rockets do when their propellent ignites again. This could not be the next evening, Wednesday 14th August we waited and watched the sky but did not observe anything similar. The weather was fair and clear and the sky was clear until shortly after midnight. 
This exactly the same thing was found one slightly lower in the same direction, but hardly distinguishable from the stars. Suddenly it seemed to change in intensity, got smaller and started to move, got brighter and larger again. After about 5 minutes it suddenly seemed to blink out and disappeared completely. It made no noise and after some one minute as could see the glow again. After almost half an hour the object got smaller and disappeared in the distance. The explosion took place at about 20:02. The object appeared ovoid in shape and was luminous in the center which later seemed to get smaller, brighter and larger again. The explosion occurred quite suddenly and we are wondering what this flying object could be. It did not appear in the sky on Thursday and we wonder whether you have some knowledge of a body flying satellites. There is already some silly talk about flying saucers in our newspapers.

Yours very truly,
