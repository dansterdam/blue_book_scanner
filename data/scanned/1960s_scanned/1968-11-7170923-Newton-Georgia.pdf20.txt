The text found in the document is as follows:

Now this has been, this also has been reported. Let me ask you, I don't mean to get personal, but how much on UFO's have you read in the past?
Very little. I'd never been interested in them much, I never believed in them, to be honest with you. I had never . . .
The reason I asked you, is that if a person had read books quite a bit he would be familiar with the, this retraction of the light. This does occur, it's something that is most difficult for our physics to understand, because we can't conceive of any way in which a light beam can be refracted like a ladder, and yet this has appeared, occurred many time, or reported to have occurred many times. Well now, I'm very much interested in the details, any details you can give me of whether the light pulsating, changing intensity, was it moving, was it completely steady, or what?
Well, there isn't seem to be any pulsating light from where I was standing, I mean, you know, where I was sitting there in the car. It seemed to be just a constant, I don't know how to say it, it seemed to be a rolling type light; I mean, it was a constant light, but yet it was, it looked kind of rough. It was acutally sparkling, but yet it seemed to be just a quivering type light, if you know what I mean.
I see, sort of a scintillating, in a way.
Right, yea' air.
Now, one important thing that I haven't asked you, is, how much of your, suppose you had taken a pencil or crayon and drawn on your windshield from you normal seating position, you'd drawn the outline of that light, how much, how big a spot on the windshield do you think you would have drawn?
Just right off, I would guess that it would have been possibly 12 inches.
