Transcription of the text in the document:

"It appeared above the horizon in the east, drifting slowly across the sky. It was seen by many people near Mount Harmony. The object was round and bright silver in color. It appeared to be about the size of a basketball held at arm's length. It made no sound and moved very slowly. It drifted in a straight line for several minutes until it disappeared over the horizon in the west.

The witness, a local resident, reported the incident to the authorities soon after it occurred. He stated that he and several other people watched the object for several minutes before it vanished from view. The object did not exhibit any conventional flight characteristics, and its slow, silent movement was unlike any known aircraft. The witness is considered a reliable observer, and his report was taken seriously by the investigators.

The case was investigated by officials from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's program for studying unidentified flying objects. While the identity of the object remains unknown, the witness's account and the lack of a conventional explanation led the investigators to classify this incident as a genuine unidentified flying object sighting. Further analysis and investigation may be conducted to try to determine the nature and origin of the observed phenomenon."
