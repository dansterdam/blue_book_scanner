Bo, what it the concern?
Dear sir:
Please forward this to some proper authority. You may have the original for what it's worth.
I have seen a "flying saucer" or some other unidentified flying object. I know it wasn't a satellite because it was going much slower than a satellite. I have talked to others and the general consensus is that the object was between 50 and 60 degrees higher in the sky northeast of town (Fairfield, Iowa). I was walking from East-south-east to Southwest fairly fast like a fast jet plane. It was dark enough so that I could see where I was walking - I covered about 1/3 mile in about 30 seconds. It disappeared from East-south-east to Southwest fairly fast like a jet plane. I thought it was going fast enough to have turned 90 degrees and went straight up on the way to get a ground speed of about 600 miles per hour. But I couldn't be sure it turned 90 degrees - the weather was clear not a cloud in the sky.
So I don't know exactly what it was or how fast it went, but it sure surprised me. I thought at first I looked at my watch and it was 6:45 p.m.
Please accept this and do a citizen a duty.
