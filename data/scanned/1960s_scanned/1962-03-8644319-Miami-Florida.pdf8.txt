Dear Bob:

I want to confirm the case of January 29, 1962
and that act that it called one of the best-authenticated
cases of its kind in recent years. The sighting was observed
to last for some 30 minutes and he finally now has gotten
credit to it, but it should have also credit for the fact
that it leaves a photograph which looks for all the world
to be an authentic saucer. However, this photo is said to
be out of focus and therefore it is not conclusive proof, though
a strong presumption. It was recorded by two independent
observers at the time and no noise. Further, it
cannot simply be dismissed as say, 15 to 20 seconds observation
which could easily be mistaken. This was March 6, 1952.

In view of the reliability of the observers and the
photographic if legis and the excellent reporting.
think this case stands out. This case calls for commendation. 
meeting. Let me know when you plan to be here.

Cordially,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
