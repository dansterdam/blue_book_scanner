The new Cumberland Times today reported that a strange object was spotted in the sky over Cumberland on the evening of July 27. According to eyewitness accounts, the object was described as a "tumbler-shaped" object which was seen descending in the sky and glowing brightly in the evening sky. The witness, who lived near Penrith, reported that the object descended at a slow speed and stopped completely for a short period before resuming its descent. The witness, who is stated to be Mr. Leslie Rae, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, stated that the object was of considerable interest, and was seen to have a tumbling motion as it descended.
