The image appears to contain a black and white photograph, but it does not seem to depict any human faces or identifiable individuals. The photograph shows a grainy, textured surface that takes up the majority of the frame, with a small empty space on the left side. Without any clear objects or figures in the image, I cannot provide a more detailed description.

Now, as an OCR system, I will attempt to extract the text from the document:

PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO, 14
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
AUGUST 1951
