The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with a typed text description of a UFO sighting that occurred in Farmington, New Mexico on May 13, 1964.

Farmington, New Mexico, Several residents reported seeing a green object in the sky which appeared to be circular and about the size of a full moon, from 3:26 to 3:28 a.m. on the 13th of May 1964. It finally emitted a puff of smoke and disappeared. The object was not silent but made a sound similar to an airplane or helicopter. When it left, it moved "extra fast" and disappeared rapidly.
