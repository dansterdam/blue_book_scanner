Dear

"Thank& very much for your recent letter and for the newspaper clipping.  I am genuinely seared to get the additional information from Mr.Gomez and now Mr. iiilcox.  I am very pleased indeed that I now have more information on this case.

It looks now as though my daughter and I will be driving down to Denver, Colorado, on Thursday, which will be the 15th, to see Mr. Wilcox as requested.  I think that this will be a good idea as my daughter can perhaps learn something more about the case.  It is my understanding that several persons have been down to see Mr. Wilcox and have been asked not to discuss the case with anyone else it trying. Naturally, I shall be very careful in my questions and perhaps you and I could arrive at a few more people.

The letter from the woman who was driving past so rapidly is also interesting, and it does indicate that there is considerably more to this case than meets the eye.  On the other hand, it would seem to have broken up and landed near them, on the other hand the reports indicate that it was observed to fall apart in the air and show' no evidence of having struck the ground.  These people were blinded by the bright light and completely unnerved by the phenomena.

Please give my best regards to Mrs. 

Cordially,
J. Allen Hynek
