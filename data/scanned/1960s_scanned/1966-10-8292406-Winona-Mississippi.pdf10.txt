Transcription of the text in the document:

I want to advise you of an unusual incident encountered last night in this area. This incident appears to cover a possible explanation of sightings of unidentified flying objects in this general area.

On the night of 10 October 1966, at approximately 8:00 PM, this writer received a phone call from one of our employees, stating that they had observed a strange object in the sky, apparently falling, and that it appeared to be on fire. Upon further questioning, this employee stated that it seemed to be dropping slowly and that it appeared to be on fire or glowing.

This writer immediately went to the area and was able to observe the object in question. I am able to state that it did appear to be a small object, approximately 2 feet in diameter, which was falling slowly and appeared to be on fire or glowing. This object landed approximately 200 yards from where I was standing, and upon reaching the area I was unable to locate any evidence of its landing.

The object appeared to be under control and did not exhibit any of the normal characteristics associated with a meteorite or a re-entering satellite. There was no trail of smoke or debris, and the object seemed to be guided in its descent.

I would appreciate any information you may be able to provide concerning this incident, and if you desire, I will be happy to discuss it with you in more detail.
