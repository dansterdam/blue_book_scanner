"Someone in Control Sheriff Says of UFO

RAVENNA, Ohio (AP)--We were close," said Deputy Sheriff Dale Spaur, and he and his partner were out after a speeder and didn't want to be seen. "But the Sheriff said we were not to release it," Buchert said. It was like the head of a flash-light, about 50 feet wide and is feet high, they said. The lines of the object were very distinct. "Somebody had control over it," said Spaur. "It could maneuver." Hundreds of persons in both Ravenna and Portage County reported seeing the object about 5:30 a.m. Sunday morning."
