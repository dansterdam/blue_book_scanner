The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from a Project Blue Book document that appears to be a questionnaire or interview form. The form contains a number of questions about a UFO sighting, including whether the object disappeared, moved behind something, or moved in front of something, as well as a request to describe the object's sound, color, and angular size. The form also includes a request to draw a sketch of the object's shape.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: none
b. Color: not usuall glowing orange color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how many times the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 6 inches covered by a penny size diameter.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
