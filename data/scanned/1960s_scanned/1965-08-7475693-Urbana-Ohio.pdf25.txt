Transcribed text:

On the scene and the debris object was located only the lowest section of the large object. A gage gave the height was high enough for me to crawl under at that point but the rest was from ground level straight up about 200 feet long according to my measurements. When the gage was high as 7 feet. There were no marks or indicators where the rest had been. It seemed that the remainder must have been very carefully removed. I had numerous photographs but in a move in may 1964 they were misplaced. 9 had numerous witnesses and in a good view and I could talk to any person 
giving information.
