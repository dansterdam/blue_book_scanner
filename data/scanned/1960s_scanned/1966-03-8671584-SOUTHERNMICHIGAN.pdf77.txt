The image does not contain any photograph or visual element. It appears to be a scanned page of text from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract all the text from the document:

At long last now, the Doctor and Hillsdale people have said they have the hard facts, the proofs, the camera description after getting out as much or the rubberish explanation as I have been able to do in this short time.

The majority of our reports in both cases appeared very insignificant. Yellow and green, which claimed lights, were the caught. They have not described as sharp. Some of the color was dazzling, and some of the light bulb appearance, but definite very indistinct. The objects themselves appeared in the case I have examined to be delicate, have a vehicle like frail appearance of very thin material or shell, which made it seem very much like a reflection of light rather than a solid object. Now what is that locate in each instance? In both cases a group in some ways the location of the objects was not purposeful. It was often seen in a strange fashion between the trees, and at Hillsdale it was seen in a very localized background. I think this is a most significant point.

A special stamp is a mark indicating a place for a draft from another source, where a particular number would be placed if there was a number, or where a particular official would sign if there was an official. Now what is a stamp? It is a place of putting markings and a means of comparison. Stamps are not the normal writings of the superintendent. He normally had the type writer.
