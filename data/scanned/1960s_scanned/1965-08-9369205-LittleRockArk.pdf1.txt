11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: I saw the object appear a brief instant to the north moving towards the SW. It had a bright white light, blinked and showed a dim yellow light, then disappeared behind some trees. It appeared to the NW again and moved slowly toward the SE, increasing speed and disappearing. It finally disappeared behind some trees just about the horizon. (South eastern horizon)
