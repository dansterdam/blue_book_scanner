IS WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

We were getting a cloud of some kind of matter when a very bright light a lot brighter than any surrounding lights.

a. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It just seemed to go out, it lasted about half a minute in which we spotted it in front of us.

b. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? 
There were a couple of trees near the road but I didn't think they would have blocked it out as it was very high up in the sky when we noticed it.
