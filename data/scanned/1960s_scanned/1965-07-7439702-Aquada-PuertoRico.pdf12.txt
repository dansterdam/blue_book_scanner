Dear 2nd of the Army
Washington, D.C.
Gentlemen: 

I want to report to you the visual observation I had made on 7/9/65.
At about 10:12 a.m. I noticed a strange object moving low over the trees. It appeared in the western horizon, short to move toward north then made a semi-circle turn & moved to the south disappearing. The time was exactly 10:12 a.m. The object drained the brilliant white to a reddish orange one when it reached maximum constellation exactly in the sky called 21°49°3'. The mass lights there and I noted something that looked as a smaller shower the a the manure.
