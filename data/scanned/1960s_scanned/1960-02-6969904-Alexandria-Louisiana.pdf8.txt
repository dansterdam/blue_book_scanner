1. It is not quite clear what the originator of the film was referring to in his description of the object. He states that the object photographed was a thin description, The portion of the film which was taken inside of what appeared to be a navigating was extremely under-exposed and the many small yellow lights were perfections from the film and these small spots of light intensants on the window and the reflected light on the lens of the camera created many circular and oval halations on the film.
2. It is suggested that the originator be asked to view the film, and indicate which frames he had reference to.
