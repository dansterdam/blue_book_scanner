Breckenridge, Montana
12 August 1964 Case

This was one of the better UFO sightings for 1964. The observer, who broke through broken clouds or a dark haze, said that he saw the moon moving in an "unusual manner". He said it was "what he never seen the moon moving like before". He said it seemed to be going up and down, back and forth, and moving in a jerky fashion. He estimated it was 2 or 3 times as big as the moon itself. He said it seemed like an arc, having the appearance of a bright object coming towards him. He watched it for about 3 to 5 minutes, and said the object was brighter than the moon. He felt the moon identification as positive, and that whatever he saw was not the moon.

He went out to look for it again the next day and saw the moon but said it was not what he had seen the night before. The object did not reappear.

In fact, the moon was just setting but was not reported separately. The observer maintained, however, that what he saw had been unusual and that he was sure it was not the moon. Further, he was convinced that it was some type of unidentified object, but he could not identify it. He felt the moon identification is positive, and that whatever he saw was not the moon.

End of report.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek
