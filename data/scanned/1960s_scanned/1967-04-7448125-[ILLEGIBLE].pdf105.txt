Dear Sirs:

Concerning your U.F.O. report dated April 17, 1967 of an unidentified flying object, I must say that I hope you would be interested in our findings. Out when it was I hope you can use this information which would be very pleased if you could look into and give me your ideas. 

Could you please look into this matter and let me know what you think?

Carefully yours,
[Redacted]
Williamsburg, Mass.
