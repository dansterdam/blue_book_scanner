SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

1. On Sunday 14 February 1960 an unidentified flying object was sighted in the sky between Nome and Unalakleet, Alaska by a number of civilians and reported to this Headquarters through 11th Air Division (D), Ladd Air Force Base. Immediate investigation was begun and reported in accordance with AFR 200-2.

2. The Office of Information, Headquarters, Alaskan Air Command, was notified as to whether or not these sightings had been reported and the information was given that they had. News media within the Alaskan area contacted this Headquarters indicating interest in the reports that had been received. The resulting press story was so written it left an inference that an object had been sighted by the Air Force presumably by radar.

3. A detailed investigation by this Headquarters revealed that the object sighted was identified as a meteor. Ladd Air Force Base, through its operational detachment of the 4th Weather Wing, had monitored and recorded its passage, and the identity of the object was so intense we publicly released the fact that it was a meteor.

4. With reference to the letter from Mr. ******* (Attachment 3), the Chief of Staff of this Headquarters, initiated correspondence to Mr. ********* Air Force regarding the report of his observation (Attachment 3).

5. In addition to his letter to Colonel Isbeil, Mr. ********* provided the local press with a statement concerning his disagreement with the published identification of this object. (Attachment 4). All subsequent actions regarding this particular sighting will be forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.
