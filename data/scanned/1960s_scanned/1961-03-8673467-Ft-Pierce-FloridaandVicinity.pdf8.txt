Nothing unusual occurred during the reminder of the leg into Myrtle Beach, Air Force Base in South Carolina. My destination was Myrtle Beach and this was a routine flight. As I approached the airfield an d began my landing approach, I saw a cluster of 5 or 6 lights in the sky; at first I thought they were aircraft, but upon closer inspection as I got nearer, I could see that they appeared to be a single craft, a spherical or disc-shaped object, emitting multiple lights. As I got closer, the object shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. I continued my normal landing and taxied to the ramp. The object had no markings, wings, or visible parts. It just appeared to be a single craft, disc-shaped, emitting multiple lights. This is the only unusual incident that occurred during the remainder of the leg into Myrtle Beach.
