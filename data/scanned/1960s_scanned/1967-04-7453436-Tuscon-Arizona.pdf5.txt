Air Force reaching a conclusion pertaining to my sighting. I have examined information concerning the incident and consulted with interested parties. This letter is to inform you, the month of April last year.

I regret the impression that a representative of the Air Force would conclude this case as unidentified. That was not my intention - I have reached the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to identify the object reported. The obvious lack of corroborating evidence from other sources and the time lapse involved all indicate this conclusion. I am sincerely awaiting your reply.
