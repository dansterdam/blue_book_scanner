"and soaring around and the 2:55:00 a.m. time period. My two children did not see the object. We heard a noise and I went outside to investigate. The noise seemed to be coming from the east and it came closer and closer. It was a bright light that was pulsating and seemed to be suspended in the air. It came to a point directly overhead and then started moving away to the east. As it moved away, it seemed to increase in size and became a long cigar-shaped object. It did not have any wings or tail. It just moved away silently and seemed to be under intelligent control. We watched it for several minutes until it disappeared from sight. It was a clear night and we had a good view of the object. I am certain that what we saw was not an airplane, satellite, or any natural phenomenon. This object was definitely under intelligent control and did not conform to any known aircraft. I am convinced that what we saw was a genuine UFO sighting."
