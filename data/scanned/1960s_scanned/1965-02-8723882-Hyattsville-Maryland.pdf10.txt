The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten text on what appears to be a questionnaire or report form. As per your instructions, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Tuesday, February 23rd

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific police questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

3:30 a.m. I awoke to look out the window at the rear of the house, as I frequently do, to observe the weather conditions, which on this particular morning were extremely clear and still. Suddenly I observed a large, luminous, oval-shaped object, which appeared to be hovering above a neighboring house, at an estimated distance of about 1/2 mile. The object was brightly illuminated, and a blue-white in color, with a definite edge or outline. It appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and remained stationary for several minutes. It then began to move slowly in a horizontal direction, maintaining the same altitude, and after proceeding for about a mile, suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. The entire observation lasted approximately 10 minutes. I am a former B-29 navigator, and am quite familiar with all types of aircraft, both conventional and jet. This object was unlike anything I have ever seen before, either in the air or on the ground. It was not an airplane, helicopter, balloon, or any other known type of aircraft. I am at a loss to explain what it was that I observed on this particular morning.
