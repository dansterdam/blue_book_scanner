The image appears to show a page from an old UFO report document as part of Project Blue Book. It does not contain a photograph, but rather a series of handwritten text responses to questions about the observed object.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object appeared to split and disappear.

15. Did the object behave in any way that indicated intelligence? (Circle one.)
Yes?No. Don't know.
If you answered YES, then tell what:
The object appeared to split and disappear.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one.)
Yes? No. Don't know.
If you answered YES, then tell what:
The object passed over some clouds during observation.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound A humming noise.
b. Color Bright orange.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
No additional information provided.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object (s) such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially outline trails or vapor trails.
The sketch shows two orange shapes, one labeled "Bright" and the other "Bright elongated", with a trail or vapor trail coming from the elongated shape.
