The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram depicting a "Horiuon line" with various annotations such as "glowing ball", "pulsating light", and "steary light". There is no photographic image present in this particular page of the document.

I suppose I am reporting something you already are aware of, and it was an experimental craft night from the base itself. This was an experience for us and it was definitely something we have never seen before. Within a matter of minutes we saw another plane going North over our house which we would have been certain was the craft of the object when we became aware to look to my husbands attention. We hope this report will be of some small value to you.
Sincerely,
