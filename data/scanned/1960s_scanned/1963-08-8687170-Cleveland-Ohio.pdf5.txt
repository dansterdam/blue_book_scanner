I. PURPOSE:
To conduct spectographic and X-ray diffraction analyses to determine the chemical composition of (1) A crystalline compound.
II. FACTUAL DATA:
1. The crystalline compound and the round object were submitted for analysis.
2. X-ray diffraction identified the crystalline compound as sodium chloride.
3. A sample was taken from the three different areas of the round object. Emission spectrographic analyses on these samples determined the composition to be magnesium and aluminum.
