I. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon releases in the area which might possibly account for the sighting: V240-482 runs NE-SW directly over T-2 direction of V54 running NW-SE would have visible traffic.

K. Position, title and comments of the reporting officer: This report is offered very little information upon which to base a theory for the sighting. It is possible that the simple sighting was created a reflection on the windshield of the car; however, the duration of the sighting, the motion, and the color seem to rule out this possibility. It is believed that this sighting would have to be attributed to a reflection on the windshield which could be confirmed. (amount of information available)
