"14 November 1964
Waldwick, Ohio

November 14, 1964...8:44 P.M...An Avon elementary school principal reported by telephone from Main Street, and personnel of the Avon Police Department checked the report. The witness, a woman named Mary Barclay, reported seeing an object in the sky which she said looked like a 'bright star'. The object, she said, was plainly visible against the background of the night sky. It stopped, was plainly visible and again, but that was the last she saw of it.

Observer: Mr. Ralph Tate."
