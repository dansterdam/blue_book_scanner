Mr. R. W. Phillips, a teacher in a local school, was driving home at night when he saw a large number of lights in the sky. After watching them for some time, he estimated there were about 20-30 objects, bright white in color, and moving very fast in a north-easterly direction. They were arranged in a v-shaped formation, and then broke up into a scattered pattern. The whole incident lasted about 30-45 seconds, according to Mr. Phillips' estimate.
The case was reported to the local press, whose report stated that the objects were observed by several witnesses. The press expressed the view that the same objects had been reported in other parts of the country, and that some explanation might be found for the sighting. However, no explanation was offered by any official source.
