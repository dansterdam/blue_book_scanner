The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a handwritten document, likely a report or witness statement from Project Blue Book. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to extract all the text from the document:

To the extent of my observation the observation was made from a point 5 or 6 miles southwest of Hanaley, Hawaii. The incident occurred July 7 1964 at approximately 1930 hrs. local time. The object was first observed in the southwest with its course approximately due north. As the object passed to the east of the observer's point of observation it appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, perhaps over 5000 mph. The object appeared as a bright light with no distinguishing features visible. At no time during the observation did the object deviate from its northeastward course. The observation lasted for approximately 30 seconds. When the object passed to the east and out of sight it simply disappeared from view with no deceleration or change in course apparent. Witnesses to the observation were [redacted]. Elevation of the object was estimated to be between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. No sound was audible from the object. No aircraft or other objects were seen in the vicinity prior to, during, or after the observation. Weather conditions were clear with good visibility. No further details are available on this incident.
