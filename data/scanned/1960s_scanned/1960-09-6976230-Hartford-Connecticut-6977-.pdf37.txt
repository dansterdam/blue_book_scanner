Transcript of the text in the document:

On 6 Sept 60 at about 8:30 PM, Mrs. Judith Scoma, age 66, of 233 Rosemont St., Hartford, Conn., was outside her home when she observed a brilliant light in the sky which appeared to be coming towards her. She stated that the light was quite large and bright and appeared to be rectangular or square in shape. She said the object hovered over the trees for a short period, then rapidly accelerated and moved out of sight to the southeast.

Mrs. Scoma stated she was quite frightened by the incident and hurried inside her home. She described the object as having a dull metallic appearance and said it made no sound. She estimated it was about 350-400 feet in the air and approximately 1/2 mile away from her position when first observed.

Investigators visited the home and examined the area, finding no physical evidence or traces. It was an extremely dark night and no other witnesses were located. The case is listed as "Unidentified" since there is no logical explanation that can be determined from the limited data obtained.
