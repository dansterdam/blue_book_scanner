14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

It disappeared like a light going out of existence and suddenly it was not there anymore. It just vanished.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what:

The object moved behind a cloud and then reappeared on the other side.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No   Don't Know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: A hissing or rushing sound, the object was silent.
b. Color: Brilliant silver or metallic in appearance.
c. Size: About the size of a car.
d. Shape: Circular or disc-shaped.
e. Speed: Very rapid, extremely fast.
f. Duration: Appeared for only a few seconds.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

The object was approximately 3.6 inches in size. My estimation is that the match head would have covered about 1/3 of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you are such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The drawing shows an object that is circular or disc-shaped, with no wings or protrusions. There are no trails or vapor visible. The object is shown moving from right to left.
