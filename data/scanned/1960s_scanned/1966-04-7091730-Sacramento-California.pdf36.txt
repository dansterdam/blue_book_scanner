It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that contains only text describing a report received by a gentleman from Springfield, Illinois on April 8, 1966. The text describes the man seeing something in the sky the previous evening in Springfield and wanting to report it to the Air Force to investigate.

M/R Received a call from a gentleman from Springfield, Illinois, on Apr 8 1966. He wanted to report something he had seen the night before. It was an object he said he had seen coming out of Springfield that had been recorded. He said he didn't know anything about it. The man had reported it to the police. Yesterday evening in Springfield. He was trying to find it and investigate it. Wanted to know if we were aware of anything about it, I said no, certainly until the observer reports it to the Air Force. I tell my boss, and Col I guess. I'll go to his field.
