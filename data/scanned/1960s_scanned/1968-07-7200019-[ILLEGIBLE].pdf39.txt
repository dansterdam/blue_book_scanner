JULY METEORS

The crescent moon in the evening sky will not hamper observing when the Delta Aquarid meteor shower is most active. This occurs on July 29th, when about a dozen shower members may be seen hourly, but some activity takes place for a couple of weeks before and after the predicted peak. At maximum, the radiant lies at right ascension 22h 36m, declination -16°, it moves eastward about 1° a day.
