PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 67-9 . DATED 14 February 1967

4. Another possibility is suggested in slides #12 and #13. That is of an aborted attempt at skywriting. The object is suggested in slide #12 by the "dot" of smoke to the right of the upper end of the line. The "dot" appears to be a 90 degree continuation of a letter, after the stem had been formed, when the smoke release failed to stay open. No aircraft is visible in slide #12 or #13.

6. The frame numbers supplied by a processor are usually a reliable indicator of the film sequence through the camera. Since frames #10, #11, #12 and #13 were all hand dated 29 October 1966 this would indicate frames #10 and #11 were taken in the pre-daylight hours, or prior to slides #12 and #13, rather than in the evening hours of the 29th of October.
