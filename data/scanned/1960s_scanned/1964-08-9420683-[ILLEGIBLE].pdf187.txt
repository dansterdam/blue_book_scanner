THIS WAS ECHO?

The night before all the excitement of August 17, Mrs. Robert Smith of 530 N. Oris had retired around 10:00 P.M. The next morning, Aug 17, around 8:00 A.M. she had put her son to bed.

The son then went to his grandmother's house. She then went to her back door to look over her back yard. She noticed a shiny object in the sky, and said it passed under the last star she had noticed. It went slowly at first and then picked up speed and disappeared above the trees beyond. It turned out to be a large, shiny object, and was fairly large. She said her son had seen it too. This was around 9:00 A.M.

The Telegraph of Painesville, asked the Smith family for details and information about the sighting, and they were willing to cooperate.

The observers heard no sound, no other lights seen, and the object left no trail.

Observers: Mrs. Robert Smith, Robert L. and Thomas, 14 year old.

Duration: 7 min. for Mrs. Smith, 3-5 min. for Robert and Thomas.
