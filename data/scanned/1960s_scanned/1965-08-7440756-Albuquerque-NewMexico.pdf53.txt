"B. Second sighting. Some- 10:10:30 p. m.
The second sighting was observed, after the first sighting. This is consistent with the type of performance indicated in the previous report. The two objects also came from the northeast direction. The direction and movements were very similar to the description in the previous report. There were no changes to be ascertained regarding the motions or flight path of these objects as they passed overhead at approximately 8-10,000 feet altitude."
