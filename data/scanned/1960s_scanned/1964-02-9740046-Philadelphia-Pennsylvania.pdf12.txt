Illuminator

On January 23 at 9:00 P.M. (serial)
the observer watched a lighted oval
object which appeared slowly in the
southwest moving northeasterly about
300 speed. The object was viewed
for 30-60 sec. It was described as
bright white in color, gave off a
steady light and no unusual sound
was detected. The object was
estimated to be about 30 degrees
above the horizon. No change in
course or speed was noted.
