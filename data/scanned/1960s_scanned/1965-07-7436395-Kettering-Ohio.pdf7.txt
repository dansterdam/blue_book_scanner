The image contains a hand-drawn diagram and a compass-like symbol. The diagram shows a curved path with an object or objects moving along it, and instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object(s). The compass-like symbol appears to be an illustration or sketch, but does not depict any real photographs or images.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the ground where you first saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
