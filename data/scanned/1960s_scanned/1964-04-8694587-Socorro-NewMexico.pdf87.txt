1. Attached hereto is a marking that has been observed and reported to the USAF in connection with an unidentified flying object sighting at Socorro, N.M. on 24 April 1964. The identification of this marking would assist in determining the nature and identification of this marking.
2. The marking was described as being eight to eighteen inches in height, colored red or reddish-orange and showing a circular shape surrounding a central oval or elliptical shape. The marking was observed on the underside of the A/C as it hovered over the vicinity. The A/C was described as being metallic in appearance, about the size of a car, and maneuvering at a low altitude over the desert.

Excerpt from letter J Douglas Stewart
"With reference to the marking of U.S. Air Force Code of Federal Regulations, AFR 80-17, we can only comment on specific things to say about how our A/C must be marked, experimental and otherwise. Also, a civilian firm must apply for an Experimental Certificate on Form ACA-305 (Aero 1-71-1) and 3-D drawings of the A/C.
As I'm sure you know, this is handled by the FAA Control Systems Division in Oklahoma City."
