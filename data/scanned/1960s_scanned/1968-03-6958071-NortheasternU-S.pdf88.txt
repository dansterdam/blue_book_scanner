MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: UFO Observation, 3 March 1969
Writer: Dayton, Ohio 45449
called to report an unidentified flying object that he observed at 9:45 pm on 3 March 1969. He worked for the General Motors Corporation as a Supervisor and has been trained for proper observations for and data.  He has never seen an UFO before. He saw three flying in a formation that he couldn't identify. The objects were going very fast, there was no sound, it left a trail. The brightness was not consistent, it seemed that the two on the side were more consistent, appeared like a flame and was sparkling. He dives in slightly hills and saw the object go from the horizon in the SW to the horizon in the NE. Way up high. It was going a terrific speed. He compared it to a meteorite, however the observation was much too long for that of a meteorite, saw it for one to two minutes. He said that he often watches for the meteor showers. He would like to complete an AF Form 117 on his observation.
