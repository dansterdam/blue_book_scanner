Dear Sir:

Report suggest a large
sighting the U.T.P. on March 9, 1964
from and I was visiting my
brother at Orford, N.H., which
is about 30 miles from Berlin,
N.H. We were on our way
home about 9:30 P.M. The light
was as a small community called Gorman's
Valley on route 146 north of Deerfield,
N.H. when out ahead of us (the
way we were going north on route 146)
about 3 or 4 miles away was this
object that looked (to the human eye)
about the size of a small car. It
appeared to be going the same direction
we were traveling and about 2 miles
off the ground. It had a steady light
about the color of a mercury vapor light,
but considerably more brilliant in intensity.
That's the main thing I remember, that
it was exceptionally bright.
