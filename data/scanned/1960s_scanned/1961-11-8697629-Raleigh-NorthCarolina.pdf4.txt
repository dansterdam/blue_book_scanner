The text in the document is as follows:

The distinctly elongated sketch is to the best of my artistic ability a spheroidal or disc a structure from Campbell, N.C., as a witness Framen, Passage and 91 across in the sky.

We were observing Jupiter in my telescope - we were of the opinion observation this larger than possible telescopic object - and which appeared in our field of view at about 30° to the southeast. It moved very nearly straight- where it remained over 4 to 5 minutes of time - about 60°to the southeast.

The air was very clear - no clouds and very comfortable - this observation was made 7:30 P.M. 11/8/61

We could not see any object only the lights which were flashing and appeared to be coming through translucent clouds - all these were the usual colors - absolutely no sound.

These phenomenon absolutely no doubt extremely interested and wonder what phenomenonthey may have seen to be a craft.
