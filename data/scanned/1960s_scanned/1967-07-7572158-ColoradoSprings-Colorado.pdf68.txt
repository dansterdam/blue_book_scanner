Thousands See UFOs Flashing 
Over Europe
WIESBADEN, Germany - (AP) Cigar-shaped, unidentified objects flashing brilliant lights and zipping over Europe yesterday reportedly were seen by thousands. 
The U.S. Air Force said the sightings were confirmed by radar-equipped observers in England, France, Germany and Switzerland.
None of the objects were identified and no air force planes were in the areas when the sightings occurred, the press reported.
A Warsaw U.S. Air Force officer said the objects were sighted the past several nights, often after midnight, and had made sharp turns and accelerated rapidly. He said they looked like "fireballs" as they flashed lights that sometimes beamed to the ground.
One object was reported to have been tracked on radar for 15 minutes, flying at an estimated speed of 1,000 mph.
The sightings were similar to those reported earlier over parts of the United States, the Air Force spokesman said. Although there was no explanation, he added. "we don't believe they are imaginations or hoaxes."
