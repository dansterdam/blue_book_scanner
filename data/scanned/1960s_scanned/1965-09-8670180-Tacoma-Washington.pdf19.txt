The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions about the observed object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes / No / Don't Know. If you answered Yes to this, what was it?
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes / No / Don't Know. If you answered Yes to this, what was it?
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color
c. We wish to see the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the object. If you had previously estimated the size of the object, how much of the match head would the object have covered?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include any unusual features of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
