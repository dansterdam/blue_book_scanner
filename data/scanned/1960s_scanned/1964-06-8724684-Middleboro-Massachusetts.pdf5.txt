SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR UFO INFORMATION

TO:        Hq USAF SAPOI PB (Mrs. Gallaher)

1. We have received the completed PID Forms 164 from Mr. Redacted of Middleboro, Massachusetts. He has requested an Air Force evaluation.

2. The sighting of 1 March 1964 is evaluated as minor-representation as described. This direction of one hour 44 minutes can be expected from the data presented. Some characteristics can be interpreted as being due to motion and action to various objects in the immediate environment.

3. Regarding the sighting of 5 June 1964, these observations were for four distinct objects with a duration of 1, 2, and 40 seconds. It is believed that the objects were apparently moving and distant meteors while this object is carried as insufficient data.
