Gentlemen:

I wish to report to you that on the evening of Wednesday, August 12, 1955, an unidentified flying object appeared to me to be an unidentified flying object. My initial contact with this object was in the community of Far Rockaway, New York. I was facing in an easterly direction towards the brightbright object and as I started to watch it, it appeared to me to be a disc shaped object. It remained in its location for several seconds and then disappeared. The glow from the object appeared to be such as one would envision would come from a fluorescent type object. I am at a lost to explain the cause of the fast rate of speed at which it moved. 

I have seen no photographic or motion picture details of this strange object before and can give you no such photographic records to add on this report. However, the object that I saw was much larger than any aircraft or other familiar sky object in the heavens and it vanished literally in seconds. 

The object disappeared as quickly as it appeared, turning off instantaneously as it were. It is a yard in length as compared with the source of illumination in the sky and its distance from me can not be accurately estimated. 

Realizing that my description contains myself a somewhat hap-hazard condition should be trusteed that the aforessaid information will be a confidential matter. 

Sincerely yours,
