There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

may be a identifiable ob ct of somekind but there have been sightings in this area before and since. I think it a favorable area for UFOs.

If would like to retain my rights to the photographs as a scientific endeavor to submit them as a evidence. I do not know how this could be accomplished however I am willing to submit them as a scientific endeavor in hopes it will show that the sightings are avaliable.

One of the students here saw what she said was a sililar object in the sky the same night as this one. Please know that I am interested in reaching the truth whether it turns out impossible to believe the reports. I shall certainly take those with all tangible evidence.

By the way you may know that we have a radar station south of Rockingham Nc. and they may have had an observation on the same date(June 13). 

Thank you for your help.

Yours truly,
