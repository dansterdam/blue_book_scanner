Please excuse our delay in answering your letter in which you requested information on the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

Photo analysis revealed this object to be the following: Pinpointing of reflecting light on body of aircraft caused by the sun's rays. This object was not a chemical or meteor but a light on the aircraft itself.

Your patience and understanding for the delay in answering this request is very much appreciated.

Sincerely,
