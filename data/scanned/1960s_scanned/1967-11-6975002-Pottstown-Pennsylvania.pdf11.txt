Mr. Quintanilla,
In reply to your request or information for AP Form 117, are the necessary answers: 
1. We were visiting with a little or no terrific at that interval of time.
2a. I was in the living room at the time and called my mother, but she told me not to get involved in telling jokes because it was almost 11:00 pm so I went to sleep.  
3. I lost all of the phenomenon I have sighted were mostly strange or that had a little more detail than what I have seen before.  
I hope I have given you the necessary information.

Sincerely yours,
Pottstown, Pa. 19464
