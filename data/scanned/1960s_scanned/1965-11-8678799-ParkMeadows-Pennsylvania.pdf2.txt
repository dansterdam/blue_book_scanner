The image contains a compass-like illustration in the bottom right portion of the page. The compass shows the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) and has a sun-like symbol in the center.

In the top portion of the page, there is a sketch-like diagram with various angled lines and measurements labeled, such as "60°", "45°", and "13° A B". This appears to be illustrating a scenario related to observing an object in the sky.

The text in the document appears to be instructions or questions related to observing and describing unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or other aerial phenomena.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curve to show high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the arc to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

JUST ONE
