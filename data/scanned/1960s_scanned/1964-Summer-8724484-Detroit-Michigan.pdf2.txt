CHILD BURNED IN NEW MEXICO

This report is based on information received from Mrs. Charles Hickman, Chara, New Mexico, on July 14, 1964. The basic details are:

On the 3rd of July, at 4:30 p.m. Charles Hickman, a resident of Chara, New Mexico, was doing the family laundry on the line outside the back door of his Grandmother's house. His 3-year-old grandson, whom he had been watching, suddenly broke away and ran out the back door, apparently in pursuit of a cotton balloon. The child ran under a water hose and encountered a tank of gasoline which had been placed there for preparing lunch for the wheat crews. The child fell into the gasoline and became immediately engulfed in flames.

Mr. Hickman saw the child as he shot down out of the sky and hover over Charles. He grabbed the child and extinguished the flames in a few seconds. The child appeared to be only slightly burned and Mr. Hickman thought he had escaped serious injury.

However, during the night the child's condition worsened and he began to swell. Three was a body swelling and a visible burn from the top of his head to his waist. The next morning the child was taken to the Los Lunas County Hospital where additional facts as to the name of the Doctor who treated the boy and other details were obtained.

However, during the night the child's condition worsened and he began to swell. Three was a body swelling and a visible burn from the top of his head to his waist. The next morning the child was taken to the Los Lunas County Hospital where additional facts as to the name of the Doctor who treated the boy and other details were obtained.

Although the Doctor was frank and readily answered all questions, he was not optimistic about the case. He, although he would offer no opinion as to the nature of the burns, seemed to believe the story told by both the boy and his grandmother.

The object, according to Mrs. Smith, was somewhat like a fog. The boy stated there was a "bluish light" around the object as it hovered over him. The boy stated he heard a buzzing sound as the object came up to him. He had begun to swell, and three was a body swelling and burn from the top of his head to his waist.

Mrs. Smith said that one of Charles' ears looked "like a piece of raw meat". She was not permitted to examine the child closely, but declared that his face was so badly swollen as to be scarcely visible. His eyes were swelled shut.

Numerous samples of the burns and hair were sent to the Northeastern University Laboratories for analysis, but the results had not been obtained at the time of this report.
