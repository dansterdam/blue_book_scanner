Page 3 UNUSUAL UNCLAS AIRCRAFT PASSED TO THE NORTH OF US HEADING WEST. IT SEEMED TO ME
HAVE VERY UNUSUAL AND UNNATURAL CHARACTERISTICS AS DID ITS M OTION. IT DID NOT HAVE
THE NORMAL TAIL, WINGS, AND OTHER CONFIGURATION OF KNOWN AIRCRAFT AND THEY
SEEMED TO DEFY NORMAL AERODYNAMICS. THERE WAS NO AUDIBLE SOUND AND THEY MOVED
WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY, MAKING EXTREMELY TIGHT AND ERRATIC
TURNS AND STOPS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. AT ONE POINT IT
SEEMED TO MAKE A MANEUVER THAT DEFIED GRAVITY. IT WAS NOT EASY TO GET A GOOD
VIEW BUT WHAT I SAW WAS VERY UNUSUAL AND I CANNOT SATISFACT ORILY EXPLAIN WHAT IT
WAS. THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON WHO SAW THIS ALSO AND I HAVE DISCUSSED IT WITH
HIM AND WE AGREE THAT IT W AS VERY STRANGE AND DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN. WE COULD
FIND NO RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR WHAT WE SAW.

PAGE 4_ _ _ _VARIOUS ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO CHECK OUT THE AIRCRAFT SIGHTINGS AND OBTAIN
FURTHER INFORMATION BUT THE TRAIL SEEMED TO LEAD TO A DEAD END. THERE WAS NO
RESPONSE FROM USAF FACILITIES RELATING TO HAVING SCRAMBLED JETS OR INITIATED ANY
ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SIGHTINGS. LIKEWISE THERE WAS NO INDICATION
OF ANY UNIDENTIFIED OR UNUSUAL AIRCRAFT ACTIVITY BEING REPORTED BY MONITORING
STATIONS OR RADAR FACILITIES. THE SIGHTINGS REMAIN AN UNEXPLAINED INCIDENT
LACKING SATISFACTORY IDENTIFICATION OR EXPLANATION. IT IS DOUBTFUL IF ANY
FURTHER INFORMATION WILL BE OBTAINED RELATING TO THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT.
