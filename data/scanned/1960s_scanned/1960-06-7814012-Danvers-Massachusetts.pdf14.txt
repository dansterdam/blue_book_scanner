There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a handwritten report or document.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

Approximately the size of  
the shiny thing. The day was 
extremely clear. It was over for
a few minutes and went off
to the west a little and then
went straight up and out of
sight. It made no sound and
showed no windows or lights.
It was metallic looking and round
the like a chrome ball. It was
moving at a very high rate of
speed and was in a straight line
motion. It appeared very shortly 
a y5th as small as it was 
originally. I did not see it come
in or go out, only while it was 
directly overhead. It made no 
maneuvers, just a straight up 
flight.
