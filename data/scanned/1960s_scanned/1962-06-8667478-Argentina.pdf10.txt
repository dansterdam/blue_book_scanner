SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for APRIL 28, 1962

Planet Venus Now Prominent

The planet Venus becomes increasingly prominent in the evening sky as 1962 progresses. Venus may be seen in the evening sky and Mercury has already begun to fade out. Even the moon, which at times may interfere with the view of Venus, is clearing the western sky.

At no time in the year 1962 is Venus more prominent than in May. It is a sight worth watching those evening when skies are clear and the air smooth. By May 1 Venus will have reached its maximum brilliance and will be conspicuous low in the northwest after sunset. Owing to its great distance it appears only as a bright star, but it is much brighter than any star in the sky and will be the first thing to catch the eye as it appears above the horizon. 

Most Prominent Stars
The most prominent stars of late April and May are Deneb, Vega, Arcturus, and Spica. High in the northern sky, the brilliant Vega, marking the foot of the Northern Cross, is also known as the "Harp." 

To the east, the brilliant star Arcturus appears, following the curve of the handle of the Big Dipper. The bright red star Antares of Scorpius, Leo's bright Regulus, Virgo's Spica, and, of course, the North Star Polaris, lie in this part of the sky.

Mercury can be seen at dawn setting low in the east, passing far under Venus which now predominates in the evening sky.
