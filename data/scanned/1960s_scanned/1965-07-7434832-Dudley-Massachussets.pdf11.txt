As requested, here is the text from the document:

Report of telephone conversation on January 14, 1966, with [REDACTED], Dudley, Massachusetts. CALL was made to attempt to give reliability of witness, a youth at 17, and to obtain further details of sightings if possible. From the phone conversation it appeared possible that the object sighted is the light may have been illusionary. If so, sightings can be ascribed to the star Regulus. Case, however, bears some resemblance to the Western Massachusetts case of January 14, 1955, in which case, however, the observers were in order of magnitude greater reliability. Unfortunately, there was no way of establishing illusory nature of motion as referenced in Western sightings.
