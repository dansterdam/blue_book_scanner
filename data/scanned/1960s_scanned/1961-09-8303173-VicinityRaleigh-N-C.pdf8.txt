Text from the document:

Dear sir:
On Sunday, Sept. 17th, 1961 at 05:00 a.m. while driving north on route U.S. #1 approx. 25 miles south of Raleigh, North Carolina, I observed a strange light in the sky and a burning star. I stopped and observed this unusual sight. We stopped and observed same for about 10 minutes. After we got home, I sat down and made a detailed sketch of my observation.
Before turning out the lights, I noticed 2 different signs about 30 feet away or more.
1st.
2nd.
