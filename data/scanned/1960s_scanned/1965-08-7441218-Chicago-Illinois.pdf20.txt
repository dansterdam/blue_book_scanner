The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

Did you notice any unusual activity or conditions, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, which might account for the sighting? No

Did you take any photographs? No
Do you know of any existence of physical evidence of materials No

INITIALS: OWS

COMMENT: It is my opinion that the object Mr. - - saw was a late model jet type aircraft, such as a Convair T-33 or F-86 or Chicago's Midway airport. These runways flare in an almost direct line with Mr. - - observation point which could account for the apparent altitude, sound and course of the object according to his description on his mind.
