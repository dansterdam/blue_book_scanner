The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book, with handwritten notes and text.

The text on the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

NO MOTION AT ALL

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

ESTIMATED 1/2 TO 3/4 OF FULL MOON

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the known object would the size of the sighting have covered?

A MATCH NO WIDER

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO FADE FROM VIEW AND THEN SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND COULD NOT BE LOCATED AGAIN

24. In order that you can give us clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words: 
(a) the color and shape of the object
(b) any distinguishing features, such as tail, flames, exhaust, etc.
(c) the manner and speed of its motion

IT APPEARED AS A BRIGHT ROUND OBJECT THAT WAS BRIGHT LIKE A STAR, MOVING SLOWLY AT FIRST FROM THE EASTERN HORIZON IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. IT APPEARED TO FADE FROM VIEW AND THEN SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY. IT MADE NO SOUND AND THERE WERE NO TRAILS OR EXHAUST VISIBLE. IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT WITH MANY STARS VISIBLE SO IT WAS EASY TO SEE THE OBJECT VERY CLEARLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE IT FINALLY DISAPPEARED.
