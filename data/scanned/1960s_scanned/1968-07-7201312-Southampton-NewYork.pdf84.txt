THE MAPS
JULY 22-28, 1963

The Air Force continues to receive numerous reports that originate from a wide range of sources, which describe strange phenomena in the sky, some of which defy logical explanation. Such reports range from the sighting of strange luminous objects to the observation of unusual aerial manuvers.

The reports cover a broad geographical area and stem from observations made by a variety of people in varying situations and circumstances. Every effort is made to verify and analyze each report in order to determine its nature and significance. 

Reports that are found to have possible merit are sent to the Project Blue Book team at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for further investigation and analysis. Those that are evaluated as lacking in substantial evidence or as explainable natural phenomena are eliminated from further consideration. 

The criteria used for evaluation and identification includes such factors as the credibility of the observer, the number of observers, the duration of observation, the clarity of view, the physical characteristics of the object, the maneuverability of the object, and any corroborative evidence or physical traces.

The Air Force continues to maintain an open mind with respect to the possibility of extraterrestrial visitations and will continue to investigate and analyze all reports that appear to have merit. At the same time, the Air Force cautions against premature conclusions or sensationalism, which could result in unwarranted public concern or alarm.
