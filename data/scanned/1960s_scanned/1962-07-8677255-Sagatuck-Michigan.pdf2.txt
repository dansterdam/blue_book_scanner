Gentlemen: 

Please assist me in a problem I encountered on the evening of July 6, 1962. I have been told to contact the AF Reserve unit in this area.

While swimming in Lake Michigan at a beach near Saugatuck, Michigan, I saw an object in the sky which I at first took to be a meteor. This object which seemed to be very distant, although it was very bright, was of two colors. It was on the lead side of what could have been very steadily out of sight in a westerly direction. I sighted this object at 11:51 PM EST. I saw it again at 12:32 AM. There was still three behind me when the objects location at the time of these sightings was approximately overhead. The object was visible for approximately one (1) minute at each sighting before it went out of sight. It covered an arc of 25 - 30 degrees in that time.

Judging by these figures this would mean that this object would make one complete orbit around the earth in 14 or 15 minutes which is much faster than any satellites I have heard of. I also understand that the state's satellites presently are all moving from west to east, the exact opposite of this object. I shall enclose a diagram using the Big Dipper as a reference point.
