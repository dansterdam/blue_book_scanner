"My car friend and I saw the same thing he described at about the same time as he related seeing it. We saw the bright light in the sky and it seemed to engage the same time as the time he related seeing it. I watched the light go into the clouds and then disappear before it came out again for a short time and then disappear again. It had the same characteristics as he described.

I have been very much impressed by the U.F.O. taken from the area and seen in conclusions from the time. He wished to remain anonymous and more could possibly be learned.

Thank you,"
