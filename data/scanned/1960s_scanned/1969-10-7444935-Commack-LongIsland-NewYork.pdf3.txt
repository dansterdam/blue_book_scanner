The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with a questionnaire-style form filled out. The text in the document is largely redacted, with only some details visible, such as the respondent's age and gender.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS OR A SIMILAR PHENOMENON BEFORE? [ ] YES [ ] NO. IF "YES", GIVE DATE AND LOCATION.

WAS ANYONE WITH YOU AT THE TIME YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? [ ] YES [ ] NO. IF "YES", DID THEY SEE IT TOO?

AGE: [ ] SEX: [ ] MALE [ ] FEMALE

GIVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF:

WHEN AND WHERE DID YOU SIGHT THIS PHENOMENON?
DATE: DAY MONTH YEAR
