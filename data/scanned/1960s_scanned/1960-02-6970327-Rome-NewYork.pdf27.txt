Dear Sir:

On two successive nights, February 7, 1960 and February 8, 1960 (between 11:35 Iti and 12:15 Mi respectively) a brilliant red light was reported over Hollywood, California. This has been an investigation made by many persons.

Will you please be kind enough to advise me if your office was notified of this occurrence, and if so, what the results of the investigation were?

Thank you very much. With very best wishes, I remain,

Sincerely,
[redacted]
Los Angeles 16, California
