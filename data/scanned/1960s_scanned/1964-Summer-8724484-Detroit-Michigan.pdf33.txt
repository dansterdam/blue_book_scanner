The image appears to be a handwritten document, but it does not contain any photographs. As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

On 8 August 1964 at 8:15 p.m. the witness, Richard Steinbaum, sighted a UFO approximately 12 to 15 feet in diameter, hovering at an estimated altitude of 200 to 300 feet over the field behind his home in Detroit, Michigan. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

The witness reported that the object emitted a low, humming sound and had a bluish-white glow around its perimeter. No other details were provided in the report.
