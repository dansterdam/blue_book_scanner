EXPLANATION
The object reported on this date and over this area does not constitute an unidentified flying object. The object observed was a weather balloon launched from the Detroit-Selfridge AFB on the same date for upper-air sounding purposes. The balloon was tracked on radar from Detroit control tower and its position corresponded exactly with that reported by the observer. The object was visible to ground observers in clear skies and its motion and altitude were consistent with the properties of a weather balloon. This sighting is, therefore, explained as a weather balloon.
