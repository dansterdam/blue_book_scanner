told him that Laser people had been doing some work on the East coast.
But he couldn't say what object was because he hadn't read and heard
all on the report. He had heard that a number of people were working
with lasers. We would have to do a lot of checking. There are a
number of possibilities. Four hours seems awful long for a balloon. 
We will have to get the weather data and if the winds are wrong then
it will shoot the theory. Mr. Heis called Brookhaven Lab and they
were not sending up any balloons. Major told him that when this
type of person sends up balloons they usually go up during the
daytime. Cambridge launches balloons. Though, I haven't had a
balloon that will stay in the area that long. The guy who had
the balloons stolen said they were very light with batteries and
are 3ft. That's a pretty small balloon.
Major told him that he would certainly like to have the negative of
the photo that was taken. New York daily News has it. I could have
to blow it up so we could see what we have got. Once we run out of
leads that's it. Major told him the case sounds interesting, have to
check many things before I can say what it is. Hollaps Island has
been the culprit in some cases lately. Ft. Churchill has been doing
some work out they are too far North.
Mr. Heis then asked questions about the University of Colorado and
if they would investigate the sighting. The problem is that they are
just getting set up a new and once they get settled they will start
investigating. We work with the base. We are a monitoring base.
If we have to make further calls we usually can make them from here.
