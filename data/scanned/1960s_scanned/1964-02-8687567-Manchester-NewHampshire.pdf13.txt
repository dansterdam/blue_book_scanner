SIGHTING ACCOUNT

I was walking back to his dormitory from the cafeteria around 8:30 P.M. when I observed a peculiar flying object. It was flying slowly out of the West and moving toward the Northwest. It appeared that the was observing or examining something of an unusual nature, as it called the objects to Timothy's attention. They were slow moving objects that he observed from the fourth floor window which was on the fourth floor of the Administration Building; they were up a 16 diameter exposures capacity and attempted to obtain sequence-shots of the objects but the attempt was unsuccessful; they only succeeded in getting some shots when the objects passed directly overhead on a tripod and began taking time exposures of the objects. 

The objects came into their sight for a total of two hours and forty-five minutes. They left the scene when Timothy and David left the droploppy via an adjoining dark room.

I questioned Timothy about the possibility of their having seen objects which were spectacular and exceptional close together on that particular evening. He said emphatically that they were seeing stars; and although there were stars in the sky, they were not the stars they had recorded. He added that he knew what stars and planets looked like.

Although others saw the objects, they did not show very much interest. The report on the "Unidentified Flying Objects" (see clipping) indicates this. Timothy phoned the newspaper, (see clipping) No one except myself showed any interest in investigating, although they received an anonymous crank letter concerning it.

I feel genuinely sincere and objective observer. The photograph (attached) was taken by an excellent camera (a Pentox analyst) and both are competent photographers. Although there are minor inconsistencies (see report analyses) I am convinced it's overall contents are factual.
