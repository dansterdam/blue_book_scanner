There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which appears to be a letter regarding a UFO sighting in the Cleveland, Ohio area on May 10, 1964.

Dear [Redacted],
This is in reply to your letter of May 19, 1964 in which you reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Cleveland area on May 10, 1964.
We have both observed the city lights when the object was sighted moving northward. The object was observed moving at a steady speed without any flickering or change in brightness.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
MAJOR, USAF
