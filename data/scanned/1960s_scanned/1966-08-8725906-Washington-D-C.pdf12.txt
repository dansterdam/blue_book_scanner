Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent. I am a photography buff and have occasionally seen various types of celestially illuminated cirrocumulus formations which could be mistaken for UAOs by the uninitiated. I am thoroughly familiar with the appearance of most astronomical, meteorological, and aeronautical phenomena and strongly inclined to apply logical rational explanations to such occurrences. I have observed several "fast moving lights" in the night sky which were eventually identified as satellites or aircraft; however, the object I observed on this occasion did not conform to the characteristics of any known astronomical or aeronautical vehicle.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
