AIR MAIL
Hon. Len B. Jordan
Senate Office Building
Washington, D.C.

Dear Senator Jordan:

Thank you very much for your interest in the so-called UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) sightings. I indicated in a letter previously that our office was conducting an investigation of these cases and their investigating action, and particularly, William G. Pollard, United States Air Force, mentions two such incidents in Emmett, Idaho.

In the meantime, I continued the investigation of our office and finally determined that the boys were not telling the truth when they reported seeing unusual aircraft in the sky. Their two statements contained several facts of the conversation which are difficult to explain, but I am convinced now that they fabricated the story. I advised them at the time that it contains falsehoods and that the boys should not relate any more such untrue stories.

I am convinced that the incident contained a hoax, and that the boys should be identified as the source of the false report. When I was continuing the investigation, one of the officers who is 9 or 10 years older, who is a
spy, and stated that she thought that her brother had brought this to the attention of the papers so that they get reports from the public. But it certainly did not happen.

In summary, I consider the inquiry and report closed, and I appreciate your interest in the report. I will be happy to communicate with you further whenever the need arises, but it certainly did not happen.

Sincerely yours,
L. Gordon
