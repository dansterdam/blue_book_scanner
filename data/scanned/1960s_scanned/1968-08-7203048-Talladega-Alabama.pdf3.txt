TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Witnesses were put up to orbit from what to start. Apparently they had seen some strange things that seemed to thwart them in their chives of huge astronomical objects. To the best of the first hand careful observation at different times of these seesaw activities. On the right of stray 3rd and twin were bright for a long time on the ground or a little plane or a hovered at a very small size of light, and then there would be a size increase until it became such a tremendous size that it was impossible to compare it with any plane or object known to give off that much light. According to the description, it hovered at the stake and made no noise whatever. Suddenly it shot at tremendous speed straight up the star again. No trail. It stayed there quite a while, and then it would redisappear again. This was repeated a number of times during the watch. One witness said he saw it go off the light of star or a moon. The shine went an out of the star or light. It seemed to be a considerable distance away. This was not a reflection of any kind, nor was it an ordinary aircraft. It appeared to be an object of tremendous size that could make itself invisible at will, or at least blend in with the background in such a manner as to be completely obscured from view.
