Sunday Night Sighting
Dallas, Texas, 7:50 P M Citizen George F. Cornet, his wife, and two children, aged 4 and 6 years old, were driving about 10 to 15 miles west of Corpus Christi on highway 44. They said they saw an object about 30 feet in diameter appear out of the clouds about 20 degrees above the horizon. This was to the east. They said the object seemed to be revolving or spinning as it hovered over the area. When Mr. Cornet stopped the car and got out to get a better look, the object then began to descend toward the ground. He said he was able to see the bottom of the object before it disappeared behind trees and power lines. He reported his sighting the next day, September 5, to the Corpus Christi Air Force Base.
The police, which appeared to be disinterested in the report, said they had received several other calls on this incident. The object was described as being around 30 feet in diameter, and about 4 to 5 years old. Browns said he was on his return trip home from fishing all day, and was about 20 to 25 miles southwest of Corpus Christi when he saw the object. He said it appeared to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and was hovering about 30 to 50 feet off the ground. He said he watched it for about 15 to 20 minutes before it began to move off to the southwest, increasing in speed as it went. The area where the object was seen is just outside the south Gate to the Kingsville Naval Air Station.
