Number 10: 2 GI's at sight Golf 1 Francis E. Warran Missile sight Golf 1. 0600. Extremely bright white light moving very fast. No sound or propulsion altitude 10 to 20,000 moving south to north. Took approximately 30 minutes across the sky from horizon to horizon. Weather is same. Appeared to be the size of a quarter at arms length. That's all I have right now. OK hope it's the last. Right. I doubt it seriously I think it's going to be like last night again. OK sir, Thank you.
