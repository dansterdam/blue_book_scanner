Dear Mr. 

Thank you for your letter of July 20, 1964, with enclosures.

We have no information on Unidentified Flying Objects, and no facility for research and investigation of them.

The U.S. Air Force has requested that we send inquiries of this kind to it. We are, therefore, sending your letter to the Air Force, Office of Information, for reply.

Sincerely yours,

Philip S. Hopkins
Director
