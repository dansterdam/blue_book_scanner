CHILD BURNED IN NEW MEXICO
One of the most sensational reports to come out of the routine and only summer news of the year [underlined] comes from Charles Keith Davis of Hobbs, New Mexico. The child burned, a 7-year-old boy Charles, was the son of Mrs. Smith and was playing in the backyard of his grandmother's laundry in Hobbs. The child had been to the boiler room of the laundry where his grandmother, Mrs. Smith, was cutting a cake in preparation for a birthday party and some small burns on his hand and arms led him to use an elongated apparently metal obj ect to raise the back of his shirt. This object has not been identified by the FBI laboratory.
According to Mrs. Smith, the child cried out and she saw him standing with his eyes tight shut and his hair standing on end until the object went back. The child was not burned, 1 according to Mrs. Smith, except on his hands and arms and these, according to medical reports, were small burns similar to those received when a material is raised suddenly and then quickly touched to the skin.
The doctor who examined the child described him as a "bright, friendly boy" [underlined] treating the burns which amounted to reddened skin but no serious injury. Although the Doctor was frank and readily answered questions, the reported did not say he had seen any public discussion of the case or an influ x of mail inquiring about the child. Additional information as to the nature of the object and the cause of the burns seemed to have been closely guarded both by either the family or the Doctor.
