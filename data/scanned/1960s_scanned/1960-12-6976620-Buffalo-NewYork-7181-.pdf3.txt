DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S):

At approximately 7:11 PM, the observer sighted a bright, circular object in the sky to the northwest. The object appeared to be approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizon and was stationary. 

The object was an estimated 3-5 degrees in apparent diameter and appeared to emit a bright, white light. The light was intense, but not dazzling, and illuminated the surrounding hazy area. The object was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes before it slowly faded from view, seemingly dissolving into the night sky.

No sound was associated with the object, and no unusual movements or changes in brightness were noted during the observation period.
