The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch shows a compass rose and some graphical elements representing the movement of an object or objects. The text seems to be instructions or questions related to the sketch, but does not describe any photographic evidence.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (by line). Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the azimuth (direction) from which you (first) saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
