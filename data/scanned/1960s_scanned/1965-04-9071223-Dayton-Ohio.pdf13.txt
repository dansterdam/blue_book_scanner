The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire with a series of questions about the observer's experience with a reported UFO sighting. The questions cover details such as whether the object disappeared while being observed, whether it moved behind something, its apparent size, shape, and color, and whether the observer was able to make any sketches or drawings of the object.

The text of the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One.)
Yes       No       Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One.)
Yes       No       Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. On a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch your details of the object that you saw such as shape, proportions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Please use arrow heads to show the direction the object was moving.
