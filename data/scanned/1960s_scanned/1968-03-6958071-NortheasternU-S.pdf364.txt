MEMO FOR RECORD
4 March 1968

SUBJECT: Satellite Decay, 4 March 1968 (1420 hrs)

We are quite certain this was a piece of debris from the USSR launch ZOND-4 which is the most recent launch. It, the debris, was about 15 minutes ahead of the main pieces of the launch. We have as visuals, but are putting ground tracers on it. All observers, from SAO, had reports from Louiseville, Kentucky.

Lt Barlett suggested that we state that it was debris without reference to origin. However, if asked directly we could certainly call them that it was debris from ZOND-4 and that it was of Russian origin.
