SAPOI GC/Mrs Cassaei/jaa/79079/28 Feb 67

MAR 1 1967

Dear Mrs

Reference your letter of September 10, 1966 in which you stated that your photographic transparencies taken from the surface of the ocean.

A photographic analysis of your color transparencies revealed that the images contained indefinite objects, presumably reflections with an undetermined number of secondary refractions or reflections. Based on the information contained in the optical system.

This indicates that the horizon shapes are not photographs of actual distant visual shapes but the indefinite images of a camera imaging its own lens diaphragm.

I have enclosed your negatives and four enlargements. We wish to thank you for enabling the review of the photographs.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
