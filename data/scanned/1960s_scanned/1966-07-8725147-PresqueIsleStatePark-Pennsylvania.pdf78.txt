ANALYSIS TEST REPORT
ANALYTICAL SECTION

SUBJECT: Analysis of Sand from Erie, Pennsylvania related to UFO

SUBMITTED BY: William F. Morley, Jr., ASSTX, POX 

ANALYSIS: Analysis sandy material that is bound together to determine the nature of this binding. A particle, similar to the particles seen in plastic vials and about 10 pounds of sand for analysis. Three of the vials were labeled "A" and two vials were labeled "B".  

The ten pounds of sand was submitted in a large pasteboard box. The sand was examined in microscopic detail and a strong ultraviolet light was used, a search for luminescent or fluorescent particles. The test for the urea in urine was performed by heating a portion of the sand and observing the color, odor and emitting hydroxides.

The sand and other material were heated and in every case the silicate turned blue indicating that it has been formed. This was a positive test that the urea was present in the sand. Other modifications to the sand were observed during the tests. The chloroform was extracted with the chloroform. The chloroform was evaporated but no residue remained.  

The sand in the box contained several pieces of sand bonded together. One of the pieces of bonded sand was placed under ultraviolet light and another piece was put on the microscope stage to be studied visually.

A sample of chloroform and the bonding substance dissolved. The activity of the bonded sand was examined. An identification was made and reported verbally to Lt. Morley of the USAF that he had just received a report on this sand which had been examined for its properties and analysis.
