Background information on UFO sighting by Mrs. _________

Reference the UFO sighting by ___________ in August 1966. A study of the subjective information submitted did not reveal the actual stimulus for her observation. Due to the late receipt of the information, it is not possible, at this time, to make a comparative investigation of the activity since records are normally destroyed three months after their utilization. In addition, the lack of a specific date prevents a meaningful check of satellite schedules.

No direct correlation can be established between the buzzing sound and the observance of the alleged UFO. We are not in a position to advise Mrs. ____________ against shooting a UFO; however, it would be inadvisable for her to committed law enforcement officers before taking such action. It should be pointed out that many UFOs have been determined to be aircraft. There is a federal law against firing at aircraft.
