15 July 1962

Gentlemen:
Last night, on the 15th of this month, at about 10 o'clock, when I was with my children, I saw what seemed to me to be a satellite in the sky. I was coming home with my children, and as I was crossing a field, I saw this object, which had a bluish-white light. I called to my children to come and see it, and they also saw it. We watched it for 15 minutes, and it did not move from the spot where we first saw it. There were no flashing lights, and it seemed to be stationary in the sky. After 15 minutes, it disappeared suddenly, as if it had been turned off. I have been wondering about this ever since, and I would like to have your opinion on what this object could have been. It may or may not have been the satellite you spoke of, but we actually saw something unusual that night.
Very truly yours,
