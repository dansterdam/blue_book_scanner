The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a typed letter. As an OCR system, I will extract the text from the document:

Dear Mr. -----

This is a reply to your letter received on with our 15 September 1965.

I regret to inform you that we have not been able to identify the flying object which you observed on 12 August 1965. While your description of the object is very detailed, we do not have any photographs or other physical evidence with which to make a positive identification. Such sightings are frequently created by natural phenomena such as aircraft, satellites, astronomical objects, or meteorological conditions. In this case, the available information is not sufficient to determine the exact nature of the object you observed.

Sincerely,
Pennsylvania
