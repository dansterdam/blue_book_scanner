The text in the document is as follows:

August 7, 1964

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of July 18, 1964, addressed to Captain Quintanilla at the Project Blue Book Office of the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base concerning the "Unidentified Flying Object" you observed.

Enclosed is a Form 164 "U.S. Air Force Technical Information concerning a sighting you reported. It is requested that you complete the questionnaire and return it in the self-addressed envelope enclosed for your information. This information is not sufficient enough to enable our Project Office to make an evaluation. The object you sketched could not be associated with any known type of weather phenomenon, illumination or aircraft towing. It does appear to be a possible reflection of some sort and the probabilities are that it was not actually observed, but rather a visual phenomena allied to aircraft towing a banner with electrical lights.

In the 164 questionnaire, would you list the duration of the sighting as well as the motion of the object and complete the other questions in as much detail as possible.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
