We noticed a strange form that might be an object that was lighted in a dull yellow of salmon and very bright at times. It was blinking on and off and then it would blot out the stars as it passed across the sky. It also seemed to be moving at an unusually high rate of speed. We are certain that it was not a plane, as it was much lower down and was not making any sound. We continued watching it for about 10 minutes, at the end of which time, it seemed to have gone out and disappeared into the night sky. We noticed that it was quite a size, about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. It was a very peculiar object and we would like any information as to what it could have been. After about 10 minutes, it seemed to grow dimmer and dimmer until we could no longer see it.
