It appeared to be hovering and maneuvering through the sky very slowly at about 1500 feet. It would stop for a few seconds and then move again. It was hard for me to judge the size as I had no reference points. The color was bright white. It seemed to be about 75 feet wide. A pinhead please in the sky would compare to the size of the object.
