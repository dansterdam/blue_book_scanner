While patrolling the area, officer A reported seeing a brilliant white light descending at a rapid rate of speed toward the SE. The light appeared to be 30-40 feet in diameter and was sighted at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet. As the object approached, it suddenly reversed direction and climbed rapidly, straight up, out of sight, in 10-15 seconds. Visibility was good, with a clear night sky.

The light was observed by officer A only, as officer B was in a separate vehicle at the time of the sighting. 

No other witnesses reported sighting the object.
