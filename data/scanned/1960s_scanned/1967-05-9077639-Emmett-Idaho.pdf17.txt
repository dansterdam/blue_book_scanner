Text from the document:

On 13 July 1959 at 1045 hours, Major Quintanilla spoke with Major William G. Salyor regarding the UFO sighting of 23 May 1957 which they had discussed previously on 12 July 1957. Major Quintanilla informed Major Salyor that he was going to have to investigate the sighting. The sighting occurred at Emmett, Idaho. L. Gorrono, Prosecuting Attorney's Office, sent a letter to Senator Jordan. Also involved is Justice of the Peace, A.O. Perry. The witnesses were a boy age 15 and his brother age 13. Major Quintanilla asked Major Salyor to go out and talk with the Justice of Mr. Gorrono and get their version of the story. Then contact the boys. Major told him that the photographs were taken with a Polaroid Swinger. He should get a measuring tape and a base photographer. The base photographer should take some good pictures with his camera and then try to borrow the boys' Swinger and take pictures with it. Major Quintanilla informed Maj Salyor that we had a suspense of 21 Jul on this and that he should get on the case and tell the heads there at Mountain Home about the problem. We will try to keep the Congressional pressure from reaching them. If he needs any assistance please call Major Quintanilla. Major Salyor may be reached by dialing Autovan 55-1990 ext 2499.
