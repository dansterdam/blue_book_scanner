While driving home from work near Midland, Michigan that we assume that it was a large aircraft. At the time we assumed that it was a high altitude jet. However, later we realized that it could not have been a normal jet aircraft. The object was stationary and hovered over our house (which we could not find an account of the time) when we first observed it, the object appeared to be rounded or circular in shape and its color was bright and metalic like (sic) chrome or aluminum. It appeared to be over 300 feet in diameter and we estimate that it was hovering at an altitude of 300 to 400 feet. After observing it for several minutes it departed: two to the east, one headed south. The one traveling south began a rapid rate of speed and disappeared from view, while the other two reappeared and continued their easterly course. While observing the object, we had no idea what it was and it was not making any sound. We were quite certain that it could not have been any type of aircraft or helicopter that we are familiar with. After the object departed, we were left with a feeling of awe and wonderment as to what we had just witnessed. We are still trying to come to a logical explanation and would appreciate any assistance or information you may be able to provide.
