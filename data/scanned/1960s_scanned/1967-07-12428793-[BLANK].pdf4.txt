U. S. SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS

Many leading astronomers have expressed their ideas on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. There is evidence that the bulk of the stars in the sky have planetary systems. Recent research concerning the origin of life on earth suggests that the physical and chemical processes leading to the origin of life occur rapidly in the early history of the majority of planets. The selective value of intelligence and technical civilization is obvious, and it seems likely that a large number of planets within our Milky Way galaxy, perhaps as many as a million, are inhabited by technical civilizations in advance of our own. Interstellar space flight is far beyond our present technical capabilities, but there seems to be no fundamental physical objections to it, and it would be very rash indeed for anyone to preclude, from our present vantage point, the possibility of its development by other civilizations.

Dr. Carl Sagan, of Harvard University, for one, has often expressed his views that the earth is not the only inhabited planet. His work has produced the logic that if a million advanced technical civilizations in our galaxy launched an interstellar spacecraft per year, and even if all stars in the galaxy can be explored with equal facility, the galaxy could be completely traversed in a relatively short time.
