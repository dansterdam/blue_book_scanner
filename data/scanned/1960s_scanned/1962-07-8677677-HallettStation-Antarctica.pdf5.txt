It is concluded that a fireball and the trail it generated produced the observed brilliant light at Hallett Station on 27 July 1962 at 11:52 as intense as day light was observed. The objects observed were compared to previous known events and it was confirmed that they gave the characteristics of a fireball as a meteorological phenomena. The report stated that the light was as intense as daytime and when investigated it was found that no source of radiation was detected. Subsequently they inspected the area and they indicated the same relative position through where the object was reported to have passed. They believe the trail was caused by the solid matter generating ion trail through the atmosphere and they indicated the trail persisted long enough to make observation possible by the naked eye. The fireball was of a brilliant flash and disappeared within a few seconds, usually a whistling, rumbling or series of explosions will accompany such an event. The observers noted any sound associated with the object which they distinctly did not hear. The witnesses were at a distance of 1/2 to 1 mile from the event and their description coincides with the known characteristics of a bolide which produces the observed phenomena with great intensity and brilliance within the general pattern of the visible spectrum. It generated a trail of illumination which was described as emitting a brilliant flash and disappeared within a few seconds.
