The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an official U.S. Air Force document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

24. Date you completed this questionnaire: 22 March 1967
25. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: 
A: a round luminous object was observed, quite close and low in the north-northwest sky on March 22, 1967 at about 9:00 PM EST. It was observed for about 2-3 minutes. The object appeared to be a bright, luminescent sphere, about the size of a basketball seen from a distance of several hundred yards. It moved slowly across the sky from west to east, without any visible means of propulsion. There were no other lights or markings visible on the object. It just dimly glowed, and finally moved out of sight. There were no sounds heard associated with this observation. This is the first incident of this type that has occurred in this area, to my knowledge. I have no idea what this object may have been, but it did not fit any of the normal patterns of aircraft, satellites, or other known phenomena. I simply observed something quite unusual and unexplainable. I would be glad to discuss this further if you feel it would be worthwhile.
