There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a typed letter addressed to "Lt. Col Quintanilla" from "R. J. Low" of the University of Colorado.

The text of the letter is as follows:

"Hector:
I'm sure you've seen the attached by ____ in case you haven't _____________. I'm interested to know whether anybody who reported this thing suggested he heard a sonic boom? Would you expect that there ought to be a report of one? Of course, there is no lift associated with a re-entering object, and, from reading, this literature on sonic booms, I conclude that lift is more responsible for sonic boom than volume. Even so, there would be a boom in connection with the Zond 4 re-entry. Maybe, for such an object, the noise of the re-entry is very minor, and you would not expect a report. What has been your experience in such matters?
Sincerely yours,
B. G."
