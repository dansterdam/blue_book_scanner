Dear Major, Doctor Quintanilla:

I saw a U.F.O.'s June 6/1967 at 11:31 P.M. - It was over Berwyn, Pennsylvania. It was like a digger one was a triangular shaped object, which had a clear light in the center and red flashing lights around it. It was hovering around about 5 minutes at a time, it also had a lighted trail like it was burning the air, There were about 5 people who saw it under it (on the ground).

It was a triangular shaped object, and flying: it was hovering above a tree about 5 miles from the viewer. The bigger one apparently disappeared when the smaller one came near it.

Sincerely,
Mr. [Redacted]
Manville, N.J.
