Dear Wendover's
I want to immediately the last three nights I have been seeing of ud in the sky. Others have seen it too. I was wondering ifyou could tell me more about it. My contact up there, as you know, have been keeping me some new. reports. I live in France, New Jersey and the last time I saw it was on May 21, 1964. The distance was 5:30 P.M. and 6:00 P.M. We were not observing star, but there something strange about the time because we are not able to see it and disappeared after some time. So, this happened one other time, and we have it many as five or six the same appearances. Any more information you can give me will be appreciated I am serious about this and I know you are too, so please let me know what you think.
