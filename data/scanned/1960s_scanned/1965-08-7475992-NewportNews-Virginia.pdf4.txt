The image does not contain any photographs. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which is a report on unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

(3) Weather: Clear.
(4) Visibility: 7 miles.
(5) N/A.
(6) N/A.
(7) See a(2) above.
h. Other Unusual Activity or Condition: None.
i. Interruption or Identification Action Taken: None.
j. Location, Approximate Altitude, and General Direction of Flight: None known.
k. Position, Title, and Comments of Preparing Officer:
Langley Captain Albert L. Jones, USAF, 4500 Air Base Wing (DOD-D), Langley AF Base, Virginia, Base Disaster Control Officer.

As analysis of the object would be difficult since the object disappeared from sight almost immediately, whether the sun was still in a position to be the direct object, or whether the object disappeared to the sun, or a combination thereof. It is impossible, however, to an unpracticed eye to make any determination of altitude. If the object had remained visible for a sufficient length of time, weather or research observations might have provided some data, but the great "G" forces that the object would experience precluded any physical evidence.

JAMES A. BOYE, Lt Col, USAF
