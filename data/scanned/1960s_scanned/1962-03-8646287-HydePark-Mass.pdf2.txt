OFFICE MEMORANDUM - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
DATE: March 23, 1962.
FROM: (Please pass to ATIC)
SUBJECT: Three UFO's observed at 10:45 A.M., EST, March 22, 1962.

The following report was received last night by telephone from Mr. [REDACTED], Washington Street, Hyde Park 36, Mass.:

"At about 10:45 A.M. EST, March 22, 1962, I was looking to the north-west out of the window of my building. I observed three objects in the sky which appeared to be circular in shape and silver in color. They were moving in an easterly direction at what appeared to be a high rate of speed. They were at approximately the same altitude, and after being in sight for about 10-15 seconds, they disappeared from view. The objects appeared to be gliding, and there was no sound associated with them. This account is based on the observation of these objects which I considered to be unusual, and their appearance and manner of flight seemed to be authentic."

This account sounds plausible and authentic.
