SUBJ: UFO SIGHTING (REDACTED)
Rt Capt, USAF, Westover AFB, Massachusetts
REFERENCE: MAJOR WILLIAM HARRIS
1. WE HAVE RECEIVED A COMPLETED FORM FROM MR. (REDACTED), CONCERNING THE SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 600 MILES NORTHWEST OF ASCENSION ISLAND IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN ON 8 JUNE 1964. THE HIGHLIGHTS OF HIS OBSERVATION; HOWEVER, THE FLIGHT PATH OF THE OBJECT CONTINUED TO BE OBSERVED FOR 5-10 MINUTES AFTER WHICH IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THE OBJECT'S SPEED WAS ESTIMATED AT 3-4 TIMES THE SPEED OF SOUND. ITS COLOR WAS GIVEN AS SILVERY - GREY. FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDED RAPID ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION AND EXTREME MANEUVERABILITY EVIDENT DURING THE OBSERVATIONS.
2. THE DESCRIPTION PRESENTED BY MR. (REDACTED) INDICATED SOME CHARACTERISTICS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF NORMANGEPIN, AS SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH THE MAJOR ASTRONOMICAL EVENTS IN HIS AREA. BASED ON HIS DESCRIPTION, AN AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS CONDUCTING A ROUTINE MISSION OR THE OBSERVATION OF THE OBJECT WAS CONFIRMED TO BE VERY SMALL AREA, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT THIS PHENOMENA WAS AIRCRAFT.
3. IF THE OBJECT CANNOT BE CORRELATED WITH A SATELLITE OBSERVATION DURING THE TIMEFRAME, WE CAN OFFER NO OTHER EXPLANATION. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED TO PRESENT A FINAL EVALUATION OF THIS SIGHTING.
