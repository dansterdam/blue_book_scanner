MEMO FOR THE RECORD
TALKED TO MRS. HAMILTON

TWO PILOTS FLYING WEST OBSERVED THE METEOR AT ABOUT THEIR ONE O'CLOCK POSITION, APPROXIMATE POSITION - ALBANY, NEW YORK. ASPECTS INDICATE THAT METEOR WAS GOING TOWARD GREAT LAKES AREA, POSSIBLY NORTH OF ROME BUT SOUTH OF WATERTOWN.

MRS. HAMILTON SAID THAT IT PROBABLY BURNED UP BECAUSE IT LEFT A VERY WIDE TRAIL, AND TRAVELED SLOWLY (DESPITE A DURATION OF ONLY A FEW MINUTES) WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT IT WAS PROBABLY OF A LIGHT OBJECT AND THAT IT REMAINED A LOT OF ITS MASS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH OPTICAL ENERGY RADIATED.
