Edinburgh revisited
The Edinburgh Evening Dispatch reported on August 6, 1963, flying ob-
jects had been sighted over the city the previous evening. A police
constable named Robert Brown saw two bright objects in the sky, an
estimated 20,000 ft up, which appeared to be oscillating and changing
color. After watching them for about three minutes, they disappeared.
According to the article, these were not the first such sightings in the
area. A number of other witnesses also reported seeing the objects.
He added that it was silver and shiny, "like a small moon", which
flew silently and disappeared from view.
