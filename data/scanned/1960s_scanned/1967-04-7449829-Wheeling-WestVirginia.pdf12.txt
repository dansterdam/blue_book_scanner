There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which contains typed comments made by Dr. J. Allen Hynek on June 9, 1969.

The text in the document is as follows:

TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE, 1969

WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA             4 APRIL 1967
Information too meager for firm evaluation. A one-witness case which I don't like. Trajectory queer. 
Basically only a bright light reported, observed for only a few seconds or so. Evaluation: 
Possible aircraft
Possible unknown.
