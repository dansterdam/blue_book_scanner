The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"Between 11:20 and 11:30 a light was observed in the sky near the home of the observer. The light was variable and appeared to be moving. At first it was a small bright light. It increased in size until it was the size of a basketball and then decreased in size again to the size of a small light. This process was repeated several times. The light was observed for approximately 30 minutes. At times it appeared to change color, going from white to reddish in color. At one point the light appeared to be accompanied by a second light. Both lights then appeared to separate and move independently. At the end of the observation, the light(s) appeared to move off and disappear."
