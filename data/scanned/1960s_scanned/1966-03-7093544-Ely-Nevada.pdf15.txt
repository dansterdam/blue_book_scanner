"These stars, a perfect line. - I continued to watch often we had gotten into bed. Our head is pleased - That we can look out into the sky. He watched, too. But I had said nothing along the first stars were. And of grieg on a new morene behind the roof of the house across the street. My husband said "They are moving!" Then the second, then the third - it took about 10-12 minutes. All the while their lights kept very bright - then almost gone now gone to some other part of the sky I star, I say a star for want of word - it began its descent."
