The image appears to contain a sketch and a compass rose, but no photograph. 

In the OCR output, I will transcribe all the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon where the object was shown. If place a "B" on the same horizon (skyline) where you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the starting point of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
