NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON (WHICH FIRST SEEN) MOVED. PLEASE A "T" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH IT MOVED LATER.

(This text appears to instruct the viewer to mark the compass diagram to indicate the initial and later directions of movement of the observed phenomenon.)
