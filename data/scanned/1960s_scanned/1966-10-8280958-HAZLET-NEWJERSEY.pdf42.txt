The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text indicates that the observer was asked various questions about the sighting, such as whether the object disappeared, moved behind something, or changed in appearance. The observer provided written responses to these questions. Additionally, the observer was asked to draw a picture showing the shape of the object and the direction it was moving. However, no such drawing is present in the image.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? 
The object appeared for a few seconds at a time and disappeared intermittently. Later, the object stayed off it.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know.
If you answered Yes: It moved behind a cloud several times

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes  No  Don't Know.
If you answered Yes: The object stayed in the background.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: A series of high pitch electrical sounding sounds
b. Color: White and reddish

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? The flame of my paper match and the size of it was small in comparison to the size of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially exhaust trails or streamers. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
