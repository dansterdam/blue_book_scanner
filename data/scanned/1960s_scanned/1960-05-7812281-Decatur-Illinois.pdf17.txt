Dear Sirs:

For your information. Dear sir, have seen 6 "flying saucers" about 8:15 to 8:30 P.M. May 4, 1960. Chemist, Norwood Hgts., Decatur, Illinois.

Unusual bright objects, with apparent portholes, hovering and darting movements. Observed for approximately 15 minutes. Our household and neighbors sighted. Objects departed in erratic motions - still air visibility. 

In this area constant sightings, with occasional reports. Hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely yours,
