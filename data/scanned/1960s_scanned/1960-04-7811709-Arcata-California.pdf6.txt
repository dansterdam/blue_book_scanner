This appears to be an item in an old UFO report document. The text reads as follows:

"This object was very close, and the view of it was exceptionally good. It was hovering and silent, and the details could be very clearly seen. It was shaped like a disc, and was silver or aluminum color. The size was estimated to be approximately 75 to 80 feet in diameter. The thickness of the disc was estimated to be between 12 to 15 feet. There were no markings, windows, or other details visible on the surface of the object. The object was hovering silently and motionless.

As I will now describe, the following occurred: 
1. After sighting the object, it moved slowly and smoothly to the south and then slightly east. The motion was very even and controlled, without any noticeable acceleration or deceleration. The speed was estimated to be approximately 500 to 600 mph. (1) I had a very good view of the object, and I was able to observe it clearly for approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds. It was moving in a perfectly straight line, and there was no wobble or instability in its motion. (2) At the end of this period, the object suddenly accelerated and streaked off to the northeast at an estimated speed in excess of 1,000 mph. The object was out of sight in approximately 2 to 3 seconds. (3) The object did not make any noise.

2. As I can rule out any conventional flight, this appears to be an unidentified flying object. This causes me and others who saw it to be quite amazed and perplexed. The sighting lasted long enough and the view was close enough for me to be certain of the details I have described. In this respect, I have to disagree with any conclusion that this was a misidentification of a known aircraft or other object. In my opinion, this was a genuine unidentified flying object of unconventional characteristics.

3. As soon as the object accelerated and disappeared, I went to the phone and called the local air force base to report the sighting, as I felt it was my duty to do so. The officer I spoke to seemed quite interested in my report.

4. It is my belief that the object which I saw posed no threat or danger of any kind. The motion and behavior of the object was consistent with controlled, intelligent flight. There was no erratic or random motion, and the acceleration was smooth and controlled. Two other observers also saw the object, and their accounts agree with mine in all essential details.

In closing, I am quite certain that what I observed was not any kind of conventional aircraft. It was a genuine unidentified flying object, and I am willing to cooperate fully with any further investigation of this incident."
