Case #12033

Summary:

On September 6, 1967, at approximately 10:30 p.m., Mr. Paul Miller and his wife observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) over their home in Lowell, Michigan. 

The object was described as a bright, disc-shaped craft that hovered silently in the sky for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. 

Mr. Miller reported the incident to the local police, who in turn notified the Air Force's Project Blue Book for investigation.

Investigators from Project Blue Book conducted interviews with the witnesses and collected additional evidence, but were unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the observed object.

The case was classified as "unidentified" and added to the Project Blue Book files for further analysis and potential future reference.
