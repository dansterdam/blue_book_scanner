5. SKETCH OR DESCRIBE THE OBJECT(S). INCLUDE SUCH DETAILS AS SHAPE, COLOR, SIZE IN RELATION TO KNOWN OBJECTS, TRAIL OR EXHAUST, RATE AND TYPE OF MOTION, SOUNDS, ETC.
My memory of what I saw is not completely clear at this point, but I recall a large object that appeared to be illuminated and hovering over the ocean and then moving off quickly at a high rate of speed. The object was quite large in size and appeared to be brightly lit up, but I cannot recall the exact details of its shape or color.
14. GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT SEEMED TO PULSATE, FLICKER, OR REMAIN STEADY, COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR OTHER OBJECT IN YOUR FIELD OF VIEW.
The object appeared to be quite large in size and emitting a bright light. It hovered over the ocean for a time before suddenly moving off at a high rate of speed. The bright light it emitted remained steady throughout the sighting. I did not observe any pulsating or flickering. The object's behavior and appearance were quite different from any conventional aircraft or celestial objects I have observed.
