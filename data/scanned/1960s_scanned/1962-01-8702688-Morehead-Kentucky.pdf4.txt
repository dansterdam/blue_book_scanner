The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document states:

"IN THIS CONSTELLATION WERE FIRST NOTICED ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD 3 OBJECTS VERY SUDDENLY APPEAR IN THE NIGHT SKY. THE OBJECTS WERE VERY BRIGHT, GLOWING A BRIGHT BLUISH WHITE. THEY SEEMED TO BE HOVERING OR STATIONARY, THEN THEY STARTED MOVING RAPIDLY. THEY WERE VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 45 SECONDS BEFORE DISAPPEARING SUDDENLY."

"TO MY ASTONISHMENT, I COULD NOT CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE OBJECTS AND WAS COMPELLED TO LOOK AWAY AS IT WAS HURTING MY EYES. DURING THIS TIME I WAS GETTING A SICK FEELING RISING FROM MY STOMACH UP INTO MY THROAT. HE SAID HE WOULD GO TO THE DOCTOR, BUT COUGHING AND TALKING WAS BECOMING DIFFICULT SO HE THOUGHT IT WISE NOT TO DO SO. AFTER SALIVING, I WENT OUTSIDE ONCE MORE AND THE OBJECTS WERE NO LONGER VISIBLE."
