11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS   
Observers watched two objects moving in different patterns in the northern sky. As the one object transversed its path it would become extremely dim. It also had this characteristic when making a turn. At these times the object could only be seen with the binoculars. At one time, as the observers were following object #1, object #2 passed into the field of view of the binoculars, so that they were both visible at the same moment.

The description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. Although there are no refueling tracks in the area, it appears that some aircraft were observed on some training mission. There is no evidence to indicate that other than aircraft were observed.
