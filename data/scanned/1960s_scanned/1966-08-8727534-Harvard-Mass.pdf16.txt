The text in the document is as follows:

"Attention is directed to the remarkable observations and experiences of Miss Edith Rowe of Harvard, Massachusetts, 12 Harvard Street. On August 6, 1966, at or about 10:15 P.M., Miss Rowe was preparing for bed in her home when she observed an unusual luminous object in the sky. Miss Rowe states that the object was approximately 100 yards away, approximately 100 feet in diameter, and appeared to hover silently above the horizon at an altitude of about 200 feet. The object was described as 'luminous', 'glowing' and 'rainbow-colored' with a circular, saucer-shaped appearance. After several minutes of observation, the object suddenly accelerated upward at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view. Miss Rowe states that she was both startled and frightened by the experience, but was able to observe the object in detail, as it was in full view and well-illuminated. Miss Rowe is a sober, reliable witness and has no history of imaginative or fanciful reports. Her observation appears to be that of a genuine unidentified aerial phenomenon."
