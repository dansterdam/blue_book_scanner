APR 80-17(CI)
INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE:
ON APRIL 8 VERY COLD DAY THE INTENSITY OF THE POWER LINE INCREASED TO AN EXTENT THAT IT GLOWED RED AND WAS GREATER THAN I HAVE EVER SEEN IT UP CLOSE - THE POWER LINE.
I HEARD THE SAME NOISE AS HEARD BEFORE WHEN NOT MUCH ACTIVITY OCCURRED. AND WAS JUST THE SAME AS EXPERIENCED EARLIER, BECAUSE IT WAS A PREVIOUS VISIT AND WENT TO GET EXT, I AM NOT SURE OF THE TIME PERIOD WAS WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS ON APRIL 1, BUT WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING UNTIL WE GOT BOTH SNOW AND RAIN ON APRIL 8.
SINCE APRIL I WE HAVE NOT HEARD OR SEEN ANYTHING RESEMBLING WHAT WE BOTH SAW ON APRIL 1, 1968 AT 10:45 PM.
