The image appears to contain two illustrations. The larger illustration is a compass rose with directional labels. The smaller illustrations appear to be landscape drawings, potentially depicting the observation of a UFO-related phenomenon.

APR 50-17(C1)
NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A V ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

NOTICE:
THE SHAPES OF THE PHENOMENA OBSERVED SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO APPROXIMATE THE ACTUAL CONFIGURATION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. PLACE AN ARROW TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOTION, IF ANY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LARGER SIGHTINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE DISC-SHAPED, CONNECT THE APPROPRIATE PORTIONS OF THE CIRCLE TO APPROXIMATE THAT SHAPE. THIS WILL GIVE US A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF THE ACTUAL CONFIGURATION OF THE PHENOMENON.
