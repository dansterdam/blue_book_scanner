STATEMENT OF WITNESS
On June 6, 1967, at approximately 2215 hours, I was in my home located in North San Juan, California. I observed a bright light in the sky, northwest of my location, which was approximately 1000 feet above the ground. The light seemed to be stationary for a few seconds, then it started to move slowly in a southeasterly direction. It continued to move for approximately 3 to 4 minutes, then stopped and remained stationary for about 1 minute. It then moved rapidly in a northwesterly direction and disappeared from sight.
The light was round and very bright, illuminating the area below it. I estimate the diameter of the light to be approximately 50 to 60 feet. It did not appear to make any sound.
I have observed similar lights in the sky on previous occasions in this general area. This sighting is the most vivid and lengthy one I have experienced.
