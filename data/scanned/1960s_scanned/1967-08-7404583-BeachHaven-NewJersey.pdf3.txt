The sky was clouded over completely except in the southeast. 
The wind direction was southwest and I checked this out with the Coast Guard Station 1-4 in Beach Haven.

The object suddenly appeared in the northeast approximately half-way across the Little Egg Harbor Bay. There were no blinking lights on the object as one sees on planes. 

I looked through the binoculars at the object and saw a solid brilliant sphere with a super-structure in the shape of a cigar (a fat cigar) and having what looked like window outlines from one end to the other.

The object moved toward the east, parallel to the earth, and then suddenly shot straight up into the clouds. NOTE: The object moved across wind.

ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 28, 1967, AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 P.M., Mother (name removed) and I saw another U.F.O. This object suddenly appeared in the south - very high - and moved downward toward the southeast. 
I thought at first it was a falling star or meteorite, but then the object shot straight up and moved in a straight line, parallel to the earth, into the northeast at a fantastic rate of speed. Mother witnessed the object also.
The wind direction that night was northwest. There was no moonlight but the stars were bright. The object had no blinking lights at all. As I said, the speed was fantastic, like the U.F.O. my husband and I saw the night of January 25, 1967, at approximately the same time.
