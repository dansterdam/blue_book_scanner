The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with various questions about the sighting of an unidentified object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
Circle one: Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
Circle one: Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound b. Color

18. We wish to know the angular size: Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment, what fraction of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially indicate the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
