This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a report or document, with handwritten text on the page.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is:

The object appeared somewhat circular in shape, not quite saucer-like, but definitely not spherical. It appeared to be quite large, perhaps 50 to 75 feet in diameter. The object was hovering at an altitude of perhaps 1000 feet, and was surrounded by a bright glow or halo. The glow was not steady, but pulsating or flickering. The object appeared to be dark in color, and no structural details could be discerned. It was completely silent. The object remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated in a horizontal direction at a very high rate of speed, and disappeared from view within a few seconds. No trail was visible.
