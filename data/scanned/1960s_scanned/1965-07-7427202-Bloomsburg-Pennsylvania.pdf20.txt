The image contains a hand-drawn diagram depicting the witness's observation of an object in the sky. The diagram shows a large object with several smaller objects around it, and the text indicates that the larger object was moving at a high speed and was hard to get. There is also some additional text describing the witness's observation.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 August 1965 Friday

35. Information which you feel pertinent; and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. We have a more unusual or complex case than an earth-made satellite. I am sure because I have seen other satellites and this was not moving as they do. The object was not an earth-originated satellite as far as I can determine. It seemed to be a complex object and not a simple object of earth-origin can stop in mid-space without falling into atmosphere and remain stationary for a long period of time. It is true that traveling into atmosphere and remaining stationary is very difficult for an earth-made objects. The thing that was observed was a blue-green color and was a large object with smaller objects around it. Please contact me if you find anything on this or have any ideas.
