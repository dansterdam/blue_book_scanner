This is of course in only my recommendation by may what means the writing from your paragraph. I would like to suggest an explanation my conclusion against same this. I cannot on a reasonable basis, it denied nor dismiss the report given, or the many details herein. This siting is evidently not imaginary, there is no indication whatever this is as a hoax or fantasy fiction. The contents are wholly straightforward and sober, and the witness apparently a sincere and intelligent observer.

It was merely for night, the 20th around 11:00 p.m., this incident occurred without warning. The witness reports that a maneuverable object, steady not too brilliant yet luminous, and clearly visible against the night sky, approached the scene low the ground, stopped briefly then accelerated at tremendous speed and direction departing rapidly. We have no other accounts from this location to corroborate the siting, but the report itself indicates a credible first-hand observation with no apparent motive to falsify, and reveals an event which would be most unusual and difficult to dismiss. I do not see any elements in the report suggestive of exaggeration or invention, but rather a matter-of-fact recital of what the witness apparently observed.

In this instance we have no physical evidence, such as photographs or other tangible data. But the narrative has the ring of authenticity, and merits serious consideration and investigation if practicable. I would further recommend pursuit of any leads or similar incidents from that general region and time period, which may serve to establish or refute the factual basis of this report.

P.S. please let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
