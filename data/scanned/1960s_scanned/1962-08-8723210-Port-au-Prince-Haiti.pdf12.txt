The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing only text.

The text found in the document is as follows:

(1) The object was described as
(2) The object manoeuvred in such a way as to cause the witness to believe there were actually two objects involved in the observation. (See Power report on attached sheets)
(3) This object manoeuvred in a very erratic manner, moving from side to side and up and down. It did not seem to be a conventional aircraft.
(4) The object was observed for perhaps over 2 minutes.
(5) Manoeuvres were recorded.
(6) Evaluation was inconclusive.
(7) Manoeuvres considered unusual.
(8) Haze-like object showing definite speed and manoeuvres.
(9) Observed by two independent witnesses, together.
(10) Profile outline changed in apparent shape periodically.
(11) I would not classify as aircraft, conventional or otherwise, based on reported behaviour.
(12) Could not remain stable but did not follow random course.
(13) I would not designate as astral phenomena, but cannot identi-fy.
(14) Unusual case, in which the sighting by two credible independent witnesses raises considerable uncertainty as to identity of the observed object. A substantial case which does not readily resolve into any conventional explanation.
