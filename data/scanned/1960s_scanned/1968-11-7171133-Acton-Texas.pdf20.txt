The image appears to contain a photograph analysis report for an "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT" sighted in Acton, Texas on 19 November 1958. The report states that one 2x3¼ negative and 8x10 B&W print enlargement were provided as part of the photography. There is no further description or details about the contents of the photograph itself.

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 68-110 submitted by Lieutenant Colonel Quintanilla (TDFT) requesting analysis of a photograph taken near Acton, Texas, 19 November 1958, to determine the identity of a purported UFO.
2. ANALYSIS:
a. Examination and technical analysis of the print and corresponding negative furnished by Lieutenant Colonel Carter indicates that the most photograph examination is in regard to the image in the question. The apparent cause is the abnormal appearance of the emulsion side of the negative at the location of the image. There appears to be some distortion of the high reflective area around the image. The "spot" would be impossible to analyze without destroying the image in question. It appears as though there may have been a chemical damage or scratches to the emulsion of the negative which dissolved upon processing and standard development when the film wrapper had been available for some time. Corroboration of this film wrapper had been available for some time. Corroboration of this film wrapper condition might have been accomplished if the film wrapper had been available for examination.
b. Facts concerning the exposure of the film on which image in question appears, tend to show that the probability that the "subject" is the result of physical phenomena occurring within the camera.
(1) The photographer did not actually see the "object".
(2) Eight photos were made (the assumption is made that more than one photo covers the same general area) but the "object" appears on only one photo.
