The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with the title "NO CASE (Information Only)" and the date "31 July 1961" written at the top.

The text in the document states:

"July 31, Freeport, Ill. Round maneuvering object observed by three police officers. No sound and three minutes duration."
