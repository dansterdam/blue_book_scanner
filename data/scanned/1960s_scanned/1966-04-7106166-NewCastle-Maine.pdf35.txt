SIGHTING BACKGROUND
During the evening hours of April 17th, the Daviess and Peabody Police Departments received calls from citizens reporting UFOs were sighted in the sky over New Castle, Maine. The objects were described as being 2 to 3 feet in diameter, reddish-orange in color, and moving with rapid, erratic motions.

SIGHTING ACCOUNTS
CASE #1 (7:15 PM EST - Daviess)
The standard meteorological observer reported the sighting of two strange objects as he was making his routine observation. He stated the objects were round, about 1/2 inch in diameter, and had a bright white light around the edge. They remained stationary for about 15 minutes, then moved rapidly and erratically for several minutes before disappearing. There were no other visual or instrumental indications to the case.

CASE #2 (7:30 PM EST - Peabody)
About 15 minutes later, Richard and Wayne Parish and David Pearson reported observing a bright red object about the size of a basketball flying in a circular pattern with a zig-zag motion. They observed the object for about 10 minutes before it disappeared. The object was too far away for a clear visual observation, but appeared to be about the size of a basketball. It was viewed for about 10 minutes and was last seen heading NW.

CASE #3 (7:45 PM EST - Peabody)
About 15 minutes later, a southeast, John Collins, was cycling to his girlfriend's house when he sighted a round, bright object about the size of a basketball. He stated the object was bright red in color and moving erratically. He observed the object for about 2 to 3 minutes before it suddenly sped away and disappeared. It was compared to an auto headlight in intensity. No other corroborating witnesses were located.
