Text output from the document:

The report they seemed to have wanted to pass on, they made effort to bury, that they considered an unidentified flying object, that is, what was seen that night, and when the aircraft arrived the boats got into difficulty, etc. 

My main effort was to get this report and find out more about it. I have made many attempts to trace it, but have not been able to find it. 

The night it was observed, it was a dark night, and it was about 9:45 P.M. They said it looked like a luminous object, very bright, coming down out of the sky, and when it approached the boats, the boats got into difficulty. 

They said it had a steady light, not blinking, and that it seemed to hover over the boats for a while, and then shot up into the sky at a terrific speed and disappeared. 

As I say, I have made many attempts to trace this report, but have not been able to find it. The reason I was anxious to find it was that I felt it might shed some light on the Irvington incident that also occurred about that time.
