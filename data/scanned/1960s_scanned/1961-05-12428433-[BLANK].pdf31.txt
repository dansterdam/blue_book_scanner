Dr. Ross: We are going to show you a few slides of some of the inflatable or expandable structures. I have some movies here of the CHAFF MAN, a man that is inside of us can't see the slides.

The CHAFF MAN structures. They all involve the same thing: they can be folded up into a small compact package at one time and opened up into a very large one at another time.

Dr. Ross: Some call them inflatable, expandable, or plant structures. They all involve the same thing: the basic function; they can be folded up into a small compact package at one time and opened up into a very large one at another time.
