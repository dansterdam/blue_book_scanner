Dear Major Quintanilla,
Since I wrote you last, I have been doing what I said I would do. My name is and I will introduce myself first. My name is and I am the son of I have been doing research on UFOs since 1948, when myself, and were the first to report a saucer-like object in this area.
I call it a UFO because we were unable to identify it. It had characteristics that identified it as such on the object as you are, but as I told you before that I have been studying these things and have come up with a new theory that fits the description of what we saw. I have sent my articles on UFOs to and to a number of others whom I have contacted. I have taken it to this area: from many people. Very interesting, but last October 3, 1964 we saw what I would call an AP. What we saw were these lights to watch, wish white. Later we heard that a weather station was doing some experiment up there and we saw were the equipment was let go by a balloon. The reason I wrote this letter is to find out what happened to my UFO report. I described it to be NICAP on August 16, 1948. It is hard to believe that the same size or distant because it was too large for that. It was my mother who called our attention to it. It bothered her and said to all of us, "you see, I told you so." that will know that is true. I was reading many people so about UFOs that they are visiting but people have imagination now, do a lot believe in UFOs. So in this letter to tell you the object if stopped about five minutes then just vanished. There was no noise.
