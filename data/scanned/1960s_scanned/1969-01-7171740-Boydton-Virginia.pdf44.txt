 1. DATE/TIME GP:  6 January 1969, 2010 EST
 2. LOCATION: Boydton, Virginia
 3. DURATION:  5 minutes
 4. USAF UNITS INVESTIGATING:  6547th Radar Sqdn, Langley AFB, Va.
 5. ACT ION TAKEN:  Radar, visual investigation by military personnel.
 6. BRIEF SUMMARY:  Witnesses saw an object hovering in the sky that appeared to be 15-20 feet in diameter. The object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.  While no physical evidence was found, the radar indicated an unknown target was present in the area at the time of the sighting.
 7. ANALYSIS:  The radar returns and visual sighting lend credence to the report, although the lack of physical evidence and the inability to track the object on radar after initial detection make this a difficult case to evaluate conclusively.  The object's sudden acceleration and disappearance indicate possible unconventional flight characteristics. Without additional data, the possibility that this represents an unknown aerial phenomenon cannot be ruled out.
 8. CONCLUSION:  Unidentified
