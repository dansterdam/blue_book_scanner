above the edge of the cloud. It (the light) was farther away; it seemed to be still in the same relation to each other and still glowed with the distinctive intensity that had first attracted my attention. Suddenly, the intensity was getting less; the sun was coming up, all the clouds were a vivid pink, this light still remaining.

This light could hardly be seen. I had a strange desire to follow it up and put it where it went until it disappeared to observe it more. Unfortunately, the sky as filling up with morning light, so I could no longer see it.

Perhaps it was a reflection of something catching the rays of the sun, or perhaps it was an artificial object reflecting the sun's rays, or perhaps the light itself was artificial. But I watched this thing disappear into the sky at a much more rapid rate than the sun was rising. And twice during the time I observed it, it underwent a very rapid increase of brightness until they were too far in the distance to be seen.

Here are some notes from my notes taken at the time: we were told by two independent people and on questioning, unbelievable. The opinion carried by the assistant knows something, so it is intelligent. A spaceship carrying two glowing lights side by side was observed through 7x50 binoculars. We do not have such ships and those quoted the lights disappearing about 6:30, some ten minutes after the lights disappeared in the distance.
