The U.S.D.F. and I we just came out of the house and saw to our south east, hovering in the air, a round whitish object, with an over all brightness approximately 3-4 times brighter than a star. This object was stationary for about 30 minutes. Then it moved off at a great speed to the southwest and disappeared from sight.
