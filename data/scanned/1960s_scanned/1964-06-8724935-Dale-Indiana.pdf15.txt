TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

Dear Bill:

During the past week I have been very much concerned and upset because I learned last night from neighbors that fireworks were set off by some youngsters in part of the entertainment they provided for neighborhood guests--this is in the social news in the Dale Herald).

I don't know what kind of fireworks, but I seen some rocket-types that could very well have landed from that "pad" in the back yard; that also explains the noise loud enough to startle me for a moment.

Sgt. Trooper Frank J. Cook is interested--he's had some dealings with young people. 
(Incidentally, a justice of the peace or a justice of Carter Township--my old Kentucky friend, Saddler, said "Mother, why don't you call Oven like other mother's, and I've got a pipeline to the Chief of Police. You see, mother's department is very helpful in cases of instant news.)

In other developments, Police Chief Hughes' letter yesterday from Miller is very interesting which may interest you.

Sincerely,
