Gentlemen:

We would appreciate your help in identifying an object we observed in the sky Friday, July 25 at about 11:30 P.M. We think it must have been a weather balloon but we are puzzled about the direction it was moving.

My husband and I were observing stars in an open field along Route 948 between Johnsonburg and Ridgway Pennsylvania. There had been heavy showers earlier in the evening, but at the time, the moon was shining and overhead some of the larger stars were visible. The object appeared after our attention was drawn to the north, just below the horizon. It appeared spherical, shining with a steady, blue-white light. It was larger than any satellites we have watched and its apparent speed was faster. 

It moved silently towards the west at the altitude of Arcturus, then turned to the south until we lost sight of it in the light of the moon. When it disappeared, it was heading south. During its course, it made several slight, sudden changes in direction without changing its speed. We have not seen it again although we have returned to the same spot at about the same time of night a number of times.
