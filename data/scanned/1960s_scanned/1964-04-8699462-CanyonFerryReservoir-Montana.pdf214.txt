CENSORSHIP AND UFOs
Article by Major Donald E. Keyhoe
USMC (Ret) - True Magazine - January, 1964

On April 8, 1964, the NASA launched from Cape Kennedy the Gemini 1 capsule. The capsule was to be an unmanned test of the orbit around the earth, and was declared a complete success.

But there are some strange things about this successful flight, which are not generally known to the public confidentially by two witnesses present at the test. The Gemini 1 Capsule was still in its first orbit when four strange objects, originating from the unknown or unknown origin, flew up to the capsule and paced their course in amazement as the capsule had its four successful orbits.

The two witnesses, who are well-known persons, described this sighting in confidence. They drew closer to the capsule and paced it for about two minutes. Suddenly, the four objects shot away at tremendous speed and vanished into the unknown.

Major Keyhoe asks: "What were these four mysterious space travelers? Where had they come from? What was their mission? The beings, were at the controls of these strange craft, and I could answer none of their questions and I would not be surprised to find that the beings inside the craft were as astounded at the presence of the capsule as we were at their sudden appearance, and their disappearance was just as dramatic."

The general public is unaware of facts such as these that happen many times over near pocket test ranges. Satellite tracking confirms that serious alien craft are watching our outer space efforts. The public also believes that the aerial wave of UFOs have been an invasion. The Air Force is completely aware that more serious alien craft are watching our outer space efforts. The public also believes that the aerial wave of UFOs have been an illusion, whereas facts disclose that the real wave of UFOs have not been an illusion.
