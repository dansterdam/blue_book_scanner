The image contains a compass rose diagram and two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a hand-drawn diagram of the position of a UFO sighting, with instructions to place an "X" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen and connect it to lines indicating the direction of movement. The smaller sketch appears to be a hand-drawn depiction of a landscape with a figure in the foreground.
