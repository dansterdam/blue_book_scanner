FLYING OBJECT OR UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON

Into a shallow bay and lighted by an official light, the object hovered or "stood still" for several minutes, according to the report. The object was oval or circular in shape, a metallic color with a shiny, glassy surface, and it appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object made no noise as to the sighting and were in accordance with the details contained in the official report submitted by the U.S. Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, which was the responsible military agency for this area.

It had one main spherical portion and fins or protrusions from the rear section. The object was seen to occasionally wobble or oscillate on its axis. An individual, who was an American citizen, had previously been an employee of the U.S. Government and was at that time engaged in a civil capacity, reported the sighting. He was one of his charter party, and this person was an individual, who was well-qualified as an observer and who had had considerable experience in observing aerial phenomena.

6. On 9 Aug 1950, the military installation had an attendance at the Standard Oil Service Station that had recently been established nearby. The individuals were customers of the service station, and it was quite evident that they had seen some sort of aerial object, since they were in an excited and agitated condition, and their story was substantially the same as that contained in the official report.

7. On 10 Aug 1950, the individual who had made the original report visited the scene of the sighting. He could find no evidence of any physical disturbance, such as broken branches, disturbed foliage, or other indications that something had landed in the immediate area.
