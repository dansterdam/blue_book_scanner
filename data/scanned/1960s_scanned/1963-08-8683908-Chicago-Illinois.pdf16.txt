27. In the following sketch, imagine that you had seen the object or objects appearing at a certain line (in the sky) when you first saw it. Place the objects in this line, high or low, and show how they changed position (dotted line) when you last saw the object(s). These are called plots of the sightings.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, or track, of the object or objects, and show any change in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were travelling.
