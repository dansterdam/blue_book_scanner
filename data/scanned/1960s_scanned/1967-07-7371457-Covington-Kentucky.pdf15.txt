Transcribing the text from the document:

HAD JUST LEFT MY GRANDPARENTS WHO LIVE ON A FARM AND I MUST LOOK AT THE STARS FOR A FEW MOMENTS, AND A THING APPEARED IN THE SKY FOR A FEW MINUTES AND HAVE YELLOWISH OR REDDISH COLORS, AND WE NOTICED IT TO BE A PLANE IN THE WESTERN SKY NEAR HORIZON. IT WAS ABOUT 15 MINUTES BUT AS I WANT TO SEE THE PLANET WE HAD JUST BEEN WATCHING COME OUT I DID NOT PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. AS I WAS LOOKING HIGH IN THE SKY SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE SKY AND I WILL REMEMBER IT AS LONG AS I LIVE. SUDDENLY THIS MAY BE AN ILLUSION SOMETHING ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE FEET LONG AND MAY BE ABOUT TWO FEET WIDE AND AS NEAR AS I CAN REMEMBER IT WAS WHITE AS NEAR AS I CAN REMEMBER AND MAY HAVE BEEN ASTRAY FROM ANOTHER PLANET AND AVERAGE SIZE THAT IS SO SMALL IT WOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED IF IT HAD NOT MOVED. HOWEVER, IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A REFLECTION IN ANY WAY. LET ANYONE WAGERING MY HEAT GENTLY TO CATCH THE STAR, OF COURSE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO, BUT I WAS OBSERVING IT CLOSELY AND THOUGHT IT APPEARED TO GO OUT LIKE BLOWING OUT A CANDLE AND DISAPPEARED BEFORE MY EYES.
