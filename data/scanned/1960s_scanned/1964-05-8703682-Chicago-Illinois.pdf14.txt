The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with handwritten text.

I think it was extremely honest and conscientious of you to have mentioned the fact that the lights you observed are examining all possibilities and that you will accept a normal but unusual explanation as a matter of fact. In favor of getting some precise information to add to our files, I would be appreciative if you would be so kind as to let me know how many people were involved in observing the lights, how long the observation period lasted, and whether any unusual physical effects were noticed, such as interference with radio or TV reception. Any little item which might well be the clue to the entire phenomenon would be most helpful.

Another thing about the images is that they haven't yet figured how to recreate them. The pattern they sometimes see on radar has never been successfully reproduced electronically. We've had the same motion that you described across the field and in typical visual reports, but trying to have it electronically reproduced on radar has not been successful. We don't know whether this represents an actual phenomenon or just a peculiar electronic response.

Sincerely yours,
