MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subject: UFO Sighting, 24 Oct 63, Minot AFB
On 29 October 1963, at 0945, Lt Warren called Minot AFB and asked for Col Verlich. It seems that Col Verlich is flying this morning so I talked to Mr ____ who said that he thought that Col Verlich had prepared the UFO report and it was either sent out this morning or would be sent out today.
