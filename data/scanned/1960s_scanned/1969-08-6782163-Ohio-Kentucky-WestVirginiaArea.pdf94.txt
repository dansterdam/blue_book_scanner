The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with a handwritten diagram and text.

The text in the document reads:

AS THE "EXPLOSION" REACHED MAX. DEPRESSION, TOTAL DURATION ABOUT 5-6 SECONDS. TRAILING DEBRIS EXTENDED SOMEWHAT AFTER OBSERVATION FROM POSITION ABOUT 1/2 MILE AWAY DURATION APPROX. 6-7 MINUTES. THE OBJECT WAS CYLINDRICAL.

TO WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT, AND THE ANGULAR WIDTH WOULD BE ABOUT THAT MUCH. DID THIS MATCH THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE OBJECT? YES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT MUCH.

ANY 5-57 INDICA TION WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE FLASH.
