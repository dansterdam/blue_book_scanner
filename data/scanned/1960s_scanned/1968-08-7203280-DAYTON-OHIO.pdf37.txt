The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The larger sketch on the top appears to be a compass with multiple directional arrows, while the two smaller sketches at the bottom depict horizon and landscape scenes.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "P" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, AT THE TOP, INDICATE THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON (ALTITUDE, ANGULAR SIZE, ETC.) USING A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE OBSERVATION. AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
