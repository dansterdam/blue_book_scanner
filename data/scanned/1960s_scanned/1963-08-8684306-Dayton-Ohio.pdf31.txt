WALES: 
Bank manager's sighting

The revival of interest in flying saucers has caused the manager of a Welsh bank to report his experience. The witness, who is a bank manager, was walking home after closing the bank when he saw what appeared to be a bright light moving in the sky. He stared at it for a moment and it suddenly stopped. He then saw that the object was round and white, and it seemed to be about 2,000 and 3,000 feet in altitude. It remained stationary for about five minutes and then moved off at a tremendous speed. The witness called the police and reported what he had seen. The police contacted the local army authorities, but they could find no trace of any aircraft in the area at that time. The witness is quite confident of the reality of what he saw and the local police take his report seriously. The witness has no history of any imaginative tendencies and appears to be a completely reliable informant. His experience is one of the few well-authenticated cases involving a bank manager. Mrs. Evans, the manager's wife, also saw the object and she told the police that he reports that only too often strange things in the sky. One of the most perplexing aspects of this case is the apparent absence of aircraft in the area at the time, since the sighting took place near an airfield. However, there was nothing to suggest any hoax or hallucination, and the witness appeared to be thoroughly convinced of the reality of what he had seen.
