The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to objects with which you are familiar? As large as a star, as large as a house? Except round.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time, about 1/6 would be covered by the match's head.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It vanished without leaving a trail behind it.

24. In order that you can give us a clear picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the motion of the object or objects which you observed in the sky. Would give the same appearance as the object which were to move at a terrific speed, at an altitude a little less than the average airplane could fly to a viewer to be about the size of an electric light, then would approximately look like the object that was seen.
