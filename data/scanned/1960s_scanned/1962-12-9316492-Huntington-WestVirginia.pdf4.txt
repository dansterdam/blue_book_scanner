The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report.

Observation time: About 4:30 A.M. Motion-less for the first few minutes - not more than 5 minutes. In observation for a few minutes, object was observed stationary. Disappeared on the South and East of the flight line.

Observation point: An east window, top floor, main office building Huntington offices of the H.K.Porter Co. Inc. - North-East sector of Huntington, W.Va.

Note the U.F.O. was too far away to see either tail, superstructure or vapor trail. It was visible only as a point of light which so much resembled a star I first thought it to be one.

Sincerely,
Huntington 1, W.Va.
