There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Air Force document, likely related to Project Blue Book, containing textual information about the launch of space vehicles.

AS THE MISSILE LAUNCHES HIGHER INTO SPACE, PARA. THE PERIOD OF
THE DAY IN WHICH THE LAUNCH MAY APPEAR AS AN EXPLOSION IS
USUALLY THE TWILIGHT HOURS BEFORE DAWN OR AFTER SUNSET. AT
THOSE TIMES, THE EARTH'S SHADOW COMBINED WITH THE DENSITY
VARIATION CAUSES REFLECTED RAYS OF SUNLIGHT TO BE VISIBLE
DIFFERENT COLORS. THEN THE EARTH'S SHADOW EXTENDS TO THE RANGE
OF SPACE WHERE THE EXPANSION OF EXHAUST GASES IS MOST RAPID.
PARA. THE EXHAUST TRAIL IS VISIBLE IN EVERY SPACE VEHICLE
WHERE COMBUSTION IS INCOMPLETE. THE STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND
TITAN II 1C3M IS THE ONLY EXCEPTION, SINCE IT HAS ALMOST
COMPLETE COMBUSTION. UNQUOTE. THE ADDITION OF THIS RELEASE
OPTION AND THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR USE IN ANSWER TO
QUERY SHOULD GREATLY LESSEN FUTURE PROBLEMS DURING EVENING
AND PRE-DAWN LAUNCHES.
