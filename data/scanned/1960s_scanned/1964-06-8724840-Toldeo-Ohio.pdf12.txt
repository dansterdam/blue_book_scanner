18 February 1955

Private *** Company G 
Fourth TNG Regiment
Second Platoon
Fort Dix, New Jersey 08640

Dear Private ***,

Thank you for your recent letter. I hope you are still alive despite your rigorous training, and that before I will get the photographs as mentioned in your letter, where the sighting occurred and also the pictures you made concerning about the latter times.

The pictures will, in any case, be helpful to get the location well in hand. I assess with your about the time of the sighting, but I am still puzzled about the fact that the red light apparently blinked in synchronism with the blinking lights or on the towers, or whatever they were.

The very best of luck to you in your boot training and please don't forget the pictures as soon as you get them.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
