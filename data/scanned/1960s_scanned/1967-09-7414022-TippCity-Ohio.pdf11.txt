MEMO FOR THE RECORD
9 Oct. 1967

Nicholas Meslonick (works somewhere on base says he has additional information on both the 20 Sept. 1967 Tipp City case and the March 67 Lebanon (Ohio) sightings. However he would not reveal this info. to the case officer unless Gen. Gerrity and Gen. Goldsworthy were present. We were unable to meet these conditions so he left.
