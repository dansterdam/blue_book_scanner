UFO FLITS OVER WYOMING

Rock Springs, Wyoming, April 29 - A high-flying disc was seen in the western sky by a group of students, another student, a junior high school teacher named Richard Surline, and another man named Keith Boyes.

The first group of students observed the object as it appeared to turn and present a flat side and edge. A glow emanated from the sides.

Surline reported the object to be a black discolored disc, first seen at a distance but apparently got brighter and nearer. 

Mr. Keith Boyes phoned Surline at about 12:30 p.m. to determine if the latter had seen the same object. Surline continued to observe the object until 2:30 p.m. The second group described the object as wobbling, turning, and of a green color that turned to silver. Presumably it was visible during the entire afternoon and early evening. It was last reported moving eastward with occasional disappearance behind a cloud.
