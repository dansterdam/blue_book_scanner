"On Aug. 13 Major White wit a new shuttle recovered from desert which were "discovered" that day. Passed to the Prime Club for study. It appears small oval shape, metallic white, but faintly transparent as if plexiglass. He had become the first man to recover such material.

In Dec., 1960 he reached an altitude of 95,000 feet in the X-15 rocket, then known as the most exclusive club in Air Force history. There were 13 charter members.

On Aug. 13, 1962 he reached am altitude of 66,500 feet in the X-15, breaking the previous record set in 1961 by Joe Walker at 67,600 feet.

The X-15 project was a special Air Force program involving the U.S. space research program and the development of boost glide vehicles to travel at very high speeds and altitudes. The flight of Aug. 13, 1962 brought the space flight speed record to an average of 3,591.4 m.p.h. (5,600 k.p.h).
