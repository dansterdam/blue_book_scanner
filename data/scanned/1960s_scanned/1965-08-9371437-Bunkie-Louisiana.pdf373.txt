Dear Mr. ,

The report you mention sounds very interesting. I will radio the man who conducted the investigation and see if we can help you. The observatory is as yet unable to determine the exact nature of this phenomenon, and we cannot be certain of any identifications. However, I appreciate your interest, and we will do what we can to assist you.

Sincerely,

Leon Hall
Associate Director
