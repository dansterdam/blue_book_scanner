Disgruntled Person
Wold-borg Air Force Base
Ohio, USA

Gentlemen:

I am in the Air Reserve, 84 Comm (IRAS) USAF, and am at present rolling in a course of astronomy at the Adler Planetarium. A course of modern astronomy. Since astronomy has always been of interest to me and since I have considered joining the Air Force Space Command, I hope what I have to say here is not taken as lighthearted as some letters I am sure you have received.

In regard to Sputnik IV, I may have seen the disintegration within twelve hours of its predicted eclipse.

In regard to Discoverer XI and capsules, I may have seen it landed to be quite different from that of Discoverer VI, or what I would surmise to have been capsules of Discoverers VII and VIII. However, I wouldn't want to write you another letter concerning what might appear to be my own opinions or conclusions. These may be appreciated and in such a case would do my utmost, being observant, very careful, and possibly of assistance.
