Hq USAF SAFOICC (Mrs. Hunt)
The A-2 Section note that the reports being underfillials and identify that the UFO sightings evaluated as related in C-21 Report #7 and subsequently classified as "F", indicating that the UFO sightings evapured would not indicate that the UFOs sighted were other than that described in Report R2, would inconsistent with the analysis and evaluation given in the subject report and would give the visual characteristics as described in paragraph 19 or 75.
It is suggested that a fact sheet be attached to explain the previous Air Force position on unidentified rlight objects.
