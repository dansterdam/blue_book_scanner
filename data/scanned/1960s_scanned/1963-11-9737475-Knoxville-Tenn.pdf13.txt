There are important omissions among them several that would give the impression of more actual atomic data and nuclear evidence.
This brief book is a worthwhile summary of the subject field. The theoretical and experimental features of certain complex photochemical processes are adequately discussed.
The book covers the scope of this field as it has developed to the present. A point of introduction to the field of electrochemistry.
The modern methods. Other related fields, as for example, certain aspects of the topic of molecular structure, are touched upon. The author gives a critical discussion both of the strengths and limitations of certain methods, highlighting their advantages and short-comings.
The discussion of the scope of the field is, in the reviewer's opinion, a most useful and stimulating one.
One of the talented volumes, as a chemically-oriented scientist is open to see to some of the important applications of electrochemistry.
The equation for the mean ionic size is:
-log x = 0.50 - 0.30 y
which has been widely used. The author now modifies this equation by introducing a correction factor to the linear term, a modification that he shows on the consideration of the experimental data slightly improves the fit.
Approximately 45-50 papers published in 1960 and 1961 are reviewed critically and carefully compared with the present one. Although the terms of this book differ from many standard works in this field, it is a valuable and readable addition to the literature.
