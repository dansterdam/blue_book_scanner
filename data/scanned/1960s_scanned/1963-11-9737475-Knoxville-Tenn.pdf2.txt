Flower and Cook Observatory
December 12, 1963

Dear Sir:

To your brilliant observational reports, allow me to add my sincere thanks and appreciation. On the same occasion, may I request that you give your careful consideration to the enclosed material.

Former - have come in one of the oldest cities of the State to compute the "Sighting data" for what we call the "brilliant objects" observed in the skies.

I should be most grateful if you would be kind enough to send the reports of these sightings, so that I can add them to our records. Any reports you can send me will be appreciated.

Very truly yours,
Charles P. Oliver
Director, Flower Astronomical Observatory
University of Pennsylvania
