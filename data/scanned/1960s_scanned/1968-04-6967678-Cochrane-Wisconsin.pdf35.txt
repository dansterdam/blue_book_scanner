because you see, people are reluctant to talk, and there are no good photographs, or very, very few, and it's a very tricky subject, and the only way we'll get anyplace is by talking to as many people who have had this experience, and seeing what patterns there are, seeing what things hang together, what things arethe same and what things are different and so forth, and so you really will be helping us if you do this.
