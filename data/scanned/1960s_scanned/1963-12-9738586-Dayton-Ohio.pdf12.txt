The image contains two illustrations. The first illustration is a sketch showing a horizon with angular measurements from 0 to 90 degrees, and a diagram of an object positioned above the horizon. The second illustration is a compass rose.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "Z" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
