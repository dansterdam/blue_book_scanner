Dear Sirs! April 4, 1964

I want to report to you a flying saucer which I have seen in County Darmstadt near Frankfurt (Germany). The object seemed to me to have been in the air from the 20th March to the 25th. But perhaps it was the 20th March and the 25th. It was clear that it was the 20th March and I observed this object with my 12x50 binoculars. The surrounding area was full of wood and meadows, but on some nights she was a little in back of me. Not much time passed to wax and wane. I followed it move a couple of seconds, then it gained speed.
