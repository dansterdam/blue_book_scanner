EVALUATION:

1. INTERIM STATEMENT - PRELIMINARY. Intraproject Evaluation: The data collected provides an interesting account, however, additional data would be required to resolve whether or not this was a legitimate UFO sighting.

2. PROBABLE CAUSE: The object(s) seen were possibly: 1. Conventional aircraft which appeared unusual due to weather conditions or other factors. 2. Misidentification of known objects.

The sighting was exceptionally circumstantial and lacking in physical evidence. While the observer appears to be sincere, more data is required to determine the true nature of the sighting.
