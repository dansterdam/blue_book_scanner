It has always been one of my privileges and pleasures to watch the skies especially after dark - in fact, I have been up at times as late as 4 o'clock just to see if I might see some of the sights predicted by our daily news-papers and by those I have observed many things not seen by others. One evening I observed this satellite the western sky at about 9:40 and I watched it until it disappeared in the north eastern sky about 2 hours later. I noticed the same performance and again at about 12 - it appeared a few minutes later on each orbit. This occurred with some regularity for more than a week - I called the attention of some of my neighbors to this. while particular light, this satellite performed as usual until it went over the top of the building, at which time we went out until the front or the building to continue our observation. Instead of continuing in it's usual path, it began turning toward the south.
