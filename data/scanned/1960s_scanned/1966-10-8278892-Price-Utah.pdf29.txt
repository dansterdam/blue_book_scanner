UFO Seen Over Price

Reports of UFOs (unidentified flying objects) are not confined to Wasatch Front areas. Such sightings also have been reported in the Price Area.

Mrs. Ann Anella, who lives a mile southeast of Price, reported seeing a lighted object in the air first on Sept. 1, then again on Sept. 22. She reports the object, appearing to be like a shining light, was traveling southward.
