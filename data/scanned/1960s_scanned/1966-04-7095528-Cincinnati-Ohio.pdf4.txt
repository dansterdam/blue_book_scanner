Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I was sighted at first - because of the Dime to sighting in Michigan, Paul was with me therefore there was a fairly clear view of the object, and continuing the early rays of the dawn however, the object appeared to - then move in position for about 30 minutes at first - then at many places seemed to be a point of light. Many things went through my mind - - that it was the planet, the sun rise enough to show the object go up - I have the object at home the only one I can show is a film taken of it.

If the UFP could afford another stamp - I would appreciate your explanation.

Very sincerely,
