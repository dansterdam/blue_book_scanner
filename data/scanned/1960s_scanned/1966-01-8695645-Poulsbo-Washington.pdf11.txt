There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. 

The text on the page reads:

"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5 year, 1 month
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

D. I saw not the exact aircraft, but believe it to have been of a conventional type, about the size of a dc-3 or similar sized transport. Some may be of a physical nature. I never did see it take off or depart the area. It remained in view and seemed to slowly descend below the foliage up to about 15 minutes when it was no longer visible. It appeared to be of a metalic[sic] color but not highly reflective. There was no smoke, vapor trail, or any other outward signs of propulsion. It simply appeared to lower itself down and out of sight.

I have only sorry I cant tell more, but that is about the way I saw it. Any other detail would be just guessing on my part."
