Text from the document:

Some of what was at first of little consequence now appears to be very significant, when seen in the light of other data which has come to light. It is significant that the report states that the object passed close over the car in which the observers were travelling, and that it appeared to be following or pursuing the car. This suggests the possibility that the object may have been deliberately tracking or observing the car and its occupants. The fact that the object executed a "sweeping arc" and then returned to the point where it had first been observed also suggests that it may have been intentionally manoeuvring in order to observe or monitor the car and its occupants. The report also notes that the object was seen on two separate occasions, with the second observation occurring some time after the first. This raises the possibility that the object may have been conducting some form of extended surveillance or monitoring of the area or the car and its occupants over a period of time.
