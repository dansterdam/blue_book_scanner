WEEKLY MAP
JULY 21-27, 1969

This is a continuation of a weekly series of maps showing the stations participating in the Surface Weather Map program, and the stations for 7-12 Mc tropospheric and VHF/UHF propagation studies. 

The stations are located across the United States and are used in these studies to provide data on tropospheric and VHF/UHF propagation conditions. The data collected is used to identify areas of best or worst propagation.

The information includes the station location and call sign, the frequency used, the type of equipment, the transmitter power, antenna type and gain, and height above ground. The time of transmission, propagation mode, and frequency bands are also indicated. 

Reports that are printed are a summary of the information collected from the stations participating in the program.
