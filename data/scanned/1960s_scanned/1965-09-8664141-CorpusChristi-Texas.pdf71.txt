Nightness car ride near Warmister, England

The writer, 12, with three others (names given) were driving from Bristol to Warminster when they saw an object in the sky. The writer describes this object as "one of the most amazing things I have ever seen." It appeared to be a large, glowing object, bright enough to light up the whole countryside around them, and it was moving very slowly across the sky. It finally descended rapidly, passed just over their car at a height estimated at about 100 feet, and then shot up into the air again at tremendous speed.

After these maneuvers it had disappeared completely, and they could see nothing further. It was reported that 30-40 people also saw the object and reacted in much the same manner - some were quite frightened by it. It was watched for about 5 minutes, and during this period the 1,000 car speedometer registered absolutely no movement, although the car was running.
