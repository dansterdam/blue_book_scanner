SUMMARY OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA

1. At approximately 1735 hours, 7 April 1967, the reporting witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, observed an unidentified aerial object in the vicinity of Newburgh, New York. The object was described as being metallic in appearance, circular in shape, and approximately 40-50 feet in diameter.

2. The object was observed to make several rapid changes in direction and altitude, at one point descending to an estimated altitude of 300-400 feet above the ground before climbing rapidly and disappearing from view.

3. No sound was reported to be associated with the object. The reporting witness was able to observe the object for approximately 5-7 minutes before it finally disappeared.

4. Several attempts were made to obtain photographic evidence of the object, however none of the photographs taken were of sufficient quality to be considered conclusive.

5. The sighting was reported to the United States Air Force, and the case was investigated by Project Blue Book. After review, the case was classified as "unidentified" due to the lack of conclusive evidence.
