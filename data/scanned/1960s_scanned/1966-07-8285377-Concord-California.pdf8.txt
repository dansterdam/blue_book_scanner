There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 15 January 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point of interrogation or a narrative exposition of your statement:
To the nearest eye it appear that a tall - fairly light colored object with a circular or at least rounded shape of considerable size was observed in the sky in the late afternoon while performing ordinary household chores. It was moving rapidly across the sky in a horizontal direction, maintaining its shape and size in a steady fashion untill briefly seen by another person in the near vicinity. No sounds were heard and no visible efforts were made to affect the object or determine its nature and origin. Some consideration is shown about the event leading to the discovery of definite conclusions as to what has been observed other than for general speculation and theorizing on the subject of unidentified flying objects.
