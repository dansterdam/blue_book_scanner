Dear Sirs:

In the course of a conversation the other day, a person mentioned the sighting of an unidentified flying object to me. Since I do have a rather large interest in this field, I interviewed the person who was involved in the sighting. I thought you might be interested in his answers to several questions which I put to him.

Question #1 was—What were the conditions under which you saw the object in the sky? The answer was that it was a clear night with a few clouds. "It was about 5:30 p.m. when I first spotted the object in the sky. It seemed to be shining as from the reflected light of the sun. It had a fantastic speed. As it reached the southwestern horizon, it suddenly, four pink objects shot out of it, one to each point of the compass. The pink objects were going at a fantastic rate of speed. As the white object continued to descend, it stopped 30° above the horizon."

Question #2 was—Did anything occur when the object stopped?
Answer was—"The object changed color from reddish-pink, to green, to yellow-orange."

Question #3 was—Next, what happened?
Answer was that the object kept changing colors and then suddenly disappeared.

Question #4 was— Was there any noise or sound that caught your attention? Answer was negative.
