WESTERN WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE
BELLINGHAM, WASHINGTON

August 6, 1965

Dear Sir:

On Friday evening, July 30, 1965 between 13.00 and 13.15 pm
I was driving home and saw a lighted, moving object moving very fast across the sky. It went at the house and I saw it and watched it move southerly. It was almost a plate like form. It was extremely high, I may be slightly off in my estimation of the time, but I am wondering you have any information regarding a flight of a satellite or something that may have been visible that evening.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
