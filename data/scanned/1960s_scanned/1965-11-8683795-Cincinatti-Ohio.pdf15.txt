A. General Review
This investigator interviewed the principals on the evening of 24 November 1965 from approximately 7:30 p.m. to approximately 8:30 p.m., in the presence of the father of Miss Guest, Mr. Gordon Guest.

Prior to my interview, both girls were in possession of NICAP report forms (short form) and had partially completed them.

In questioning, I was impressed to individually question the girls, and in view of their prior work on the report forms, I deemed it meaningless to do so.

Questioning revealed that at least one of the girls (Miss Guest) heard one or more of the significant radio-type sounds described in prior press reports in the Boston Herald pertaining to the Hill case.

During the questioning and subsequent discussion, various discrepancies appeared in the answers from each girl, and there was an inability to get a mutually satisfactory answer which would formulate a clear answer to which was usually seconded by the other.

The most important variances in verbal answers with written answers are as follows:

1. Distance: (Written reports not completed) Neither girl had the slightest conception of distance. Answers over the questioning period ranged from "a few hundred feet" to "eight to ten miles".

2. Size: (Written reports not completed) Both girls agreed that the object was the "size of a helicopter", "about the size of a halfmoon", yet neither could approximate a more reasonable comparison.
