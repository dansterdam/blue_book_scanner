Unidentified Phenomena/object (blank)
3 OCT 1960

1. Reference copy of attached letter to Lt Col L. Tacker from:

2. The ATIC analysis of (...) a report of an unidentified flying object observed on 15 August 1960, reveals that the objects were probably aircraft. These objects were reported to have appeared to have lights on them and to have been maneuvering. It is generally believed that the lights observed were a normal phenomenon associated with aircraft in flight in that particular area of the southwest. It is quite possible that these objects were two high altitude aircraft which were conducting aerial refueling operations and were seen in conjunction with the satellite which had precessed orbits.

3. It is possible to conclude the high flying aircraft and not something from space. The witness did not receive the outline of a span or wing with binoculars on a dark night. Due to the relativity bright trailing running lights, it is impossible to determine if they were attached to the aircraft itself. 

4. Due to the great amount of traffic through the area, it is impossible to determine the specific aircraft which were observed.

5. "Recommend we send you a copy of the statistics from 1...9 through Jun 1960, and print a copy of the "Noted Cases" per your request."
