There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this document. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains only text.

Here is the text from the document:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - seemed to be a buzzing whirring sound, quite loud 
b. Color - dull silver or gray in color

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match or pencil at arm's length in line with the object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object could have been covered by the match head?
about 1/2 to 3/4
