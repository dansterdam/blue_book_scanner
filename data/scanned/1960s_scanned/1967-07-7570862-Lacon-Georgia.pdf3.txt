MACON, GEORGIA 11 JULY, 1967
The current evaluation of "possible aircraft" is open to severe
criticism because:

"Thought it was a falling star at first--then leveled off."
No planes were in the vicinity during time of both sightings.
(0025 and 0135 hours--).
Four planes landed at Robbins at 0959, 0101, 0103, 0118 hours--thus not at above times.
Description of "blue-white glow" does not fit aircraft evaluation.
Also, witness fairly sure it wasn't an aircraft.
Therefore, in absence of supporting information, I could not go along with only "possible aircraft." "Possible unknown" should also be included (a possible unidentified).
