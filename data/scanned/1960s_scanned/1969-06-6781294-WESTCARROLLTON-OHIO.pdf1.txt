The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report form. The form includes details such as the date, time, location (West Carrollton, Ohio), source (civilian), number of objects observed (one), type of observation (ground-visual), and physical evidence (none). The form also includes a "Brief Summary and Analysis" section, but the text in that section is obscured and not legible.
