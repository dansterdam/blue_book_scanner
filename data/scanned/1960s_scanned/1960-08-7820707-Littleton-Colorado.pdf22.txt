5-WAY ASSAULT ON SPACE
U.S. SCIENTISTS RIP PAGE FROM SCIENCE FICTION

CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA. - (UPI) - America's space scientists
scored a new record yesterday in an historic milestone on space conquest. With the blast off of a 150-mile-a-minute rocket carrier, President Eisenhower's administrative team sent U.S. science a big step forward toward mastery of the heavens.

ANNOUNCED THAT a fresh cargo of the latest additions to the earth's artificial satellites—Discoverer XIII—in orbit they plan to send a radio signal back, possibly within a month.

Just as the Air Force test pilot Shepard shot up 115 miles to the world's altitude record of 115,700 feet last week, the U.S. scientists yesterday scored the biggest day in space science.

Fired an Atlas Intercontinental ballistic missile carrying a nation of radio-dispersal-experiment sensors into space. It can be seen by nearly every nation, including Russia, from over 15,000 miles per hour. 

After more technical troubles that threatened to postpone the experiment, the satellite WHICH WAS SENT INTO ORBIT FOR RUSSIA - was sent into orbit around the earth. The coast-to-coast experiment WHICH BOOSTED THE PRESIDENT'S Satellite-Discoverer XIII-in to space showed Echo's feasibility as the anchor to a global communications network.

SERIES OF Echo-type satellites could mark a new phase in world-wide television and almost instantaneous world-wide radio communi cations.

The successful recovery of the satellite—called Echo by scientists—proved it is America's seventh satellite success, paved the way for the Air Force's announcement that it would fire a thing into orbit soon.
