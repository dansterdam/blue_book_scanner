The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with a series of questions and instructions for the observer.

Text extracted from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object. The amount of the object covered by the match stick will give the angular size of the sighting. If you had performed this, how much of the object would have been covered by the match stick head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words any object or objects which, when pieced up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw. Avoid using such technical terms as "spherical" or "saucer-like" - tell it exactly as you saw it. Take a little time to think this through carefully.
