Sirs,
On May 10, 1965 I reported the sighting of a U.F.O. in the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. I was later contacted and told that my letter of 10 May 65 would be forwarded to this office in Washington D.C.
It seems to me that nearly three months is ample time for you to have heard nothing further and I am getting damn impatient.
I was told I may have been sighting a new experimental light in the tall section of an Air Force jet. I would like you have received my original letter some time ago which would give you a fully explained account of my May 9 sighting, will therefore not go into more detail here.
I will be expecting to receive a reply promptly. I hope one, within your limits of comment on such affairs.

Mr. -- Avenue
