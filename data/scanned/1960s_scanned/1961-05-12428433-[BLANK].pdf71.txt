The work of preparing and considering legislation is done largely by committees of both Houses of Congress. The personnel of the Standing Committees of each House is chosen by a vote of the entire body. All bills and resolutions are referred to the appropriate committees, which may report a bill out in its original form, vote against it, or make changes. Legislation to die in committee is excluded from further consideration.
