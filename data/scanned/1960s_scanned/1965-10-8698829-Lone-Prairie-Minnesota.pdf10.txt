There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

"THEY WANTED TO SEE IF THEY COULD STOP MY CAR LIKE THEY DID THEY COULD ONLY DO TO SOME OF THE OTHERS. I FEEL THAT I WAS GETTING UP TO ABOUT 80 M.P.H. WHEN I SUDDENLY NOTICED MY CAR ENGINE STARTING TO SLOW DOWN AND MY CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN. I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK YOU ARE PROBABLY OF THE U.S. A GRAVE CRIME ACT TO LET THEM KNO WHAT HAPPENED ON THE 13 THAT THEY SEEMED TO DEMAND OF ME TO DO 7? IT SEEMED TO ME TO BE AGAIN 1I COULD HARDLY SAY THAT WE LIKE EACH OTHER FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES. THEY THEN TURNED AND THE OBJECT SEEMED TO HOVER THE OBJECT SEEMED TO HOVER SLOWLY. AFTER IT WAS ABOUT A MILE HIGH ( THIS IS ONLY MY IMAGINATION) THE LIGHT WENT OUT AND MY CAR ENGINE STARTED TO RUN DID NOT SEEM TO BOTHER ME. I LOOKED AT MY SPEEDOMETER AND IT HAD BEEN SETTING ON AND ON EVIDENTALLY THAT IT HAD BEEN ON THE GROUND I TOLD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND REPORTED IT. WE WENT BACK OUT TO THE SPOT AND THE SHERIFF. WE COULD NOT FIND ANY THINGS ON THE GROUND THAT WOULD SHOW THAT AN OBJECT HAD BEEN THERE. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. I KNOW WHAT I SAW BUT IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME WELL THATS TOUGH LUCK.

THANK YOU"
