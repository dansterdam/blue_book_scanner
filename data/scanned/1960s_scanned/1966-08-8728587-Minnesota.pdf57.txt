FLOOD OF UFO REPORTS IN STATE
BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
"Unidentified flying objects," green, red, bright blue and bluish-green, were reported in Minnesota and western Wisconsin Tuesday night.
Several pilots reported sighting an object near the Twin Cities. They said it seemed to be "solid, with lights" and then it suddenly "faded away."
A resident of Plum City, Wis., about 50 miles from the Twin Cities, also called to report seeing an object that "seemed to approach him and then just disappeared."
At the Flying Cloud Airport southwest of Minneapolis, several persons reported seeing an object that "looked like a satellite and then faded away."
Donald Cramer of Plymouth, a Minneapolis suburb, said he saw a bright, flashing light in the sky that seemed to be "moving around."
"It was brighter than a star and just flashed on and off," he said. "And then it faded away into nothing."
