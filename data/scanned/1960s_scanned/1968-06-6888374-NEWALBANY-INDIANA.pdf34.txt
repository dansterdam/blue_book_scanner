7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO ACCOMMODATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SCALE AT AS A SAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SKETCH.
