There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report, with a form where a witness has answered some questions. The text on the form can be transcribed as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:             Day             Month             Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

(The rest of the page is blank, with handwritten notes and text obscured by the image quality.)
