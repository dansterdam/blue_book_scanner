W Father Jaliicm 
causes UFO Heports
LONDON, O. — The Rev. John F. Jailison, a Roman Catholic priest in London, 0., has said that he believes many UFO sightings and reports are the result of natural phenomena and are not necessarily "something from outer space."
The priest, who has studied the UFO phenomenon for some time, said that he has found that many sightings can be explained by clouds, meteors, re-entry of spacecraft, and other natural events. He indicated that his studies have led him to the conclusion that only a small number of reported UFO sightings probably have an "extraterrestrial" explanation.
The priest stated that he has found many instances where people have reported seeing unusual objects in the sky which turn out to be natural phenomena that people are not familiar with. He said that some people tend to get overly excited and report these natural events as UFOs.
Father Jaliison said that he has found that many reported UFO sightings occur at night when it is more difficult to identify objects in the sky, and that some sightings may be the result of hoaxes or imagination. He indicated that his studies have led him to believe that great caution should be used in evaluating reported UFO sightings.
