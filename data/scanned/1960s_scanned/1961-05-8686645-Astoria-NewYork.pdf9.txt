Turning to the OCR output of the text in the document:

Considering with subject release of some fragments of platform or object (approximately 4'x3') which was thought to be connected with some classified planes. Examination of parts revealed some information on physical characteristics, type of construction, materials used, manufacturing methods, etc. But no positive identification could be made as to the identity of the object. Possibility of its being remainsof unidentified flying object cannot be ruled out.

In viewing the attached photos between 1200 a.m. and approximately 0300 a.m. object was estimated to be 1 mile or less in size and was estimated to be about 500 feet off the ground. No sound or trail of passage was observed by the watcher. Apparently the object made no landing or take-off run and just disappeared from sight.

Not being mechanically or scientifically trained, hope this data will prove of interest and enable you to evaluate further if required.

Yours very truly,
