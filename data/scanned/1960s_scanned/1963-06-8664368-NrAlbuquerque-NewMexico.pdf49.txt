On the 4th of June 1963, Sheriff Dwyle Lindsay-Smith of Polk County, Minn., with two deputies, Howard Hough and Don Mieialis, KWAM radio reporter, were dispatched in three separate vehicles to investigate a strange multi-colored light which had been reported in the vicinity of Lyle, Minnesota short by after 8 p.m. that evening.

The deputies and the radio reporter chased the strange light which resembled a truck driver as it darted in and out of different vehicles on a rural road near Lyle. Several automobiles in the area also reported seeing a strange multi-colored light which appeared to settle momentarily on some trees near the Iowa border.

Highway patrolman Vernon Nefstead reported in a radio message that while chasing the object at a high rate of speed the light seemed to be guiding them and keeping a fixed distance between the patrol car and the object. When they stopped chasing it, it speeded up and went out of sight. The object was not found later in the vicinity of Lyle but found nothing unusual. Police at Albert Lea, Independence, Cedar Falls and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said they had received similar reports of a strange light in the sky that evening.

An Austin radio station said that after it had broadcast news of the incident, the station received calls from numerous individuals who said they had seen a multicolored light that seemed to descend and ascend in the Lyle area. The aerial phenomenon was also reported by residents of Conger, Hollandale and beyond as far as Brownsdale, Minn.

Wooded areas which would offer concealment were closely scanned.
