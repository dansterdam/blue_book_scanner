JUNE 1962 
EVALUATION BY OFFICE OF TECHNICAL STAFF UAL 11094 13 JULY 1962 CLASSIFIED INTERIM REPORT ON SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS CONCERNING PHENOMENA WITNESSED AT HALLOTT STATION ANTARCTICA DURING THE PERIOD OF 26 JANUARY 1962 THROUGH 4 MARCH 1962
THE STATION WAS MANNED BY A 3-MAN CREW AS FOLLOWS:
CHIEF SCIENTIST - CHARLES P. SMITH 
CHIEF RADIO OPERATOR - RICHARD R. HARRIS
COOK/GENERAL ASSISTANT - JOHN 0. GREENE
AT APPROXIMATELY 00:30 HOURS ON 26 JANUARY 1962, ALL THREE MEN WERE AWAKENED BY A STRANGE NOISE. UPON INVESTIGATION, THEY OBSERVED A LUMINOUS OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER THE STATION. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET IN DIAMETER AND SPHERICAL IN SHAPE. THE OBJECT EMITTED A PULSATING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT AND MADE A LOUD HUMMING NOISE. DURING THE NEXT FEW MINUTES, IT BEGAN TO RISE STEADILY UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THE MEN WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. THEY WERE QUITE SHAKEN BY THE EXPERIENCE AND REPORTED IT TO THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION IMMEDIATELY. OTHER STAFF MEMBERS WERE INFORMED AND CORROBORATED THE ACCOUNT. SINCE THAT TIME, NO FURTHER INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED. HOWEVER, THE MEN HAVE REMAINED VISIBLY NERVOUS AND APPREHENSIVE. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION IS PLANNED.
