11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observer sighted an object which he described as rectangular, 2 ft long and 1 ft wide, which traveled a level path and went from 20 deg elev in the north to 20 deg elev in the south in 5 seconds. Inverted, low flying aircraft. However since the duration was so short and the speed apparently too great and no sound was observed, it is my opinion that it was a meteor.
