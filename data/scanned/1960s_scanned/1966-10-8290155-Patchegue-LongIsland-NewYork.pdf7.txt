At 1509 hours, 21 Oct 66, Major Quintanilla spoke with Al Hein, of Westbury, Long Island, New York. We had a UFO sighting early this morning. A couple of patrolman observed object. I am just trying to get the procedures that are followed. A patrolman spotted the thing in the sky. Sgt and another, all saw it and they in turns reported it to Westhampton AFB. The Air Force people made a check of their own radar installations and FAA radar installations and came up negative and that they would not give their information on to Wright-Patterson. Once we get it we will see what the characteristics are, Major told him. If it looked like an aircraft then we check into aircraft. If it has other characteristics we check into the others. I don't know what they saw so I don't know what I am going to be looking into. Mr Heis said that a photographer took a long lens shot of it. The photo showed a large round and not saucer shaped object. Like a full moon but not fully outline. Seemed to have some type of lights, different colors, and was passage shape. One person who observed the object works for Grumman s/c and was a former navigator and he thought it to be 3 - 4,000 ft alt. Very bright, bigger than a star. He saw an amber light flashing and travelling fast. Noting in an arc. Looked like a tennis ball. Didn't look like any aircraft he had ever observed. The police kept tabs at 0113 and was still in the general location at 0510. Mr. Heis said he has a number of other calls that other people saw it. This thing could be from an advertising firm that had balloons stolen. This place was vandalized and balloons went up over the weekend. They were being filled with lights. Major Quintanilla.
