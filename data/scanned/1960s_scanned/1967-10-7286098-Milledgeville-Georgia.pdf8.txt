TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

I have been working on a small rock quarry with my cousin for the past three years. While working in the quarry on the afternoon of October 7, 1967, at approximately 4:00 p.m., I observed a very unusual sight in the sky that I can best describe as a flying saucer-shaped object. The object was silvery in color and appeared to be rotating as it moved through the sky. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and seemed to be slightly higher than the height of the surrounding hills. The object was visible for approximately 30-45 seconds before it disappeared from view behind some trees. I was surprised and somewhat frightened by what I saw, as I had never observed anything like this before. I immediately told my cousin about what I had seen, and we both watched the skies for the next several minutes, but the object did not reappear. I am certain that what I observed was not an airplane or any other known aircraft. The object moved and behaved in a manner that was entirely inconsistent with conventional aircraft. I have no explanation for what I witnessed, but I am confident that it was an unidentified flying object of some kind.
