VOLUME NINETY-EIGHT 
Keenes Boy Chased Home By 
'Flying Saucer'; Police Called!

BOY GIVEN SEDATION TO 
QUIET HIS TERROR AFTER 
INCIDENT:
A Keenes, Ill., boy was chased home Sunday night by a "flying saucer", police officers said today. 
The whole neighborhood was in a dither about it, they said.
The 12-year-old boy told police the object was about 40 feet wide, sort of glowing, and was after him. He ran for his home, awakened his parents, and the parents called the Fairfield police. 
Patrolmen from the Fairfield police were promptly notified to check the report. They were looking for a "flying saucer" when A deputy sheriff from a nearby county saw it too.
"It came within 100 feet of me," said Ronnie Austin, the deputy sheriff. "It was a bright, brilliant light, almost like a star."
The boy, who was up in the sky as the object passed over, said it seemed to him much bigger than a star. 
"I said to Erville, 'Look there, it's back,' and before I could say anything more, it was gone," Austin reported.
The family was so shaken by the incident that the boy was given a sedation to quiet his terror.
