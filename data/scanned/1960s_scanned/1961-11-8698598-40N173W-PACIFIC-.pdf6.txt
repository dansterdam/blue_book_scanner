No Case (Information Only)

"ANGEL HAIR" IN NEBRASKA: A veiry unidentified flying object streamed across the skies near Chadron, Nebraska, last November 15th, and as it moved overhead small white stringy objects fell from it, drifting slowly like a fine, luminous, cobweb-like substance. After a few minutes the object disappeared from sight and the material on the ground began to disintegrate and disappear. The fibers shrunk, curled up, and seemed to vanish into the atmosphere. The object was shaped somewhat like a cigar and had a glow like a fluorescent light around its outer edge.

The case was investigated by the Air Force and they were unable to determine the nature of the object or the material that fell from it. The witnesses were considered reliable and their story was not doubted. The material that fell was examined and found to be a very thin, almost weightless, cobweb-like substance. When exposed to air, it shrank and disappeared completely, leaving no residue. The fibers were not sticky and did not seem to carry any electrical charge. According to the report, "human hair seems to be the closest earthly substance to compare it with."

The report states that the object was seen by a number of witnesses and the material was collected from the ground. The origin and nature of the "angel hair" remains a mystery.
