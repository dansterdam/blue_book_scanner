The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be an affidavit form from the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, regarding the citing of four moving lights observed on May 21, 1964. The affidavit describes the observer's account of the movement and appearance of the lights, noting that they did not appear to be large and seemed to resemble "feathered out" stars or points of light. The affidavit is sworn and subscribed before a Notary Public on May 26, 1964.

AFFIDAVIT

I have read an affidavit executed this day by concerning the citing of four moving lights on May 21, 1964. The facts stated therein are an accurate description of my own observation on that night.

I would supplement the affidavit by stating that as the last two lights almost converged, the fourth moved to a position apparently vertically above the third. In this respect, as in others, the most striking thing to me about the lights was the seemingly erratic manner in which they moved with respect to each other.

By way of describing the size of the lights, I would also add that the lights were not large, perhaps resembling stars with "feathered out" edges. It appeared that except for the assumed atmospheric condition to which Mrs refers, the lights might have been mere points or dots.

SWORN TO before me and subscribed in my presence this 26th day of May, 1964.
