VERY CLOSE SIGHT-
ING IN NEW JERSEY:  According to a news report dated May 14th, a Meadowbrook, N.J. resident named DeCicco made an unusually detailed sighting of a "flying saucer" while on his way home at 1:30 that morning.  According to the newspaper account, DeCicco first saw the object while driving away from his home, but in a subsequent telephone interview, he said the UFO followed him part of the way home from a bowling alley he had just left.  In either case, the object moved slowly toward him at an altitude of only about 100 feet above the driveway.  It was spherical and glowed with a soft blue light, according to the witness.  It appeared to be about six feet in diameter, and had a ruby red blinking light in its base.  There were no windows nor did it make any sounds.  After passing over his car, it moved off in a northerly direction from his car, finally fading from sight.  A minute or so later the thing "took off in a hurry," just as DeCicco was summoning his wife to see it.
