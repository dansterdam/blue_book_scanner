NO HELP. There seems to be no question that they did have visual contact of some sort of flashing lights for which they could offer no explanation that they considered satisfactory. The project case officer concurs in conclosion that what was observed could not be explained on the basis of any known physical phenomena
EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE:
There are no radar scope photos which indicate unidentified targets. There are no meterological data to include winds, etc. to assist in determining the nature of this report.
