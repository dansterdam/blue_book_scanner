University, or to the Condon committee for careful examination. He said
he would write when he knew what he was going to do with the film.

The investigator advised him that he would suggest to him that he would suggest to blue
Book that copies of the film be made by the Air Force, one negative
being given to Mr.  in return for temporary use of the original
film for evaluation. indicated that he would be happy to comply
with such a request; he cannot afford the cost of prints himself, and
would like to have a negative for lending to those who would like to
make their own copies, rather than risking the original. This of course,
is in the interests of those who want to examine an undamaged original.
Also,  pictures as they stand do not show whether the object
seen was conventional or not. An aircraft, particularly a jet, departing
along a climbing path straight away from the viewer could give the appear-
ance of an oval object, and motion appear to still or move only slightly
for several minutes. The fact that two objects in succession were seen
following similar flight paths suggests military aircraft departing for
patrol, or commercial flights departing one after another from the same
runway under tower control. The only way that these possibilities can
be checked out, other than finding the flights which were at the right
place and at the right time, would be to obtain more detail from the film,
or to perform an experiment in an attempt to reproduce the films with the
same camera, at the same time of day.

Because of the possibility of aircraft as an explanation, the
investigator would place this sighting in the category: 'unknown; possibly
conventional'.
