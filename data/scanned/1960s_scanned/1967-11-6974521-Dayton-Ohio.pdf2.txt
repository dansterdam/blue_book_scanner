The image contains two illustrations. The larger one is a compass rose diagram with various directional labels. The smaller illustrations on the bottom appear to be graphical representations or diagrams related to the phenomenon being described in the text below the compass rose.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "Y" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON AS VIEWED.
