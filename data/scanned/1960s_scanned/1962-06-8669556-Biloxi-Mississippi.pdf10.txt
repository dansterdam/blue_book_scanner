The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document with handwritten text at the top.

Page 10

I cannot read or identify the handwritten text, but I can provide the text exactly as it appears in the image:

"Some time ago a detailed analysis was made of the Algiers incident, there is little left to add to this case. The report has been returned to ATIC for final processing."
