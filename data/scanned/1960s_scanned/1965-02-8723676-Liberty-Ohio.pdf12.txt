Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir,

The sphere that was submitted to the Air Force at Wright-
Patterson AFB, OHIO was tested at the Air Force Materials 
Laboratory. The object is of American origin and its composition
was determined. While production was not induced, it was 
produced; confirmed that the object was of American origin 
and did not exhibit evidence of sponsorship. The sphere 
was returned on 23 Mar 65.

We appreciate your patriotic duty as an American citizen in 
submitting this object to the Air Force for analysis.

Sincerely,

FRED (REDDY)
Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
