Plane trails 'flying saucer' in new report

An unusual sighting of a strange flying object in the Southern Tier devel- oped new angles this week.
Officials at Griffin Air Force Base in Rome said they have confirmed that an unidentified flying object, described as "peculiar," was picked up on radar last Wednesday night. Peter Adshead, an official of the air base, said the base made the report.
"It was just weird," Dr. William Shinn, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University, said. "There is no explanation for it."
Adshead said officials at the base picked up on radar a fast-moving object, and they tried unsuccessfully to contact it by radio. He said the object they tracked was not an airplane, and it was too fast to be a meteorite.
Adshead said the base is keeping files on the incident, but he admitted that "we have no idea what it was."
The sighting occurred about 10:30 p.m. last Wednesday, and the base officials said they ob- served the object for about 15 min- utes before it disappeared.
John Calabria, a city fireman who also is a member of the Broome County Astronomical Society, said he and several neighbors watched a strange object in the sky at the same time as the base's radar had it under observation.
"It didn't have any of the charac- teristics of a plane or a shooting star," Calabria said. "It was very, very bright."
Calabria said the object was visible for about a half-hour, and it did not have any of the normal characteristics of a conventional aircraft.
