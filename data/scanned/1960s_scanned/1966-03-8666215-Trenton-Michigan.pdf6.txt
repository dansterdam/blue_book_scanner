The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch depicts some kind of object or phenomenon, with a label indicating it is "POST TO INCLUDE 3R, d", and other annotations such as "WEST AWAY" and "EAST" along the horizontal axis, as well as "CAME FROM WEST" and "TREES TOPS". The overall shape and elements of the diagram suggest it may be related to a sighting or report of an unidentified aerial phenomenon.
