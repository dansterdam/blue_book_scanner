The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this particular page. 

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can produce the following text found in the document:

Farm outlined in circle. More aerial scars will follow. The impact point was covered with a strip of canvas eight feet long and one foot wide. Believe it is in a circle - but not sure.
