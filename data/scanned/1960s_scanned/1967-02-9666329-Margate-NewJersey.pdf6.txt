The image contains a sketch diagram and text. The sketch diagram shows an aerial view of an object, possibly a UFO, and its motion path. There is a compass rose in the corner.

The text on the page is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved path high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curved path where you lost sight of the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A ONE UFO

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
