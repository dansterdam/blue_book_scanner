The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with text and handwritten responses to various questions.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
The witness has drawn a sketch showing an object moving in an arced path, starting at point "A" and ending at point "B".

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
The witness has provided a handwritten response, but it is not legible enough for me to accurately transcribe.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The witness has provided a handwritten response, but it is not legible enough for me to accurately transcribe.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The witness has provided a handwritten response, stating "Yes, object disappeared".

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The witness has provided a handwritten response, describing the object as "It appeared to be a small, distant, glowing object".
