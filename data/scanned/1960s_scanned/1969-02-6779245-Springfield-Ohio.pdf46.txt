THE CONCLUSION, IS WARRANTING TO ATTRIBUTE THE UFO TO A CONVENTIONAL SOURCE BECEAUSE:

1. WAS FIRST OBSERVED FLYING FROM WEST TO EAST APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT CONTINUED ON THIS COURSE ABOUT 2 MILES AND THEN MADE A SHARP TURN TO THE SOUTH. IT FLEW IN THIS DIRECTION ABOUT 1/2 MILE AND THEN MADE ANOTHER ABRUPT TURN TO THE EAST. IT CONTINUED ON THIS HEADING UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THIS TYPE FLIGHT PATTERN IS NOT CONSIDERED CONVENTIONAL FOR KNOWN AIRCRAFT. 

2. IT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET IN DIAMETER. THIS ALSO IS NOT A SIZE CONSISTENT WITH CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

3. DURING THE PORTION OF THE FLIGHT WHEN IT WAS OBSERVED FLYING FROM WEST TO EAST, THE OBJECT GAVE OFF A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT.

4. DURING THE FLIGHT, IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING AT TIMES AND TO BE TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AT OTHER TIMES. THESE MANEUVERS ARE NOT CONSIDERED CONVENTIONAL FOR KNOWN AIRCRAFT.

IN CONCLUSION, IT IS WARRANTING TO ATTRIBUTE THE UFO TO A CONVENTIONAL SOURCE BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING:

1. THE FLIGHT PATTERN WAS ERRATIC AND NOT CONSISTENT WITH CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
2. THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT WAS LARGER THAN CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
3. THE BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT WITHOUT ASSOCIATED SOUND IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
4. THE HOVERING AND HIGH SPEED MANEUVERS ARE NOT TYPICAL OF KNOWN AIRCRAFT.
