Police Report UFO 
Sighting Caused 
By Burning Logs

Williamstown Police Chief Jr. 
Joseph Callahan reports that 
four unidentified citizens in
formed him about a strange UFO
sighting near the Williamstown
area. The UFO sightings were made
at about 7:30 P.M. on January 22,
1957.

The chief, who did not know
anything about the incident until
the citizens reported it, stated that
the persons were burning logs and
suddenly saw the logs take the
shape of a UFO. The chief explained
that the persons were certain they
were seeing a UFO which hovered
over the area for several minutes.

Reports of the sightings were
made to the chief's office the next
day, January 23, 1957. The persons
reporting the incident are local
citizens of Williamstown and were
at work at the time.

Convinced Object
Was A Real U.F.O.

According to the report of two 
Williamstown citizens, they ob-
served a strange object in the sky
on January 22, 1957 at approxi-
mately 7:30 P.M. These citizens
have been reliable members of the
community for many years and 
appear to be sincere in their report. 
They must have been convinced
that what they saw was a real 
U.F.O. for they took the trouble
to report it to the Williamstown
Police Chief the following day.

The chief stated that the ob-
ject was caused by the burning
logs, but from the description
given by the witnesses, it ap-
peared to be more than just
burning logs. The witnesses stated
that the object was hovering over
the area for several minutes. Why
would burning logs hover in the
sky? This seems rather doubtful.

The citizens reporting this 
incident have been described as
reliable members of the commu-
nity. Therefore, I feel that their
report should be given serious
consideration and not just dis-
missed as being caused by burn-
ing logs.
