A witness reported that the USAF observed a very close object, approximately 10-15 feet in diameter, hovering over the ground at the witness' residence in Naperville, Illinois. The object emitted a bright yellow light that illuminated the surrounding area. The object then moved away rapidly, higher in the air, and disappeared from view.
