The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and an object above the horizon, with instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. The second and third sketches show larger aerial views, with the instructions to place an "A" on the position where the object was when you first saw it, and to draw a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
