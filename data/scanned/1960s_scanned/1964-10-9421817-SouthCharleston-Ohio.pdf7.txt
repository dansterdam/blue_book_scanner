The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an official document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

The text on the document says:

OFFICIAL FILE COPY

[PID (FILM)]
Wilmington, Ohio 45177
29 December 1964

Route Superintendent, Ohio
Dear Sir:

Evaluation of the negative which you submitted to us for analysis on 7 DECEMBER 1964 has been completed.

Photo analysis reveals that the superimposed image was probably caused by a scratch or pin hole in the negative. The scratches or pinholes are probably caused by normal handling, such as plate loading or older removals may have been used on the film clip holder.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
Major, USAF
Chief, Project BLUE BOOK
