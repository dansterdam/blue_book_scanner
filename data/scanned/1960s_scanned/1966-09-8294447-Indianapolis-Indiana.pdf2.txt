The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely related to a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document says:

"UFO REPT.
The boy (about high school age) from Indianapolis, Indiana reported seeing some strange bright lights last Saturday (17 Sep. 66). He called long distance. I mailed a UFO report form to him. 
Indianapolis, Indiana"
