EDWARD J. LINEHAN
BOX 244, ROUTE 3
LORTON, VIRGINIA

May 21, 1963

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Director, Dearborn Observatory
Northwestern University
Evanston, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek:

The enclosed slides were taken on May 11th between 2 and 2:30 PM, EDST, with a Leica M3, Summaron F 3.5 cm wide angle lens at f/16 and 1/250 sec. apertures.

You will notice that slides 3,4,5 and 7 show disc shaped sun reflections. These appear only where the sun was framed deliberately in the viewfinder. Possibly the same effect was produced by my own lenses, which are corrected for my extreme near-sightness. My sun glasses are stronger than the others. And, of course, there may be no relationship since we discussed sources of reflection. I do want to remind you again that we have a small pond at the foot of our property which was clear because of the dry weather we were experiencing.

I hope the slides will be helpful to you.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
