Dear 

This replies to your December 12 letter regarding the photos of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which you submitted to us for analysis.

I regret that it has taken us so long, but we have so many inquiries regarding such matters that we are unable to reply as promptly as we would like.

The photo analysis on your film has been completed. I have included the report, your original negatives, and prints. Your interest in our UFO program is appreciated. Again, I am sorry that circumstances precluded our replying promptly.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. WEINMAN, JR.
