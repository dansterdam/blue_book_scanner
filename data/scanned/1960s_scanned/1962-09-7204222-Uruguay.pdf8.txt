Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 23 September 1958 enclosing 35 mm negatives or an unidentified flying object photographed at 3 p.m. on 18 September near Tularosa Mesa, New Mexico.

An analysis of the enclosed slides reveals:

Slide 1 contains multiple images of the sun known as parhellions, which are reflections of the sun in the atmosphere. 
Slide 5 contains no discernible image.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
