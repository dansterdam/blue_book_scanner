Astronomer sights saucer:
An astronomer, who wished to remain anonymous, reported sighting a flying saucer. The astronomer stated that the object was very bright and appeared to be rotating. The saucer was visible for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view. The astronomer also reported that the object appeared to be under intelligent control and did not behave like a typical celestial object.
