The image does not contain any photographs, it only shows a diagram and a compass. The diagram illustrates the motion of an observed object or objects, with instructions to draw a picture showing the path and any changes in direction. The compass is also part of the diagram, providing directional information.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "Y" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
