This image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a diagram with instructions for observers to use when reporting a UFO sighting. The diagram includes a compass rose, an illustration of a UFO sighting, and several questions for the observer to answer.

The text in the document reads as follows:

27. In the following sketch, place a "P" on the horizon where the object was when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show the high point where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "Z" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
