UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT FILE
REPORT SUBMITTED BY: ROBERT BLAIR
LOCATION: CARSON CITY, NEVADA
DATE: SEPTEMBER 8, 1965
TIME: 2230 HOURS

On the evening of September 8, 1965, at approximately 2230 hours, Robert Blair, an employee of the Nevada State Highway Department, was driving home from work on U.S. Highway 50 west of Carson City, Nevada.

While driving, Blair observed a bright light in the sky that appeared to be descending rapidly. He stopped his vehicle and watched as the light hovered above a nearby ranch house for a few minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing.

Blair returned to the area the next day and spoke with the ranch owner, who confirmed seeing the strange light the previous evening. The ranch owner stated that the light had shone brightly through the windows of the house before quickly departing.

Blair submitted a detailed report of the incident to the Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official investigation of unidentified flying objects. This report is part of the Project Blue Book archives.
