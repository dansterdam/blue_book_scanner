DATE: 12 October 1964
TYPE EVALUATION: SPEC ID:
ITEM SERIAL NO:

I. PURPOSE:
Analysis of suspected meteorite for identification.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
1. The sample was submitted for analysis and assigned Analytical Branch No. 4-1571.
2. The sample was chipped and pieces sent to X-ray diffraction for scattering pattern, infrared for spectrum between 2.5µ - 40µ, and spectrographic analysis for an emission spectrum.
a. X-ray diffraction gave no pattern.
b. Infrared spectrum showed no organic material present, but a spectrum similar to an inorganic silicate.
c. Spectrographic analysis gave the following results:
