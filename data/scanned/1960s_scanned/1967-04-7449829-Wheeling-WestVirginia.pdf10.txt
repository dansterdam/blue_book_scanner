The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows the path of an object or objects, with angles and elevation measurements indicating how high the object was above the horizon when it was observed. The second sketch is a compass rose, which could be used to indicate the direction of the object's movement.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "x" on the curve that shows the highest point reached by the object shown. Place an "o" on the compass where you first saw the object.

90
75
60
45
33
15
0

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
