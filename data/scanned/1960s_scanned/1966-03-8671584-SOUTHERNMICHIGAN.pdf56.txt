REPORT OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DEXTER, MICHIGAN SIGHTING OF 20 MARCH AND THE HILLSDALE, MICHIGAN SIGHTINGS OF 21 MARCH 1966

The two sightings at Dexter and Hillsdale, respectively, may be called the crucial sightings which became the focal point of local attention (and later of nationwide) and had associated with them a veritable barrage of other reports which were later out association with the principal events under discussion here. It is possible that many of these were the result of the general excitement surrounding these events and of suggestibility on the part of those who reported them. However, there were reports of odd sightings, particularly in the Milan area, a few nights previous to the sightings discussed. It would have taken an arm of investigators to have run down all of these. In the course of our investigation, I spoke with the following people:

County Sheriff Berna - Washtenaw County
County Commissioner (1974-1982) Don Hadden
Deputy Eli Pippstsrlock
Patrolman Kenneth J. Young
Colonel David J. Miller
