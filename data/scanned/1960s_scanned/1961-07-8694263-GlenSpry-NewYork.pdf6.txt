The handwritten report states:
"I was referring to the fact that U.S. newspapers are not mentioning the fact that the bill of rights is very clear on this matter, that the unauthorized use or exploitation of a name by an organized and lawful government is the act of an arbitrarily constituted tribunal and not that of a democratic or representative body. Clear insight (or a) fight against an open enemy can be secured, but clear insight into one's own mystery is more difficult and more true."
