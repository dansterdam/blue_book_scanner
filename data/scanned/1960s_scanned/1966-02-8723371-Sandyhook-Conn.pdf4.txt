The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with questions about the observer's experience.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The observer provided a handwritten response describing how the object disappeared.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? The observer circled "Yes" and provided a handwritten response.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? The observer circled "Yes" and provided a handwritten response.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - "Moved", b. Color - "Appeared to be bright silver".

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and specifically show the direction the object was moving.
