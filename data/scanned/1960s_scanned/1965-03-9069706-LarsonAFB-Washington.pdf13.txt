MEMOS...
To whom it may concern:
Due to conflicting reports coming in from the public regarding the sightings of unidentified flying objects, I note that Washington has put out a release stating that the Air Force is no longer investigating these sightings. However, I must tell you that the day will come soon when the Agency behind the UFO investigation as I know it will reveal itself and we, the public, will be astonished at what they find.
Sincerely,
Ray Fowler
