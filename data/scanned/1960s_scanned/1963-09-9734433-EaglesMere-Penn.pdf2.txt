Dear Sirs:

It has been suggested that I write to you about my observations of an unusual satellite.

On Monday, September 23, 1963, between 9:50 and 9:55 P.M., E.D.T. I observed a bright object travelling from east to west at a high speed (i.e., high for such an object). This object was brilliantly lighted and made a very definite impression on me. When it was where it would next appear and I walked to the shore of the nearby lake where a clear view was obtainable. The object appeared to be roughly triangular in shape and was brilliantly lighted. It was apparently the same object in speed, path and brightness (it was the brightest object I can remember ever having observed).

This station was Marble for a radio station was heard before the object appeared and after it had passed from view. This assocaion was Eaglesmere, Pa. in north central Pennsylvania, a summer resort area. This object was also witnessed by my wife the first time and by a friend the third time there is no question in my mind as to what was observed. I am quite familiar with both satellites and aircraft and this object had none of the characteristics of either. It was an ex-pilot and had nine years in the Air Force, departtent of defense and I examined (apparently critical) was between 25 and 30 minutes.

But she path and the apparent speed of this object area, may lead you to some conclusions. Theis you may wish to investigate this matter further. I shall be glad to furnish any additional information which I can.

Sincerely,
