EXAMINATION OF AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT RECEIVED FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT, OTTAWA, ONTARIO, 18 DECEMBER, 1968
by
John E. Rowland

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
An unidentified aerial object, which was received from a representative of the Department of Transport, Ottawa, has been examined by X-ray diffraction and metallographic techniques. The irregularly-shaped, metallic object was identified as austenitic high-manganese steel. It is almost certain to have been of terrestrial rather than of meteoric origin.
