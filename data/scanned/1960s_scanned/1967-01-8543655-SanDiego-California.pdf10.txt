This image does not contain any photographs or images, but rather handwritten text on a page from an old UFO report document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to transcribe all the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
Day  Month  Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Under a minute - sighting was brief
Looked ligher than normal, about the size of a baseball
went straight up, straight down - no zigzag
made no sound, no trail, no light
Far a fence - but I watched it
it was out of sight quickly, I manly saw the clear area of the saucers
