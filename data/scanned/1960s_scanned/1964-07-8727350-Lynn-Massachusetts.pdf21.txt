Lynn, Massachusetts.  
June 8, 1964
Gentlemen:
On Saturday night at 10:25 P.M., a saucelike object was sighted over Lynn, Massachusetts. This object was oval in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and was observed for approximately 10 minutes. The object was at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet and was moving in a southwesterly direction at a speed estimated at 200-300 m.p.h. The object was emitting a blue-green glow which illuminated the surrounding area. It made no sound and showed no navigation lights. The object appeared to be under intelligent control.
After the object had been observed for about 10 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view at a tremendous rate of speed. It was moving so fast that it appeared to disappear instantaneously.
