27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point marked by the "X" and that the object you first saw is described by the lines (solid line) where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the horizon (skyline) was when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place a "B" at the beginning of the path, a "D" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
