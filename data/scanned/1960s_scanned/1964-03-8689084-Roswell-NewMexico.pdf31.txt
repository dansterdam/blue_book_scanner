The image appears to contain a single black-and-white photograph that takes up the majority of the frame. The photograph appears to be a blurry, grainy image with little detail. There is text at the top of the image that says "FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, AFSC" and "UNCLASSIFIED" at the bottom.

FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, AFSC
