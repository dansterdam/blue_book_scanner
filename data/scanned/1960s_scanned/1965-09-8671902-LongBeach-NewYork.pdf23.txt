SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying
Object, 7 Nov 65, Cleveland, Ohio.

On 7 Nov 65, at approximately 1805 hrs. EST, the undersigned observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Cleveland, Ohio. The sighting occurred while the witness was in his car en route to Cleveland. The object was first observed slightly to the north and slightly above the horizon. It appeared as a bright, white light, similar to a very bright star. The object was in sight for approximately 5-10 minutes and moved in a southerly direction, gradually descending.

The object appeared to be considerably higher than normal aircraft and was SILENT. There were no other known aircraft in the immediate vicinity at the time. If there were nearby aircraft, they were NOT VISIBLE.

In view of the facts that the object exhibited characteristics which differed from conventional aircraft, and the sighting is considered POSSIBLY of an unknown or unidentified aerial vehicle, it is requested that this report be forwarded as appropriate for any further investigation or analysis.
