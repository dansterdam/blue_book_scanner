To me, and I guess the lead house to a lot of people in town, the appearance of this object was quite startling and I would say it had a couple of characteristics that distinguish it from a lot of other things that they might describe. For one, it was sailing along very smoothly without any apparent motion of it's own. And the second thing that distinguished it was the fact that it cast no shadow which is something that arouses a bit of curiosity. I would say its size in comparison to something as large as a house may have been one third that size. I would estimate its height to be about 300 feet. And it's passage across the sky was somewhat diagonal in direction rather than straight across the horizon. I had a chance to view it for maybe 15 to 20 seconds before it disappeared in the direction of the ocean. And considering the speed it was traveling it seemed to fade out in the distance rather than suddenly vanished from sight. So those are the principal characteristics of the object that come to mind. Its journey was abrupt, in and out in a matter of seconds, and that perhaps is what most distinguishes it from the usual run of such celestial phenomena.
