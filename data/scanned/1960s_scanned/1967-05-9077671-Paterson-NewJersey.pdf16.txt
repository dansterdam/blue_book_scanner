Transcript of the text in the document:

"About a media before these I saw an object, party way below airborne, a few over flying southwest. It was  moving to the rim of formation.

This I saw above rather than straight down and it was there seen. Each was a single white light.

If the reason I was so long in contacting you was because it did not seem with certain so as to make a definitive report.

It thinks I save it to my country. I tell them that there is nothing in our sky that belong there.

Even duty is to your and nation mountain air so promptly acceptable.

The above is exactly gentlemen. I appreciate that get that you do not understand what we are to ignore until.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
