GENTLEMEN:
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN A MOST UNUSUAL SIGHTING THAT OCCURRED
IN YOUR AREA DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 25, 1963, DURING
THE COURSE OF A VFR FLIGHT FROM SIOUX CITY, IOWA, TO PIERRE, SOUTH
DAKOTA.

THE AIRCRAFT WAS CRUISING AT A TRUE AIRSPEED OF 170 MPH AT AN
ALTITUDE OF 6,500 FEET ON A HEADING OF 310 MAGNETIC. THE SKY CON-
DITIONS WERE CLEAR WITH VISIBILITY FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO THE
NORTHEAST OF APPROXIMATELY 15 KNOTS. SUDDENLY, THIS OBJECT APPEARED TO BE AN UNUSUAL
CLOUD WAS SIGHTED BEARING SOUTH. THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHERE
SOUTH OF THE "SIOUX CITY" RADIAL PRONUNCIATION.

IT FIRST WAS NOTICED AS A DARK, SHARPLY DEFINED MASS, WHICH APPEARED
TO BE GAINING ALTITUDE SUDDENLY. AS THE PILOT TRIED TO OBSERVE IT TO
A LARGE TANKER MAKING DOGLEG CONTACT, SINCE THERE WAS A SMALL OBJECT
BESIDE IT. IT APPEARED TO BE INTERCEPTING OUR COURSE. IT THEN SEEMED TO
RECEDE TO THE SOUTHWEST. THE OBJECT WAS EXTREMELY SHARP AND CONCISE,
AND IT DID NOT HAVE AN IDENTIFIABLE STRUCTURE.

WE TURNED TOWARDS THE OBJECT. A LACK OF RELATIVE MOVEMENT INDICATED
IF WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT'S PROPELLER CLOUD, HOWEVER. THE SMALL OBJECT
SUDDENLY SEEMED TO ACCELERATE AND DISAPPEAR HIGH INTO THE CLOUD, AND
THE WHOLE MASS APPEARED TO RECEDE. AT THIS POINT WE TURNED BACK
TO OUR ORIGINAL COURSE TOWARDS PIERRE. AT THAT TIME THE SINGLE FEATURE
MASS DISINTEGRATED INTO APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 20 SMALL OBJECTS AND
THE WHOLE GROUP DISAPPEARED WITH THE RECESSION OF OUR ENCOUNTER, WHICH
LASTED APPROXIMATELY ONE TO TWO MINUTES IN DURATION. THE VISUAL ANGLE
SUBTENDED BY THE OBJECT WAS PROBABLY SMALLER AND WE DISCONTINUED OUR
GAZE WHEN OUR INTEREST SMALLER AND WE DISCONTINUED OUR
GAZE WHEN OUR INTEREST SMALLER AND WE DISCONTINUED OUR WATCH.
