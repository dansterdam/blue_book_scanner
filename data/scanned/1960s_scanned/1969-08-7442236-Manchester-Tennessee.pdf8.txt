[Handwritten text] The object appeared to be in the sky very high up. It seemed to be self-luminous, glowing, and changing color from red to yellow. The shape was round or oval, and the object appeared to be reflecting light as it moved. It seemed to hover and then dart across the sky at a very rapid pace, going out of sight.
