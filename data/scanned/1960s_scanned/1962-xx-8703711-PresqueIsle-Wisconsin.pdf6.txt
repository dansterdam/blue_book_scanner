CLOSE FIGHTING IN ARES THAT THE STORY WAS ABOUT 5 TO 7 AND LASTED 40 MINUTES.  A SAUCER WAS SIGHTED OVER BUEMOS AIRES.  FOE SOME 20 MINUTES FIGHTER PLANES TRIED TO INTERCEPT IT, BUT WERE UNABLE TO GET CLOSE TO IT.  IT SEEMED TO BE METALLIC AND SHOT OUT INTENSE LIGHTS.  FINALLY IT ACCELERATED AND LEFT THE AREA AT A TERRIFIC SPEED, GOING OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS.
THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE ARGENTINE AR FORCE WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT SUCH INCIDENTS WERE WELL-KNOWN BUT THAT THEY PREFERRED NOT TO MAKE ANY STATEMENTS ABOUT THEM, AS IT ONLY LED TO 'WILD RUMORS AND SPECULATION'.
