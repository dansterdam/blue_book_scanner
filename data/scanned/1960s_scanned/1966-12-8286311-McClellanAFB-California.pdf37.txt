The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, discussing a UFO sighting report.

The text in the document reads as follows:

On 8 February 1952, a civilian pilot and his passenger were flying a private plane over the area west of Sacramento, California. They reported seeing a bright unidentified flying object that was hovering in the sky. The object then accelerated and disappeared from view. The pilot and passenger were reportedly "disturbed" by what they had witnessed and thought it was a "strange sight."

The document also mentions that the investigating officer found the witnesses to be "credible" and "reliable," and that they provided a "coherent and detailed report" of the incident. The officer noted that while the sighting was "interesting," there was no solution to the "unexplained light."
