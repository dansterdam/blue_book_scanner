The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a large, blurry photograph that takes up most of the space. The text at the top of the page reads "FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, AFSC" and the text at the bottom reads "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the text found in the document:

FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, AFSC
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
