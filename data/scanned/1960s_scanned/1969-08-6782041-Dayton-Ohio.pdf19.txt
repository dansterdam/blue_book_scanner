The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a list of questions with handwritten responses.

DID IT MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?

The handwritten responses provide details about the reported UFO sighting, but do not contain any visual information or descriptions of a photograph.
