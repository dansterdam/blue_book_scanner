Aug 27, 1966
Dear Sir,
On August 22, 1966, I wrote you a report about an incident which occurred on August 18, 1966, at 10:00 P. M. This involved an object which I observed through a window of my home.
At this time, I wish to advise you that on August 23, 1966, at approximately 11:30 P. M., I again observed an unusual object in the sky from my home. This object appeared to be circular in shape and had flashing lights around the outside edge. The object seemed to be hovering in one position for several minutes, then it slowly moved off in a Northeasterly direction, finally disappearing from sight. 
The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes and there were no other lights in the sky at the time. I have no explanation for what I observed and I am quite puzzled by it.
Please let me know if you have any further questions regarding this matter.
Yours truly,
