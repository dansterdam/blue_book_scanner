TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING - MINOT AFB, NORTH DAKOTA
DATE: 6 OCTOBER 1968
LOCATION: MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, NORTH DAKOTA

ON 6 OCTOBER 1968, AT APPROXIMATELY 2230 HOURS, THE CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR AT MINOT AIR FORCE BASE OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) ON HIS RADAR SCOPE. HE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE CHIEF CONTROLLER AND OTHER TOWER PERSONNEL OF HIS OBSERVATION. THE OBJECT WAS TRACKED ON RADAR FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES. IT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND ALTITUDE. ITS SPEED WAS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN 3,000-5,000 MPH.

AFTER APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES, THE OBJECT DEPARTED THE AREA AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. DURING THE TIME IT WAS TRACKED, IT REMAINED WITHIN 15-20 MILES OF THE BASE. ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO ESTABLISH RADIO CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT, BUT ALL WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.

AIRCRAFT FROM MINOT AFB WERE SCRAMBLED TO INTERCEPT THE OBJECT, BUT WERE UNABLE TO VISUALLY ACQUIRE IT. METEOROLOGICAL BALLOONS RELEASED FROM MINOT AFB WERE OBSERVED TO BE MOVING IN A DIRECTION OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT.

CONCLUSION: THE OBJECT OBSERVED ON RADAR WAS DETERMINED TO BE A GENUINE UFO BASED ON ITS UNUSUAL FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIOR.
