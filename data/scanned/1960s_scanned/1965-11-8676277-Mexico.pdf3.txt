The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document page from a Project Blue Book report, with the heading "UNCLASSIFIED" and some text describing an analysis of a UFO case from Mexico.

UNCLASSIFIED

SUBJECT: UFO (MEXICO)
ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA
Pt: BURTON
DATE: 20 JAN 66

Analysis was requested on a 35mm slide containing three light-toned images similar in appearance, taken near Guadalajara, Mexico, and forwarded to the Photo Analysis Division (TDPA) and Photo Processing Division (TDPPE) with the following results:

No discernible signature could be derived from the images noted on the film. Low contrast is a characteristic that the images were probably caused by a ray of light entering a camera, or possibly from some lens flare if one was used.
