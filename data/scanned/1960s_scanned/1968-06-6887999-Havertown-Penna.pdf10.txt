The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch appears to depict an "unidentified flying object" as described in the text above the sketch. The text instructs the viewer to "SHOW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDING ALL AND EVERY DETAIL."

As an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C)
14. SHOW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDING ALL AND EVERY DETAIL. HAVE SUCH PICTURE BEEN TAKEN, AND IF SO, INDICATE WHERE IT CAN BE OBTAINED. INDICATE BRIEFLY ON MARGIN IF PICTURE IS AVAILABLE.

UNDESCRIBED ABOUT SHAPE
BECAUSE OF THE CLOUDS
HERE IT WAS HARD.

A flight about 5 miles
down at 2 o'clock

15. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A HOUSE OR TREE. WHAT FRACTION OF THE KNOWN OBJECT'S SIZE DID THE PHENOMENON OCCUPY? THIS WILL GIVE AN IDEA OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON.
