INTERVIEW WITH DEPUTY SHERIFF DAY HOLKO

A number of excited teen agers came into the sheriff's office at approximately 2 am, Sunday, February 18, 1968. Holko stated that they were all excited and that "they were talking all at once".

Two of the youths, reported and stated that they had seen an object and that it was "colored lights, approximately the size of a car rising from a gravel pit just outside the town of Vashon. (See attached sketch of the area.) The youths also reported that a pond or water in the pit had been frozen.

Deputy Holko, along with a large number of island residents (Holke estimates 50), went to the gravel pit to investigate the report.

The following observations were made by officer Holke:

1. A large pond, approximately 100 feet in diameter, was found frozen in the gravel pit area. Just approximately one foot from the edge of the pond was also firm in spots. Neighboring puddles, however, showed no signs of freezing or ice.

2. Officer Holko broke through the ice and determined that it was approximately two inches thick. Holke estimated the depth of the pond at two feet during his second visit to the spot on Sunday afternoon.

3. The two inch layer of ice was composed of five sub-layers, or laminations, which were filled with masses of small air bubbles.

4. The surface of the ice-covered pond was, in Holke's words, "clearer than it should have been." (It was brightly lit at the time he investigated the incident.) An unusual triangular shaped area, with a base length of approximately 5 feet, where it appeared the surface was also observed. (See sketch for location.)
