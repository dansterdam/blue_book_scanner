SIGHTING OF STANLEY BRAUER AND DON WEIGANDT

Mr. Stanley Brauer and Mr. Don Weigandt were contacted to obtain details regarding an unidentified aerial object that was observed from their restaurant on the night of April 28, 1964. 

Mr. Weigandt stated that at approximately 8 PM, they went outside to investigate a noise and observed an object in the sky. The object was described as being about 75-100 feet in diameter and silently maneuvering. It would fade out and then reappear, often changing color from red to white. The observation lasted for about 5-10 minutes, during which time the object remained generally stationary.

Later, at 1:15 AM the following morning, Mr. Brauer and Mr. Weigandt took out some trash and again observed the object. This time it appeared to be on the ground, with a dull reddish glow. They also noticed charred leaves on the ground in the area, which they felt were possibly dropped or carried to the spot by the object. 

The leaf sample contains no radioactive trace elements, indicating that the object was not the source of any radioactivity. The analysis suggests that the object exhibited remarkable maneuverability and color-changing capabilities, which are consistent with characteristics often associated with unidentified aerial phenomena.
