The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photographs. Instead, it shows a handwritten text describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 9 Jun 1967
35. Information which you feel should be considered and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: This object was in view for a period of time, but was not readily observable to be positively identified as any aircraft. The object
was about the size of a star at arm's length but gave off an intense reddish glowing light. The light seemed to be
pulsating or rhythmic in nature and the object appeared to slowly drift along a horizontal path across the sky. As
it passed from view there was no trail or exhaust apparent, nor was there any sound associated with the object.
The apparent size of the object was smaller than a normal jet but much larger than a star. I cannot estimate the
distance from the viewer or give any details as to altitude. The viewing conditions were very clear and the moon
was only a thin crescent in the southern sky, not a factor in the viewing. There was no cloud cover and no other
air traffic observed during the period of the sighting. The duration of the sighting was approximately 5 to 3
minutes.
