GARNET BAG HOT AIR BALLOONS

Hot air balloons made out of garnet bags usually appear as a red, orange, yellow or white light in the sky and may remain aloft as long as 10 to 15 minutes. If they are fairly close, they may appear as two objects, one on top of the other. The bottom object is the heat source and is quite bright and the upper dull glowing object is the garnet bag. 

Usually the heat source is on a bales wood platform. When the object is aloft it may move in an erratic manner or a straight trajectory, depending on the wind. The balloon also flashes and flickers as the wind blows the candles. When the candle-burn down the platform may catch fire and sometimes causes sparks and pieces of burning debris to fall; however, they usually burn out before they hit the earth. Shortly after the sparks stop falling the object disappears.
