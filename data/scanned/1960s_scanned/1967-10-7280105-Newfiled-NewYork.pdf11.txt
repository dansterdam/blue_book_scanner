1. It is important that you provide all information in your report so that our office does not duplicate your investigation.

2. Most aircraft records and other important data are kept on file for only thirty days. This is just one of the many reasons for timely submission of your report. If you forward a report, such as the 20 October 1967 sighting, please indicate the reasons for delay in reporting the observation.

3. Subject reports are returned to your organization for re-accomplishment. Request they be returned to this office as quickly as possible.
