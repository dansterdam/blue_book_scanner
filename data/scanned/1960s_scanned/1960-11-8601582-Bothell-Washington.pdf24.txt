Dear Col. Kellogg:

Jsnuss ry 23, 1953 I wrote you a report regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object which occurred on January 20, 1953 near Bothell, Washington.

I wish to add to that report P well as clarify P few points.

1. I still mP intsin that what I saw was not an aircraft of known configuration.

2. The object was in sight for several minutes and I was able to observe it closely.

3. It made no noise whatsoever.

4. I cannot understand the persistent skepticism regarding this type of report. I assure you that I have no reason to fabricate or exaggerate this incident.

Sincerely,
