Dear Sir:
We are writing to ask you if you would be so kind as to know if any of our investigators or any of the sightings belonging to the U.S.A.F. have ever been confirmed into actual satellite data which were considered of "greater" and have not thought much about it except momentarily.
On Saturday, September 4, at 7:30 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time an incident happened to make an immediate satellite light in the sky directly east. At first it seemed to be a star and found that it was not a star at all but a round object that appeared to be pushed out in the formation below it and found that it was smaller inside, told my parents and two brothers about it. My mother suggested it to be the satellite of some kind and above the clouds. We closed it and for not it could be maneuvered for it to travel from a position directly above and could see the whole of it. During the course of it, the formation of the light changed in shape and color.
