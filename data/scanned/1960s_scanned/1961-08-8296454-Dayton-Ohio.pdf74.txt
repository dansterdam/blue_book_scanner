There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page of a document from Project Blue Book, which seems to be a questionnaire or report form. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

39. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object?
(Circle One) Yes No
IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate?

40. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was? 
(Circle One) Yes No
IF you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was?

41. Please give the following information about yourself:
