Dear Sir:

I am writing you this time not in asking for information, but in reporting to you about a UFO that I saw, along with five other people, and two other people (which I did not know about at the time). The sighter's names are as follows:

Initial sighter in our group:
[Redacted], 14 years old, female
Toledo, Ohio 43614
[Redacted], 14 years old, male
Toledo, Ohio 43609
[Redacted], 35 years old
Toledo, Ohio 43614 
[Redacted], 44 years old
Toledo, Ohio 43614
[Redacted], 36 years old
Toledo, Ohio 43614

The object was first seen 7 April 1967, at 2110 hours.
E.S.T.

At this time we were approximately one hundred yards S.W. of Woodsdale Ave., while traveling N.E. on the Anthony Wayne Trail, Toledo, Ohio 43609 (as near as I can recollect).

The object was in sight for about twenty minutes. I know this because it took the house to tell my mother and father about it and there was a clock right near the door. The object was in sight continuously because two of my friends were outside watching while I was inside.

The object was seen at night. There were many stars that night but no moon. No clouds were visible and the weather was clear.
