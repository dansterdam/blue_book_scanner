in my mind what it was like but had not tried to make it. well, they questioned me about that so, I described it to them but would not try to make it at that time. well, I went home and on the way home I passed this noise. (January 20, 1969) I practiced until I thought I could make this noise well enough to imitate what I had heard. on January 21, 1969 I went to them and endeavored to imitate the sound of the flying object as I had heard it. I also learned on January 21, 1969 that an elder couple in Carrolton had heard this unusual noise and I went to talk with them. they were convinced an I was that we had heard the same noise. taking a road map and drawing a direct line between Smithfield and Eclipse, Carrolton falls right on this straight line.
well my story goes on.. I came to the conclusion that I was not going to find anyone else that had heard this noise when my neighbor asked me if I had asked someone who I had completely forgotten. I went and asked a lady and her son and the son stated he also had heard this noise. today (1-21-69) my Sunday school teacher told me not to worry that I was not the only one who called langley - that someone else heard the noise and called langley and that they had given this person a rough time. I had told her previously (1-19-69) of my story and she evidently found this out during the week.
conclusion to this story is that I saw and heard an unidentified flying object and I have reported it to the proper authorities. I hope my government will do research to discover satisfactorily an answer to this puzzle.
