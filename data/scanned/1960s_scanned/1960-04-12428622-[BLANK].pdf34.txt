The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the output of all the text found in the document, without any additional commentary.

Now mind you. I'm not saying that these things happened. I'm saying that they were reported to have happened—a very, very great difference. And the central problem to which I address myself tonight, and on which I want you to be the judge and jury, is simply—what on earth (or perhaps I should say, what not on earth) could be the stimuli that gave rise to these reports.

This is the problem which concerns me—largely as a matter of curiosity—because in our times there has been no more bizarre phenomenon, that attracted the attention of so many, than that of the waves of flying saucer reports that have from time to time occurred in the U. S., in France, in Brazil, Italy and Israel; I hear also, in the USSR. It chills me to think that our Russian colleagues, if they address themselves to this problem, might come up with an answer before we do—that is, an answer to the problem of report generation.

In what field of human endeavor might the answer lie? 

In physics, in psychology, in meteorology, in optics, in ESP, or finally in astronomy, or in the province of astronomy? It must lie somewhere—perhaps in many of these fields. (I mean the answer to where the stimuli for the reports lie.)

The reports are real, and their cause must be real—even if the cause is mass hallucination, it is still a real cause.
