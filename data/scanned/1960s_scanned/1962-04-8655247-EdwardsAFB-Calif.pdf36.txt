For Authoring Books
On Space Capability
Lieutenant Colonel Patrick J. Maginnis,
formerly assigned to the Office of the
Deputy Chief of Staff/Operations, Hq.
USAF, was recently commended in a
special letter from the Commanding
General of the AFSC for his extensive
writing and publication of books on
space capability.
Lieutenant Maginnis was nominated
for the Senior Officer Award "for his
outstanding contribution to the acquisi-
tion of knowledge and development of
skills directed toward the accomplish-
ment of USAF mission" as set forth in
AFSC Regulation 900-2.
The book, entitled "Flying Carpet"
deals with the Air Force's "man-in-
space" program. Another of his books,
"Manned Space Flight", has been ac-
claimed for its clarity and use in edu-
cating Air Force personnel and the gen-
eral public on the nation's efforts in the
space field.
The book was described as "extremely
creative and suggestive" in its presen-
tation of technical data. The AFSC let-
ter stated that the Lieutenant Colonel's
publications had been influential in the
acquisition of knowledge and develop-
ment of skills directed toward the ac-
complishment of the USAF mission.
