plain about the lack of assistance, however, since none of us knew what proportions these incidents would assume as the next few days came around.

My interrogations were made triply difficult because of the ubiquitous press, radio and TV men. It was impossible to talk quietly with anyone without having a microphone placed in front of your face. I was always importuned for "just a word" or, "will you answer just one question?" It is difficult to describe to one who wasn't there the general bedlam. Mr. ______, the chief protagonist in the Dexter case, reportedly complained that I had spent very little time with him. It was virtually impossible to do so; several times I was visiting and anxious to talk with him but he was occupied with several reporters. Here again is where some assistants would have come in handy; they could have diverted the reports while I talked to _____. One needs some clever interference run for him in cases like this; it is virtually impossible to do it single handed. By contrast, I recall the Eagle River, Wisconsin "pancake" case. In that instance I had chartered a plane and took several graduate students with me. They were invaluable in chasing down leads, assisting in the interrogation of subsidiary witnesses and running very necessary interference, making special arrangements to see people etc. I have resolved that in investigating future cases, if I do at all, I must have at least one dependable assistant who knows the ropes. Otherwise too much time is wasted in sheer mechanics.

Through the kindness of Prof. ______ of the Graduate School, University of Michigan, I made my headquarters at his home during my several day stay and both he and Mrs. ______ were of extreme help. Mrs. ______ gave freely of her time in answering the phone, which seemed to ring incessantly, to varying hours, and then again early in the morning. It was through Dr. ______ and his kindness that I was put into touch with several University of Michigan faculty members who were very helpful to me.
