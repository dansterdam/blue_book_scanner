Mr. Edward Bernard, 11 Connor Street, Middletown, New York, reported that he observed something which appeared to be a flying object on the evening of 25 April. He described the object as moving in a circular motion and that it was quite bright, lighting up the area. The object remained in view for 2-3 minutes when it disappeared rapidly from sight.

The distance of the object from the observer was estimated to be 5 miles and the elevation was approximately 45 degrees.
