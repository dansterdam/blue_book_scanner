There is no photograph present in this image. Instead, the image appears to be a handwritten report or document from Project Blue Book, a former US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

WHILE TRAVELING ON U.S. 227 SOUTH
COMING HOME FROM VISITING FRIENDS
AT ABOUT 1:30 AM THE 5 OF AUGUST
WHICH WOULD BE YESTERDAY I
BELIEVE, I TURNED ON OFF OF 227
BEFORE TURNING I WAS BLINDED
AS IF I HAD MY PICTURE TAKEN
IT CAME TO A STOP AND LOOKED
FROM THIS SIDE WINDOW IN THE FIRST
WAS A VERY LONG OBJECT AS
BIG AS A HOUSE TRAILER WITH
RED BALLS OF FIRE COMING FROM
IT AND LOOKED LIKE PIECES
FALLING AWAY FROM IT. THE
BLASE BEGAN TO TURN BLUE AND
IT TOOK OFF IN A STRAIGHT LINE
AND WENT AS IT AND MORE I
HAD BETTER REPORT IT SO I KNEW
I WOULD HAVE TO DO IT.
