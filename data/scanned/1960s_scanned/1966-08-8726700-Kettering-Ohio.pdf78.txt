Gentleman of the Air Force:

I have photos of a UFO. You people will call it something else, but this is the fact, that you can't deny. The United States government admits that life does exist on other planets, if they are in our air space and among us.

My name is Kevin Dicks, I live in Minneapolis, Minn. I saw a UFO on a clear day in the western sky. It was not a airplane, it was not a meteor or any known phenomenon.

I heard a UFO make a noise, and this is the motion picture I took of the object. And was, not able to find it, if I took pictures in the last August or early October(1966). The object did not pass over the trees and not ahead. The object was in the sky at about 2/3 of the overhead sky to the ground.

Time was about 7:00 & 7:30 p.m. No airplane was around at that time. The shutters of camera was open at about 4 to 5 seconds. Camera was also not moving and was on a base that did mod move by anything. Color of object was orangeish-white and looked more disc than round.

Sky was clear (see stars in picture). There than, there was no hittitness in sky and the object was right in about 4/5 of the sky between the object, and the ground. I have never seen the tail of the path of the object. The object did not make any noise, I can recall if i heard it make a whisper, who made silence out of the negative, said "I don't know what the object is".

Please send photo back to: Kevin Dicks, Minneapolis, Minn.
