IF THIS THING WERE MORE THAN ONE HALF MILE HIGH, HOW MANY TIMES THE LIGHT WAS IT? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED. DID THIS ARRANGEMENT CHANGE DURING THE SIGHTING?

CONDITION / CLOUD COVER         WEATHER
CLEAR                           FEW CIRRUS CLOUDS (LOW CEILING)
MOONLIGHT                       CIRRUS CLOUDS (HIGH, HAZY, OR WISPY)
PARTLY CLOUDY                   NIMBO STRATUS (LOW, DARK)
                                CUMULO NIMBUS (THUNDERSTORM)
                                HAZE OR SMOG

IF THE SIGHTING WAS AT TWILIGHT OR NIGHT, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE STARS AND MOON?
BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
MOON HIDDEN BY CLOUDS
PARTIAL (MOON OR STARS)
NONE OF THE ABOVE

IF SIGHTING WAS IN DAYLIGHT, WAS THE SUN VISIBLE?  YES   NO. IF YES, WHERE WAS THE SUN AS YOU FACED IT?

IN BACK OF YOU                   TO YOUR LEFT
                                TO YOUR RIGHT
                                UNKNOWN. COULD NOT DETERMINE POSITION.

BRIEFLY, DESCRIBE THE SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION SEEN DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS OR STREET LAMPS, ETC. FOR TERRESTRIAL ILLUMINATION, SPECIFY DISTANCE TO LIGHT SOURCE.

THE OBJECT DID NOT GIVE OFF ANY LIGHT OR ILLUMINATION ITSELF. IT WAS JUST REFLECTING LIGHT FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE SUCH AS THE SUN OR MOON.

GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED DARK OR LIGHT, WHETHER IT CHANGED COLOR, ITS TRAIL, SHAPE, OR OTHER OBSERVABLE FEATURES. INDICATE COMPARISONS WITH OTHER OBSERVED OBJECTS, LIKE STARS. A LIGHT OR LIGHTS?

THE OBJECT APPEARED AS A SINGLE BRIGHT ORBLIND THAT REFLECTED LIGHT FROM THE SUN OR MOON. IT SEEMED TO MOVE SILENTLY AND WOULD SOMETIMES DISAPPEAR BEHIND CLOUDS ONLY TO REAPPEAR LATER. BASED ON ITS MOVEMENT AND APPEARANCE, IT SEEMED LIKE SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT OR AERIAL VEHICLE RATHER THAN A CELESTIAL BODY LIKE A STAR. I COULD NOT MAKE OUT ANY DISTINCT FEATURES OR DETAILS ON THE OBJECT ITSELF.
