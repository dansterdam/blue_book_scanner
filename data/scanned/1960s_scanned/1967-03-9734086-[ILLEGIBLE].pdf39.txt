1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to answer Work Order Number 67-57 from Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., for the identification of objects/images as observed on the submitted negatives.

2. ANALYSIS: Each negative shows an object was photographed and each object appears to be an aircraft in flight.

a. The first photograph shows a plus-shaped image with an additional, shorter crossbar to the right of center. Microscopic examination of this image reveals several features:
 
(1) Less dense imagery at the upper end of the vertical crossbar suggests a tail rotor.
(2) Wider imagery at the tips than at the center of the horizontal crossbar is indicative of the main rotor not being "stopped" by the camera shutter speed.
(3) Only the starboard "flotation-type" landing gear being visible due to the under-side rear angle of photography.
(4) Numerous statements in the accompanying letter that also suggest helicopter 33571/27 are:
- Numerous vertical movements... 
- Cycle-shaped...
- Very slow speed...
- Being visible for a 15 minute period...
