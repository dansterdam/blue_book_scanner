11 NOV 67 2/c2052
Source: Civilian
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 Hours, 30 Minutes
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
Course: NW
PHOTO: No
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
CONCLUSION: Probable (BALLOON)
BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
FAA radar painted a target that could be identified at that time, actually the object's was at an estimated 5,000 to 7,500 ft and 25 miles north of Erie. The radar controller felt that the target would have to have been quite high. Lost target about 20 miles NW of Buffalo.
COMMENTS: The controller thought that the object must have been a balloon but couldn't find the agency that launched it. The wind on the ground at 30,000 ft was blowing from 230 deg at about 51 MPH. It appears that the object was a balloon, however, the launch agency could not be located.
