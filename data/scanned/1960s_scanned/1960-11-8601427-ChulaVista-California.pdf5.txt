THIS OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AT APPROXIMATELY 0900 HOURS ON 8 NOV 60. IT WAS OVAL SHAPED, SILVER IN COLOR AND VERY BRIGHT. IT APPEARED TO BE ROTATING SLOWLY. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES. IT THEN INCREASED IN SPEED AND DISAPPEARED TO THE SOUTH. AT NO TIME WAS THE OBJECT BELOW THE CLOUD COVER. THIS APPEARS TO BE A VERY UNUSUAL PHENOMENON. OBSERVERS FEEL THAT THIS WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR OTHER KNOWN OBJECT. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUESTED.
