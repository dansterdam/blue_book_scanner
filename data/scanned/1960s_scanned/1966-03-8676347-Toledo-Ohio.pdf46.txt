UFO-Watching
Newest 'Sport'
Of Area Residents

ELLIOT - The newest sport in
this town is watching UFO's, or
unidentified flying objects.

For the past few nights, cars
parked on lonely country roads
to "watch" a strange, large,
bright object which residents
say appears in the skies and is
looking for space ships and little
green men therein.

Friday night in East Elliot,
there were at least a dozen
parked vehicles whose occupants were scanning the skies
for sight of a UFO.

Residents of the area reported
hearing a "strong beeping
sound" and there was a green
object seen in the sky on Route
Road, where some felt "something" may have landed.

The reasoning was that a
number of trees were crushed
and branches broken. However,
inspection of the area didn't reveal
the damage could have been
done by snow and ice.

Earlier in the week, some
other Spinney Creek residents
over Spinney Creek, and on
Wednesday three men driving
along Beach Road observed
something in the sky near the
power lines, and followed it.

"The 'thing' was making
erratic motions" and was moving quite rapidly.

The men followed it toward
Kittery down Route 236, caught
up with it or near it, before it
veered off and vanished.

One woman reported finding
some odd "plastic" type object
near her home.

Although the UFO activity
has come mostly from Elliott
residents, sometimes the "ship,"
or "something" landed a few
nights ago on the beach in
Kittery.

In fact, police checked out a
report of a "loud beeping" near
one home, and when they went
there found out the beeping was
really peeping from a tree frog.
