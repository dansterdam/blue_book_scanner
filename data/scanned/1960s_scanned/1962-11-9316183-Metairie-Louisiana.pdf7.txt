Dear Mr. President:
I don't know if I am doing the right thing in writing this letter, but I feel I must do something about what was seen.
As my brother and I were driving home yesterday evening, about 8:45 p.m., on the Veterans Highway, we noticed a small brilliant light in the sky which appeared to be approaching us. As it came nearer, it seemed to be maneuvering or stopping, and as it came still closer, it split into two parts. One part seemed to circle or dart around the other, and then the two parts came together again. At this time, it was quite bright and appeared to be about the size of a small plate. As it came closer, we became convinced that it was not an airplane or any other conventional aircraft, as there was no sound and the motions were not like any airplane. 
As we approached David Price, we noticed that the light or lights had then changed to a silvery or metallic color, and were flashing on and off. We stopped the car, got out, and watched the object continue its strange maneuvers for about 15 minutes. At times it appeared to change shape, becoming elongated at one point. When it moved away, it seemed to blend into the background.
A couple of other cars stopped and looked at it too, but I don't know who they were or what they thought. After it disappeared, I discussed the incident with several people, but I am not sure they believed me. As I mentioned before, I am not sure that I am doing the right thing in writing this letter, but I felt I should at least report what we saw.
