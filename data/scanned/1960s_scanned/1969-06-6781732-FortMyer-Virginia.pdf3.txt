ALL INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALL INFORMATION RECEIVED PROVIDES A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THIS SIGHTING.

Our position on the earth at 8:57 PM. That was when I first observed the phenomenon which I saw. I contacted several neighbors to verify my observations. It appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape and very bright. It hovered at times and then moved rapidly at other times.

From observation it seemed to be approximately 1,000 feet in altitude. I attempted to obtain photographs but was unable to do so as I had no camera available. The object remained in view for approximately 10-12 minutes before disappearing from sight.
