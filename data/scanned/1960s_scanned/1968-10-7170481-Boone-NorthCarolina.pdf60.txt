The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book.

Text extracted from the document:

It should be remembered that I am not an eyewitness of this occurrence but only obtaining the details of the happening from those who were actually there. The thing was sighted by others besides myself, but as far as I know, the ones who saw it are not available. Where were we when this happened? It was seen from the yard of my home.

It was elongated and angular on its farther side. It may pointed north with a rounded end toward me which was smooth. It looked to be of a metallic surface while possibly 30 feet in length. It did not hover but did appear to glow faintly with a strange light and looked to be a metallic color with the bottom a shade or two lighter than the rest.

It disappeared toward the southwest and was out of sight within a few seconds. I still look to be round and somewhat a hallucination. It was still consistent with my earlier observation. Of what I could see the thing appeared to be larger than appeared to be stirred by the current.
