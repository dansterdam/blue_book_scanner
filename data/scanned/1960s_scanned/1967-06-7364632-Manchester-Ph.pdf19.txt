MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
JUNE 7, 1967 

Reported sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object or possibly Balloons in the Manchester, New Hampshire area on June 7, 1967.

The witness reported seeing a group of objects, approximately 10 to 15 in number, moving in a northeasterly direction over Manchester, New Hampshire at 9:15 PM on June 7, 1967. The objects were described as appearing to be in the shape of a cigar or sausage and appeared to be oscillating or wobbling as they moved across the sky.  

The witness indicated that the objects were at a high altitude, approximately 10,000 to 15,000 feet, and were observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before disappearing from view. No sound was associated with the objects and no other witnesses were reported.

This case was investigated and it was determined that the objects observed were most likely weather balloons launched from a nearby site.
