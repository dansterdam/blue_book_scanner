Text from the document:

"A letter from Missoula, Montana, dated August 5th (Case #32) tells of four unidentified young men who observed around 9:00 P.M. a formation of eight or nine round luminous objects about a thousand feet in altitude and traveling in a southwesterly direction at an estimated speed of about 800 miles per hour. After maneuvering in different directions for about 10 minutes, then the objects climbed vertically and disappeared. The observer identified themselves as reliable citizens and seemed particularly impressed by the tremendous speed of the objects."
