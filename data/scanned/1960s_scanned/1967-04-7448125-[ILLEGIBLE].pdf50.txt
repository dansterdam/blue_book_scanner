The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with various questions about the sighting of an unidentified object.

Transcribed text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
seemed to gradually fade away but looked back, it was gone.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One.)        Yes          No        Don't know.         If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:     unsure of surroundings

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
1 to 4

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. 
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
(The sketch shows an object with a rounded oblong shape, drawn with dotted lines as if fading or vanishing.)
