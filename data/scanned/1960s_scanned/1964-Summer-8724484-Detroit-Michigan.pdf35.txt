The image appears to contain a black, blurry, oblong shape in the center of the frame, which could potentially be a photograph of a UFO. However, the image quality is poor and the object is not clearly defined, so I cannot say with certainty what it depicts.

Detroit, Michigan 
July 24, 1964 

Dear R.E.C.

This is a report on what 
my wife and I saw during the evening of July 24, 1964 in the sky over Detroit, Michigan. 

We were sitting on our porch looking to the northwest when we noticed an object moving rapidly in the sky. At first we thought it was an aircraft, but as it came closer, it became apparent that it was not an aircraft. This object appeared to be oblong in shape and had a reddish-orange glow. It moved rapidly at first and then slowed down and hovered for approximately two to three minutes before speeding up and disappearing over the horizon. 

Sincerely,
