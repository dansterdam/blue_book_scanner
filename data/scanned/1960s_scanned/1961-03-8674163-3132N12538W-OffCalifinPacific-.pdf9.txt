However, the image itself does not contain a photograph, only a drawing or illustration of what appears to be a building or structure.

"INTELLIGENCE OFFICE 
ATT: CAPTAIN GREGORY MCNEW 
AFOIN-4E 
WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

16 March 1964

SUBJECT: Sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects 
    REFERENCE: Your request of 12th

Dear Sir: 

Enclosed is a photo from our files of a seemingly material and probable highly charged "object" over Japan.

In reference to your "Garland HAFB" photo, we would wish to ask this question? What provision is separate this type can you make on your COC for wider and more comprehensive analysis, which might perhaps you impress, and assist in terms, with which would produce greater detailed attention from the COC to AAHATRON, Chromes, and the Pentagon?

Thank you once again for your detailed reply.

Very truly yours,"
