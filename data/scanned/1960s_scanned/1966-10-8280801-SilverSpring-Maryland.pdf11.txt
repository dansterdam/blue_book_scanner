I had a hunch to look for something. That is why I went out to the back yard and looked up. Waited about ten minutes. I started to go in as I got a little chilly. But didn't. I looked up or rather, looked north, south, east and west, like a count. Each corner of the sky was lit, like a quarter moon each. The whole of the sky top-third keeping in the lighter spot. I didn't go out to look for any. But wonder if I did. Each sighting had been different. They may travel in the dark sometime and not be seen - they have lights or lighted - they are welcome to watch.
