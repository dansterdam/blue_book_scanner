The image contains a photograph that appears to be a diagram or sketch drawn by the observer. The diagram shows the movement and trajectory of the observed object, with annotations describing its appearance and behavior.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? YES, DISAPPEARED TO MY LINE OF SIGHT.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes / No / Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what. YES, TO SOME EXTENT BEHIND CIRRUS CLOUDS.
16. Did the object move in front of or behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes / No / Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what. YES, APPEARED TO MOVE FROM BEHIND CIRRUS CLOUDS.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - SILENT b. Color - BRILLIANT RED TO ORANGE GOLD.
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? ABOUT 1/3.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
