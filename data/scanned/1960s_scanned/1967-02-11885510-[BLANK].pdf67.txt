He theorized that the brilliant surface of the sun was actually its atmosphere and the so-called sunspots were simply the solid dark surface showing through the rifts of the atmosphere. The very influential French astronomer Arago, as late as 1850, could not find anything wrong with this theory.

In 1832, Von Littrow accepted the theories of J. Lambert (1750) that comets were undoubtedly inhabited and their extensive atmospheres had the purpose of mitigating and preserving the heat of the sun which must vary greatly along the eccentric orbits of those bodies. Both men were leaders in the mathematical theory of comets.

On the moon the German astronomer Gruithuisen could see cities and railroads, and other astronomers speculated what function the rings of Saturn might have to make conditions there more comfortable for the intelligent beings which were undoubtedly there.

In the second half of the 19th Century the science of astrophysics was born and quickly showed that the conditions on the sun, moon, comets, and the majority of the planets were such as to preclude the existence of any life there. The only possibly habitable planets were Venus and Mars, and life on these was highly problematical. It became unfashionable to talk about inhabitants of other planets, and Lowell's ideas about the artificial origin of the canals.
