The page contains two sketches, but no photograph. 

The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and a curved line labeled "B" to illustrate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen.

The second set of sketches shows a larger sketch on the left labeled "A" and a smaller sketch on the right labeled "B", which are examples of how to complete the larger sketch to show the position of the object when it was first seen.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
