There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

the first Air Force.- Lt Marano requested that they contact the local police and have them see if they saw anything or had any unusual reports, and if so send copies to us. Contact the Control Tower and see if anyone saw anything unusual and make a statement that we/have radar coverage and that nothing unusual was sighted during this time period..

Lt Marano and Capt St. John discussed the UFO reports that had been made to us incorrectly. Captain St. John said that they realized that they had had a slip shod program on these UFOs so Col Sheppard set up new policies and decided to have the Intelligence Officer investigate the reports. Now they must turn the reports over to the Intel people for investigation and they in turn send them back to the Info office upon completion. Lt Marano explained that if a report was investigated/they did not have to send it to Wright-Patterson. Lt Marano told him that we would finish up the reports they had previously sent to us since they are so old, however, they should investigate the report of 27 January and submit inaccord with the regulation.
