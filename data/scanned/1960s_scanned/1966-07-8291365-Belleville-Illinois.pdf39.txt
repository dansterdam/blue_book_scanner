No one info only
Case to: all to investigate
Proposed reply to letter from ************ 29 March 1967

Dear Mr. ************,

Reference your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object on 6 July 1966. Since you have just reported this incident it is considered too late to be of much use. Investigation is not possible. If you had reported your observation to the Air Force shortly after 6 July, a meaningful scientific investigation would have been possible. The report will be filed for information purposes only.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

J. Sofaer - 1 May 67
