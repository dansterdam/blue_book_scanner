15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROJECTIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS, INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

[Sketch of an object with a circular shape and a line extending from it.]

Over head around 100 yards, floating or standing still. Slight movement was noticed as if object were drifting slowly from West to East. The object was round and its surface seemed to be reflecting light. The bright objects reflection was around 3 to 4 feet in diameter but object itself appeared larger.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE (HOLD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT. HOW MANY TIMES DOES THE OBJECT COVER THE MATCH?) OF THE OBJECT AS IT APPEARED WHEN FIRST OBSERVED? GIVE THE APPROXIMATE SIZE IN DEGREES.

The object appeared to be around 6 inches in diameter at an arms length.
