LG Freeman/SAPXRCC/1/9/75079/6 July 61

Reference your recent observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Attached herewith is your original photograph for our records. This object was approximately 75 feet away and was 3-4 feet in diameter. The photograph indicates its brightness, size, and lack of details or thickness as noted by your observations.

Photographic analysis shows no support for our remarks concerning the size, shape, and appearance of the object. This indicates it was probably a real physical object and not merely a reflection or mirage.

Enclosed are your original photograph with one enlarged copy.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force. Your diligence in our program is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
