Lack of space prevents us fr  
details, but we have recently learned of two more incidents in which evidence was apparently left behind by ying saucers, as in the U. J. case. The first incident occurred near Cannelton, Indiana, a few miles from Dale, where the sighting described in the middle of page 25, No UFO was seen, but mysterious altered circles were found in a hay field belonging to Merrell James Stark. These were described as "acid type burns."
