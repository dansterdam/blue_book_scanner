The image does not contain any photographs. It consists of three sketches illustrating how to estimate the elevation of an observed object above the horizon based on its apparent size in the sky.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
