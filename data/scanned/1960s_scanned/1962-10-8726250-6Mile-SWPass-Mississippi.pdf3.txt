No Case (Information Only)
4 October 1962
Jacksonville, Florida

On October 4, 1962, two power failure occurred within a period of 15 minutes. One was in the southwestern part of Jacksonville, the other was in a wide area covering the Northside and Arlington areas. The witnesses reported that when the power failed, they looked out and saw a large bright object hovering over their homes. Mrs. Baker said she looked out and saw the object hovering over and across the road, and it was so bright she had to shield her eyes. The object then went straight up at a high rate of speed and the power came back on. The witnesses across the areas where the power failed also saw the bright object go straight up and the power came back on. The case appears to be one of the more unusual power failure cases on record.
