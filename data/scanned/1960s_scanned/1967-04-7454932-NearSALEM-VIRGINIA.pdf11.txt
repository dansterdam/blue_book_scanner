The image does not contain a photograph, it is a typed letter. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

Re: TDPT (UFO)
4-17-67 observation

Dear Major Quintanilla:

This is my 15 year old son. He and his brother states they saw the "flying saucer" picture in the subject photo, land and take off on or near the property adjoining our home premises. He states at first they were frightened and ran, then returned a distance to snap the picture.

He says he sent the negative to Dell Publications and that it has been returned. I will write them myself in an attempt to get the negative for you.

Very truly yours,

DM:dj
