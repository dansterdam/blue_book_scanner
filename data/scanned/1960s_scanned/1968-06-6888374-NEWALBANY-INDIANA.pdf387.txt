(A SKETCH OR DIAGRAM MAY HELP IN VISUALIZING THE OBJECT.) 
a large bright oblong object about 25 feet long about 8 feet wide, appearing silvery or white in color, hovering silently over the center of the road approximately 50 yards from me at an altitude of approximately 100 feet. The object appeared to be self luminous, with no visible means of propulsion, and did not reflect the sunlight. It moved horizontally for about a mile and then shot straight up at high speed and disappeared. All this was observed over a period of about two minutes.
