The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The diagram appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, and it shows instructions for a person to sketch the motion and direction of an observed object or objects in the sky.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" on the compass where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a SKETCH of how they were grouped, and put an arrow to show the direction that they took.
