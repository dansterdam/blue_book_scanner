Mrs. [REDACTED]
Rockaway, New Jersey
Called on Sunday evening, April 25, 1959.
The woman seemed fairly reliable, but she still doesn't think the things were birds. She seems impressed by the high angular rate of motion and the regularity of the motions. These do not suggest the birds. There do not seem to be any distinct features, such as wings or tails. It is on the outskirts of the town and mostly in back. Although it is not a light, it is brighter than the background and there are no indications of the normal shape of a bird. It does not suggest reflection from the body of a bird.
It was a clear night, and the stars were out. When asked how the light compared with the Big Dipper, the witness stated that they would be bigger but not brighter than the stars.

Note: This was not the reason I don't have a date in this case? I don't think it was received.
