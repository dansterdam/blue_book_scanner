June 8, 1968
Lights on the car lighting up the low-hanging clouds. The bright spotlight, however, did not seem to be associated with the general behavior of the object. It would seem to be a coincidence; it is even conceivable that the sound from the siren did reach the house, due to the peculiar weather conditions at the time, but that there was also a sound from the object. It would seem important to talk to the driver of the police car, to see why he had his siren on.
Mentioned that after the object reached attitude and went to the south, that it never seem to bother the neighbors had so many dogs around here. They were all just - barkin', you know, just whining, and my dog out in the back here, she was on top of the doghouse crying to jump over the fence. Apparently the noise must have really hurt their ears.
Everyone agreed that the noise was extremely loud, a fact that makes it difficult to believe that the siren, at the very closest one-half mile, could have created so much noise.
Mr. Rawlings said he reported the event to the Antiogo Radar Base, but that the radar operator told him he could get no returns from that direction because of weather conditions; the returns were from rain cloud reflections.
They also checked with the local airport, but there was no traffic and for one arrival from Stevens Point, which is 19 miles southwest, which has a field where jets land.
There is a possibility that the family saw a jet airplane with lights on, but the lighting and general behavior of the object seems to be inconsistent with a jet airplane.
