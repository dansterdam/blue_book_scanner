Another incident -

One day, October 5, 1967, my mother and I were standing out on the back porch facing the hills. It was only three afternoon. In the back of the hills way far away, my eyes caught a very fast moving object appearing at a reasonably quick rate across the blue sky. It was a black disklike.

Two nights before, only 2 times, I had watched a caught light similar to the one I have told you about about a bright light and appeared in the sky. it was on the left. It never thought too much about it although one could tell it was unusual.
