The image does not contain any photographs, only text. The text appears to be a "Photographic Data" section, listing information about the type and make of camera, focal length and make of lens, brand and type of film, shutter speed used, lens opening used, filters used, whether a tripod or solid stand was used, and whether "panning" was used. It also mentions the exact direction of the camera with respect to true North and the ground, and notes that supplemental information is unavailable.
