This was taken on 8:59 a.m. film. This corresponds to my list, which went around the house to see if the wave was really felt. I carried about 3 pounds to get another picture to make the scene going from west to east slightly for your cooperation.

If you wish I will report all moving objects in Tetrell's category that I can photographically capable enough to hold. Like only little pictures of the one that got an odd and down.
