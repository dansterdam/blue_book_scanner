The image does not contain any photographs, only diagrams and text. The diagram on the left shows an illustration of the horizon and the positions of an object above it, with angular degrees marked. The diagram on the right shows a compass rose. The text describes questions related to the observer's experience of an unidentified object, asking the reader to draw a picture to show the object's motion and direction.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
