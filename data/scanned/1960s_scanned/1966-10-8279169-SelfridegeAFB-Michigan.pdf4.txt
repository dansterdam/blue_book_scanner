Page 6 - Dear the one concerned

The main thing I will explain a little later.
As for the glow, it was very bright - and a change after between a 2 o'clock & feeling 1/4 mile it did subpart back to hold 7/1/2s mile it back to hold.
3/4 of the time I noticed that to lead. 7 more while I feel from a 1/4 minute but it was.
1/6 on the bottom - this may be moved I don't know but i've from this side seen a round object and day 99 3/6 yes. Most means that we not we were not as kind to help it.
This almost landed by the lights. In fact this is not my eye has been kitting me for watching at a all these phenomena they in are pretty shy. This moon was and amounts found the my other moon I have seen. Sincerely bogoslav.
