MRS. ---- ACCOUNT
We talked to Mrs. ---- in her home for a few minutes. She took us in her car (from which the sighting was made) to the instant scourl Her account is as follows:
She was a housewife petty to take a friend to the theatre and was on her way home. The time was about 10:30 P.M. Upon stopping at Intersections, saw through the side window of the car a number of lights, which disappeared in the direction indicated above. She called the attention of Mrs. ----. Mrs. ---- reports that it would be hard to say how many lights there were, but she would guess 6 or 8. Quite low, about up to 15 degrees and similar in color and the tail lights of a car. Their confirmation was as in the distance. Pulling away from the intersection, the two women speculated that the object might be an airplane, but that it had an extraordinary motion unlike any airplane landing or taking off near the nearby airport. O'Hare Field is foreground, but this might be very clear. She thought, but was not sure, that Mrs. ---- had commented about the strange behavior of the object between herself and the car turned west. Bearing west, Mrs. ---- said that she could see the car approached point B. It was about the same altitude as the streetlights, not too far off as estimated in their line of travel. It seemed very much as it first did, although it seemed to be around the farther end of the athletic field of the high school. The two women continued to watch the object as the car approached a stop sign at intersection C. At about 6 (approximately the time they stopped - it was before or after she stopped) the object appeared to turn slightly and disappear.
