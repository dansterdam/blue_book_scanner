Text extracted from the document:

We 55 and we scan
Observed, probe with interest an oblong
Cigar shape in the sky
Craft moving steady in a straight line
Changed direction at will toward horizon
Moved off at a high rate of speed
Observed only a few seconds
Caught the attention of all observers
None of us was able to get a satisfactory explanation 
Unusual but fascinating experience
It seems strange that no one has heard of any other incidents involving such a sighting when presumably an occurrence like this should be of interest toothers in the vicinity
We are all reliable witnesses and respectable community members in our town
Would be pleased to learn of any other sightings similar to what we observed
Have searched local newspapers to no avail
Would appreciate any information you can supply
Thank you for your attention
