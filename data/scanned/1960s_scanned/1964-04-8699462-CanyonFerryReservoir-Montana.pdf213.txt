Gentlemen:

Subject: Article, "U.S. Air Force Censorship of the UFO Sightings", by Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, U.S.M.C. (Ret.), True Magazine, January 1965

No unidentified objects were observed accompanying or pursuing the GT-1 spacecraft, launched into orbit on April 9, 1964. Objects observed were identified as parts of the spent launch vehicle booster and minor structural pieces which routinely break free from the expendable booster portion in the spacecraft and booster separation process. There is no indication of the presence of any material which was not originally part of the launched vehicle.

Sincerely yours,

Leo X. Abernethy
Chief, Mission Support
Apollo Flight Operations
Office of Manned Space Flight
