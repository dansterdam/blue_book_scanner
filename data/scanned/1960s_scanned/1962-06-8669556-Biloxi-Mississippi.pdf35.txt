PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
RECORD OF INVE 3TIG A TION OP UNIDENTXFIED FLYING OBJECT
EXHIBIT III
Case No. 8669556 Biloxi, Mississippi 
Date of Report: June 8, 1962
Date of Sighting: May 1, 1962 
Witness: Mr. Ray H. 
Occupation: Retired from Civil Service
Narrative: On May 1, 1962, at approximately 8:30 p.m., the witness, Mr. Ray H., a retired Civil Service employee, was walking along the beach at Biloxi, Mississippi, when he observed a bright, round object hovering over the water about 300 feet from the shore. The object was estimated to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It was surrounded by a dim, fluorescent-like glow and gave off no sound. The witness observed the object for about 15 to 20 minutes, after which it suddenly disappeared, moving straight up and out of sight in a matter of seconds.
Disposition: This sighting is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The description of the object and its apparent ability to hover and move out of sight rapidly are consistent with the characteristics of an unidentified flying object. There is no evidence to suggest that the object was any type of known aircraft or natural phenomenon. The witness appears to be a reliable observer.
