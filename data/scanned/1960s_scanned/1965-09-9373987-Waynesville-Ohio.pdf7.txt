Dear Miss _____,

The objects which you sighted on the nights of 4 and 6 September correspond with the passage of the satellite Echo II. The satellite was visible to the northwest at 8:07 p.m. at 7째 altitude on 4 September and to the northwest at 8:28 p.m. at 6째 altitude on 6 September. Echo II was visible to the north of Tampa at 8:07 p.m. at 7째 altitude and set at 8:28 p.m. at 6째 altitude. The motion and visible light characteristics of the satellite in flight is a common illusion as one light, in this case Echo II, passes another light, such as a star.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
