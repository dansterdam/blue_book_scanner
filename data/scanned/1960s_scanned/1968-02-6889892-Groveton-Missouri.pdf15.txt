IN REPLY
REFER TO:

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr., USAF 
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
Aerospace Technologies Division

Wright-Patterson Air Force, Ohio 45433

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Your memorandum of April 17, 1968, in reference to a reported UFO observation on February 9, 1968, was received.

Except for unusual incidents, we have disposed of our aircraft movement records for the concerned date. No investigation similar to the UFO observation was recorded at the control tower.

Instances of aircraft operating in the area do not normally do not operate in the area at the time involved.

The observations related in paragraph 2 of your memorandum gave indication of low altitude operation of a turbine-powered jet aircraft. I would suggest contacting Wichita, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, FAA Regional Offices for possible information. Those facilities are such headquarters of the location reported and conduct extensive helicopter operations.

Sincerely,

James E. Kennedy
Facility Chief
