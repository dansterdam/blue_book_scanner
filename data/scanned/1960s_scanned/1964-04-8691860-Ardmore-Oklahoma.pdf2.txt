Dear Sir:

A recent United Press release by Emily R. Svellis mention that I am enclosing a sketch made by me after seeing some type of craft on 6-21-64. I am sure to have encountered or to have been encountered by some object whose all dimensions and construction were so unusual. I'm afraid on a scientific study it appeared much larger than the common article as seen in N. Mexico by Mr. Zamora, more like the B-58 bomber. Its glowing in the sky was such that it seemed to have been traveling at a fantastic rate of speed, and if it must have been in process of sharp turn. The distance at which I observed object was approximately 1/4 mile and the process was quick and abrupt motion over in its direct direction, glowing over when last visible.

If you feel this was a weather or observation object utilized States, it would make me very happy, since I find each cloud with great suspicion. I would be glad to answer any stretch sense of interest, but I would not like to have relation as the matter.

A stamped and envelope is enclosed and I would like returned. The reason for sending it along was to avoid a thank you for your consideration.

very truly yours,
ARDMORE, OKLA
