11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS

On Oct 6, 1962 at 2000 hours with the visual sighting, the object continued for 3/4 hour over the ocean, then departed at 2015 at an elevation of 10 to 15 degrees. The object displayed no appreciable motion. The minute-to-minute visual observations were confirmed by radar, and 1 clear radar fix placed the object at 15 miles from the observer. The radar operator stated that many small, fast-moving objects were quickly picked up and tracked.
