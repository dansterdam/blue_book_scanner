The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The following, extracted from Maj Weaver's OD Report dated 27 Apr 64, is quoted for your information:

"AFSC Command Post called at 1643 relaying a UFO report as follows:
At approximately 0130 local time near Espa√±ola, N.M. on 26 April a Ranger's son observed an object emitting flames and noise. His father again observed the object as it returned and his son involved. The object was reported circular in shape and still smoldering and there were footprints in the vicinity. They notified the state police and Kirland AFB. The prints were similar to those reported on the 25th April at Soccorro, N.M. Personnel from Kirland site may be there now."
