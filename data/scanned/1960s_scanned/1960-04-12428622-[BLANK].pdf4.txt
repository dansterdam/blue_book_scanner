The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document describing a UFO sighting.

faded, and the gigantic object, which may have been 300 feet long, had sunk into darkness. The spectacle had lasted about 3/4 of an hour.
Unknown to him, this observer reportedly had witnesses. Two policemen making their rounds at 1:00 a.m. also observed the phenomenon, as had an army engineer southwest of the town of Vernon.
The case was briefly described in the Paris newspaper, LIBERATION. Nothing more was done about it, except that higher conducted his own investigation. Speaking of policemen: if those same two policemen had reported that they had seen two things beat up a victim and take to the woods, their testimony might be sufficient to send someone to the chair; but when something violently unusual comes up, like this, or if they had seen the angel Gabriel riding along on a nine-legged octopus, no one would, of course, believe them.
Oddly enough, policemen have figured in many sightings. I remember back in 1947, a policeman in Oregon who was feeding pigeons in back of the station house, observed some flying disks. It was 1:00 p.m. on the Fourth of July, just two weeks after Kenneth Arnold had reported the first real newspaper case in the U.S.S.on June 24, 1947-the classic case from whence sprang the name "flying saucer." He reported having seen "saucer-like objects" flying over Mt. Rainier.
