H: I see, they were of variable intensity, but not as together.
S: Yes, that's right. 
H: I see, what was the kin condition of the sky? Were there are clouds at all?
S: No, sir, it was very clear.
H: Very clear, yes. Compared to the brightest star -- there were some bright areas at that season -- the star Arcturus which is in the northwest which is a very bright thing and there's in the northeast -- did you make a comparison of colors with the stars at that time?
S: Yes, sir. I'd say that these appeared to be as bright as any in the sky, may be even a little brighter.
S: Okay, go on, he cut in on us.
H: Mr. Moore said something about having seen a light travelling across the sky. Did you see any motion any place?
S: Yes, I did.
H: But not the diamond formation? 
S: Yes, one from the diamond formation -- left the diamond formation.
H: Was it the fifth one?
S: No, it was the fourth one. It was the one that - you see, the diamond shape would be the long points of the diamond were facing toward the west (as I see) and the short points were facing north and south. And the most westerly light of the diamond left the diamond and went out to the western section of the sky. Quite a distance, transiting the one that the Moore saw. You see, those were five in the sky. But those were only four in the diamond shape. And the most westerly one in the diamond shape went out to the western section of the town at a high rate.
