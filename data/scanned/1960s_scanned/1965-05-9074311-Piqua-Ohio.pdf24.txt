See Saucer,
Shell Splits

It was a cloudy night, but the stars were visible. The students, four youths and three girls, were leaving a Route 495 drive-in theater in Lawrence, Mass., at 5:20 a.m. Directly overhead in the sky, they saw a "flying saucer" which split into two.

The four students, David Kenney of Lawrence, Mass., Robert Dunkin of Methuen, Mass., and Nancy Dagle of Haverhill, Mass., and Roxanne Dagle of Haverhill, Mass., stated they saw this between 8 and 10 p.m.

Ruth, the driver, confirmed Ruth's slight information. The "object" appeared to be a cloud-like hazy light and appeared to be diving toward the horizon. It then seemed to disappear behind the trees. The students started driving home. David said that later, when they were nearing their homes, the "object" reappeared and seemed to follow them for a short distance and then disappeared.
