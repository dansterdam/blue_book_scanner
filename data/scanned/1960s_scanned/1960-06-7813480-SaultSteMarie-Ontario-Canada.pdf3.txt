1. Enclosed is a somewhat damaged 8 mm film which apparently shows a phenomenon of some type. Being as there are no qualified spotting personnel or equipment here, the film is forwarded to you for evaluation.

2. The film was taken by Mrs. ___ on the 7th of June, 1960, between 1900 and 1930 hours, Eastern Daylight Saving Time. The picture was taken in the rear yard of her home in Ontario.

3. Mrs. ___ was using a standard Brownie Kodak camera, 8mm. She was shooting pictures of contrails when she got the apparent image of a disc-like phenomenon.

4. Mrs. ___ was not directly aware of the disc until she received her film back from the processing laboratory, Canadian Kodak Co., Ltd., Toronto, Canada. However, she was aware of a bright object, similar in appearance, rapidly crossing her vision through the lens. The phenomenon's appearance was accompanied by a loud sonic-type boom which was heard by many people in the Sault Ste. Marie area.

5. Also enclosed are four still enlargements of the object which were processed from a second print of the original film.

6. Mrs. ___ would appreciate the return of the film when you have no further use for it. Please return it to this office, and it will be returned to her personally.
