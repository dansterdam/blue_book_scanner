rapid development of radio astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, X-ray astronomy, etc., indicates possibilities never dreamed of just a few years ago. What is said about stellar civilizations today may become obsolete tomorrow. 

The fundamental question whether extra-terrestrial civilizations (or even life in general) exist at all has not been answered in these papers nor in similar papers in the West. Nor the next question, whether man-kind is willing to put so much effort into a search which may well prove futile likewise has not been settled. The Soviets have something to say about this. They rationalize by noting that the development of methods for interstellar communications will be of the greatest advantage to radio technology in general regardless of what the radio technology was originally designed for.

There is also a curious utilitarian streak running through Soviet discussions. In the Soviet periodical ("Sputnik") (1967, Nr.1, p. 179), e.g., the Nobel prize winner, physical chemist, N. Semenonyov, declares that the present knowledge and technology makes possible the regeneration of the atmosphere of Mars which could make Mars a suitable home for humans. Also, some Soviet writers are optimistic that the more advanced civilizations are very anxious to communicate their knowledge to us, even though the Soviets are at times quite unwilling to reveal many of their scientific advancements.
