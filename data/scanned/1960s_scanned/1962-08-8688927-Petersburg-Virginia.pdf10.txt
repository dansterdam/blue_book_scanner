OCTOBER 8, 1962 

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Reference your letter of August 15, 1962. The content of the UFO-sighting report submitted by you on August 15, 1962, has been carefully reviewed. The report contains certain statements and details indicating capabilities that are not consistent with our findings and analyses of similar sightings. Accordingly, the information and evaluation of this particular case reported that the sighting does not constitute evidence of an extraterrestrial vehicle and any additional witnesses.

Your interest in this project is appreciated.

Sincerely, 

W. T. LUCKADOO
Major, USAF
