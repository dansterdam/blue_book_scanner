UFO REPORTS

DATE: 7 September 1965
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler
CHAIRMAN: HICAP Massachusetts Subcommittee

TO: HICAP

Enclosed are a number of UFO Reports investigated by the HICAP Massachusetts Investigating Subcommittee. Over 40 UFO Reports were received by this subcommittee between early July and mid-August.

The majority of these reports were evaluated and found to be a local advertising plane, Echo I & II transits, aircraft seen under unusual lighting conditions and even a large kite carrying a red flare. Other reports were rejected because of insufficient data, witnesses refusing to cooperate and because of our limited resources to investigate reports at a great distance from us entailing travel. Out-of-state reports were completely ignored.

There were several good sightings during this period. Some reports have already been forwarded to HICAP, some are enclosed, and hopefully others will follow. A sample of the identified UFO reports are enclosed. Many of this type never reached the written stage as it would have been just a waste of time.

Respectfully submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler
HICAP Investigator
