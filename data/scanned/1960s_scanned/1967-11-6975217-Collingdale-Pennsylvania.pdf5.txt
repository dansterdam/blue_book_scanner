Dear Sirs:
I am a very firm believer in U.F.O.'s. Just why I looked out the window and saw the constellation of one of the stars (Orion constellation) turned direction on a 90 degree from its normal position, around @ 10:15 PM the night of November 11, 1967. This direction is approximately 10:00 to 7:30 position of the object. The reason I write to you is because just the other night, Nov. 10, at 6:30 PM, I not only saw it but I had this good friend to observe it. She was quite certain that what we saw on November 11 was not the same object, but something else altogether. My age is 13 & my friend is near my age & we read a number of books pertaining to "Project Blue Book" related & Flying Saucers - various business related Edwards, & numerous magazines that come once a month. I have no other observer.
