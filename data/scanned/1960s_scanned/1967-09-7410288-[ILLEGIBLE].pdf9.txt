1. Attempts are made to comply with all provisions of AFR 80-17A. The majority of sightings reported to this base are received from off-base callers who are unable to furnish complete information. Buckley ANG Base is always contacted for corroboration of information reported. However, due to the small number of radar and control tower personnel at Buckley, the assistance rendered in this area is extremely limited.
2. Reference paragraph 3, your letter, the reading of 35Â° reference elevation of the object.
3. This office will continue its efforts to furnish all possible information on each sighting reported.
4. A copy of our UFO report form is attached for your information.
