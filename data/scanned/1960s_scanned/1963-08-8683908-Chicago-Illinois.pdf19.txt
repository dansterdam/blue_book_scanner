The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten page from an old UFO report document. The text appears to describe some kind of observation or encounter with a strange light or object in the sky. The text discusses the object's movements, size, and characteristics, and mentions that it was "a strange light behind the trees" and that "there was a surge of light behind it". The text also mentions that the observers were "helping with high altitude research".

The text found in the document is as follows:

"To Whom It may concern. There was no photograph attached - a light that appeared to the right, 9 o'clock position. At first it appeared low. But after 3-5 min. It came toward us. It broke into a handful of lights - evening downtown. There was a surge of light behind it - about three times the size of the original. The lights separated slightly - then reconverged. It turned slightly to the right and disappeared. The lights were a bright yellow, no flashing or colored lights were observed. The object did not block the stars. This event lasted about 2-3 minutes. Observers were helping with high altitude research. Did a sighting occur to the east on this night?"
