Text from the document:

At 11:52 p.m. on the date stated above, I was awakened by my daughter who had noticed an unusual light in the northern sky, hovering and stationary for about 10-15 minutes. It was a very bright light, more intense and larger than any star. In my opinion it has to be some type of Unidentified Flying Object.

In the field I observed it to be much larger and brighter than the surrounding stars and planets. I watched the object very steadily until it apparently left the area. My wife also witnessed the object and we have discussed it.

We both agree that the object was about 40-50 degrees above the horizon to the north and was round in shape, larger and more intense than any known celestial body. Without me making a word, it appeared to my wife to be the same object I was describing. We watched it for about 10 minutes without it moving from its position.

The light was not pulsating nor blinking, but maintaining a steady bright white light. It seemed to be rotating or spinning slowly. The light illuminated the surrounding area and cast shadows on the ground.

There were no sounds associated with the object. It gave the impression of a structured craft, possibly metallic, although I could make out no details as to its construction. The object gave off no exhaust trails nor did it appear to enter or leave the atmosphere. It just seemed to fade out of sight, possibly by moving away.

I cannot say with certainty just what the object was, but I can state positively that it was not an airplane, satellite, star, planet or any other known object in the night sky. I have observed many types of aircraft, and this did not resemble any of them.
