Major Tyler, Air Force Command Post, Sergeant Dumberton from the 29th Air Division reported that on November 5, 1965, they had an emergency declared on a VC-140 aircraft. The aircraft had 9,000 pounds of fuel remaining and was dumping fuel. Dumberton was interrupted while the aircraft had the wrong indication to be dumping and was actually climbing. A spherical object, approximately 30 feet in diameter, was observed following the aircraft for several minutes before climbing away at a high rate of speed. The document describes the sighting and other details related to this incident.
