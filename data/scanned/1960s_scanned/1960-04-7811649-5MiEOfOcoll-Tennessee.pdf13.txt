Heading out to take Gross to spend the night with the family at Green Acres Inn, the first work to be done the next morning was to secure various items and equipment. As we came out of Highway 20 onto the Lee-side highway it was just a moment. It was brilliant against the evening sky, possibly the size of the moon at its lowest, but much brighter than any moon, and we could not judge the distance or height or diameter of the object. The height could not be judged, but later-possibly its intensity was lowered or no, although it thinks could disappear behind the clouds. It could have been 20 or 30 or 50 miles up. I'm no judge of such things. Any more than you can look at the moon and say how high it is.

The object was brilliant against the evening sky, possibly the size of the moon at its lowest, but much brighter than any moon. The observers could not judge the distance, height, or diameter of the object. The height could not be determined, but it is mentioned that the object's intensity may have lowered or it could have disappeared behind the clouds, and it could have been 20, 30 or 50 miles up.
