As regards apparent brightness or intensity:
The object appeared brighter or more intense than most objects at the point of observation. At no other time during the observed journey did the brightness approach that of the observation at this point. This distinction in brightness was so marked that the observer surmised it must be due to some change in intensity, while the shape and other characteristics remained the same. In intensity, while not uniform, was not such as could be associated with the variation in intensity.
The question arises, what was the cause of this variation in intensity? Could it have been some sort of apparatus or vehicle, or was it any form of reflection? What then do you think it was?

Sincerely,
