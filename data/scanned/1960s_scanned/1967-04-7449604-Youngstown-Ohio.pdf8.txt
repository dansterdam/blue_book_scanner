Dear Sir,

I have finished your questionnaire as best I could and I hope it will be of some help. Also wanted to take you to what it was I saw. It seems like a very unusual matter to what it was I seen, and I would also appreciate if you could send the Project Blue Book because I would like to ask more about the U.F.O.

Sincerely yours,
