Dear Mr. ----,

This is in reply to your letter of July 30, 1964. In which you requested information on an incident which occurred near Wilbur, Washington over your area.

It is not clear whether you were a witness to the phenomena which is described in your letter. According to the file, a citizen of Wilbur, Washington gave an oral report on July 30th. As to whether you observed the sane metallic object, I am unable to determine from the information you provided.

You made your observation and this office will appreciat e any additional details you can provide regarding your sighting. The information you furnished will be made a matter of record.

You properly observed the passage of either one or two metallic objects which were very bright and maneuverable. This sighting was investigated and referred to in the Blue Book files.

Sincerely,
