The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a text document describing the analysis of an unidentified object or phenomenon. The text discusses various photographic techniques and analysis methods used to examine the object, including double exposure, the use of a black background, and microscopic examination of the negatives. The text also references the identification of certain features and characteristics, but does not provide any further details about the nature of the object itself.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 66-14 DATED 16 NOVEMBER 1966.

There are several methods by which this photograph could have been made. These methods could have been used singly or in combination:

A. Positive printing technique, utilizing a positive transparency in register over the negative.

B. Double exposure technique, utilizing the basic scene then painting the camera at a black background and somehow randomly moving a small light source across in front of the lens to obtain the "pulsing" light effect.

C. Recording the basic scene and waiting until lights 1, 4, 7, and 5 are extinguished and then placing one or several small light sources at the scene and randomly exposing the camera. This has the general appearance of strongly suggesting that this camera was deliberately utilized.

Frame #2 - This appears to have been done with two separate exposures, possibly from two different cameras.

Tracings a, b, c, and d are identical in general shape differing only in width. This was accomplished by using an anamorphic lens on the camera, slightly deforming and imaging four separate but similar exposures or patterns.

Frame #3 - The invisible, translucent, and weightless appearance identified as "3" is possibly a third exposure. A microscopic analysis of the frame shows two light image-like patterns within the area marked.

Frame #4 - Within the area marked "1" a microscopic examination of the negative reveals several bright spots and possibly also images of the moon, again indicating multiple exposures.

From #5 - An analysis was made of the length of the apparent exposure time with the actual exposure time. As before, this photograph could be duplicated.
