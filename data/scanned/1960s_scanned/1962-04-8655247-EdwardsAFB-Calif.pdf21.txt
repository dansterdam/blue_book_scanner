MANAGEMENT

Second Air Symposium On Bionics
To Be Held In Dayton Next Year

The United States Air Force sponsored by
the School of Aviation Medicine, Aerospace
Medical Division, the Office of Research Analyses, Air Research and Development Command, and the Wright Air Development Division, Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, May 21-23, 1962, a Symposium on Bionics. Participants included members of the Aerospace Medical Division, the Institute of the Aerospace Sciences, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and representatives from universities, foundations and government agencies.

Bionics is a relatively new, and rapidly advancing science since its introduction in the late 1950's. A new area of inter-disciplinary research, bionics seeks to apply the principles and mechanisms observed in biological systems to engineering problems. This knowledge derived from the study of biological systems is applied to produce new devices, components, and systems.

APGC Closes An Era
With Last OF-60's Flight

An area closed at Air Proving Ground
Center recently when the last OF-60
target drone being flown over the
Little Gulf was scheduled to land. The
last OF-60 flight was made on March 29.

The first and final OF-60 drone
flights were made in 1957 and 1962
with Col. Ralph W. Crissey and Capt. Owen C. Daris, Jr.
conducting the OF-60 from the Little
Gulf Operation area at Eglin AFB.

The drone was retrieved and returned
to the team of Camarata, May, and Igo,
who were responsible for the OF-60
program at the Armament Test Division.
AF and MAC officials were on hand
when the last OF-60 drone was landed
on April 5, 1962. This last vehicle is
now stored at the APGC as a museum
piece.
