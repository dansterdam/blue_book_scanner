DEAR SIR:

THIS IS IN REGARD TO A PHONE CALL I HAD WITH A MR. JUSTIN O. GARRICK SOME TIME AGO. I HAVE JUST NOW BUT WAS ASKED TO WRITE YOU AND CONFIRM WHAT

ON THE CORNER OF W. RIDGE AND W. PETERSON ARE THERE IS A BUILDING WHICH SOME FOLK CALL THEMSELVES FROM BUILDING OUT IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE WITH SEVERAL NEIGHBORS. IT WAS a SIGHT WHICH WAS VERY BRIGHT WHICH LOOKED LIKE A LIGHTED CIRCULAR OBJECT IN THE SKY WHICH SEEMED TO WATCH OVER OUR HOUSE VERY INTENSELY. HE SAID THEIR WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY AND HE THINKS POSSIBLY IT COULD HAVE BEEN A HELICOPTER AS THEY SAW IT AS a SINGLE OBJECT HOVERED OVER THE BUILDING AND THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WHAT WE BOTH SAW AND SAY ANY DAMAGE MAY HAVE BEEN THIS.

YOURS TRULY
