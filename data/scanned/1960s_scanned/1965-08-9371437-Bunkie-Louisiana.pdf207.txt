The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing text describing a sighting report.

The text in the document is as follows:

3 AUG 55

Ellsworth, 3 Dakota. About midnight the 24th Bomb Wing advised that they had observation. 10 miles away for 17 minutes, visual observation, appeared as a bright light, no particular actions.

Best description of object would be a ping pong ball in a box bouncing around, very jerky and bouncy. Maj McKlerian, ext 2761 will have the observers call us.

Maj McKlerian said that the object picked up on radar was a slow moving aircraft, 20 miles south tracked east. Slightly slow moving cargo.
A 2lt Weller said that their were four to seven visual reports seen at the same time. More information will follow.
