There is a photograph present in the image. The image shows a handwritten sketch or drawing of an unidentified flying object that the witness observed. The drawing depicts the object as having a general saucer-like shape with some lights or reflections around it.

The text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, and remained standing of for several minutes, and then seem to go slow back at first but when we turned the car around and attempted to drive towards it, it seemed to fade away very quickly. We were driving around the town itself.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) YES NO Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: only telephone poles and wires.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) YES NO Don't know. If you answered YES, then tell what: the opposite hill slope of the valley.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound noise that could be heard above our idling engine.
b. Color only lights; red, green & a greenish-white.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? a single light, a small fraction of the total area.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
