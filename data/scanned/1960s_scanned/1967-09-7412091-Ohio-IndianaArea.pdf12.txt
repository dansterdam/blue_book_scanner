The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, likely describing a sighting of unidentified flying objects.

COMMENTS: Sighting #1: Another aircraft apparently sighted object #1. The time of the sighting was given as 08382 and duration as 10 seconds. Also a ground-visual sighting was made at 09450. They indicated course was NE and duration as 10 seconds. Because the initial observer stated that this object was in view at 08382, it is quite possible it could have been the same object seen at 09450. Sighting #2: Appears to have been a meteor-like object seen by another observer that he thought may have been a satellite.
