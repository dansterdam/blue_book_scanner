Dear Sirt

This refers to the visual of saw your echo satellite july 15, 1962.

ECHO SATELLITE JULY 15 1962 
11:16 PM

PATA ECHO SATELLITE
11:16 PM

The visual observation was made to determine the movement and to further identify the object in sky. The object was traveling east to west and climbing slightly. It was moving at a high rate of speed and appeared to be larger than a star. When the object was near the horizon it faded from view. Does the sighting you received an have any material that would assist in identifying the visual sighting? I would appreciate any information you might be able to give me on this incident.

Sincerely yours,
J. D. Jones
