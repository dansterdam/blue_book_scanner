SUBJECT: REPORT ON U. F. 0. DATA SIGHTING - BOYDTON, VIRGINIA

TO: GEORGE F. CONLON
BOYDTON, VIRGINIA

RE: YOUR LETTER OF 29 JANUARY 1962

YOUR REPORT OF THE UFO SIGHTING ON 7 JANUARY 1962 HAS BEEN RECEIVED AND REVIEWED BY THIS COMMITTEE. THE DETAILS OF THE SIGHTING AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR LETTER APPEAR TO BE OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST TO US, AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION.

BASED ON THE DATA FURNISHED, IT APPEARS THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS PROBABLY OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN. HOWEVER, FURTHER INVESTIGATION WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION. IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR EVIDENCE THAT COULD ASSIST IN OUR ANALYSIS, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO FORWARD IT TO US.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION IN THIS MATTER. WE WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU SHOULD WE REQUIRE ANY CLARIFICATION OR HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

SINCERELY,
THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
