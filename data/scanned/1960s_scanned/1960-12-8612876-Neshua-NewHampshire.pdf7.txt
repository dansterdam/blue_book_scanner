The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text. The text appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The handwritten text states the following:

"That saucer shaped craft a double space cover gray gary metal"
"By the way I am a member of the EATS of Concord and some claim that the Aircraft I saw was in fact the Concord and was visiting the area, which I doubt, for the craft seemed quite small and maneuverable."
