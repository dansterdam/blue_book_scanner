The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The page contains a questionnaire-style form with various questions about the observed UFO phenomenon, including whether the object moved in a straight line, changed color, made a noise, etc. The witness has provided handwritten responses to these questions. There is also an open-ended question at the bottom asking the witness to describe what drew their attention to the phenomenon.

14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
When the object came directly over, I could see it was not an airplane or satellite. It was a solid object, about twice the size of a car, and appeared to be hovering. The glow around the object seemed to attract my attention. 

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Flew off.

B. DID THE OBJECT MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? 
YES   NO
