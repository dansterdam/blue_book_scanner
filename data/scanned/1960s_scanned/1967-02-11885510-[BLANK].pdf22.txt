This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document discussing a controversy over Soviet astronomers' classification of cosmic radio sources STA-21 and STA-102 in the California Institute of Technology Catalogue of Cosmic Radio Sources. The text describes the debate over whether these sources should be considered as satisfying the requirements of "civilizations of Type 3" and the doubts raised about the periodic variation in the radio frequency of STA-102 being an artificial signal.

rational way.  All this setting up of criteria is highly
arbitrary as it presupposes complete understanding of radio
astronomical processes which is hardly the case. 

An illustration of this humble truth is the controversy
produced by Soviet astronomers over STA-21 and STA-102, that
is, Nrs. 21 and 102 in the California Institute of Technology
Catalogue of Cosmic Radio Sources.  They were hastily declared
as satisfying the requirements of civilizations of Type 3, and
some more of such, LHE-210, LHE-459, and LHE-523 were found at
GAISH.

So far as the situation with STA-102 is concerned much
doubt has been thrown on Kardashev's claim that its period
variation in radio frequency should be considered as an
artificial signal with a period of 100 days, drawing our
attention to this galaxy.  Astronomers in the West failed to
confirm its periodic variation and it is generally considered
now of the quasar type, that is, a perfectly natural, although
not yet perfectly understood, object.

Yu. N. Parijskij investigated, on Kardashev's request,
sources STA-21 and STA-102 with the great Pulkovo radio tele-
scope (Byurakan Conference, pp 54-60), but his conclusions are
hardly in favor of the artificial origin of the radio emission
from these two sources.  He finds that their radio properties
