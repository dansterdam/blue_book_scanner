Gentlemen:

On the night of September 9, 1964, a flight of four UFO objects were observed over the West End area of New Jersey. We have received reports and descriptions of these objects from numerous reliable sources. The approximate times and descriptions of these objects are as follows:

8:45 p.m. - A fast moving shining (or glowing) object, one of four identical objects, was observed.
8:50 p.m. - A fast moving shining (or glowing) object, one of the four, was observed in shape.
9:00 p.m. - A group of four objects different from the previous two were observed.
9:43 p.m. - The objects closed and were off - a white light, stationary; shape that was elliptical.
9:45 p.m. - The objects came from the NE and went W.
9:46 p.m. - A circular object came out the NE and went W.
10:25 p.m. - What appeared to be the same object again.

The reason is all not write because we believe our newspaper people may have been confused by the sightings and we do not want any premature publicity. We think anyone would be confused by this many sightings. We are looking into this and will advise you for any reports of significance.
