On 22 March 1967 the crew of a Brazilian Air Force C-47 and the crew of a Brazilian Air Force F-86 aircraft were approaching Vinhedo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, southwest of the city. The object was initially sighted by the F-86 pilot and subsequently by the C-47 crew. The object was described as a reddish-colored full moon that appeared to be at very low altitude, and the tower asked the C-47 aircraft to intercept and identify the object. The C-47 crew made several attempts to contact the object but pursued it for some time before it finally disappeared. No pictures were taken of the object.
