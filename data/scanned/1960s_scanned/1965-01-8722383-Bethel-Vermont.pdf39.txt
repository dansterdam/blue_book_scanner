The text from the document is as follows:

Miss Catherine Martinka, Bethel, Vermont, had a strange experience on the night of August 15, 1965, about 8:00 p.m. According to her report, she was watching television when suddenly the set went off. She then looked out the window and saw a bright circular or oval object which seemed to be hovering over the area. The object was bright white in color and seemed to have lights around the edges. It remained in place for about 5 minutes and then moved slowly to the east and disappeared. Miss Martinka reported that during the time the object was visible, the television set remained off. She said the object was about the size of a full moon and that it gave off no sound.
On the same night, at about 9:00 p.m., a similar object was observed by Mrs. Louis Gravel, who lives about a mile from Miss Martinka. Mrs. Gravel reported that the object was circular in shape, bright white in color, and that it seemed to have lights around the edge.
The diagram appears to show some kind of flight trajectory or path related to the reported UFO sighting.
