Here is the text from the document:

"About, 9:10 a small missile shaped craft about 100 ft length shapped like a space ship with a tail, no light. Coming along the horizon. so fast 20 minutes later disappered. It stoped, hovered, then went down at a steep angle and vanished. it was dark so could not details well see within the next 15 min. I had never seen anything like this, within its speed and sudden disappearing act , startling its near silence and the manner of its flight. It traveled out of sight smoothly and swiftly."
