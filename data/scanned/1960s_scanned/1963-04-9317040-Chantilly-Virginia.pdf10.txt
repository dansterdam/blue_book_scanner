Dear Miss

Enclosed are the completed forms we spoke of on
the telephone April 19.

I would like to do a story on Project Blue Book
in general, regarding it as a possible means of public
information and revealing certain personal color
to the things and perhaps make it more interesting to my readers.

Thanks very much for your help. I'll look forward
to hearing from you when you have done the information on the subject.

Yours truly,

Peter Truman
