Right.
Do you recall what your altitude was at this time? 
6000.
And what was the altitude of the object?
Between 6500 and 7000.
And at this time how close do you estimate you were? 
I would guess between 3 and 5 miles.
During the complete observation, in regard to the flight path,--was it--did it travel from one direction to another?
Well, it was standing practically still in the sky. It seemed to be in a little rocking motion which would be caused by a little gust of wind and there were other times when it would rock down flat to where it looked much further away, but it was standing still. When it began to move, it went straight up like an elevator for a little and then disappeared. I think perhaps in a twinkling, possibly in the neighborhood of the Utah Lake area, almost directly over the position of the Utah Lake. Just as it reached up overhead, I turned on it and made a turn toward the west on a heading. I would imagine about 250* heading and after I had turned it out of sight and I could no longer observe it.
At this time could you get an estimate of the speed, or was it too fast?
Way too fast. When it did decide to go, it really went; and it was clearly visible and disappeared going away from me in a period of a second or two at most.
In relation to the speed of manned aircraft, say possibly 300 mph, would it be:
Oh, much faster. I would say probably up in the thousands. The acceleration was extremely fast. Almost like it was being fired by a rocket or something, except that there was no trail, no vapor, nothing visible in the way of our observation.
Was that the case both when it was moved straight upward and then when it moved out of sight?
When it moved straight up it went much more slowly, and it seemed to move at a steady pace. It didn't seem to be accelerating greatly as it went up. But when it disappeared, it was quite instantaneous, I would say that it covered the area from the inside the point of the valley to over the top of the hill in this twinkling of an eye.
