Object (OBSERVER'S ESTIMATE) silver in color, 10' to 20' in diameter, motionless for a duration of two to three seconds before disappearing. Observer claimed silently rising at an oblique angle with a slight bluish-white trail. Wind and visibility conditions were favorable making long range and duration observation difficult. Location of object in the clear sky and duration of observation make its classification as a meteor extremely doubtful. The observer was a local businessman, reputable and observant.
