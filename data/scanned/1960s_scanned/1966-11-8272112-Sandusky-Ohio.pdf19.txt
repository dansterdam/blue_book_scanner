The image contains a handwritten letter and a simple sketch of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified flying object. The letter describes a sighting of a bright object in the sky and mentions the U.F.O. (Unidentified Flying Object) seen on the evening of November 8th, 1966 in the Sandusky, Ohio area.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

To Whom It May Concern

On November 8, 1966 at 7:30 p.m. my wife and I were outside and observed the brightest object we have ever seen in the sky. The object was very strange and moving very fast. It would hover and then dart around making sharp angular movements with great speed. The object appeared to be round and silvery in color. It would ascend straight up and then dart around the sky at unbelievable speeds. It remained in view for approximately 15 minutes. We watched it with great interest and amazement. The object was very high and we could not hear any sound from it. I would be very interested in your comments on this incident.

Sincerely Yours
