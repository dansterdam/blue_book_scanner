14 October 1962
Formosa, Argentina

The text in the document states:
"The object appeared suddenly in the sky. It attracted the attention of people down the road by its unusual maneuvers. It turned, sharply changing direction, and seemed to be oscillating or vibrating as it moved rapidly across the sky. It was a bright light, larger than a star, and finally it disappeared over the horizon. The object was seen at a distance of about six miles southwest of Formosa, Argentina by an unspecified number of people. The report indicates that the observation was close at hand, with the object displaying unusual and fast maneuvers."
