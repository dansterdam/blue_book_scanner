The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with instructions for the observer to draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon observed, including any details that might have been seen. The text at the bottom of the page instructs the observer to indicate the size and position of the observed object and to estimate what fraction of the sky it occupied at the time of the sighting.
