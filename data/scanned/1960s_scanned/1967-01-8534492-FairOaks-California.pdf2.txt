The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an illustration of a sketch and a small compass-like diagram. The sketch shows a horizon line with an object above it, and the compass-like diagram appears to be a visual aid for the questions in the text below.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it. Place an "H" on the skyline to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
