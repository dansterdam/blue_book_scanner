4. SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: This object was sighted twice - once at 1830-1845 hours and again at 2030-2100 hours. It appeared as a bright light in the sky, hovering and making rapid movements. At one point it appeared to emit small lights. Despite repeated observations, no definitive identification could be made. It did not have the characteristics of any known aircraft. Ground witnesses were able to observe the object through binoculars and provide additional details. The object's unusual movements and inability to conclusively identify it as a known object led to the conclusion that this sighting was UNIDENTIFIED.
