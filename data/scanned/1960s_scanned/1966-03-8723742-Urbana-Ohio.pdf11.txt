Text from the document:

In the first place my wife seen it first. She was woken up by the humming sound. She then got me up.

I was sleepy, but I could remember it as well bright. I figure it was the morning star.

The next morning I realize it was a airplane. looked like jupiter in the winter mornings and it was high in the western skies. And I didn't see it the next night.

I'm sorry this is all the information I can give you. But the time I had a small telescope.

I have been watching the skies at times. But I haven't seen anything as spectacular as that any thing I see as soon as possible.
