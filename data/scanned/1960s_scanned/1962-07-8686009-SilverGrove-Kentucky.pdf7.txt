The image contains two sketches or illustrations. The first sketch depicts a curved trajectory of an object in the sky, with a ray-like pattern emanating from it. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road, with buildings and trees in the background.

In the first sketch, the instructions indicate that the viewer should place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. The viewer should also place a "B" on the sketch to show how the object appeared when you last saw it.

In the second sketch, the instructions indicate that the viewer should place an "A" on the position where the object was when you first saw it. The viewer should refer to a smaller sketch on an example of how to complete this task.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch on an example of how to complete this.
