UCHSTONES IN VERSE 
Officials Trip Over Selv
Trying to Identify Objec
Why is it that man refuses to believe 
in the unknown? Last Monday night, 
July 12, 1965, I believe I saw an object 
that man refuses to accept. The object 
was seen in four states according to 
the newspapers, of. I being
myself.
I was later told by the Air Force 
that it definitely was a balloon. Because 
of the altitude it was estimated at, it 
couldn't have been a balloon. It was 
estimated at the hundreds of feet in 
diameter.
A day later the Air Force then said 
it definitely was a balloon, but they 
didn't know where it came from. 
How definite is definite if one day 
they make a statement and the next
day they completely contradict them-
selves?
This incident, as you can see, must 
bear the full name and address of the 
writer. All names and addresses will 
be withheld from publication.
Readers: Are they trying to hide some-
thing from the public? It seems that 
way.
Then another official said it was 
the planet, Venus, but I say it was 
Venus since it moved east to west as 
planets do. Why did Venus then
move from east to west back to east?
It was repeated when the
night as similarly, another object was Sighted and it did these things.
Brains don't do these things.
It was a satellite. Its satellite's orbit
didn't altitude of only 80,000 feet. I
didn't see any satellite.
Finally, I saw the object through
my binoculars, which magnified it con-
siderably. Since when, at that altitude, . 
would a balloon show up so vividly 
and come! And it looked like a planet?
or even a star?
What can civilian would you call it?
