AFFIDAVIT

This is to certify that the following statement is a true account of my personal observations regarding the evening of May 25, 1960. North Miami, Florida:

My neighbor called me over to her front yard to observe an unusual object, located over a house approximately a mile away.

After watching said object for several minutes, my observation was that it suddenly appeared to change position and it seemed to halt and hold its position for about 20 seconds. Then it appeared to take off at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing from my point of view. The approximate size of the object was estimated to be about 12 inches (15 inches). As it seemed to return to its original position, I endeavored to acquire any height, shape, or sound that would enable me to further identify the object, but was unable to either see or hear anything at all.

I am firmly convinced that it could not have been a plane, as it's movements within the rifteen or so seconds seem to be an impossibility for any known aircraft. It seemed to me, and the stars.

Sworn to and subscribed to before me a Notary Public, this 1st day of July, 1960; at North Miami, Florida.

My license expires April 17, 1961.
