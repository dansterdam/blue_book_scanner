P5B1
Pocatello, Id.
11 Nov. 1965
It is requested that I provide information-
concerning the sighting of an unidentified aerial
object observed on the night of 8 November 1965.
At approximately 7:00 p.m. (17:00) on the above
date, I was outside my home when I observed a bright
light in the northern sky. This light appeared to be
moving in a northerly direction at a very high rate
of speed. It continued in this direction for several
minutes, then changed course and headed in a westerly
direction. During the time I observed this object,
it exhibited a very rapid rate of speed and appeared
to be at a very high altitude. At no time did I
observe any sound emanating from the object.
