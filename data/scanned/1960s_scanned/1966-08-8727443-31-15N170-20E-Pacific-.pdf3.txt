This sighting like another recently reported by another aircraft in the same general area in the last six weeks. No reports were reported by only one aircraft.

In addition an informal conversation with a Pilot who was hitch hiking on a WAC C-124, while to Hickam, on the morning of 7 August, revealed he saw an object. Object appeared ahead of the aircraft at 15 miles and continued forward motion at around 6,000 ft. No noise or visual trail of any kind was apparent. Crew was not unduly concerned and made no record or report of the incident. If is interesting to note that this crew incident happened in the same general area as the UFO reported above.
