Dear Sara,

One of the nights of Apr. 29 a car came along the road past our home. As it neared the house, the lights went out for a second, then came back on. The car then slowed down and seemed to float across our field and out of sight. It made no sound and was about 15 feet off the ground.

Sincerely,
Redacted
