DEAR SIR,
ON THE MORNING OF MARCH 12, 1965 AT 4 A.M. NEW YORK TIME, A MOST REMARKABLE OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE. 
IT HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN UP RATHER LATE THE NIGHT OF THE 11TH (MARCH) AND WAS ABOUT TO GO TO BED AND WAS GAZED BRIEFLY UP AT THE STARS. IT WAS A VERY CLEAR NIGHT (MORNING). I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE, A FAIRLY BRIGHT STAR, EITHER STARTED FROM STANDING POSITION, OR SLOWLY HAD BEEN MOVING VERY SLOWLY DUE SOUTH I BELIEVE, OUR PERHAPS SOUTHEAST, IN ONE GENERAL DIRECTION. I CALLED TO MY WIFE TO VERIFY WHAT I THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN "ILLUSION". SHE TOO SAW THE OBJECT MOVING. IT WAS EXACTLY AS THOUGH A STAR WERE DRIFTING IN SPACE, NO SMALLER, NO LARGER, JUST A WHITE SPARKLE, AND ABOUT AS BRIGHT AS BRIGTEST VENUS WHEN IN POSITION.
