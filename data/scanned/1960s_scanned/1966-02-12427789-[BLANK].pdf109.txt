The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of text describing an unidentified inflatable, object that was sighted near Dover, Delaware on October 25, 1955.

According to the text, the object was reported to be approximately 15-20 feet long and white in color. It was described as a "mysterious" and "unidentified" object. The text discusses how the object was detected by radar and that Air Force officials from Dover Air Force Base were investigating the incident. The text also mentions that the object did not appear to include a "primary target" or "device for guiding radar", and that it was made of some kind of material, possibly aluminum, and was partially inflated.
