Although I did not see a definite shape, this object, I properly be classified as such, did not move in front of anything and appeared to be solid. I wear eyeglasses and the object through 7 x 50 binoculars which did not reveal or clue to its identity. The area was exceptionally quiet and heard no sound of any kind during the entire sighting. The size of the object was comparable to a baseball held at arm's length and appeared to grow smaller as it receded toward the east. I was outdoors during the entire sighting in a residential area of the city and was facing east when the object appeared. The sky was clear with a few stars, full moon, no clouds or wind. The weather was dry and cold. No one was with me at the time of the sighting. I cannot estimate the speed or direction of the object although the slowness and sharp turn made by it in my opinion, rule out a conventional aircraft. The 2 identical flights over the city and vanished in the area it first appeared. Each flight took approximately 1 minute. I have enclosed a sketch as well as a print of the object because it was not distinct enough to be studied the object through binoculars and did not show up, however, the slide when projected shows a purple glow or aura surrounding the object. Any information you can give on the nature of this object would be appreciated.
