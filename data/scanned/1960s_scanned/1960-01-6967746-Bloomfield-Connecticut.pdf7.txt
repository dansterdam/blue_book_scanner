Location: West Stafford, Connecticut  
Date: 8 April 60  
Hour: (3) 5:00 P.M.  
WX: Clear Sky - Day
Description: Star like object of a white or silver color, approximately 3 to 5 meters in length, moving erratically in a zig-zag pattern in the sky. Object hovered motionless at times, then resumed erratic movement.
Duration of Sighting: 5-10 seconds  
Direction of Motion: west to east
Satellites: (AGCIN-69, Thor# 6.9231) - Negative
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Weather conditions precluded observations  
Radar Analysis (AGCIN-431): Negative  
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): -  
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Negative  
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Unreliable  
Analysis and Conclusions: It appears that the object observed was either a satellite or missile rising and descending or a random optical effect (reflection, refraction, etc.). The erratic motion and short duration of the sighting tend to indicate that the object was not a conventional aircraft. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the object was an unidentified flying object.
