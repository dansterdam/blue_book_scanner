The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a "circular, disc-shaped object" with a "short, stubby, horizontal vapor trail or tail, like a rocket". This is described in the text where the witness is asked to "Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects" and provides the details of the observed object.

Regarding the text in the document, here is the OCR output:
