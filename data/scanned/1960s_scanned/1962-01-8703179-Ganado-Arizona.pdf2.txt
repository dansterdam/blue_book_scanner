The image does not contain any photographs. However, it does contain a typed report on a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet. The text of the report is as follows:

"We (a group of us) have seen this object quite a few times. It is seen a defined object (ASST-11460203) which is triangular in shape, and has been reported by many people in this area. It was an aircraft of some sort, but I would hesitate to call it a space ship or something the like. It is a little worth of saying, that to the best of my knowledge it was not of earthly origin -the time, a definite rapid speed, and a strange brand of flying leads me to this conclusion. It was first sighted and viewed with the naked eye to be a very strange and peculiar sight."
