35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire:

Tonight, all the sightings had me heart about 1:00. I was not sleepy as I watched the object come directly overhead at about 3:30. The object appeared directly in the east coming in very low. It seemed to hover in trouble trying to keep it's elevation. I tried very hard to go up, but it would go up a short way, then come down again. It continued the operation for quite some time. However, all the time, I was making an observatory about over the air base to the west. The object seemed to be communicating a cable or some object to the west. It would go up, then come down. The scene was not such 20 to 30 seconds upon separate time. (Estimate) Just as the object started to show light in the east a large object appeared.
