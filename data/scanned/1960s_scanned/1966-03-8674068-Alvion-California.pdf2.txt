This image contains a photograph analysis report from Project Blue Book related to "Unidentified Flying Objects" observed in Pt. Cabrillo, California on March 23, 1966. The report indicates that two color slides were provided as part of the photography, but the quality is described as "Poor". The analysis concludes that the exact nature of the imagery could not be determined, but the main group of lights suggest a "tower-like" configuration which may have been emanating from an attached building. The report is signed by Thomas E. Davis, Intelligence Research Specialist, and Wilber Price, Jr., Chief of the Photo Exploitation Division.

DATE: 23 MAR 66
PHOTOGRAPHY: AF F NRS: TWO COLOR SLIDES

2. ANALYSIS: Although the exact nature of the imagery could not be determined, it is believed that it could be that of a lighthouse. The photography was accomplished in the dark hours between 0630 Z and 1000 Z time. The main group of lights suggest a "tower-like" configuration which could be a lighthouse at Pt. Cabrillo. The light which is adjacent to the "tower" could be one which was being emanated from an attached building at it's base.
