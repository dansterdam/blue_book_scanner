REPLY TO UFO Sighting (Newtown, Ohio) 

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (Ms Gaines) 
Case D C

1. Reference the attached report regarding a sighting by Mrs C.M.G. on an unidentified flying object on 27 Jan 64.

2. The information indicates a meteor observation is more likely. The object is described in the witness statement as having a relatively slow speed and some irregularity of movement and color change which is inconsistent with a typical UFO sighting. Therefore, it is suggested that the evaluation may be completed.
