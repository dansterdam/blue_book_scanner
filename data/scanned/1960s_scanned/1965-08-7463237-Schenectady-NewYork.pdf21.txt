There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a document or report, likely related to the Project Blue Book UFO investigation program.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe all the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  19  Day  8  Month  1965  Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Let me add related plates please send descriptive information.
