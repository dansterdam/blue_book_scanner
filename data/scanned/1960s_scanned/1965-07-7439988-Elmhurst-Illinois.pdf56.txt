Dear sir:
This is a follow up to my conversation with a member of your staff this morning. As I indicated, I wish to make an informal report of an unidentified flying object I observed at approximately 7:40 pm on 7/9/65. 
The object was gray in color, disc-shaped, and approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed moving from east to west at a very high rate of speed, approximately 1500-2000 mph. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute and 45 seconds before it disappeared from view.
As I indicated, I realize this report may not be official and may have little value. However, I felt it was important to record my observations, as this is the first time I have observed such an object. 
Thank you for your attention in this matter.
Sincerely,
[redacted]
