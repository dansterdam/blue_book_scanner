May Have
'Shot' UFO
"It could be a UFO," so said a government agency which studies UFOs for evidence of interplanetary flying devices. The agency stated that a "City Youth" in Fitchburg, Mass., recently photographed a UFO.
This was the first time, according to the agency, that a "lay" person has been able to obtain a photograph of a UFO. Usually, when they are observed, they vanish before any pictures can be taken.
The agency stated that the photograph shows "definitely" an unidentified flying object. It was examined and analyzed at length by the agency in an attempt to identify the object. They concluded that it could not be identified as any known type of aircraft.
The agency went on to say that the object, "which still bears the 'story unidentified'," is interesting from a scientific point of view and the government agency is continuing its studies with the photograph.
