SAUCER WITH LIGHTED WINDOWS IN PARAGUAY: Of the dozens of good sightings made by people throughout Paraguay, one of these witnesses comes to again only a very small part of the night from 2300 to 0430 of 13 Jul 65. The object was observed for about five minutes and was close enough for the witnesses to distinguish clearly - it was round, about five meters in diameter, and was divided into eight or more sections of lighted areas which traveled in a patterned manner, much like sections of a revolving door. The color of the object alternated between blue, white, orange, and red. No sound was heard. The object maneuvered in the sky, stopping at times and then moving again. The object disappeared in the direction of the mountains. The color of the lighted areas varied as the object maneuvered, and several witnesses saw the object twinkling like a star as it went behind clouds.
