There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text-based observations and descriptions.

FACTUAL OBSERVATIONS:
(1) The size of the objects when directly overhead had a relative diameter of approximately 1/3 to 1/2 that of the moon's diameter or about the size of a dime.
(2) The objects' formation increased in size approximately seven to ten times.
(3) The time of final observation was 8:55 pm CST + 1/2 min.
(4) The objects were circular.
(5) The reddish-orange pattern was maintained by the objects for the duration of the observation.
(6) The color of the light received by us was orange-yellow when they were at lower sizes and bright white when first sighted.
(7) The objects made a smooth maneuver, turning from East to West.
(8) There was no noticeable wind or sound and visibility was excellent from that time of night.
(9) The moon was about 3/4 full.
(10) All objects were of equal intensity and were glowing when closest.
(11) There was no detectable sound produced by the objects.

NON-FACTUAL IMPRESSIONS:
(1) The objects appeared to be higher than about 500 feet.
(2) If it were assumed that their speed was that of a conventional aircraft (about 300 mph), I would estimate their altitude to be approx. 3000 feet. I do not mean that they were at 3000 feet. I am only trying to establish the angular velocity of their position vectors.
