Proposed reply to letter from John South, 7 May 1967

Dear [Redacted],

This replies to your recent correspondence concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object. Without an exact date or comment concerning the flight characteristics, a positive identification cannot be made. Your report will be filed for information purposes only. 

The Air Force has found no tangible evidence that proves extraterrestrial vehicles exists. After investigating over 11,000 cases since 1947, there has been a total lack of evidence to substantiate the existence of extraterrestrial vehicles flying in and out of our atmosphere.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

R. J. Squireth 3/ May 67
