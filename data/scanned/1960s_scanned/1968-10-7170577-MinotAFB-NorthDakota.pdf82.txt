The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, likely containing a UFO sighting report.

The text in the image is as follows:

DID THE PHENOMENON:
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME? AWAY?
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE DIRECTION?
MOVE ERRATIC?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SMALL IN SIZE?
LARGE IN SIZE?
FLUTTER OR MOVE-?
IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

(The rest of the text is handwritten, and appears to be the observer's description of the UFO sighting. It mentions the object was "very bright" and remained visible for several minutes before finally disappearing.)
