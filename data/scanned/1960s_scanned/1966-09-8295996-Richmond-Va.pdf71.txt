SECOND BARIUM CLOUD EXPERIMENT
LAUNCHED AT WALLOPS

The second of a series of two barium vapor cloud experiments was conducted at 5:31 a.m. EDT today at Wallops Island, Va.

A cooperative project between the German Ministry of Scientific Research and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the chemical payloads were developed by scientists of the Max Planck Institute of Munich, Germany.

Today's experiment was launched by a Nike-Tomahawk sounding rocket. Portions of the mixture of barium and copper oxide were ignited and ejected at three separate times during the flight of the rocket-at about 125 miles altitude during ascent and again at 160 miles altitude during descent. The three distinct green-colored clouds were visible for hundreds of miles.
