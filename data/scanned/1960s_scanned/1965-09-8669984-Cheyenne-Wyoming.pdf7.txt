Object sighted and observed through binoculars to the North of Cheyenne by a group of eight young civilians. The object appeared low on horizon, moving slowly westward, disappearing after about 4-5 minutes. Speed was estimated at 30/100 Edlestone.

Object first sighted by personnel at Golf, who informed two members of the Target Assistance team at a nearby Launch Site. The object was visible and identical to that described in the previous sightings.

The members of the Target Assistance team were informed by the Golf personnel and can produce a very accurate description of the object.

The weather in all aspects was clear with occasional clouds.
