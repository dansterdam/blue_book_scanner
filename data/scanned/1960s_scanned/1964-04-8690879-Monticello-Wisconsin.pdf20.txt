There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, containing handwritten text.

We can talk about this next time I see you. Of course, there is nothing that takes the place of a personal interview, but these are expressive and time-consuming.
By the way, I think the diagram is a pretty good one. We put a lot of work into getting the details for it.
Cordially,
Allen
