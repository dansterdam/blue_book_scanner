Saucer Reports Flood Oklahoma
(Continued from Page One)
craft flying in diamond formation came from Chickasha, Cushing, Shawnee and Chandler, Okla.
Some of the first reports came from Purcell, 30 miles north of Wynnewood, where the highway patrol said an unidentified flying object was picked up on two radar screens early Saturday.
Officers in three patrol cars at Shawnee said they followed the strange craft for 40 miles. They said the craft moved in a northerly direction and changed colors from red to white to blue-green. They said the objects moved from side to side at times.
The Weather Bureau at Wichita, Kan., confirmed reports of a formation of unidentified flying objects over a wide section of south central Kansas early today.
Deputy Sheriff Everett Tucker of Wellington said he and his wife saw one of the mysterious objects moving "rapidly to the north."
Cushing officers also observed a formation of four unusual objects. Their description of the craft changing colors was similar to the description given by Shawnee police.
At Cherokee, Bartlesville, C.V. Barnhill reported a kitelike shaped object with a red light on top.
Sightings also were reported at Wichita Falls, in north Texas, and at Borger, Pampa, Dufrant, Denison and Tulsa, in the Texas-Oklahoma area.
