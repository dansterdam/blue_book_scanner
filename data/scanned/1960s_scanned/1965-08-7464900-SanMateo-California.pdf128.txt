Transcribing the text:

I have given a good deal of thought to the object which appeared over my home on this date in accordance with the details given about a nine-year-old boy's observation for which I received a report from some reliable source to whom I owe this account over my signature.

A few years ago I became familiar with this fantastic theory. I was impressed, not so much by any case that was impossible to reconcile, but the classic case of an object that could come in with tremendous speed and then halt abruptly and depart with equal velocity seemed to me to establish its quality as a machine of some sort intelligent directed. To have it come in at great speeds close over one's home and then depart in a manner which seemed to indicate an intelligent and purposeful course of action with the object maneuvering and returning in a very short time I found strangely difficult to reconcile my understanding of our present known physical laws.

Certain features such as the manner of its entry, its halt, and its departure I found hard to account for on the basis of anything within my scientific ken. Certain peculiarities of light and color were different and seemed to be different. Certainly beguiling it down to a mere will-o'-the-wisp, or a temporary hallucination, or some transient atmospheric disturbance, I could not quite bring myself to do. Striking as only very rare and impressive phenomena can be, this experience has lingered with me. The peculiarities and novelty of its observed manifestation as a machine force me to conclude that we have here an object and a performance not in keeping with current physical laws and not to be rashly dismissed.
