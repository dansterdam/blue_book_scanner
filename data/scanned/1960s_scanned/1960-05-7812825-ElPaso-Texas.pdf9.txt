AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: Biggs AFB, Texas
Initial Report
PAGE 3 OF 3
Paragraph k. Preliminary analysis: Generally the data received from this sighting indicates that the object was in view briefly, as to speed and flight path. There appears to be conflicting information as to the apparent size of the object however, I feel that the obvious distance traveled by the object during this period also conforms to the speed of the object as it is known to explode and disappear. No information in any of the reports indicated that the object was any thing other than an astronomical body.
