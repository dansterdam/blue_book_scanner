Dear Mr. Tack,

This is in reply to your letter of 17 December 1954, reporting an unidentified object observed in June, 1954.

Echo One of the objects sighted was likely some type of bird or aircraft, based on limited information given in your letter. The second object, however, which was described as hovering and oscillating, would seem to indicate the possibility of an uncommon aerial phenomenon.

Since you have additional data, we would appreciate receiving copies of any photographs, sketches or other pertinent information in order that a more firm evaluation of the sighting can be made.

A copy of your letter is being forwarded to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. He has been designated as Astronomical Consultant to the Project Blue Book.

Sincerely,

MILTON W. JACKS
