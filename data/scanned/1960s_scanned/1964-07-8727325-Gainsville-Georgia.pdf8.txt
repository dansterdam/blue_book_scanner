NICHELLE 
Clarkesville, Gal. -
A strange light was seen in
the sky over Clarkesville. Ga.
by several persons on the night of
May 20. 1964. The light was de
scribed as being round and white in
color, and was seen hovering over a
nearby mountain ridge for about
thirty minutes before suddenly 
disappearing.
This was the only event of its
kind reported in this area, those who
saw it were Roger Dinsmore. Tony
Lem's, and Burnett Ridenbpugh.
The three witnesses reported
that the light first appeared around
11:00 p.m. and was pointed out to
then: by Dinsmore, who had spotted
it a few minutes earlier. According
to their statements. the light seemed
to be hovering in one spot and did
not appear to move during the time
it was observed. After about thirty
minutes the light suddenly vanished.
all three witnesses stated that they
could not account for its sudden 
disappearance.
The local sheriff's office was
notified of the sighting, but no fur
ther investigation was conducted
since there was no physical evidence
to substantiate the claim. The wit
nesses were described as being re
liable and trustworthy, however, and
authorities could offer no explana
tion for the strange light.
