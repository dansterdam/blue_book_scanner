The image contains a diagram with a compass-like shape in the center and lines showing different angles. There is also a section of text below the diagram asking the viewer to draw a picture that will show the motion of the object or objects.

In the text section, the document mentions:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please use X to show the ground line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an 0 at the position where you first saw the object and an X at the position where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an 'A' at the beginning of the path, 'B' at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
