PLANE FLYING OVER CITY OF DAYTON MONDAY NIGHT
Date Line 4:15 AM

PLANE CAUSES CALLS
- Strange Lights 
Not Invaders

"Are you sure we're not being invaded?"
That was the question asked many times as telephone calls were made to the police and news media last night. 

The calls were prompted by strange lights in the sky over Dayton. The lights were seen as far west as Brookville, west of here.

Now, a flying object, believed to be a light plane, has been sighted over the city, according to Dayton police.
