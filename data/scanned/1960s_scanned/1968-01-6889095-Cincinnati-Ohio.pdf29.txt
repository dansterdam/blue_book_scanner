The Miami, Ohio 45231
January 26, 1968

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr. 
Air Force Research & Development Command 
Andrews-Patterson Air Force Base
Wright-Patterson AFB, OHIO

Dear Major Quintanilla:

After searching the local newspaper for three weeks and reflecting upon the situation, I feel it as my duty to report a UFO sighting. I deleted them in item at the end of the sighting and left none in item form.

DATE: Monday, January 1, 1968
TIME: 5:20 to 5:30 EST (Checked by wristwatch)
PLACE: My yard, 1448 Narrowsburg Dr., Cincinnati, Ohio
OBJECT: Two bright red lights, about the size of the largest, starry night.
BEHAVIOR: Two bright red lights, as bright as the brightest stars; remained fixed while the other moved swiftly, the motion directly below the first and moved horizontal with respect to the first and then back to below the first. Movement was very slow. The lower one disappeared at 5:30 p.m. The upper one remained fixed, but dimmer, until 5:35 p.m.; when it too disappeared. The movement was directly away until it seemed to disappear in about 15 seconds total.

VISIBILITY: Continuous; Brightness not constant, but seemed to get dimmer about every 4 seconds. No sound; viewed through Binoculars, and no other observations made.

WITNESSES: Mr. & Mrs. (redacted) and Mr. & Mrs. (redacted).
