It appears to be a typed letter from the University of Colorado, Boulder, addressed to "Bob" and discussing the characteristics of a "re-entry" incident that occurred on March 3, 1969. The letter describes the size and shape of recovered fragments and discusses the possibility that the re-entry fragments may have fallen in a densely wooded area, making their recovery difficult. The letter is signed by "GEORGE QUINTANILLA, Jr. Lt Colonel, USAF, Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office".

TDPT (UFO)
March 3rd re-entry

Dear Bob:

Reference your memo of 9 July 1969. It has been my experience that a small, rumble, or a swift is associated with the re-entry of a object.

The characteristics of the sound depend upon the shape and size of the object. Smaller fragments tend to make a swish, larger fragments a rumble; depending upon the shape and density of the object. A swiftly moving object in a straight line will produce a sharp, cracking sound, the smaller fragments, within a much, much smaller radius. 

On the 3 March 1969 incident, we could find no evidence of anyone hearing a sound. The night was cold and clear and the people had their windows closed and there was a light wind. This could be an indication that the re-entry fragments fell in a densely wooded area. The best possibility that the re-entry fragments fell in a densely wooded area, East of the recovery. We have no sound; however, we might be looking in the wrong place for the recovery of the fragments.

Thank you for the article, I will be looking forward to seeing you in the near future.

Sincerely,

GEORGE QUINTANILLA, Jr. Lt Colonel, USAF
