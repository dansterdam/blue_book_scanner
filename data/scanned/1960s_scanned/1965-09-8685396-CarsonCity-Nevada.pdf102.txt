Stars in Their Eyes? Many Insist 'Flying Objects' Seen
Despite Air Force claims to the con-trary, a lot of citizens "insist that they have seen strange objects in the sky that defy identification," the report states.
Dale Johnson, director of the Department of Investigations of the Research Analysis Corp., is quoted as saying that "the Air Force just poo-poos everything."
The report goes on to discuss various sightings of unidentified flying objects, including one in Carson City, Nevada, that was witnessed by several law enforcement officers. It also mentions the "theory offered" that "mystery objects" are present in the skies, and discusses the debate around whether these are real or simply misidentifications.

THEORY OFFERED
Mystery Objects
There All Along?
This is also the theory offered by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, consultant to the Air Force's Project Blue Book, on "Flying Saucers". He says the natural phenomena which cause such sightings are present all the time, but people simply don't notice them until they are pointed out. If you're not accustomed to looking for such phenomena, he explains, you won't see them, but they are there all along -- "right under our noses."

Johnson believes that in the vast majority of cases, people notice "strange lights" simply because the conditions are right to make the lights visible. He does not believe they are witnessing anything extraterrestrial.
