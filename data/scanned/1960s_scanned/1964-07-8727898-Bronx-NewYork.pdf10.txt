The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Major Quintanilla,
As requested, I am forwarding this report for your consideration. The writer, whom I have interviewed, appears to be reporting a sighting of some significance.
Sir:
A private your investigation as soon as possible for two reasons: 1) the writer appears to be describing some experience which he feels is of sufficient importance to warrant serious investigation, and 2) I believe the matter should be handled as speedily and discreetly as possible in order to avoid unnecessary publicity or embarrassment to the writer. From the nature of the report, I anticipate that the writer may be apprehensive about the reception his report will receive, and I would not want any unintended consequences to result from an undue delay in processing this case.
I will be happy to provide any additional information or assistance you may require. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Sincerely,
