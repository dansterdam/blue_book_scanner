Text transcription:

If the Christian world found out people who have visited us from outer space, certainly most of them would turn to God for the answers. But it is still a matter for speculation and confusion for all of us. 

16. Do you from your experience confirm the not christians and people who would entirely reject altogether the messages and revelations?

I think that the men who believe and know would not talk at all to avoid criticism. They would only make statements to their families and close friends for fear of ridicule and just to protect themselves. 

2. I hope this is not true. Martians (sic) seem very gentle going (sic) and scientific men.

3. I don't think they are known. Don't people say that visitors did not behave as normal human visitors do? 

4. This is the most startling question. Do the visitors give any clue as to their origins? Do they come from Earth? or from outer space? 

17. If the visitors to us are so advanced technologically, do you think they would have solved the problem of overcoming great distances or time intervals involved in space travel?

18. I am sure you would have some good thoughts on this. What do you think their motives might be in visiting us?
