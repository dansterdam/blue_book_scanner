Sgt. Dp DEFENSE
WASHINGTON D.C.

Two flying objects were observed at approximately 2:30 p.m. on July 25, 1964, at approximately 5,000 ft. altitude, while flying in a southerly direction over the Washington, Missouri area. The objects were saucer-shaped, silver in color, and appeared to be approximately 20-30 ft. in diameter. They traveled at a very high rate of speed and disappeared in the distance to the south.

The sighting was observed by Mrs. Linda Jaegers and myself, and we consider the sighting to be authentic and extremely puzzling. The objects traveled at such a high rate of speed and disappeared so quickly that we were unable to obtain any photographs. We were within good viewing range and had an excellent opportunity to observe the objects closely.
