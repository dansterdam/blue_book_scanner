There is a photograph present in the image. The photograph appears to show a partially obscured object in the sky that passes through multiple layers of a cloud cover, leaving a trail of white smoke. The text below the photograph describes the object as penetrating a multilayered cloud cover and moving across the horizon, leaving a trail of white smoke. The object then disappears into a black cloud. The text also mentions that the pilot and copilot sighted the object.
