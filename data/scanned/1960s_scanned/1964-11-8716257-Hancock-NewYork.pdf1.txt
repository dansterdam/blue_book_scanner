SATELLITES
Object observed on seven occasions that was moving across the sky faster than the North Star's apparent motion and disappeared. This was regarded as various satellite observations. SATELLITES, Observation of satellites moving into earth's shadow creating the sudden disappearance is a logical explanation due to the absence of further observation. No further investigation warranted.
