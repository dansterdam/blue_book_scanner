As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

10. IF THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE PHENOMENON, HOW MANY WERE THERE? DRAW A PICTURE TO SHOW HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED.

They were apparently the most unimpressive, and may have been the result of an entirely natural condition during the night. Some say its appearance, or the phenomenon rather, was hardly of any great interest whatsoever, as far as they could tell from their observation. They certainly did not feel this was anything of a remarkable nature.

CONDITIONS (Check appropriate blocks.)

CLOUD COVER (Form Wind): THIN, CIRRUS SCATTERED 
PRECIPITATION: NONE

LIGHTING AVAILABLE AT TIME OF SIGHTING OR OBSERVATION
BRIGHT MOONLIGHT, MOON  HIDDEN BY CLOUDS, STARLIGHT

POSITION IN SKY 
IN FRONT OF YOU TO YOUR RIGHT

TO YOUR LEFT TO YOUR RIGHT
(Specify the major source of illumination present during the sighting, such as the sun, headlights or street lights. Also, compare the sighting with other observed objects, like stars. A light or other illumination object may indicate the shape, size, and movement of the sighting.)

12. SIZE AND SPEED OF THE PHENOMENON, INDICATING WHETHER IT APPEARED SMALL OR LARGE, FAST OR SLOW, AND DESCRIBE ITS MOTION IF THERE WAS ANY.
It seemed rather mundane, with trifling maneuvers that were hardly of note.
They were seen quite clearly, but there was nothing remarkable about their behavior or appearance.
There was nothing at all unusual about what they saw in the sky that night, as far as they could make out.
The lights moved in a manner that seemed quite ordinary, and provided no indications of any special or unusual qualities. They came and went with very little to observe that was of any interest.
In short, this incident was considered most unimpressive, and was felt to be a product of natural conditions prevailing at the time, rather than anything special or extraordinary.
