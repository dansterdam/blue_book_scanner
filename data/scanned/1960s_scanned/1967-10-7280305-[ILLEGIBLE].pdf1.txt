OUTPUT TEXT:

10. CONCLUSION:

POSSIBLE "WEATHER" TYPE PHENOMENON. THE UNUSUAL FLIGHT PATH AND GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED SUGGEST THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY SOME TYPE OF WEATHER PHENOMENON RATHER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR ANY OTHER KNOWN TYPE OF AERIAL OBJECT.

TYPE OF OBSERVATION:

VISUAL AND RADAR OBSERVATION. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED VISUALLY BY THE WITNESS AND ALSO TRACKED ON RADAR.

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:

WITNESS OBSERVED A FAST-MOVING BRIGHT OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE CIRCLING OR MAKING LOOPS. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10 MINUTES.

RADAR SCOPE OPERATORS TRACKED THE OBJECT DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD AND NOTED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCLING OR LOOPING WHILE MAINTAINING A RELATIVELY RAPID RATE OF SPEED.

TOTAL EVIDENCE:

INSUFFICIENT TO WARRANT ANY DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION.
