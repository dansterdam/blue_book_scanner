The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 AUG 67
Day Month Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

A strange flow over the farm almost as bright as the moon. A brightly lighted object flying or hovering over the farm for quite a while and giving off blinding light.
