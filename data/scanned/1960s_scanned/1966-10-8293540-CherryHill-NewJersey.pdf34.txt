TDY/UFO
UFO Observation, 30 October 1966

Dr. [REDACTED]
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138

Dear Dr. [REDACTED],

Reference your recent letter of June 20, 1967 concerning the most unusual sighting by the [REDACTED] building on October 30, 1966.

We did receive a similar letter and requested they complete a form 112. We contacted the Goodyear Corporation in Akron, Ohio, but they did not have one of their blimps in the area.

For your information, I am inclosing copies of the correspondence with the Air Force and Mr. [REDACTED], which will indicate that this sighting was not reported to us until several months after the incident. This sighting is being carried in our insufficient data category.

Sincerely,

VICTOR CUPYANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
