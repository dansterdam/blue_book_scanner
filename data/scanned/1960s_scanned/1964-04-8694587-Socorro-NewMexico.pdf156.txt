Air Force UFO Expert to Check 'Saucer' Reports
SOCORRO, N.M. - Dr. J. Allen Hynek, special consultant to the Air Force on unidentified flying objects, is coming to Socorro Tuesday night to begin his investigation of a mysterious flying object that was reportedly seen here early Tuesday morning.

Dr. Hynek, director of the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University, said he would arrive in Socorro Tuesday afternoon. His investigation, he said, would determine whether the object was a real flying saucer. 

The object was first reported to New Mexico Tech policeman Lonnie Zamora, who said he saw the object land and a person appear near it. Zamora said he saw the object this morning before it took off again. 

Officials at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo said they would send Hynek, a civilian scientific advisor to the Air Force, to investigate the reported incident.

The most recent report of the object came Tuesday morning from Lonnie Zamora, a New Mexico Tech policeman, who said he had a call from a "bright, blue, object" about 100 yards away from him. It came down very low, he said, and took off again. It was oval-shaped and had red lettering on it.
