31 March 1966

Miss Sara Hunt
Office of Information
Department of the Air Force
Washington, DC

Dear Miss Hunt:

Finally, enclosed are the three reports on the UFOs I saw on 19 March 1966. There have been some delays in getting these to you by telephone; besides, I've never heard of the Air Force doing anything with such UFO sighting reports, anyway. However, as a patriotic American, and as a retired AF officer, I am glad to still find the reports, and send them in. Maybe some day, God and the Administration willing, things will get somewhere. Open and scientific investigation of these phenomena will, I think, find something of great scientific importance. 

I think that you will be interested in reading these reports, especially since you, too, saw one of those strange objects, according to the reports. As you know, Wright-Patterson AFB and I have a number of findings (alas, from WW-II on) on this matter, and can let me know. I'd certainly appreciate it. If the answer is "sworn free", however, you can forget it, for as yours says as well as for me.

The enclosed are still much information to be picked up from the other witnesses; I did NOT fill in any of the reports from them, as I hardly the the scientific method. If you, and/or Wright-Pat wants these additions, however, as I investigate them further, I'll be glad to provide them. However, while I welcome honest investigators bothering my family, while I welcome honest inquirers bothering only my family's and of my family's, any treatment such as I've been meted out to active duty AF personnel who had the conviction will meet with resistance.

Sincerely,
