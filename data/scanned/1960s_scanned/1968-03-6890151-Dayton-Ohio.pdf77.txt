The image contains a sketch of several unidentified objects in the sky. The objects are depicted as circular or elliptical shapes, with some details around them. There is also text below the sketch that provides some context about the sighting, including the angular size of the objects and the observer's ability to perform a related experiment at the time of the sighting.

TEXT OUTPUT:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE HOLD MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR TREE? THIS WOULD INDICATE ABOUT HOW LARGE THE OBJECTS WERE. IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE EXPERIMENT WOULD HAVE COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
