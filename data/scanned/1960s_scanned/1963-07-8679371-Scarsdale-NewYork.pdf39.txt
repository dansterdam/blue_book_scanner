27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared above the horizon. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show the point at which the object dispped below the horizon (skyline) when you lost sight of it. Place an "A" on the same curved line again to show the point at which you first saw the object.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object was observed to make. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and an "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
