14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object disappeared but details are not provided.

(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a marsh stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the hand of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
The witness estimated that the object would have been completely covered by the match.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially outline or vapor trails or other trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
There is a simple sketch of what appears to be a triangular or boomerang-shaped UFO with an arrow indicating the direction of movement.
