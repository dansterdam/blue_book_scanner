The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a page from a document with handwritten text responding to a questionnaire. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   8  Day    Feb   Month   1967   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The handwritten text appears to be an explanation provided in response to the questionnaire. It describes the details of a sighting, though the specifics are not clear from the text alone.
