The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, with lengthy text describing an unidentified aerial phenomenon or UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

Very annoying to attempt to explain to people. Extremely difficult incident. Very large dim object seen in sky at even, at altitude appeared to take off with burst of speed toward horizon in a zig zag course, moving silently. Object seemed to maneuver very quickly but was seen for about 10-15 seconds before disappearing in the distance. No explanation for it seen. Nothing in sky at the time that could have caused it.
