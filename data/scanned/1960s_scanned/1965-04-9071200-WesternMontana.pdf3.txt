There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book.

Sincerely,

Pittsburgh, Pa. 15221

Incidentally, my attempts have obtained no supporting evidence of its existance - or of the case itself. It has pressed, no doubt, on many details that seem confused.

This report originated from an "unknown" source, and there are no eyewitnesses or other evidence to confirm its validity. The individual who submitted this report claims to have had sightings since the original incident, but is now over 80 years old and has difficulty recalling specific details.

Without further verifiable information, I am unable to confirm or deny the authenticity of this UFO report. The text provides limited details that are difficult to corroborate at this time.
