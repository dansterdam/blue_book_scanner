There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing only a sketch and text.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

a. went further to eastward at a very high rate of speed
b. climbed to an extremely high altitude and continued eastward on a direct course

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and give an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
