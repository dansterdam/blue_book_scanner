Started seeing to the south east in the sky of about 60 degrees - a light appeared to travel at a rapid rate and at times hovering and disappearing from sight. As it approached it seemed to be disc shaped about 15-20 feet in diameter and had a reddish orange color the disc tilted on its edge and seemed to have a white light around its edge as it tilted on edge it changed to orange color again. After tilting on edge it seemed to shoot from that position approximately 20 seconds after first observed it at the above location it also shot off rapidly out of sight and disappeared - seemed to be about 200 yards from observer at that point - with no sound and no trail was observed. Over cast sky with little wind, observer a reliable witness. No further details could be obtained on this sighting due to lack of additional information.
