The image shows a photograph of an inflatable structure in space. The structure appears to be a large circular ring or torus shape, with distinct radial striations or ridges visible on its surface. The caption below the image indicates that this structure is 30 feet in diameter and will be assembled with the 30-foot units shown in Figure 15.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
It is important to note in this configuration, such as this, that the inflatable structures are suitable for a variety of purposes, such as work stands, control consoles, and shelters. And these tend themselves to similar packaging and light-weight capability in the lunar configuration.
Of course, there is the question asked, what do we see in looking at the possibility of space vehicles? We feel the approach we are discussing here with the torus configuration lends itself directly to studies of inflatable structures where we can investigate, on a test-bed basis, the performance of such systems. Using controllable natural periods, and if the characteristics we have as the Apollo planning consider the considerations as the Air Force is now consider the possible future of the Air Force.
Figure 17 shows a picture of the center hub of a 30-foot diameter unit that we are building on corporate funds at Goodyear. This unit will be assembled with the 30-foot units shown in Figure 15.
