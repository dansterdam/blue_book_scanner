The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram with two sketches labeled "Side view" and "Top view". The text indicates that these sketches are meant to show the shape of the phenomenon being described, though no further details about the phenomenon are provided.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:
