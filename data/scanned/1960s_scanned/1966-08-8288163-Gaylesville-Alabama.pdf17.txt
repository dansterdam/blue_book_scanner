ESTABLISHMENT OF MODEL OF THE U.A.P. (U.F.O.) 

COMMENT 1: The "lights" (objects) were seen by my family and me as distinctly as you see the figures which are in their outline. The objects had absolutely no blur and their outline was sharp.

COMMENT 2: I arrived at this solution about two weeks after the sightings, but waited for the Air Force to contact me. The objects they never have done, then made these calculations, and was mightily astonished to discover that the electrical power lines were not noticed by me until May 1967, when I saw them on the extended map while examining the details of sighting when the objects were nearly overhead.

May 19, 1967
