PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 12/0030Z
2. LOCATION: Omaha, Nebraska
10. CONCLUSION: Probable: AIRCRAFT
11. CHIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The officer on duty was attracted to several slow moving lights in the sky shortly after midnight. When nearly overhead, the lights seemed to pause momentarily, then moved off to the northwest. Several other persons witnessed the sane slow moving lighted objects. The description and activity of the objects would indicate that they were aircraft, possibly aircraft equipped with landing lights, rather than UFO's. The actions and course of the objects were similar to those sometimes seen with aircraft under certain atmospheric conditions. The witnesses did not interpret the incident as a sighting of a true UFO, nor do the available facts indicate that this was a case of such a sighting.
