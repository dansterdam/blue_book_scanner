3. COMMENTS: A careful check of the sequence of 8 photographs, appears to be circular in design and to have a domed type upper surface. A cylindrical object protrudes from the upper surface. The image appears to be defocused, as to the camera being of a cheap type, appears to be correct in that the film was not of the best quality. There is no apparent evidence of any L-Vilign, as to the camera being a cheap type, appears to be correct in that the film was not of the best quality. There is no apparent evidence of any L-Vilign, as the image is not distorted from the camera lens.
4. INFORMATION: Information necessary for a more detailed analysis would include focal length of the camera and lens data, which is not available. The image could be sized using the distance from camera to object (not provided). The measurements would be accurate.
