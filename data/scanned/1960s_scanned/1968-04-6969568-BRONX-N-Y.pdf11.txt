The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a form or report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY STOP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE SHAPE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?

SOME TIME

DISAPPEAR

PERFECT ROUND

It appears to be a checklist of observed phenomena related to UFO sightings, with the witness indicating that the object "DISAPPEAR" and has a "PERFECT ROUND" shape.

Below the checklist, there is a handwritten note that says:

"I suppose it is to have some light on the subject, but this time, because the people seem to play the wrong thing."

And in response to the question "How did it finally disappear?", the witness has written:

"Just disappear of my sight up in the air."
