11. COMMENTS - Investigator's note: Per caller, the lights appeared in pairs or groups of 3-5, were round or oval in shape, very bright orange in color, and moving at a fairly high speed. The caller did not think they were flares or aircraft, but could not describe them further. ATIC evaluation: The lights were probably a cluster of burning or chemically-ignited balloons, but insufficient data for definite determination.
