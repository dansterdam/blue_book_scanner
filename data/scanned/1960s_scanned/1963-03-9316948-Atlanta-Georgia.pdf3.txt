The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document from the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C., dated April 5, 1963, regarding a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in Decatur, Georgia on March 23, 1963.

Gentlemen:

METEOR

On the evening of March 23, at almost precisely eight o'clock, a very bright object was observed from Decatur, Georgia. It was very bright, larger than a star, bluish in color and edged with gold. It was round, but was pulled downward toward the horizon.

The object was roughly a third as large as the sun seems to be. It was bluish in color and edged with gold. It was round, but was pulled downward toward the horizon. It also pulled a little out of shape at the top, where the speed seemed faster than at the bottom.

I have watched both papers and magazines for an explanation, but cannot find anything that seems to fit my observation. If you have had other descriptions of this phenomenon, I should be most interested to know what you have been told. This has been an almost unforgettable experience. I have no doubt of my having seen something extraordinary.

I should be most interested to know what I saw. There is no doubt of my having seen something.

Very sincerely,
