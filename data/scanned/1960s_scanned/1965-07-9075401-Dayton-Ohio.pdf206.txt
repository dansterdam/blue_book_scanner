There is a photograph present in this image from the Project Blue Book document. The photograph appears to be a sketch or diagram that shows the motion and direction of an unidentified object or objects.

The text from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "X" on the curve where high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "H" on the show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "S" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
