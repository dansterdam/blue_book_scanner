Proposed reply to letter from July 31, 1967 (Incoming 507.67):

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your letter of July 31 in which you described the various unidentified flying objects which you have been observing since December 1966. 

At this time, we would be unable to undertake a meaningful scientific investigation into your earlier observations. 

If you would like us to investigate your latter sightings of July 4 and 7, 1967, we will need additional information. Upon completion of this included AFD form 6-2, our analysts will undertake a detailed investigation into your observations.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified flying object, please contact the nearest military installation at the time of your observations. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.
