Text extracted from the document:

Dear Mr. ______,

Thank you please return the enclosed form and return it evaluating the additional information on the form would provide.

1. How was the 25 second time determined?
2. Was the duration of the sighting the same for all sightings?
3. Could you indicate the number of times the object was observed to rise?

Your cooperation is appreciated and will aid immensely in the evaluation of your sighting.

When considering the possibility of a sighting being a satellite, please consider the angle at the same angle when moving South to North, and the supplementary angle when moving North to South. This serves to point up the true nature of the observation.

Thank you for your effort and interest.

Sincerely,

C. P. HART
