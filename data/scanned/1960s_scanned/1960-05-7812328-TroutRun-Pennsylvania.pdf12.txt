TROUT RUN, PENNSYLVANIA
May 4, 1960

Mr. Maurice Rice,
Department of State,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Rice:
Since I can not get any direct information to who should receive the following information, I must send it to you in the hope you will direct it to the proper channels.

Last Monday night, approximately midnight, I noticed what I thought was a plane in distress in a general direction from my bedroom, north by northwest. The light which first attracted my attention was of a flickering blue-white intensity. The craft - if it was a craft - maneuvered rapidly and at times grew to mountainous, the flickering inandescence becoming intense and steady. At first, I decided it might be a jet since they do make lights of varying colors. The light - the first one I noticed and at the time the only one, I believed - did what is commonly known as a figure "8". It was this maneuver which made me think the light might be coming from an ordinary craft. Later, approximately one a.m., this one blue-white light was joined by another of an orange-yellowish-white intensity.
The two maneuvered together, first up into the heavens at tremendous bursts of speed, far greater than any jet I had ever seen.
