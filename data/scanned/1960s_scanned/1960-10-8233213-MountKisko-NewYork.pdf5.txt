At approximately 7:37 p.m., Wednesday, October 5, 1960, I was on my way back into the house after coming in from the northeast. As I walk along the driveway, I noticed a bright light in the sky to the northwest. This light hovered there briefly, and then moved rapidly up and to the northeast, out of sight. Soon afterwards, this light reappeared, traveling rapidly from the northeast to the southwest. It seemed to be at about the same elevation as the first sighting, and I observed it for about 10 to 15 seconds as it swiftly passed out of sight to the southwest. The light was a bright whitish-light color, and seemed to be solid and not blinking or pulsating. I am not able to judge its size or distance. I have not seen anything like this before, but am satisfied that it was not any conventional aircraft or satellite. If this is of any importance to your investigation, I shall be glad to discuss it further with you or to furnish any additional information I can.
