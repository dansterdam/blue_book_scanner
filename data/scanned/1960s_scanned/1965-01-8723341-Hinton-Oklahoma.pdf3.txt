On 11/1/64 at 8:30 pm cst I saw a flying object of about the size of a car at low level and quickly through. We had seen something in similar fashion a few nights before but lost it. This time we watched it come in from the west about mile distant and traveled in a straight line across our field of vision for about 60-75 seconds before disappearing into the east. Its motion was smooth and the lights very bright and constant. They were not blinking. The lights were of various colors including white, red and blue. The object appeared to be elongated and rectangular in shape. This is about the best I can describe it. If you need any additional information, please let me know.
