DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

JUN 30 1955

Dear Mrs.

This is in reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects. 

We are enclosing a copy of AF Form 164 which is used for your report on unidentified flying objects. As soon as possible and return it to this office, we will evaluate your report, and you will be informed of the results.

The material that you found in your yard was probably "chaff" material. This is dropped from aircraft as an electronic countermeasure. I am enclosing an information sheet on this subject which will help you gain a better insight into the cause of such operations.

I am also enclosing the current report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force project on unidentified flying objects, for your perusal. I hope this report will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
Chief, Civil Branch
