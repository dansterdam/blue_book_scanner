Easton, Pennsylvania 18042
21 August 1966

In reference to your letter of 10 August 1966 requesting information concerning your observation in June 1966, and regarding your request for investigation as to the stimulus which caused this observation, it would be extremely difficult for our analysts to establish a valid conclusion as to the actual date and time of the incident due to the lack of specific information.
If you could furnish additional information which I trust will answer your questions, it will be greatly appreciated. If you desire to report your observations in more detail, you may do so by completing the attached FID Form 164 and return it in the envelope provided.

Sincerely,

VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR. Major, USAF 
Chief, Project Blue Book
