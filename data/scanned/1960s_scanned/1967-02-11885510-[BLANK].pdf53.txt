APPENDIX II
PLANETARY REQUIREMENTS

If one assumes that the process of the beginning and evolution of life on other planets must be similar to the Earth's (as maintained by Soviet astrophysicist I. S. Shklovskiy). The following series of planetary requirements must be met:

1. "Planets on which life may begin and develop may not evolve too close or too far away from their star, and their surface temperatures must be favorable to the development of life. However, taking into account that a comparatively large number of planets, say about ten, can originate simultaneously with the star, it may be reasonably expected that at least one or two of them may rotate at distances at which the temperature range remains within the required limits. It is very unlikely that the red dwarfs of the spectral class M, and even later subclasses K, would sustain life on their planets since their radiation energy is insufficient."

2. "The mass of an inhabitable planet must be neither too large nor too small. If the gravitational field of a planet is too strong, the original hydrogen-rich atmosphere will not be able to evolve (by a process involving the escape of hydrogen into space) into the oxygen-containing air on which the advanced terrestrial type of life depends; if the gravitational field is too weak, the atmosphere will not be able to be retained."
