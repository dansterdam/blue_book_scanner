DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
A metallic, disc-shaped object, approximately 35-40 feet in diameter, was observed hovering over the northern section of Cape Girardeau, Missouri.  The object was surrounded by a brilliant green glow and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion. It emanated a humming sound and illuminated the surrounding area. The object was seen by all four witnesses for approximately 10-15 minutes before it accelerated rapidly to the northeast and disappeared from sight.
