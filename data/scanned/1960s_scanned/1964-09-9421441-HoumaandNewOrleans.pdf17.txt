EVALUATION OF PHOTO ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

1. SUBJECT: Analysis of visual observations by Capt. John James, USN (Ret), OBSERVER (MODD)

2. By visual observations on the nights of 13 and 15 Sep 64 in the Houma and New Orleans area, Capt. James reports having seen and plotted unidentified lights and objects in the sky. These objects were observed to move at relatively high speeds, make 90 degree turns, and change directions and altitudes abruptly. Occasional hovering was also reported.

3. The objects were observed both individually and in groups of up to 5 or 6 objects at a time. The objects were observed for periods of up to 30 minutes during a given night. Motion and maneuverability of the objects, as described, is not characteristic of known aircraft, satellites, or other identifiable objects.

4. Capt. James has had considerable experience in visual observations of aircraft, satellites, and other objects in the sky, and is considered a reliable and competent observer.
