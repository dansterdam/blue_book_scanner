BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: On 6-26-61 at approx 1000 hrs MWT, a salt lake city tower operator reported a "flying saucer" type object which was observed on SP ground radar and also in the air by a SP air observer. The object was at an altitude of 15,000 to 18,000 feet and was moving in a northerly direction with a speed of about 550 mph. The object disappeared from radar while still in sight of the air observer. Air Force investigation was made and the object could not be identified. There is no tentative explanation that would be satisfactory to account for this sighting.
