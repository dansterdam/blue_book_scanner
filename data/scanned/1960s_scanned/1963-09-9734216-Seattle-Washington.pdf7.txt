Dear Mr. Washington,

This is in reply to your letter dated September 17th. On September 17th you reported a sighting on September 17th.

Of the two sightings you observed, the first was probably an aircraft, possibly your attention was drawn to it due to the unusual circumstances under which you observed it, i.e., it seemed to be maneuvering in a seemingly erratic manner. The second sighting, as you describe it, was possibly a slow moving object traveling in a southeasterly direction at a low altitude on the evening of September 17th.

Sincerely,

Maston M. Jacks
