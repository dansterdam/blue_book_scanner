Investigation Report
Sightings of August 16, 1966

This case began as a TWX from Truax Field to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, concerning sightings by three independent observers of a "moon-like" object. Before investigation of this sighting could take place, a reply to a letter concerning a previous sighting brought a clipping concerning sightings in the Mansfield, Ohio, area on the same date, August 16th.

From the clipping several leads were obtained.

Several calls to the White Cloud Field at Minneapolis resulted in contacting a salesman for the Aviation Company at the field; his report is enclosed. In his report were mentioned radio reports to Rochester TSS.

Other flying services were contacted at Flying Cloud:
Flying Service gave the name of ******* as a witness; he proved to have been a passenger. A man at **** Aviation said he was on the field until 10:00 PM and in a position to see anything that happened, but saw nothing. Tower personnel reported that the tower closed at 10:00 PM, so they were not present during the sightings. A rumor that an object settled on the runway and then take off has not been verified.

A call to Twin Cities International Airport yielded a report of ******** having seen an object; the name of his watch supervisor was obtained.

The St. Paul Pioneer Press/Dispatch, origin of the clipping, could not provide any additional information; the reporter was not known.

Aero Division provided the name of ********.
