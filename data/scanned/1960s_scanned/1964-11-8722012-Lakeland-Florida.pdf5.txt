There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, with handwritten text describing a sighting of an object in the sky that disappeared, possibly indicating a UFO observation.

Text extracted from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 July 1964
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This object looked like a star. It was gone except for a little spot of light left out in space. It disappearrd so quickly it could have been a meteor except the way it disappeared it just seems to have gone up faster than can be seen, and the light itself seems to have gone out rather than just faded away. There was no sound.

P.S. Sorry for the misspelled words.
