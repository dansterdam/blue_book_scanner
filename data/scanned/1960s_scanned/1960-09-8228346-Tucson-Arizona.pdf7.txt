The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

Based on the OCR analysis, the text in the document is as follows:

PARKED SOME 50 FEET SOUTH SOUTHEAST, AT WHICH LOCATION WAS OBSERVED VISUALLY.
THE OBJECT APPEARED AS APPROX 20 FT IN LENGTH, SLIGHTLY CONICAL IN SHAPE, WITH DARK COLOR LIKE THAT OF ALUMINUM. IT APPEARED TO BE SURROUNDED BY A HALO OF IRIDESCENT LIGHT WHICH DID NOT ILLUMINATE THE AREA AROUND IT. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED IN ALTITUDE OF APPROX 1500 FT AND WAS HEADING IN A NORTH NORTHWESTERLY DIRECTION AT AN AVERAGE SPEED OF 70 MPH. IT WAS IN VIEW FOR APPROX 2-3 MINUTES. AT NO TIME WAS ANY SOUND HEARD.
A COMPUTED BACK BEARING PLACES THE LOCATION APPROX 1.2 AIR MILES SE OF OBSERVER'S POSITION. THE OBJECT, WHICH HAD NO DISCERNIBLE SHAPE OR OUTLINES, APPEARED SUDDENLY AND QUIETLY, APPEARING TO HAVE NO PRACTICAL PROPULSION. IT LEFT NO TRAIL OR VAPOR.
IT IS FELT HERE THAT NO ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THIS CASE AND THAT NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED SINCE THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND NOR APPARENTLY ANY LOGICAL REASON FOR CONCERN.
