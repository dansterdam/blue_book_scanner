March 3, 1963

On March 3, 1963, between 9:45 and 9:50 p.m., EST, numerous observers in the Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania area sighted several whitish to bluish white lights that appeared to have orangish-red tails. The majority of the observers stated that there were three objects traveling in a northeast direction. 

These objects were sighted by numerous ground observers and also by several aircraft pilots. Indianapolis FAA Center was notified at the time of the sightings, but did not pick up any objects on radar that could be correlated to the UFOs. The Space Detection Center reported that they were certain that the sightings were the result of the decay of space debris into the earth's atmosphere. The sighting is being carried as a satellite decay in Project Blue Book files.
