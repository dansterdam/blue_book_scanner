October 10, 1963

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in response to your letter of September 30, 1963 related to your observations of an unusual object sighted on September 9, 1963.

Our Foreign Technology Division has investigated your report. Based on the data you believe you observed, it is not possible to evaluate the object with certainty. Your indications are that the object was not an aircraft. We are attempting to pinpoint its closest position to where we can pinpoint the sighting as near a place of reference. This is moving southeasterly from a point north of the city, 67 degrees above the horizon.

Thank you for reporting this observation to us. We are sorry that we cannot enlighten you further.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
