SUMMARY REPORTING OFFICER: The individual contacted who took photo's of a previous UFO in the Neosho, Missouri area is Lt. and Mrs. __. This is the same individual who was given to the Beaver valley times and an article and the photos were released in this newspaper.

On 7 August 1965, this same individual reported he saw a circular object hovering about 30 feet above the ground at a distance of about 500 yards for about 8 to 10 seconds. The object appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. He stated the object was first observed as a blue-green light, then a brilliant white light, and then back to a blue-green color. The object was an estimated 600-800 feet in altitude. The witness stated he immediately grabbed his camera and took 3 pictures of the object. The time lapse from the time he first saw the object until he took the 3 pictures was approximately 30 seconds. The camera used was a 35mm and only one exposure remained on the roll of film. The object was observed for a total of probably 1 minute. When the object started to move, it appeared to accelerate rapidly and disappeared in 8 to 10 seconds. The witness stated he could not tell if the object was rotating or not. This was the first time the witness had ever observed such an object.
