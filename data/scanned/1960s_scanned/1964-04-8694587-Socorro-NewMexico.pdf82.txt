Sgt. Chaves of the New Mexico State Police was interviewed by Major Conner and Sgt. Moody. He could add little to the investigation except that he arrived at the scene about three minutes after the incident happened and that Mr. Zamora was scared.

Major Conner's formal report will be on its way on 27 April. He will include copies of Sgt. Chaves' report, and Sgt. Moody's report, which will be forwarded at a later date.

As the present time we don't know what it was, but Major Conner and Sgt. Moody are still checking out the helicopter activity in the area.

There was a call to Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, USAF BLUE BOOK, and Lt. W. Branch.
