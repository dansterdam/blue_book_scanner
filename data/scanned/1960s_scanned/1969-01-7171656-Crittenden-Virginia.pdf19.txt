SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 17 Jan 62 from Crittenden, Virginia; Your memo of 24 Jan 1959
TO: Office, Aerial Phenomena Branch

Air Force, Washington 25, D.C.
In reply to the recommended memorandum concerning the subject, a review of our files shows no further information on this UFO sighting. For your information, flight progress strips dated 17 January 1959 have been checked and show no unusual activity corresponding to the time and date of the reported sighting.

There is considerable hesitance regarding activity in the Norfolk/Newport News area and it is possible that balloons or blimps have been operating in the vicinity of Crittenden at the time of the reported sighting.
