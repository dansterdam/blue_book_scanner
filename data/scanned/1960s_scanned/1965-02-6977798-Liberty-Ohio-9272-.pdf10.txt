The image appears to show two circular objects, possibly discs or lenses of some kind. They are close-up shots of the objects, which appear to be made of some type of material with a textured or uneven surface. There is no scale provided in the image, but the objects appear to be relatively small, likely only a few inches in diameter. The image has been labeled as "UNCLASSIFIED" and "FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION AFSC", suggesting this may be part of a historical document or report related to unidentified flying objects or aerospace technology.
