less in the same physical class as our sun. Only two stars
CCeti and CEridani about 11 light years distant were tried.
Signals in the hydrogen line 1420 Mc were sent to these stars
from the National Radio Observatory in May-July 1960, and
characteristics of the radio emission from these stars analyzed. 
No evidence of any artificial signals was discovered, and the
answer to our own signals, if any, cannot be expected until 1982. 
It is not known whether the Soviets ever attempted a similar
experiment. They all quote the Ozma project, and the book
"Interstellar Communications" published by the NASA in 1963
(in which the Ozma project is described) appears to be one of
their fundamental information sources, although, the Soviet
expert Khaykin considers Ozma a waste of time and resources
(Byurakan Conference, p 90). The inference in most of the
Soviet papers, however, seems to be that the Soviets have
nothing to offer in the experimental line comparable even to
the modest Project Ozma. Experience, however, with Soviet
scientific practice, notably their withholding of information
on recent scientific activities for several years as was the
case with their radio telescope development, makes it advisable
to exercise caution in ascertaining their status from published
literature alone.
