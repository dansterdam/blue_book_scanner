FIRST REPORT.
SUMMARY (Give a brief written narrative) : UFO sighting reported to the 0D at 1941EST 25 May 60.

Reportee stated that she (?) was looking out a window when she noticed something in the sky that she had never seen before. She further stated that she had some physical reactions like she had never seen before.

Since it took me approximately one hour to arrive at the above address,I called Central C.O. Lowry AFB, Colo. APPARENTLY the sighting was of short duration and the object could no longer be seen when I arrived. She stated the object arrived at the address at 0012EST and the object could no longer be seen some time later.

Location of sighting was SE of Keystone Point (North Miami Beach) ,Florida and appeared larger than a star and had a bright white glow. It remained in a stationary position and was in sight for several minutes. No trail, exhaust, or unusual features were observed.

First observed while out in the yard about 1930EST. Appeared to move up and southerly direction and after moving up would appear to deep back some and then continue again.

Witnesses to the sighting were the reportee and a resident at the same address and mother of reportee.
