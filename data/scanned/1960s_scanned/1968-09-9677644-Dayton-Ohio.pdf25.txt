The image contains two illustrations. The first one is a compass-like diagram that appears to depict the directions someone described the unidentified flying object (UFO) phenomenon when last seen. The second illustration shows a person standing on a road with hills or mountains on either side, suggesting a landscape view.

TRANSCRIPT:

INDICATE BY A CHECK (X) MARK THE SECTOR OF COMPASS WHICH BEST DESCRIBES THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. ACCORDING TO YOUR ESTIMATE, DRAW AN ARROW TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT AND STATE THE APPROXIMATE ELEVATION IN DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON.
COMMENT: WITNESS MAY INDICATE MOVEMENT CURVED ON 210-230 DEGREE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO INDICATE MOVEMENT.
