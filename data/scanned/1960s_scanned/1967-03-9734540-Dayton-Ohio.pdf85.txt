The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten narrative description of a UFO sighting.

Based on the OCR output:

THIS OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AS A LARGE BRIGHT WHITE TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED ALTITUDE OVER OUR POSITION. IT APPEARED AS BEING TWO WHITE LIGHTS WITH ONE RED LIGHT BETWEEN THEM. THEY WERE REVOLVING, THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND WE COULD BARELY MAKE OUT WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS, THEN IT SLOWLY ZOOMED DOWN CONSIDERABLY AND AS IT ALMOST REACHED THE HORIZON IT STOPPED AND IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES THEN DISAPPEARED. THERE WAS NO NOISE OVER THE HORIZON. THERE WAS NOTHING STATED IN THE DOCUMENTS AS TO WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS, BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT IT WAS NOT A STAR, AN AIRPLANE, A HELICOPTER, A WEATHER BALLOON, OR ANOTHER TYPE OF AIRCRAFT. THIS SIGHTING WAS AS A CITIZEN WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE SECURITY OF MY COUNTRY, AND IS TRYING TO HELP.
IF DO NOT PERSONALLY CARE WHETHER YOU BELIEVE ME OR IF ANYONE BELIEVES ME. I KNOW WHAT I SAW AND I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ALIEN TO ME.
