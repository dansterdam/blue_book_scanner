ed: 
It was in 1952. Glenn spent a summer at the 
Edwards Air Force Base in California, to work
on a confidential new program to test some
rockets for the air force. Every day, Glenn would
go to the tracking station to watch the firing of
these rockets.
One day, as he was watching the firing, some-
thing caught his eye, moving briskly across the
sky. It wasn't a plane, a rocket, or anything they 
usually saw. Glenn watched as this object raced  
across the sky and disappeared over the Indian 
Ocean. Glenn began to report this phenomenon.
He was told there was the wonders of outer
space, and that this was a satellite-
like object
passing over. But Glenn insisted there was no
satellite up there at that time. This was something
else - something he couldn't identify. 
This object had made a tremendous speed and
the next crucial stage of the flight was the re-
entry and landing. Glenn continued to watch
for this object, and finally one day saw it come
back. "Capsule is turning around," he reported.
Oh, that was incredible! I can't believe that I can
see this. And sure enough, the object came back
to the same place it had disappeared before, just
a couple of hundred yards behind the tracking
station. Glenn set out to look at this object more
closely. But when he got to the place where he
thought it would land, there was nothing there.
The object had vanished. Nothing happened.
"I have had no ill effects as a result of seeing
this," Glenn later said. "It is simply a matter of
fact. Visual acuity is still excellent. But the more
I think of the incident, the more disturbing it
becomes."
Glenn had with him a small band camera to take
pictures of the rockets. But he didn't use it this
time. He was too intent on watching the object
rather than get the camera away.
But now, if only it had is mind and his camera
pointing at the exactly right moment - just as
though on an invisible shell, he might have
caught a glimpse of this incredible visitor. The
