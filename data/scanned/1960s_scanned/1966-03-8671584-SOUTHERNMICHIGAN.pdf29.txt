and in those general vicinities, I could form f no consistent
other hanl,
picture whatever of these allied events. On the contraryr
I could form a consistent picture of what apparently was observed
over the swamp at Dexter and. Nit at Hillsdale. In both cases
a distinctive/relationship, yellow, and green lights were
reported y plus a general ti yellow glow. The spectacular
lights, when reported, were stated to be of limited area. One
of the 'girls at Hillsdale described lights in the sky as Christmas
tree lights. Other girl at Hillsdale agreed but stated that a
yellowish glow surrounding and enveloped the discreet lights.
The similarity between the Dexter lights and the Hillsdale lights
wes's triking. Not only as to color and intensity, but motion as
well. The motion was described in both cases as smooth and
slow, with a tendency to disappear rather suddenly and reappear
elsewhere. Most observers described a smooth horizontal motion and while
other girls from Hillsdale said the lights seemed to get excited and moved
erratically when car lights and flash lights came into the vicinity, the
major behaviour was described as persistent, smooth and slow.
