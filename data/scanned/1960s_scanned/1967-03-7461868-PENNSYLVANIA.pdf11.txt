There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe the text found in the document:

I will explain the way the lights went on this way--we saw an object from a slight distance that it looked very close as we were watching it. At this time we could see the entire ship and it was dark red in color. This object flew in close to us and hovered. The lights were located directly behind the sharp blue top edge. The entire object was quite bright, illuminated from within. The lights we saw were the object's own lights as it hovered. These lights were so bright they were clearly visible even though the night was very dark. There were two red lights on the top and two red lights on the bottom. The lights stayed on the object for approximately three or four minutes. The lights could not be seen through the object as it was very solid and bright all over. Several commercial planes were spotted right after the object left, indicating that their trail had been broken up by the passage of this strange object. 

I have made this as plain as I could and I have analyzed it as best I could describe it as I want it to be.

I will gladly answer any questions you may have.
