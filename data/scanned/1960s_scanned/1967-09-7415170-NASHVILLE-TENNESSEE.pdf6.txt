Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am writing to report concerning two U.F.O.'s which I witnessed on the night of 3 September 1967. The objects were of a group of about 8 to 10 and were about 200 feet in diameter. And were sighted in 
the southern sky just after dusk. And were stationary for some time.

Then about 7:19 P.M. O.C.T. the objects began to move, at first very slowly and then increased in speed rapidly.
The objects traveled at a tremendous rate of speed in a westerly direction.
The strange thing which I noticed was that there appeared to be a control tower or antenna-like structure on top of the objects. I do not know whether this was some type of guidance system or
what its purpose was. That is about all I can recall concerning this sighting.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

P.S. There were 5 other witnesses of these objects.
