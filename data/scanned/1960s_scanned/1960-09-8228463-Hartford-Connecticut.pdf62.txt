The image shows a photograph or document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s. The image appears to be a handwritten label or caption that reads "CAB #2 AERONOGAL GRANULES".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the following text from the document:
