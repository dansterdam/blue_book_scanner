The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects. 

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

report. (The glare created by the strobe lights would probably distort the shape of the object being viewed.)

I have personally witnessed the igniting beacon on top of the Empire State Building of an airborne distance in excess of 75 miles at night in atmospheric conditions less desirable than those which prevailed on the night of the sighting.

At jet altitudes, high intensity strobe lights would be visible at distances well in excess of 100 miles, possibly 200 miles. An aircraft approaching Albuquerque from that direction would maintain a fairly constant relative bearing towards the viewer and with head winds varying between 50 and 75 knots, would be visible for a considerable length of time - 20 to 40 minutes. During its approach, while maintaining a constant bearing, it would appear to weave from side to side and up and down due to airspeed, course and altitude deviations.

2. Since missiles were not in the area and free balloons cannot travel against the wind and all available information indicates that the sighting was indeed the strobe light, equipped jet commander, this incident is considered closed.
