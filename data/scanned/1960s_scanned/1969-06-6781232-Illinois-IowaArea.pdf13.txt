The image does not contain a photograph, it is a handwritten document. 

Transcription of the text in the document:

Many letters from people who have been disturbed by an unusual sighting are received, and it is gratifying to note that some of them feel that the sharing of their experience may be of some help, and that they are willing to take the time to put their story down. Some details, in certain circumstances, make it difficult to fully evaluate the facts, but when your main problem is deciding whether what you saw was a UFO, or just your imagination, your main problem is real and needs consideration.

I feel that you must have been quite convinced that what you saw was very unusual, and that was the reason for your writing. However, the real and whole story is usually not made clear unless certain details are given, such as the date, time, location, weather conditions, direction of travel, size, shape, color, speed, and duration of the object observed. Many of these facts are often not mentioned by the writer, possibly because the person does not realize that they are important to the evaluation of the sighting.

If possible, I would like to photo-graph whatever it was that you saw. Would you be willing to send in a photograph if you are able to obtain one?

Sincerely yours,
