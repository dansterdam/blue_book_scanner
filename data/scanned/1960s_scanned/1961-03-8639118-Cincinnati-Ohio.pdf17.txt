There are two sketches present in this image. The first sketch appears to show a curved trajectory or trajectory of an object in the sky, with annotations indicating the position of the object and the height above the horizon. The second sketch appears to show a person's perspective, with annotations indicating the position of the object when it was first seen and where it was last seen.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how the object appeared when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" on the position of the object as it was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
