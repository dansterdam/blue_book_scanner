Dear sir, or sir: I saw a ufp in the sky over cathedrAl city. the time was 10:15 pm. it appeared to be moving fast from the south east and seemed to be about 30 feet in diameter. the shape was circular and it made no sound at all. it had a steady bright light that seemed to be pulsating. the object was observed for about 5 minutes. again in the same place it was again observed for a second period of about 2 minutes. as i watched it, it just disappeared. I was watching it with another person, and he agreed on what we saw. This whole incident was most alarming to us, and we are at a loss to explain it. any help on this matter would be appreciated.
