CASE - 8679371

On 22 July 1963, at approximately 10:45 p.m., two unmarried persons, a male and a female, both approximately 30 years old, were walking in a rural area near Scarsdale, New York. The two persons noticed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving. They watched the light for several minutes until it disappeared from view. The light was described as being a bright white color and was larger than a star. It made no sound and appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground. The two persons returned to their automobile and drove to a nearby house where they contacted the local police. The police responded to the area but found no trace of the object.
