SERIAL CASE OF HIGH STRANGE NATIONAL PARK REPORT SICHITING
GILACIER NATIONAL PARK 
The history of Glacier National Park begins with the establishment of Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park straddling the border between the northern Rocky Mountains states and the Canadian province of Alberta. Glacial peaks of both countries rise to the sky in spectacular fashion along a narrow section of the Montana and Alberta border. Of the original Glacier National Park, there have been over 80% of the glacial-ice lost in recent decades due to climate change. What remains now are remnants of once mighty ice masses that have shrunk at an alarming rate, according to the U.S. National Park Service.
