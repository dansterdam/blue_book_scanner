The text in the document is as follows:

THROUGH TELESCOPED VISION AS SPACECRAFT PASSED TO OUR LEFT AT EXTREMELY LOW ALTITUDE CAUSING A CONTINUOUS VIBRATION IN THE CRAFT AND AIRCRAFT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CALCULATED TO BE OVER 300 FEET FROM US. THE SPACECRAFT COULD BE CLEARLY VISIBLE AS IT PASSED AT A CONSTANT FORWARD SPEED AND ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND WAS CALCULATED. WE WERE STUNNED BY THIS EXPERIENCE AND FULLY STUNNED BY THIS VISIBLE PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE UFO SIGHTINGS AS FORMALLY REPORTED BY FLYING PERSONNEL UNDER SEPARATE COVERS.
