Air Intelligence "Staff" Pilot Sighted

Editor's Note: John Casantos Curry, who prepared this release, was an astronomer and military intelligence affairs officer. He coordinated this report:

The present case of reports on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) seen by a U.S. Air Force pilot, at 11:40 hrs., on 3l July 1965, near Carson City, Nevada, is considered important.

During World War II, such reports came often from pilots but were usually explained as enemy aircraft. Since 1946, a number of such reports have come from properly trained observers - some of whom were personnel in the armed forces - reporting on sightings of unidentified objects that did not correspond to any known aircraft, balloons, or astronomical phenomena. These have included observations of lights, shapes, and motions which could not be identified with any conventional air or space craft.

After the war, reports of "flying saucers" were also received from various parts of the world, some indicating that these objects were real physical entities - and not just hallucinations or psychological phenomena. Some of these gave way to "flying cigars" or "flying fishes" reports and other descriptive terms as the shapes of the objects varied - but all indicating that there were unidentified flying objects - craft that were not of this earth.

The present case is one of the few instances where the reliable report comes from a U.S. Air Force pilot, indicating that he saw a cigar-shaped object with red and green lights blinking on and off, which maneuvered at a speed far in excess of any known aircraft. This report is added to a growing number of such accounts by competent observers, including military and scientific personnel.

Echo I Up 5 Years 

Echo I, the satellite which was launched on 12 August 1960, has now been in orbit for 5 years. This is an achievement and has more significance than just the longevity of a space vehicle in orbit. The satellite is being tracked over a large portion of the globe and serves as a reference point for geodetic and navigation studies. Its signals are used to locate and identify various points on the surface of the earth with great accuracy.

Echo I is a larger, more solid sphere. In a polarized light, the sun's rays are reflected from the metal-coated surface, and this reflection gives a distinctive "echo" quality to the signals received on earth. Whether beamed, pulsed, or continuous wave, the signals from Echo I are easily picked up by ground receiving stations around the world. Echo I, in its orbit, passes directly over the United States from horizon to horizon twice a day. This satellite is a brilliant object in the sky, reflecting the sun's rays, and is easily seen by the naked eye, especially at dawn and dusk, when it appears as a bright "star" passing overhead.

View's Range 12-20 Minutes

The satellite is in view for an average of 12 to 20 minutes, since scientists have found that it can be seen continuously for this period of time. Some orbits are longer, some shorter, but the average is in this range. Thus, the signals from Echo I can be monitored and recorded for this period of time.

Lights reflected on low clouds, or beams of light coming through breaks in the clouds, have also been observed by watchers when Echo I passes overhead. One must add a few more facts:

1. The satellite is not visible when the sun's rays do not strike its surface.

2. Low clouds, fog, or mist obscure the view.

3. Slowly, slowly, it passes a near or pole moving star across the sky until it disappears at the horizon. It is only visible during the period of time when the sun's rays are striking its metallic surface.

The importance of the Echo I satellite in the field of geodesy and navigation cannot be overemphasized. It is a ready-made target, so to speak, high in the sky, that can be tracked by stations on the ground. The information gained from such tracking is invaluable in mapping the earth's surface and in navigation studies.
