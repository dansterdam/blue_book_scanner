The image appears to contain several illustrations related to UFO sightings and observations. The main image in the center depicts a compass-like diagram with directions and annotations. Two smaller images below show a person standing on a road in a landscape. There does not appear to be any photographic content in this document.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. AND A "Y" AT ITS POSITION AS IT MOVED OR CHANGED IN LOCATION. CONNECT THE X AND Y WITH A LINE TO SHOW THE APPARENT DIRECTION AND COURSE.
WHEN ESTIMATING DIRECTIONS, REFER TO THE COMPASS ROSE. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SHOW APPROXIMATE COURSE AND DIRECTION.
