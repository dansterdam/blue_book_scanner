FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED IN ANTARCTIC
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - From the Antarctic yesterday came official reports that a flying object, described as "something real", was sighted by the crew of a Chilean base.
A Chilean base commander in the Antarctic reported the object was "something real, something in the sky", said it was a high-speed object, "glowing with a reddish orange light", and that it moved without sound.
In Buenos Aires, the navy reported the object was seen by two Argentine and two British base commanders near the Argentine base on Deception Island, east of the southern tip of South America.
The report said the object moved swiftly and silently, disappearing within minutes. Details were scarce, the navy said.
