The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

(a) The observers stopped watching it before it disappeared.
(4) Description of flight path and maneuvers: The object moved from 72 degrees to about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon in a slight zig zag pattern in about six or seven seconds. At its point of stopping, for a minute and then in the same motion as before, it took the path for about 10 minutes. The path was like this [hand-drawn illustration]. It went straight out away from the observers, then it seemed to dart back and forth in a "zig-zag" manner. This final movement seemed to be in a steady path, not zig zag, as the descent and movement to the night seemed much slower than the initial movement.
(2) No one watched the object disappear from sight. It was still visible when they stopped watching.
(3) They observed the object for almost an hour and a half (90 minutes).
c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Ground - visual.
(2) Optical aids - binoculars. (7 x 50 stellar) with coated lenses and adjustable eye pieces.
(3) N/A
d. Time and Date:
(1) 03:52 until 05:22, 19 June 1963.
(2) Light conditions - night.
e. Location of Observers:
(1) Niagara Falls, New York (this is 2 miles south of the Niagara Falls Municipal Airport).
(2) FAA Tower, Niagara Falls Municipal Airport, Niagara Falls, New York.
