UFO SIGHTING REPORT:
I. PERSONAL ACCOUNT
(In your own words, please describe the incident as it happened.) (If additional pages are needed, use them.)

Two objects coming down route 42. I had been at the summer home in [Redacted], and was in a hurry to get back to Wencham. It was dusk. As I was driving along, I noticed something above the trees that looked strange. It was hovering to me. I stepped on the car and lowered the window and the car slowed it. There was no noise. It was a vehicle with lights I could not make out the details. As I watched it for a while, it suddenly vanished into the distance. I was alone and immediately told my husband. I could not make out what I had seen. It was a UP.
