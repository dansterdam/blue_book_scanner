SAP-OTCO/Mass #70926/AUG 29. 1968

Dear ...:

This is in reply to your report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on August 29, 1968.

We appreciate your submitting this report. However, if your sighting was of an object in the sky and not an actual landing or close encounter with a craft, we will not be able to investigate it further and make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFOs in the technical information we can provide.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base or United States Coast Guard station, so that they can make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF Branch
Chief, Civil Division
