4. Search for Life on Mars

Mars is the only planet where conditions remotely approach those on the earth. It was therefore natural that Mars became the focus of attention of astronomers and biologists looking for evidence of life elsewhere in the solar system. 

In the U.S., the center of the study of Mars for a long time was the Lowell Observatory, Arizona, where Percival Lowell's work was continued by E. C. Slipher. In the USSR, an indefatigable searcher for evidence of life on Mars was Tikhov.

Tikhov (1875-1960) was a Pulkovo astronomer who had attained considerable international reputation for the excellence of his observational work. In 1909, during one of the great oppositions of Mars, he studied that planet through filters and proved the existence of snow near its poles and clouds in its atmosphere, in spite of the low position of the planet during observations. This work remained little known in the West, and was repeated at the next great opposition in 1924 with substantially the same results by W. H. Wright at Lick Observatory, California.

After his retirement from Pulkovo, Tikhov settled down in Alma-Ata, Kazakh S.S.R., and in 1957 formed there a "Sector of Astrobotany" at the Institute of Physics and Astronomy of the Academy of the Kazakh S.S.R. The idea of this sector (or section) was to study the behavior of plants in conditions approaching those of the Planet Mars, that is the Arctic tundra and high mountains.
