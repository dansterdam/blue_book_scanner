The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document that discusses a sighting at an airport.

Another UFO?
Airport 'scorns' sightings 
To the Herald-Journal:
I am writing to you in reference to the article printed in the Oct. 30 edition.
On the night of Oct. 25, 1966, I observed in Skaneateles a strange object in the sky. It would recede to the eastern horizon and come back overhead, and I was intrigued by the object and drove over to a friend's house. He stated his relatives were witnesses to it also.
I called Hancock Airport and a man answered politely and asked me what I was calling for. At first I told him of the sighting. He said that they had no actual sightings and that the men operating the airport were just "poking fun" at them.
He said no. Then I inquired as to the reason regarding lights on planes that I have observed to have flashing lights. I then told him what I have stated so far. He then stated that they do not get reports of anything as UFOs.
If a person has alleged to have seen something the only reaction he ever receives from the monitors at Hancock Field is one of negative and sarcastic views. I don't maintain these are UFOs but maybe some of these people who have seen something on the ground or in the sky would lie hesitant to report it, and maybe the facts do exist.
