HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE FIRST POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "0" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

CONNECT THE "X" AND "0" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE APPARENT COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "0" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "0" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE APPARENT COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. THIS WILL PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
