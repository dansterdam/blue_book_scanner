Transcribing the text in the document:

It takes again Uncontradicted by the newspaper accounts of it any more than has been done by those who try to explain it away as a meteor or a weather balloon. The simple fact is that the United States Air Force is unable to explain this observation even though their explanation is that it was a "weather balloon." A weather balloon does not appear like the object described in the report. It would be admitted if GRO had a way to be the truth.
