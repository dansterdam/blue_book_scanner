This image does not contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, detailing wind data received by phone from 3WW (Mr. Hayes) in support of a balloon sighted drifting from the vicinity of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Dayton, Ohio on July 12-13, 1965.

15 July 1965
MEMO TO: TDEW (Major H. Quintanilla)
FROM: TDFCC (Meteor) Wind data received by phone from 3WW (Mr. Hayes) in support of a balloon sighted drifting from the vicinity of Harrisburg, Pa. to Dayton, Ohio, 12-13 July 1965.

1. The mean flow for these two days in the region from Harrisburg to Dayton at 50,000 to 55,000 feet was from the Northwest between 280 degrees and 310 degrees at 30 knots. These data were obtained from inspection of analyzed data at the 100 millibar pressure level.

2. The mean flow obtained from the next higher pressure level, 50 millibars, is represented of the 55,000 to 70,000 layer:
a. On 12 July the flow was from the northeast, 030 degrees at about 10 knots.
b. On 13 July the flow veered to be more from the east, 070 degrees, at 10 knots.

3. The levels immediately above this layer would retain the same general direction but would have higher speeds. A speed of 50 knots or better could be maintained from 80-120,000 feet. Generally, the balloon speed along its trajectory is considerably less than any one reported speed.
