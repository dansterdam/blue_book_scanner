The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved, object-like shape in the sky, with the instructions to place an "A" on the curve to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and a "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with a person standing on a road in the foreground, and buildings or houses in the background on either side of the road.
