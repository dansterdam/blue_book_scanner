27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the course the object was traveling, as you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where you last saw the object. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
