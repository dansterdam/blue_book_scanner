There is one large object standing on the ground and was located in between some woods. It was very close to the witness - only about 20 yards away. The object was a dome-shaped craft, about 40 feet in diameter, with portholes around the middle. It seemed to be resting on a landing gear of some kind. The witness was able to observe the object for about 2 to 3 minutes before it suddenly took off at a high rate of speed, disappearing over the trees. No sound was heard during the sighting.
