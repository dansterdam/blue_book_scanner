TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

I watched or strange disk in the sky a little piece of ground of center of ship (drawing to follow) I mentioned to be so and he said to had been watching the disc in sky, they gave call on phone close nearby 11:00 p.m. We then continued to watch this object which was not moving. Put his head out the window to make sure It wasn't a reflection. We pulled out the moon for reasons I can't remember now. We watched it for about another twenty minutes before to move slowly down in direction of town. It was hard to tell how low to the horizon as It was out some distance. That was about 5:10 p.m. that we began to move. About ten minutes later it seemed another disk like object move to the right of the one we had been watching. His first one could not be seen. We watched about another ten minutes before they disappeared. We were amazed at what we saw because it was so unusual and we both closed by the time first class. We watched about another 20 minutes before they were way to the right of the car and heading to the night of the car and seemingly had nothing to do with what we saw. I had to answer me and tell me "whether there is any explanation for this sighting," because it took a lot of courage to tell it.
