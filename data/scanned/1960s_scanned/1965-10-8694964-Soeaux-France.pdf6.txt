REPLY TO 
ATTN OF: TDEW

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information (Lambany, R)

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI-CC (Mrs Hunt)
WAAM D C 20330

1. The attached letter from Lambany, R, in French, was translated verbally. The writer appears to be an expert on flying saucers based upon one of his observations of the design of this machine. He desires to know if he should give to the United States information concerning a document giving the design of this machine. 

2. It is suggested that a fact sheet together with a statement that there is no evidence to indicate the existence of flying saucers, as such, having been brought to the attention of the United States Air Force, be prepared to translate and forward to Lambany, R. The writer is not submitting his report to us. It is not necessary that a translation be made by the Ambassador in France.

FOR THE COMMANDER

JOHN W. de JARNETTE, Colonel, USAF 
Deputy for Technology
