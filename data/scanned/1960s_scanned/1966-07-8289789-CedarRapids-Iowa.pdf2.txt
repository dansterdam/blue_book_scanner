1. Reference the attached unidentified flying object report from Robert Lynn, Associate Member National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
The following is extracted from Dr. Olivier's letter:
"This object observed from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, by two people is absolutely a bright meteor or fireball; there is no question as to its identity. The date was about 7/7/66 about 10:30 p.m."
2. Wish most cases were as easy to decide on! The reports will be placed in our fireball case file.
3. Request you inform Mr. and Mrs. of our findings.
