MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJ: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968
Contacted: Mr. and Mrs. ______ Kentucky 42701
TIME: 9:15 PM EST
LOCATION: Approximately three minutes
Mr. and Mrs. ______ were in their car on Western Kentucky Parkway, approximately twenty-five miles west of Elizabethtown. The object did not disappear over the horizon, but over a hill. The object passed north of them and was traveling NE. Looked like a light on smoke. Mr. ______ was pretty sure that the object passed north of them. However, since the road curved he could not say positively. He was pretty sure that it passed to the north.
