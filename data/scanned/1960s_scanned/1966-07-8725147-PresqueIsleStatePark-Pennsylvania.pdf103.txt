4 August 1966, contacted Mr. Alvars V. Petersons of Flight Dynamics Lab for information on alleged indentation on the ground. Following are his comments:
1. No way object could have made stable landing without at least the appendages.
2. Sand should have been a lot more compressed for alleged landing.
3. No ground maneuver capability apparent.
4. Portions of ground around indentations appear to have been undoubtedly compressed.
5. No definite sign of vehicle departing area in the sand. No evidence of heat or sand being disturbed by aerodynamic vehicle.
6. How could object have caused car to shake when it supposedly hovered over the ground approximately 10-15 feet and then settled to the ground.
Mr. Petersons said that various persons had discussed the alleged indentations very similar to how of a boat that have been pulled up on the beach. Smaller marks looked like where anchor was placed. Also looked like the type of indentations that would have been made when a rifle was fired at the ground.
Rough weight calculations made place weight of alleged object at approximately 1500 lbs total weight. This being a static load estimate - (Mr. A.V. Petersons).
