11. COMMENTS
Descriptiom is that of classic meteor. Meteor, probably of fireball class, was very startling and probably a fireball experience for the witnesses. There was some discussion whether it could have been a plane, but the silence of the sighting and the sudden disintegration of the material has been turned over to the Smithsonian Institute for analysis, but as yet no answer. ATIC opinion is that recovered material had no connection with the sighting.
