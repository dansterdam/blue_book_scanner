Conversation of Major William E. Morley, USAF, and Lt. William F. Marley.
Since I didn't have instruments my first opinion of the size of the object is in error. I thought it was a one dollar bill is in error. Later in comparing it to my hand I discovered it was much smaller, covered by my mistake. On Friday the moon was at the same height and I thought the size should have been a penny. Exhaust was a little larger than the moon and was a little larger than the moon on 7 July. I have some basic scientific background. Now to get description:
Body size - 2 dimes held at arm's length - 75% accuracy 
Using an object to cover object I would use two dimes. I figure the 75% accuracy.
Moon was 3/4 full, 15 degrees above the horizon. Moon had some light on the object. Object passed over the moon. It was about one second.
Now - off the subject. There have been accounts in the pasts so many people have seen UFOs that there must be something to them. I see (2300) - 0100 while watering these.

The text appears to be a detailed description and analysis of an observed UFO encounter, including information about the size, shape, and movement of the object, as well as the witness's scientific background and other relevant details.
