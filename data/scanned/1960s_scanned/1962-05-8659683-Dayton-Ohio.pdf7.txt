The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during its course.
A- <------> B

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or one's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
3-4 degrees

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Went behind some trees, then gradually faded out of view.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects with which you would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
Small, globular, with silvery glow, suspended in air, but sphere-like in form.
