The image does not contain any photographs, only a filled-out document form with text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, appeared to go out
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what: Seemed to go behind some wispy clouds
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound: None b. Color: Bright white light
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the width of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the known object would have been covered?  The object seemed very large in the sky, covering a large portion of the sky, perhaps 10 to 15 degrees.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
