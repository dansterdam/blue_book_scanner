Dear Sir:

At 5:00 PM CST on December 29, 1961, Mr. and myself were travelling south on US 31W about 10 miles north of Goodlettsville, Tennessee, when we saw what appeared to be strange objects in the sky for several minutes. After observing these objects in the sky for a few minutes, I stopped at a roadside phone booth to WPAFB and was connected with a duty officer who made a report of my experience. During this conversation I was told an investigation would be made and if the experience could not be explained, more information might be required from me. As I have not been contacted, I assume the investigation resulted in a satisfactory explanation.

The February 19 issue of Newsweek has a small article describing the results of investigations performed last year and states that a very few reports were unexplained.  

I would like to know whether an investigation was conducted on my report, and if so what were the results.

Sincerely,
