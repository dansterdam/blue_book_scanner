Dear sirs,

Monday July 8, 1963 a saw a stationary unidentified flying object (U.F.O.). This U.F.O. was right at almost regular intervals and from month to month west northeast east and west. It was very bright like a star but larger more the horizon.

My mother and father saw this also. Could give any information on what I saw.
