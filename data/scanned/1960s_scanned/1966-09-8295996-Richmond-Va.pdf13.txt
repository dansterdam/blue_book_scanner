The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch appears to be a compass rose with various directional markings and angles labeled. The text below the sketch provides instructions for the observer, such as placing an "A" on the curved high point where the object was first seen, and drawing a picture to show the motion or path of the object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved high point where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the skyline where the object was when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw it.
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion the the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
