The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. It appears to be an instructional page from a Project Blue Book document, with questions and instructions related to UFO sightings and observations.

Transcribed text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows where the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
