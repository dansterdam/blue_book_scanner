ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR COMMENTS: 
A bright light appeared over the hills before the sighting, causing me to pull over and watch. The object moved rapidly back and forth, occasionally hovering, before disappearing from view after several minutes. I was quite startled by the unusual nature of the sighting, as it did not resemble any aircraft I'm familiar with. I would appreciate any insight or analysis your team can provide about this incident.
