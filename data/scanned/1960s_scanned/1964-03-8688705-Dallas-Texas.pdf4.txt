My report and investigation of the object . This object was observed by two 
persons on the evening of March 8, 1964. The observed object appeared to be circular in shape, luminous in character, and appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed. The object first appeared to the northeast and traveling in a northerly direction. 
The object was observed for approximately 20-25 seconds before it disappeared from sight. The witnesses are considered reliable and there is no reason to doubt their observation. The object was reported to appear and disappear suddenly and no sound was heard. The object was estimated to be approximately 200-300 feet in diameter.
