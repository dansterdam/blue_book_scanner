Jean Shepherd, chief of the Aerial Phenomena Branch at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and Air Force investigator Sgt. David Moody were in Socorro, N.M. Tuesday to check the report. Dr. J.

The object came to a halt in a field near the city and appeared to land and then take off, leaving a crater in the ground, authorities said.
