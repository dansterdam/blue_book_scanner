Gentlemen: 

On Aug 13, 1968 at 7:25 pm my brother (Tom) and I were driving east on Rt. 127 on our way home. We both observed an object that seemed to be hovering over a field. The object was glowing bright orange and was about 20 ft. in diameter. Our car flickered momentarily as we passed under the object. After a few minutes, we observed the object ascend at a high rate of speed and disappear. 

I would appreciate any information you can provide on this incident. Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Allen
