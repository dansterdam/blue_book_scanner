The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a diagram and some text. The diagram shows a compass rose and a sketch of what appears to be an object moving through the sky. The text prompts the viewer to imagine the object's movements and draw a picture showing the direction it was traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you (first) saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you (first) saw the object.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? ._1__ 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
