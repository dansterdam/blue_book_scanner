The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Dear Sir,

Reference your unidentified flying object observation and subsequent photographs which you made on February 17, 1967, the Aerial Phenomena Branch is pleased to provide you with this information for analysis. The results are as follows:

a. Examination of the negative reveals this to be a multiple exposure. This is evidenced by the multiple frames outline and irregular light and dark areas of the negative.

b. The size of the image relative to the frame size indicates the object was very close. Since no camera data is included, an exact determination of size is not possible.

c. The image shows a definite distortion with the suggestion of a definite object. However, the blur could be caused by motion of the object, however, if this were the case, there should also be blurred.

d. The general appearance of the image suggests that it is an unprocessed image. The graininess and lack of detail suggests an unprocessed image.

In summary, your photograph was a multiple exposure and the image suggests a process with the film.

Enclosed is your original negative and an 8" x 10" black-and-white print. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
DAVID L. EPPES
