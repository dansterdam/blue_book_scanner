Flying "Object" Mystory spzens With New Reports
Weymouth, Newland - The area around Pleasant Point, near the Gibbs School, has been the scene of repeated sightings of the "flying object" mystery in recent weeks. 
Mrs. Mary L. Cline of 12 Short St. Whitman, said she saw the "object" on several occasions, around 9 p.m. She described it as round, with flashing lights. 
"They didn't seem to surprise us. The lights were just there, changing color, blue, orange, yellow, green - all different colors. It wasn't a plane or satellite," she said. 
The "object" was seen by others, mostly young people, in the area, she reported. It appeared to remain stationary, then move swiftly across the sky. 
On one occasion, Mrs. Cline said, she saw it go behind some trees, then reappear. 
"It was much bigger and brighter than a star and would not disappear," she said. "It was so strange. I would not say it was a UFO, but I don't know what else to call it."
The sightings were first reported several weeks earlier on June 8. 
The police said they had received calls reporting the "object", but there was nothing they could do about it.
All these reports followed the first sighting, which was reported to the police by Roy E. Bates, a local resident. 
Bates said he saw a bright light in the sky near the Gibbs School one evening in early June. He said the light appeared to be hovering and then moved rapidly away.
"It was much bigger than a plane and brighter," he said. "When I first saw it, I thought it was an airplane on fire, but there was no sound."
The sightings have continued, Bates reported, with several other people reporting seeing the strange light in the sky.
