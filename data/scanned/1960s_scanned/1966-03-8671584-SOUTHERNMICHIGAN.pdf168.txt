Mr. Wagner "the complainant" is the one who made the original sighting. He stated that he was about to enter his house from a front yard, when according to him, he noticed a bright light out of the corner of his eye. He thought at first it was a falling star which he said abruptly stopped right over a swamp to the immediate north of his barn. He called his son, Ronald, out from the house to verify the sighting and together they watched the glow of light behind the trees in the distant swamp. Apparently at this time Mr. Wagner made the report to the Sheriff's office. Deputy McFadden and Fitzpatrick were dispatched to the [REDACTED] farm and in my interview with McFadden and particularly with Fitzpatrick (with whom I spent several hours in detailed discussions) they stated that upon arrival at the farm Mr. [REDACTED] and his son confirmed the sighting.
