"INVESTIGATOR SHOOTS DOWN SAUCERS

Dr. J. Allen Hynek discussed his findings at a news conference after spending a week in Michigan investigating UFO reports. Hynek is a Northwestern University astrophysicist and scientific consultant for the Air Force. 

Numerous UFO sightings have been reported in recent weeks, many of them in southern Michigan. 

Hynek emphasized his investigations were confined to two specific days of sightings and did not cover all of those reported.

"I am not making a blanket statement to say or the entire UFO program," Hynek said, "I emphasize that I cannot prove or disprove the reality of the sightings. It appears very likely, however, that the sightings were of unconventional objects - an unusual aerial phenomenon."

Hynek said his study was confined to a small community about 50 miles southwest of Detroit, and saw three to six miles west, on March 21.

Although these were reported, Hynek said he would not investigate them because he did not have time to see them. He said he investigated only those sightings seen by a large group of witnesses.

"If only one person reports seeing something, it must be dismissed," Hynek stated. "However, if many people see the same objects then it is grounds for scientific investigation."

Hynek also pointed out that studies released on Thursday night on the series of UFO sightings in the sky over the series of questions asked the question of whether a satellite or a small planet was the source of those sightings. But Hynek said, "I would not apply that conclusion to the sightings I have investigated.""
