I was a student at the time that I observed this object. I had noticed a strange light in the sky that seemed to be much larger than a normal aircraft. It was brighter and more intense than the surrounding stars. The object seemed to be hovering and did not appear to be moving. I watched it for several minutes before it disappeared. I have not seen anything like it before or since. I am unable to offer any explanation for what I observed that evening. The experience has left me curious and uncertain about the nature of the object.
