Up-East "Hillbilly" Adds To His Fame On Florida Radio-TV

Airmen William "Billy" W. Cole, a recent addition to the Air Force's "Up-East Hillbilly" radio and TV programs, has won fame as an actor in television since his high school days. His rich, deep voice has won him some honors, including eight AFSC talent contest finals in 1961 and second place in the AFSC talent contest finals.
Much of Bill's music is original, and he has been featured by professional singers on TV shows such as Don Gibson, Cuz Wilburn and Grandpa Jones. His humorous TV personality is in the nation's spotlight now, and he has played most of the clubs in Georgia, Alabama, and North Carolina. One song he wrote and sang called the "Jet Springs" has appeared in the Air Force Times and Air Defense Command Review.
Peter Glannini, a computer programmer with the Command, has perfected a computer technique on a computer which calculates and analyzes AFSC talent contest finals in 1961 and next year's contest. This has permitted the Command to establish objective criteria for the talent contests and to run them more efficiently. Peter's duties didn't stop here - he made the first statistical analysis of the winners and put out a booklet on this data.
