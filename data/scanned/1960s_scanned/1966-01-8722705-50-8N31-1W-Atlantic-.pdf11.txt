Transcription of the text in the document:

Can't say I can't give you any details. That's about the best I can say on this. That's why I was so very anxious to give you all the details I could possibly give or possibly thought of later. The thing appeared to be transparent and appeared as a very bright light. No shape could be made out. However, I could make out three sides to this object. The color was a very bright white and it appeared very 
bright to the eye. This thing moved here and there and would stop a moment and then take off very rapidly. It would not leave the sky but was very low. I am quite sure this was not an airplane or satellite or any other known aircraft. In fact, I do not know what it was, but I can assure you it was not a plane, jet or helicopter. It was very bright and dazzling to the eye and kept appearing and disappearing. That's about all I can say on this. I hope this gives you the details you wanted.
