Dear, ____, 

I fell like a dummy after writing to you saying that I saw three U.F.O.'s in the sky on October 3,but usually when I write a letter or something to be mailed it has the tendency to hang around my desk for about 12 years(I'm 17).Well with your letter I mailed it that night.I went to bed that night at about 11:30,and while listening to the radio,it's a portable and under my pillow N.A.S.A.was making the sky turn weird colors.What was happening was that N.A.S.A. was experimenting with the atmosphere. (If you remember,you probably don't.I said I saw the same things about two years before.) The next day guess what was on the front page of the two most popular newspapers. "SPACESHIPS LAND AND RED AND GREEN STRIPED CREATURE'S APPEAR". No it didn't say that,but it did say,and explain.
