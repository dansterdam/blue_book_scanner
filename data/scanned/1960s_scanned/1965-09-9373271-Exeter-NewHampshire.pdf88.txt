SUBJECT: UFO Sighting

1. In reply to your letter, same subject, 16 Nov 65, and telephone conversation between SMSgt Heffley, SAF, and Sgt Moody, Hq AFSC (TDEW/UFO).

2. Big Blast "Coco", a SAC/NORAD training mission, was flown on 13 September 1965. By 03/043GZ, the operational portion of the mission was complete and participating aircraft were enroute to their home stations.

3. Ten B-47 aircraft from Pease AFB were involved in Big Blast "Coco" and were estimated to arrive at their destinations between 03/0142Z and 03/0355Z. The town of Exeter, New Hampshire, was located under the track of the approaching aircraft, and it is possible that the recovering aircraft would have been displaying standard position lights and possibly over-flown the area during the hours of darkness.
