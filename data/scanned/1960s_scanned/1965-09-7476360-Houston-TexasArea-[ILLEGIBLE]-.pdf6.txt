35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points
of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your lighting:

The object was at about 30 degrees elevation at about 45 degrees azimuth and it was about 300 feet
away. It seemed to be about 10 feet in diameter and to be colored a very bright blue-white. There
were no protrusions, portholes or other visible features except that it seemed to be giving off a
great deal of light (so much so that it was hard to look at). It was emitting a deep humming sound.
It hovered for about 30 minutes, then without warning suddenly accelerated rapidly and simply
disappeared. It left no vapor trail or sound of any kind as it accelerated - it was like it had
just blacked out. They appeared to be shaking with fright while watching it. By the time we
got to a car to drive towards it, it was gone. We stood there at that point for some time more,
watching for it to return, but it did not. My daughter and I were the only two who saw it. We are
still not sure to this day what it could have been. I would be willing to cooperate further if
any additional information is needed. My telephone number is [ILLEGIBLE].
