UFO form continued
just found a note & still to run under the next page there. I got the
signal lights & had quite a bit of an experience last night. The
object appeared to be luminous & I felt it was alive & intelligent as
near as I could determine. It would flip off its lights, then flash on
again, but in a different spot or altitude. The first time it did this
I recall that I got out of the car as it seemed so close & I thought
I might get a better view. When it happened again & it gained on me
rapidly, I got back in the car & drove off as fast as I could. The
object then seemed to just hang out there for a while, even as I drove
off, & then it flipped its lights off & I could not tell where it
went. This thing's don'tknowwhat is makes me a little scared & I
don't care if O.t.O. has 01.0.3.
