The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document related to Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object I saw did disappear. It seemed to get very large (one-half of Saturn in size) and then it moved down toward the horizon and faded out of sight. The objects my friends saw flew out of sight.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound   It made no sound.
b. Color   It was dull white to red. However after awhile it was the color that seemed to turn white.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or one's length in line with a known object and compare the known object and note: How much of the match or length did the object cover? It would cover the object completely. I think.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object you saw such as wings, propulsions, etc... Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
What my friends said they saw in the sky: The object stopped for a while and then moved very fast and then stopped again and faded to a very dim star. The object is not moving a twice as fast as it does.
