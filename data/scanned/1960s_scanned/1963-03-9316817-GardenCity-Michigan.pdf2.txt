Dear Sir:
Last March my friend and I were driving somewhere and got caught in a storm. It was getting too dark to drive so we pulled off the road and waited it out. We were sitting in the car when we noticed a bright light off in the distance. It seemed to be moving around and getting closer. We rolled down the window to get a better look and the light suddenly shot straight up at a very fast speed and disappeared. We were both amazed and not sure what we had just seen. We eventually drove on but I can't stop thinking about it. Have you had any other reports of similar sightings in this area? Let me know what you think.
Thank you.
