AT APPROXIMATELY 1900 WE DISCOVERED THAT THE SHAPE WAS RETURNING AND WE IMMEDIATELY TURNED TOWARDS IT ON A HEADING OF 160. AT THIS TIME THE SUN WAS OVER THE HORIZON BUT THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE LIGHT IN THE SKY AND THE OBJECT WAS CLEARLY DARK-LIGHTED AND THUS SHARPLY ETCHED AGAINST THE SKY.

AT THAT TIME THE RANGE WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSUME. THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING BIGGER THAN THE DISTANCE OF TWO MILES, HOWEVER. AT THAT CLOSE RANGE, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE SHAPED LIKE A FOOTBALL WITH A POP UP ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MASS. THE DOT BEGAN TO GROW IN SIZE AND THE MAIN MASS BEGAN TO UNDERGO TWO DISTINCTIVE POSITION CHANGES. THE DOT WAS AS LARGE AS THE ORIGINAL MASS AND THE ORIGINAL MASS WAS QUITE SMALL. WE CONTINUED ON THIS HEADING FOR SOME TIME, AND WHILE CLOSING IN ON THE OBJECT, DISCOVERED THAT INSTEAD OF COMING CLOSER, IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING AWAY. FINALLY, WHEN IT WAS GETTING QUITE DISTANT, WE DISCONTINUED THE CHASE AND RETURNED TO MITCHELL.

MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A RESERVE MILITARY JET PILOT AND THAT OF THE PILOT THAT I WAS FLYING WITH HAD NO CONCLUSIONS. IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUSLY WAS NO AIRCRAFT, SINCE AIRCRAFT DO NOT CHANGE SHAPE AND SIZE FURTHER, THE LIGHTING APPEARED TO BE INTERNAL AND SELF-GENERATED. A NIGHT TO RESEMBLE A CLOUD OR SMOKE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ALTITUDE CHANGES DUE TO SUDDEN TEMPERATURE CHANGES. OUR GROUND OBSERVATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE VISUAL OBSERVATION IN THE AIR, AND WE COULD SEE NO SIGN OF ANY CONDENSATION. AN EXTREMELY DENSE FLIGHT OF BIRDS COULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THE UNUSUAL MOVEMENT, BUT AT OUR SPEED WE WOULD HAVE PASSED ANY SUCH CONFIGURATION. A DRY CASE CLOSED, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO MARK IT DOWN AS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION, WE WERE FORCED TO CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS SIMPLY AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
