The image does not contain any photographs. It is a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document titled "The A.P.R.O. Bulletin" from July 1963, and the text appears to be an article about "Saucer Panics Cattle".

THE A.P.R.O. BULLETIN
TUCSON, ARIZONA - JULY 1963

SAUCER PANICS CATTLE
The article discusses how the appearance of a "saucer" or unidentified flying object caused panic in a herd of cattle. The article describes the cattle as "milling about in a confused state" and running about erratically after seeing the object. The article suggests that the saucer-like object caused the cattle to panic, though the exact cause is not definitively known.
