Text transcribed from the image:

Dear Sirs:

On Monday night, December 5, 1960, about 8:40 P.M., Mrs. Herman called my office and told me that a curious red object was in the sky over the college. I immediately went out to investigate and found that the object was a bright reddish-orange light hovering over the college. It was about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. It remained stationary for about 5 to 7 minutes, and then began to move slowly in a southeast direction. As it moved, it dimmed slightly. We estimated the height of the object to be several hundred feet above the college.

After it had been traveling in a Northeast-South direction for about a minute, a plane was seen in the area, coming from the Southwest. As the plane approached the object, the object suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly in an easterly direction, disappearing from sight in about 3 seconds. The plane continued on its course and did not appear to pay any attention to the object.

This is about all that I can report on this incident. We were able to contract the difference in the object's behavior when the plane approached, which seems significant. Let me know if you require any further information.

Sincerely yours,
Brother R. Herman
President
