The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with a handwritten response to the question "Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting."

The handwritten response states: "Object moved from West to East. Lighting seemed to be continuous."
