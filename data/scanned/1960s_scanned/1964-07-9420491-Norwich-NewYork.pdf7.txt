Glowing UFO Seen
By Norwich Man

The man said he first sighted the object at 9 p.m. on November 21, 1964. He said it was about 150 feet in the air and about one-half mile distant. The object, he said, was round in shape and appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter. It had a bright glow that lit up the surrounding area. 
The witness said the object remained stationary for about 5 minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. 
The man said that, when the object first appeared, it was surrounded by a strange fog or mist. 
The witness, who was alone at the time, said he was both amazed and frightened by the incident. He said it was unlike anything he had ever seen before. 
The man reported the sighting to local police, who in turn notified the U.S. Air Force. An investigation was begun by Project Blue Book officials.
