The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an "Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) Information Sheet" form that was part of Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated reports of UFOs. The form includes various fields for recording information about an observed unidentified flying object, such as the shape, color, size, and behavior of the object, as well as details about the observation itself, including the date, time, location, weather conditions, and observer's impressions.
