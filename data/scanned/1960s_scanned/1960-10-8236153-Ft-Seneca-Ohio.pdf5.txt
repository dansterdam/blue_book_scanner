SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (X-##)

1. On 8 November 1960 the object was first sighted by the witness, a resident of Ft. Seneca, Ohio. The witness was a retired U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant on duty at the time of the incident.

2. In the referenced letter, the witness claims to have sighted an unusual object at approximately 10:30 P.M. on the night of 8 November 1960. The witness further states that the object remained visible for approximately an hour and ten minutes, and that he was able to observe it through 7x50 binoculars. The witness also reported that other individuals were present and also observed the object.

3. Telephone contact with the witness on 10 November 1960 did not add any significant information. The witness could not contribute anything specific, but appeared all indications as being truthful and cooperative. The witness did describe the motion and characteristics of the object as "brilliant and oscillating."

4. It is noted that the case that a sighting was made and the fact that the witness apparently exhibited characteristics of truthfulness. However, no positive identification of the object was made, nor could the witness contribute any reliable data or information that would enable a positive identification. The sighting, as reported, could not be positively identified or explained.

5. Telephone contact was made with the Erie County Sheriff's Department to establish a possible independent verification or corroborating evidence of the sighting, but during the time in question, no other sightings or reports were received from the local area.

6. It appears strange that the object was only person-reported and no other independent verification could be obtained from the area, if indeed, there were objects present as described.
