There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which appears to be a report or letter.

As requested, here is the text extracted from the document:

This what I could see. It was about 10 to 15 feet long, oval or round, reflecting the sky. It just hung there for a few minutes and then took off at a terrific speed, higher and higher, until it disappeared from view. I have no idea what it was, but it was certainly not a conventional aircraft. It made no noise and left no trail. I would not explain or identify something I could not be sure about. I am a retired, fairly well-known physicist, and if I had seen something at all clear or definite, I would certainly report it. But this was just a momentary sighting, and all I can say is that it was some kind of unknown object.

Yours Truly,
