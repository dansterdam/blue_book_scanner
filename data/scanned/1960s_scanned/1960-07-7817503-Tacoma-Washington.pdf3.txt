TWO COUNTY GROUPS SEE STRANGE RED LIGHTS

Two separate groups of St. Louis County residents, about three-quarters of a mile from each other, said they saw bright red lights in a circular formation in the sky about 10 p.m. Wednesday.

The first group, a family at a private University City home, observed the mysterious lights through a 120-power telescope. Her nephew, Mrs. Geraldine Flath, and her two young sons watched the object through powerful Navy binoculars.

Dr. Joseph C. Hynek, reported seeing a mysterious red light about 9:30 P.M. Wednesday. Many others reported flickering - - apparently-moving lights and a humming sound. The lights were visible for 15 or 20 minutes before they seemed to rise and then disappear.

Then the group watched the lights as they moved steadily west. The lights were sighted twice, once near the horizon and later up in the sky. We found when we looked through the binoculars that the eye was really moving, the movement of the lights.

Hynek said it must have been terribly high when it disappeared, because it took so long to do so. The economy, described the object as "four very bright red objects" in a circle around a center object. "They moved from east-northeast to west-southwest," he said. "They moved in a rather strange way."

He said he could not tell how high or how far away the lights were. "They moved in a sort of jum-bled motion, seeming to move in and out," he added. His brother-in-law and two neighbors observed the lights, they said.
