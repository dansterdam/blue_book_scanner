The lights were self luminous and constant illuminating the surrounding

area making it very bright. It appeared to move slowly across the sky

in a straight line and then suddenly disappeared. There was no sound 

at all coming from the object. It appeared as a point of light in the

sky and was comparable in size to a bright star, but more brilliant

in appearance.
