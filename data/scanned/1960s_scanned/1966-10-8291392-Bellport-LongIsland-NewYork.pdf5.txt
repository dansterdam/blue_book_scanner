This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document or report, featuring handwritten text.

The text on the page says:

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to it if you have any questions in the handling of these reports. Turn to this form.

One final note: Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CAC, Ext 495. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the sighting than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help the Air Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.

The handwritten text at the bottom of the page reads:

After incident we are in search colors. Without clues to the incident still up.
