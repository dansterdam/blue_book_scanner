LITTLE MEN SEEN IN WASHINGTON STATE: Two girls living in Renton, Washington, on August 6, reported they had seen three non-human men, about five feet tall, who appeared to be wearing some kind of strange dress - tight-fitting white-domed heads, and protruding eyes of the individuals. The arms had no expression, the eyes were gray like stars, and the bodies had a luminous quality. The necked dresses with white shirts underneath. The girls leave from their home about fifteen feet, and when they looked back the three beings had disappeared. No sound was seen in connection with this strange incident.
