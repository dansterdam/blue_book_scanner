7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN 'A' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A 'B' AT THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN 'A' AND 'B'. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS TASK.
