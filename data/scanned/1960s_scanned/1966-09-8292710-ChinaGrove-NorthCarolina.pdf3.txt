There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a document containing a written report.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Gentlemen:

I am submitting a U.F.O. report which I would like you to examine. I am submitting all information that I can possibly report.

There were 5 objects sighted. The objects were disc-shaped and each one disc-emitted an eerie light. The lights of some were very bright, others dim. The objects were spotted in the town of China Grove which is located 9 miles out of Salisbury in the county of Rowan. The objects were spotted for the time between 5:30 and 10:30 p.m. Many people were standing still while others were moving quickly. Many objects disappeared, then re-appeared quickly. The brightest object was moving at a 45 degree angle to the South. The objects were spotted on Sept. 7, 1966. There were people who saw the objects.
