Dear M _____,
President Johnson has asked that I reply to your recent letter concerning your unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings.
The Air Force has the responsibility of investigating UFO reports and evaluating whether such objects pose a threat to our national security. We have been investigating UFOs for nearly two decades and to date we have no tangible evidence which proves the existence and inter-planetary mobility of extraterrestrial life. In our opinion, UFOs exist as misinterpretations of known natural phenomena or conventional objects.
However, we only investigate UFOs reported to us. I am including UFO Form 165 which can be used in officially reporting a sighting to us. Since you state that you have not sighted this object since the advent of said weather, perhaps with the coming or spring you will observe it again. If you should see it again, we would appreciate your filling out the enclosed form in its entirety and returning it to us. We could then evaluate your sighting. If we are unable to find a logical answer, then your case will be categorized UNIDENTIFIED.
As requested, I am mailing this letter to your office address. I trust that the Air Force takes every precaution to protect those who request it from undue (and unwanted) publicity.
Sincerely,
Attachments: BB V8
