The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, but the page is mostly blank with only some handwritten text at the top.

The text that can be read from the image is:

"I was sitting on the porch and something caught my eye. I saw a strange looking thing in the sky. What was this? I called my wife and she came out and saw it too. It was moving fast and then it disappeared. I've never seen anything like this before."
