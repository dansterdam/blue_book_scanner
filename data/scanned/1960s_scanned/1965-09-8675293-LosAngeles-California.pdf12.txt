UFO, 9 September 1965
COMMENTS OF THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER:
Reference the sightings of the UFO or light phenomena and alleged photographic evidence:
Allowing for discrepancies in observations attributed to untrained observers, it is believed that the reports tend to be in fair agreement.
It was estimated that the phenomenon was caused by a relatively small metallic which the observer relatively at low altitude and short distance. The color is described as white or yellowish-white. The size is estimated to be between 15 and 20 feet in diameter. The phenomenon was observed for a period of about 5 minutes. The green color noted by one observer is indicative of that given off by high intensity lighting.
A check was made with personnel at the Griffiths Park Observatory, and it was also their opinion that the phenomenon so described could have been caused by a meteorite.
