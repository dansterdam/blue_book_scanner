ATTN OF: APDIB-H22
SUBJECT: UFO PHOTOGRAPH (ARCATA, CALIF.)

1. Reference is made to attached letter to Director of Estimates, 78th Fighter Wing, Hamilton AFB, California, from MC (name redacted), dated 20 Jun 1969.

2. The referenced letter forwarded three photographs with his correspondence. These photographs appear to be of the moon and are dated 23 June 1969. The subject of the photographs, as stated in paragraph 1, is an object which the individual claims to have seen in the proximity of the moon as it appeared to him.

3. Analysis of the photographs by the photo-analysis branch of ATIC led to the conclusion that the object in question is a defect which they have identified as a scratch on the film or negative.

4. It is concluded that the ATIC conclusion differs from his determination as indicated in paragraphs 8 through 12 of his correspondence, inasmuch as the information contained in paragraphs 8 through 12 of this correspondence indicates his determination of the nature of the object.

5. It is indicated that the configuration and focus of his equipment was such as to make it difficult, if not impossible, to determine the distance to the object in question. The report must be evaluated on the basis of the information provided in his letter.

6. From the information provided by MC (name redacted) concerning his equipment, it is determined that his telescopic "lenses" are typical of those which are used for viewing astronomical objects. However, most systems which are used for viewing astronomical objects do not have the precise optical characteristics required for accurate distance determination on small, distant objects.
