27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when it disappeared from your view. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which the object first appeared, and a "B" on the compass to show the direction in which it disappeared.

28. Draw a picture that will show the path that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and draw any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
