Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear sir:

The first time I wrote you I mentioned a couple of incidents which occurred at about 11:00 p.m. on Saturday, July 14, 1967. Since then, and as I type this letter, I have just had another unusual experience.

As I mentioned in my previous letter, my fiancee and I observed a strange object in the sky which we were unable to identify. At the time, we were driving along a country road near Plainfield, Indiana and the object appeared to be following us. It was a clear night and the object was easily visible. It appeared to be metallic and was approximately 50-75 feet in diameter. It emitted a pulsating light and made no sound that we could hear. After several minutes, it accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

This evening, while I was sitting in my home, I observed another strange object in the sky. This time, it was hovering over a wooded area near my home. It appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a bright, pulsating light. I observed it for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

I am very concerned about these incidents and would appreciate any information or explanation you might be able to provide. I realize that my experiences may seem incredible, but I can assure you that they are completely true. I am a rational, levelheaded person and I have no desire to report anything that I cannot be certain of.

I hope you will be able to shed some light on this matter. I would be more than happy to provide any additional information or details that might be helpful.

Sincerely,
