Here is the text from the document:

See Dr. Hynek's rpt, Feb., 1962. weather.

Called Miss ___ regarding her sighting of 21 June 1967 at Las Vegas. Report was shoped and written. The object was over one and there were many contradictions. The girl turns out to be a freshman in college and not very sure of physical things. She is a journeyman radar and I would say all-in-all that the original analysis is probably correct. Instead of possible aircraft, I would say probably somewhat eccentric. The witness indicated a definite location of the object that has not been written very much to begin with.  

The diagram indicates that the object disappeared in the telephone conversation and it indicated that she never had to lift her head very much and that the object always appeared low in the sky. This is an unreliable and untrained witness and there certainly is no compelling reason to think she saw anything other than a aircraft.
