COPY.

2nd. October, 1964.

Dear Sir,
Thank you for your letter of the 25th. September, 1964. There is little to add to the newspaper report which you enclosed with your letter. The object observed was quite bright in appearance and was lost from sight at approximately 11.00 p.m. on the 23rd. September, 1964, within about 5 minutes. It was at a high altitude and moving steadily towards Essex. At no time was it possible to estimate its size or speed.

Yours faithfully,
Chief Constable of Kent.
