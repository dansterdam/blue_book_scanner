There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or report form with various questions about the sighting of an unidentified object. The questions cover details such as the object's disappearance, movement, sound, color, and size. There is also a request to draw a picture showing the shape and details of the observed object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes / No / Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes / No / Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound, b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
