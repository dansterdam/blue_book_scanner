The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document that includes diagrams and instructions related to observing and reporting unidentified flying objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object or objects (if any) were when you last saw them. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
