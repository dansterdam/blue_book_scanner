SA. WHEN MAKING YOUR SKETCH, PLEASE PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING. ALSO PLACE A LETTER "D" AT THE POSITION OF THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

TO THE SKETCH BELOW, PLEASE MAKE AS LARGE AS POSSIBLE AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "G" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "D" AND "G" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. ALSO, SKETCH ANY OUTSTANDING FEATURES OR DETAILS TOY MAY BE DISTINCTIVE FOR LATER
