Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent. I have been extremely interested in UFOs for several years now, and have read extensively on the subject. I often discuss UFOs with friends, some of whom have also sighted them. However, this is the first time I have personally witnessed a U.F.O. What I saw was a very bright, elliptical or round object, with a brighter light on the periphery, moving silently and swiftly from east to west across the sky. It was accompanied by several smaller objects. The sighting lasted about a minute and a half.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Reported it to a U.F.O. reporting agency sometime in June 1966, soon after the sighting occurred.
