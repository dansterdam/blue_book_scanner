Complaints About "A" UFO Procedure

To the Editor:
I would like to tell you about an incident that happened last Sunday evening at approximately 7 p.m. We were sitting on the front porch when we noticed what appeared to be a U.F.O. After observing that it did not seem to move my husband got the binoculars to see what it was. It was a flat object with three engine straight out behind it and one short one on the front that hung down. I called the police and they came, took one look and said The Dispatch and they gave me a number at L.A.F.B where I should report it. The lady I talked to was delightful. After I put the young man for almost a half hour I put my husband on the phone. He, too, got disgusted at the stupid questions that were asked of him. told the young man at L.A.F.B. he was reporting something to him, and that he was only trying to report something to him, and it is pretty sad to think that some Air Force in the minds of some people can't even ask a sensible question. If this is what they want to report an U.F.O, then I can understand why people are hesitant to get involved. That is the last time we will do it again.
