A DESIGN ANALYSIS OF THE CROWDER UFO:

1. The tank-shaped UFO as described by Crowder was estimated to be approximately 120 ft. in diameter and 15 ft. high.

2. The Apollo Lunar Module has somewhat similar overall dimensions, although it is not a simple cylinder. The Lunar Module is approximately 20 ft. high and 14 ft. in diameter. According to the simplified sketch, the total enclosed volume is somewhat less.

3. The Lunar Module is expected to weigh approximately 30,000 lb. This would give it a specific weight of 10 lb./cu. ft.

4. Assuming that the Crowder UFO had the same specific weight as the Lunar Module (10 lb./cu. ft.), then the Crowder UFO would weigh 17,000 lb.

5. The Lunar Module has four landing pads, each 37 inches in diameter, giving it a total pad area of 1,200 sq. in.

6. This gives the Lunar Module a pad-loading of 7 psi. on earth.

7. But when landing on the Moon, which has only 1/6th earth gravity, the effective Lunar Module pad-loading will be 1.2 psi.

8. The four "padprints" allegedly left by the Crowder UFO each measured approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The total "padprint" area of the four is then approximately 1.96 sq. in.

9. This gives the Crowder UFO a pad-loading of approximately 17,000 psi. (Based on assumed specific weight of 10 lb./cu. ft.)

10. Four-lane concrete highways are stressed to withstand loads of 640 psi.

11. Thus, the "design" of the Crowder UFO, by failing to use larger pads, ended up with a "craft" whose pad loading is 30 times too high to enable it to land on major highways without puncturing the concrete.
