The image does not contain any photographs, but rather diagrams and drawings related to a UFO sighting report. The diagrams include a sketch showing the height of the object above the horizon and the direction it was seen, as well as a drawing depicting the motion and direction of the object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
