The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter from Dr. J. A. Hynek to Mrs. Quarterara, who is described as being from the Air Force Academy in Colorado. The letter discusses an offer of services and an invitation to visit the area. The text of the letter is as follows:

Dr. J. A. Hynek
7 October 1964
Page 2

Wife of a Naval aviator (Cdr. _ _ _ _ _ _ , USN) and three daughters were driving from the Air Force Academy to Florida when they were forced to make an emergency landing due to trouble with their car. They proceeded to drive carefully and slowly to a service station but discovered that the battery was dead and the car would not start. They were all in transit to different destinations. I do not know the names of the officers who assisted them.

Mrs. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Air Force Academy, Colorado

Lt. Cdr. A. H. Rice, USN, recently came in to offer our services. If you could interest yourself and would like to offer our services, it would certainly be appreciated. We would be most happy to be of help in the Conet, we could work on this case.

Finally, I would like to invite you to visit us and the Naval Academy in this area.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek
