The party chief or boss of the local flying saucer investigating group was out and what was done could not be ascertained through this source. 

Consequently, we, the two investigators, proceeded to interview the key investigator, who was the acting chief in the absence of the party chief or boss. This key investigator stated that the photograph was taken by the group's photographer, who was an amateur but adequate photographer. The photographist was a Carpenter, employed as a meat cutter, who resided in Girard, Ohio. 

The key investigator stated that the negative and print of the photograph was turned over to the party chief or boss of the local investigating group as soon as it was developed. He said he did not know what became of it thereafter. This means the photograph and its analysis is in the files of the party chief or boss and not available to the two investigators at this time."
