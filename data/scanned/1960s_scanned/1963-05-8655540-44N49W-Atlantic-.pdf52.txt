TDED
EVALUATION of UFO Report From DOW AFB, Maine 26 June 1963

TDED (Lt Col Friend)

1. The two separate tracks are visible on the scope, two of which appear to be aircraft. The third track is at a varying angle as an aircraft riding. The third track is at a varying angle and appears to correspond to the three tracks indicated by the observer.

2. It would appear visual viewing might sight at least one of the tracks as an aircraft under other conditions and subject to being observed. The size and general appearance would likely be those of the observing aircraft and come within a 5 mile radius of the disappearance.

3. Since the "largest" were not seen visually or on any ground radar, and since the apparent speeds are considered too high for normal aircraft, it is likely that these objects represent returns of other equipment or phenomena such as anomalous propagation probably caused by atmospheric conditions.

4. It is still uncertain that the dark was submitted. The range on the scope was not indicated but is assumed to be within the capability of the DOW AFB radar installation. It is believed the weather conditions at the time could have influenced the visual as well as radar operation.
