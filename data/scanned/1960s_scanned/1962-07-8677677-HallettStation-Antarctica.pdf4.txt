Text from the document:

ON 7 July at 07/1156 an intense light was observed at Hallett Station. This light was first observed from the roof of a building and the Commanding Officer reported that the light was brighter than flares or illumination rockets being used for nightly observations. As the light moved over the station it was noted that there were two smaller lights trailing behind it and that the light appeared to have a reddish-orange glow. The relative position throughout the sighting was along with the upper air navigation lights. There was no apparent sound associated with the object and the direction of travel was from east to west. The sighting lasted 10-12 seconds.

Apparent brilliance rules out stars, planets, etc. The duration of the sighting precludes the possibility of a meteor or an aircraft flying across the sky. Since the object was observed by at least two independent observers, and the relative position and direction of travel was consistent, the probability of a positive identification as the object described is high. A tentative astronomical identification as a meteor is possible, but the duration, reddish-orange glow, and multiple lights are not typical of meteor sightings. The size, relative position, and time of observation could indicate a connection with aerial illumination activities, but the reddish-orange glow and multiple lights are not typical of such activities. This sighting, therefore, remains unidentified. No photograph was obtained. (Weather was reported as clear).
