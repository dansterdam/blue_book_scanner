The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, with some handwritten text at the bottom.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE OBJECT AS VIEWED THROUGH THE BINOCULARS AND WHAT WAS ITS APPROXIMATE SIZE IN FEET. ABOUT HOW LONG DID THE OBJECT REMAIN IN VIEW? WHAT WAS THE DIRECTION AND SPEED OF MOTION OF THE OBJECT? WHAT FRACTION OF THE TOTAL TIME WAS IT IN SIGHT?
