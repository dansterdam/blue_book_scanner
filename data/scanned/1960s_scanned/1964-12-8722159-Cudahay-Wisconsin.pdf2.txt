Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you identified an object which you could not identify.

From the information which you submitted, the duration of the speeded up object would indicate a speed observation; however, the description including the color change is not considered valid since this would ordinarily indicate a time lapse photographs which is not in accordance with the flight path from northeast ending in the south unless there was a change in course of the object.

Analysts at the Project Blue Book Investigation office are unable to determine the cause of your report. However, as you were served in conjunction with the lunar eclipse on 19 December 1964. Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
