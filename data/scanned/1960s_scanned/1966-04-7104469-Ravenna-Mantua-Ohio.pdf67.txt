Their conclusion that the object sighted was the planet Venus ridicules the United States Air Force has suffered a loss of prestige in this community.

However, the report further states that representatives of the United States Congressman is that representative of the community of investigative bodies have never personally come to this county to interview the witnesses. I am sure there are personnel available to conduct a thorough investigation.

I personally know the three officers involved. They are men and I feel is grossly unfairly undecided them for their conclusion in this matter until it has conducted a real and thorough investigation.

As the Congressman from this District I sincerely urge you that the Air Force immediately send investigators to Port make such an on the spot investigation and to re-evaluate after such a visit.

Sincerely yours,
Robert E. Cook
