4. The description of the object is as follows:
Due to the low ceiling and limited visibility it is extremely
doubtful that air traffic or balloon releases might account for the
sighting.

4300 AR WING (ADO-83) LANGLEY AFB, VIRGINIA. The description of the
sighting is from February, 1964. This object was observed by five high
school students. The students were using binoculars and stated that the object
was metallic in appearance and appeared to be in the size of a
DC-9 with the water. The object was also estimated to be about 3/4-mile
away as it crossed from the north to the south. The object blacked out and
was lost from sight in the vicinity of the James River bridge. A dull thud
was heard. The draw-bridge operator stationed on the James River bridge
and located down-stream from the sighting, stated that no aircraft
approached or was seen in the area during the 15 minutes the object was
visible. There were no vessels headed upstream at the time of the sighting.
The only vessel still and in that the object was observed passing over was
a barge on the James River. There is also the possibility that the many lights
in the Hampton Roads area could (reduce optical illusions) when
viewed through the blowing snow.
