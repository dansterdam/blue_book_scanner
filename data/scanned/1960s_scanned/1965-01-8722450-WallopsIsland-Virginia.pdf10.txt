WE REGRET TO ANNOUNCE THE RECENT DEATH OF MARION DARLING OF HOLLYWOOD, CALIF-ORNIA. SHE WAS THE WIFE OF GEORGE ADAMSKI, WHO DIED FIVE YEARS AGO. MARION HAD BEEN ILL FOR SOME TIME. SHE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PERSONS WHO WERE FRIENDLY WITH ADAMSKI IN THE 1950'S, AND SUPPORTED HIM IN THE MYSTERIOUS GOINGS-ON IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA DURING THAT PERIOD. ADAMSKI FOLLOWERS ARE SADDENED BY HER PASSING. YOUR EDITOR MET HER SEVERAL TIMES, AND FOUND HER TO BE A CHARMING WOMAN.

CONTACT: PLEASE NOTE - On February 11th, a newswriter, CALIFORNIA TELEVISION CRITIC G.K.B. GAVE US A CALL, TELLING US THAT HE HAD BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH A TOP SCIENTIST WHO HAD BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH UFOS, AND THAT THE SCIENTIST WAS TO MAKE A STATEMENT SOON. THE NEWSWRITER TOLD US THAT THE MAN "WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT HOSTILE," AND THAT HE FOUND THE SCIENTIST'S CLAIMS "VERY INTERESTING INDEED." WE AWAIT DEVELOPMENTS ON THIS MATTER WITH INTEREST.

REGARDING THE SAUCER FLAP IN VIRGINIA CONTINUES. Clippings are still pouring into our office from there, and a new wave of landing and low-level sightings is reported. THE CASE OF JANUARY 29TH, AT PORTSMOUTH, VA., WHICH STARTED THE FLAP, IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED CAREFULLY. THIS UFO HAD APPARENTLY LANDED IN A WOODED AREA, AND ITS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WAS FOUND ON THE GROUND. SOME OF THE DETAILS ARE STILL BEING CHECKED. MEANWHILE, ANOTHER CASE HAS OCCURRED NEAR THE APPALACHIAN RIVER, AT FREDERICKSBURG, VA. THIS OBJECT HAD HOVERED OVER A HIGHWAY, AND WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL WITNESSES. IT IS BEING INVESTIGATED. THE LATEST CASE TOOK PLACE AT DINWIDDIE, VA., WHEN A FARMER REPORTED THAT A LARGE DISC-SHAPED UFO HAD LANDED IN HIS FIELD. INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING ON ALL THESE CASES.
