14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

I had just come home from work and was standing in the doorway. This is the first time I hav seen a thing like this before.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

It just gradually faded out of sight. It had the appearance of a solid object at first, then it seemed to scatter or break up as it moved away. It had moved toward the south at a fast rate.  

5. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE IN FRONT OF OR BEHIND SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING, AT ANY TIME?

The object appeared to be suspended in the sky at first, then gradually moved off into the distance.  It was not observed going behind or in front of any object.
