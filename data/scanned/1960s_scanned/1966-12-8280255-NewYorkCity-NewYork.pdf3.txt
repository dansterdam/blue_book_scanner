Text from the document:

There appears to be about 8 or 9 inches of clearance below the instrument 
panel and about 4 feet clearance in front of the instrument panel, seat and 
controls (controls). The cabin interior is observed to be totally vacant except for
a single seat/couch on the left side. The interior color appears to be of dull silver,
gray or metallic appearance. No observable windows or portholes are present.
The exterior shape and contour (observed when landing) appears to be circular 
with a dome-like upper section and a rather flat bottom section. The estimated size
would be approximately 30 feet in diameter. The color of the exterior when observed 
just prior to landing appeared to be dull silver or gray metallic.
