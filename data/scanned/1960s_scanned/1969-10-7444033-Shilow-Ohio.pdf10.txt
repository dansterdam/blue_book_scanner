The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a blank page in an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with text instructions at the top on how to describe a photograph if one were present. Since there is no photograph in this image, I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document.

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WELL AS POSITION, AND INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING. 
16. SUCH THINGS AS THE APPROXIMATE SIZE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR BUILDING, AND MAKE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW IT COMPARES IN SIZE TO THAT OBJECT. ALSO ESTIMATE HOW IT COMPARED IN BRIGHTNESS, LIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MOON'S DIAMETER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
