The image contains a compass-like diagram in the top half and two landscape sketches in the bottom half. The compass diagram appears to be used to indicate the direction of an observed phenomenon. The two landscape sketches depict an aerial view of a landscape, possibly from the perspective of the observer.

Text extracted from the image:
6. HOW INCHES YOUR HEAD? 6" SHOW DIRECTION WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON. 

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW A LINE CONNECTING THESE TWO POINTS. THIS WILL SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS IN A STRAIGHT LINE OR WHETHER IT WAS ERRATIC. ALSO INDICATE BY ARROW THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT AND SPEED IF KNOWN.
