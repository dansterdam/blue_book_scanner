Toledo, Ohio 43614
June 22, 1964

Dear Sirs:

My name is [REDACTED] and I am 22 years old and a graduate of the University of Detroit. I work at Radio Station [REDACTED].

Leaving the station alone the night of Saturday, June 13, 1964, along the drive over the airport field adjacent to the station, I saw strange objects in the air flying over the field. I observed them for approximately ten minutes and at a range of about 300 feet. The objects had no lights, no vapor trails, and no discernible wings or fuselage. They made no noise.

They had approximately the size and shape of the cockpits of some jet fighters that I am familiar with. There were five in a formation and I observed them move and change directions under complete control. At one point they appeared to form a cluster and then scattered.

I was very excited by what I saw. Since there was no more than this sighting that night, I waited to be sure that what I had seen was more than a transitory phenomenon. Unfortunately, I have not observed anything similar since then.

I would be grateful if you would let me know if you have any information on such sightings in the Toledo area or elsewhere. At present, I am convinced that the objects I saw were not part of any of our conventional aircraft. They appeared to be of an advanced design not known to me.

The size and maneuverability of the objects leads me to believe they were not conventional aircraft. I would appreciate your comments on this unusual sighting.

If you wish me to complete some kind of formal report, I would be happy to oblige.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
