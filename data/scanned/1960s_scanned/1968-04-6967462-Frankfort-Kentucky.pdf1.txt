11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers were asleep when they were awakened by a loud noise similar to noise power lines make on a cold day. When the source of the noise couldn't be discovered they decided to go to the door. Just then they sighted the object through the window. It appeared as a dull yellow-ish light that traveled in about 5 minutes. They observed that their dogs were barking and seemed very frightened.

COMMENTS: A form 117 was sent to the observer but was not returned. It is unknown if the object passed in front of or behind anything, or if the light appeared to go off.
