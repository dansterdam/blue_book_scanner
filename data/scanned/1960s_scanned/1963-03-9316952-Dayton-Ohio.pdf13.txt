The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved trajectory line and asks the viewer to imagine that they are at the point shown and to place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it.

The second sketch shows a broader landscape view, with a person standing in the middle of a road. This sketch is referred to as a "smaller sketch" that serves as an example of how to complete the first sketch.
