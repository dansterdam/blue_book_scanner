UAO: Over Boulder

The report states that a group of students at the University of Boulder, Colorado (USA) reported seeing a "light formation" with "inverted 'V' wings" which came to a point at their trailing edges at 7:35 p.m. on 24 February 1965. They said the object was white against the crisp, dark winter sky. The object was flying in formation at a very high altitude, and at first the witnesses thought they were just stars, but they soon concluded they were not normal stars. The witness said the object made no sound and did not appear to be an aircraft. He had observed such phenomena before and said that the object moved out from the formation in a jerky movement. He said it quickly returned to the formation, indicating it was under intelligent control. The witness said the object was seen to be weaving back and forth across the camp to and they were going from southwest to northeast at a high speed.
