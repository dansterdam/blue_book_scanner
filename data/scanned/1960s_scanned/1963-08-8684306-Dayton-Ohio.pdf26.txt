Activity over Gloucester
The following information was reported to the investigation of UFOs where a report had appeared in the press, by Mr. and Mrs. Gavin, who live at 138 Broadway, Gloucester. They reported that at about 10:30 p.m. on the night of 15th August 1963, they, together with Mr. Gavin's brother and sister-in-law and Mrs. Gavin's parents, who were visiting them, all saw an unusual sight in the sky over Gloucester.
They stated that they first saw a cluster of bright objects moving straight across the sky. These were estimated to be about eight or ten lights, possibly more. They moved swiftly and silently, changing direction several times. They appeared to be at a fairly high altitude. After a few minutes, this cluster broke up and a series of individual lights, about six in number, were observed moving on a more erratic course. These appeared to be larger than the lights in the original group and were of a red or orange color. They also seemed to be at a lower altitude. Occasionally they would disappear from view and then reappear. This activity went on for about 20 minutes, after which the lights gradually faded from sight.
The witnesses stated that on more than one occasion, the lights formed a triangular or wedge-shaped pattern. Although the group was not photographed, it was reported that they decided to call the police, but by the time they had made the call, the activity had ceased.
