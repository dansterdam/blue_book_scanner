War Department
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs:

I would like to inform you of what I saw on the date of Feb. 12, 1962. I was looking at the moon at approximately 4:17 P.M. when I suddenly saw a strange object flying between me and the moon. It was flying at a high altitude at a northern direction at a 25 degree angle. The thing was moving at a very fast speed so fast I could hardly keep up with it. To me it looked something like a jet plane but I'm not sure as any of our jet planes I've ever seen. Please reply this letter because I'm very curious.

It looked something like this. 

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

P.S.
If you do not take letters like this and it to someone who does. Thank you.
