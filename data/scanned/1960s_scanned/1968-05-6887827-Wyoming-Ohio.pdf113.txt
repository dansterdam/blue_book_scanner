Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear sir,

Enclosed is a carbon copy of the report to the sheriff's department of Marathon County, on the sighting of the UFA near Mosine, WI 29.

One correction I might make... on page 2, there is reference to a Frank Koszak-- this should be Frank Jerzak of the UFA.

It is not necessary to return this report... I look forward to seeking you on Friday, and hope we have some response to request or further witnesses...

Sincerely,
Jan Dady
