14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON? 
It was looking out the side window of the car, I had seen some cycle ahead (worth) which I thought were fast out of the plain field, wash.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It went behind and out the right of the car. They went south of us, they split in a climb of two-up and out of sight.

DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? 
NO - IF YES, DESCRIBE
