my friend and myself were standing in front
of the house at XXX - - - - - - - - XXXX 
mo. we saw a flying object standing in the sky. 
it was the object was strange to me. i mentioned to 
my wife. it was almost out of sight. i hastily 
looked at it and it disappeared. i instantly
ran to the telephone to call the sheriff, but
i hesitated because i would think i am crazy. we
watched it for a few minutes and started
saying "look." when we first saw it, it was
about the size of a basketball. the exact size
i'm not sure. as i said, it was in a row, we
realized the situation was more serious than
we thought. the object was fair more distance
than i saw it, it no longer had the brightness
house and a more stop the same. i went inside the
attic where the i formed from the telephone directory
the triplanny relic, we couldn't
outside and sighted. it the next time i
sergeant gave us the telephone and made a report
then went back outside and started w... once
again. i made my report of approximately
1:15 p.m. just within minutes of the first sighting.
