Obs. A description and drawing of the object:
The edge of the object was solid and smooth but it didn't reflect light evenly. Its contours were the under part. He couldn't see the top or the sides clearly. Lights pulasted so rapidly that they remember, lights. He didn't remember where they were on the object except lights pulsated so rapidly. They were found and about 1/4 mile in size of a light. The objects size was 27 ft. long and 10 ft. high after observing an auto 1/2 mile away. It was found that the object just have been a could not have seen it at all.

Obs. B description and drawing of the object:
Seen a dark curved shape. He said it would be the same as if you shut all the lights in a house. You could still see a dark something. He saw at least 8 distinct bright clear bright lights - they were a little bigger than ordinary house lights in between he could see faint dim lights. They pulsated slowly. Dont remember the estimated distance between the end lights 2 was 23 foot apart and 6 after observing two 4 inch lights in the field at the same distance.

The adult witness and the boys estimated the boys to be 9 feet from the object at a distance. The adult witness said the boys were about 7 inches off the distance. This appears to be a cone shaped hose and 4 3 estimated red appears to be in the 7 or 8 inches in diameter. The top edge curves and not even the winds blowing as the top edge disturbed the ground as it flew near did not when the boys were fairly shocked and winds hard. Can be said that it was like a flier than wild had swiveled on it and then drilled in the rush.
