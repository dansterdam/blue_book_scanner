The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

The text from the document is as follows:

The object that we were observing was clearly seen by me as was several others. We were traveling slowly and the object was stationary almost directly over the area where our highway was located. The object was described as round, disc shaped with a yellowish orange light around the edge and no bright light in the center. The object was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 3-5 minutes before it accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared from sight.

I have a deep conviction that what I saw was a bona-fide unidentified flying object. It did not behave like any conventional aircraft I have ever seen before.
