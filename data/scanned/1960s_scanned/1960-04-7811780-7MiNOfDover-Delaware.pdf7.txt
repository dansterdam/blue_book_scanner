UFO Report
for: ATTN (CDRU)
INTELLIGENCE DIVISION ASB, OHIO

1. Reference our message PIRN LD-13, dated 11 April 1960 and our previous report PIRN LD-12/53 dated 25 March 1960; following conditions are reported based on an interrogation of Army and Navy observers at the scene. Slight differences are indicated in parentheses.

2. Description of the object:
(1) The object consisted of a cluster of three lights.
The first, in direction of movement toward the horizon, was largest and bright white. 
(2) The entire cluster was the size of a quarter held at arm's length. The size of a "pea" individually. No discernible shape between the lights.
(3) "A" was bright yellow, no tail. "B" and "C" were more reddish in color.

(4) Three.
(5) "A" behind, "B" and "C" following "A" and close to the right of "A".
(6) None.
(7) No tail or trail.

Authorities at the sight stated they were at a loss to explain the phenomenon. Upon interrogation, it was determined that the object was moving slowly in a 20 degree arc, drifting slowly, north and west, with the windows closed. Relative weight of this statement should be judged accordingly.
