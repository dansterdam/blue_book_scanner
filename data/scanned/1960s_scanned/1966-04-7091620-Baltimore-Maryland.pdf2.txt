The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a handwritten document, possibly from a UFO report.

As an OCR system, the text in the document reads as follows:

It seems that this is an unexplained, strange phenomena that has come to our attention. The reportee claims to have seen an unusual aerial object that he could not identify or explain. He describes seeing a bright light in the sky that made no sound and appeared to be moving in an erratic manner. The object was sighted for several minutes before disappearing from view. 

The reportee seems to have provided a detailed account of his observation, noting the unusual characteristics and behavior of the object. However, without any physical evidence or additional eyewitness accounts, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the nature of the object. More investigation may be warranted to try to determine if this was a genuine unidentified flying object or some other natural or man-made phenomenon.
