The image contains a drawing of a compass and some geometric shapes, but it does not appear to contain a photograph.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline). Draw a "B" on the same line to show where you first saw the object. Place a "C" on the compass where the object was when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT: Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
