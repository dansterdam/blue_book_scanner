Dear Mrs. Kennedy:
Just a note to tell you that we saw an orange object, kite shaped, fly southeast over our house at 8:00 pm last night.
It hovered for a few minutes and then sped away at tremendous speed completely out of sight in a matter of seconds. It was an amazing sight, and my husband and I were both amazed at this unusual occurrence.
I hope this information will be of some value to you.
Sincerely yours,
