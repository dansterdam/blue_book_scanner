There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten text from an old UFO report document.

Using an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

Witness:
Receiving this letter in relation to a sighting verified was on the night of October 15, 1966 approximately 8:15 - It travelled through the city from the south-eastern first spotted and disappeared into the west-north-west. It possessed the size of a car and colored various shades of orange and yellow intermitently, and seemed to hover stationary a few seconds at a time, and to travel between the above mentioned 2 points, took at least 10 or 15 minutes. It glided through the air making no sound at all. It made no effort to man or any other objects. There was no sound to indicate sound waves. I discussed this sighting with my family, outside the immediate reaction of they all seemed not to believe.
