E. U. CONDON
-2- 21 FEBRUARY 1968

No report had been received by 31 January 1968. According to further information which Capt. Quintnilian, Hq USAF, Chanhute AFB, had gone on temporary duty and only now would be available for interview. Chinhphan agreed to give priority to obtaining Quintnilian's statement, asking him to send immediately a copy of the initial UFO sighting report which Grattit received through Chicago Center. The latter was done, and a copy is attached.

As of this date (21 February 1968) no report of the UFO incident of 19 December 1967 has yet been received by the Colorado Project from Chanhute AFB or other source.
