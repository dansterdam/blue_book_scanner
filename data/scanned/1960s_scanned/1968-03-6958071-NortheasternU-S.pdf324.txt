Transcribed text:

Sighting of fireballs. On March 3rd at about 6:30 p.m. Eastern Standard time, James L. Whitley, William Doelling, and Barbara Dodson, Wilmington, Delaware, observed two bright, fast-moving objects. Moving slowly from southwest to northeast, there were two of these objects which disappeared in about 13 seconds, finally breaking up and disappearing rapidly in about 2 seconds, from northern horizon to south.

It was only two objects of magnitude C, as per Dr. J.R. Winn. Having an angular size of 30 minutes of arc. If these were astronomical objects, this size would make them between 40 to 50 feet in diameter.

The intensity was that of a 1st magnitude star. The frequency is unexplained. The origin is also unexplained.

The use of a telescope revealed no detail, merely increasing the size of the object slightly.

This sighting has been the subject of much investigation by the Center.
