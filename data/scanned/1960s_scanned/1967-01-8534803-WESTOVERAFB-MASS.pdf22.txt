My dear friend,
I remember them mentioning the sightings in which I was involved, but cannot give you the names of the witnesses involved. It is a possibility that the sightings could have been caused by some natural phenomenon, but in my opinion that is highly unlikely. The details of my sighting are as follows: I was in a certain location at a certain time and I observed a strange object in the sky. It did not appear to be an aircraft or any other man-made object. I watched it for some time and it exhibited unusual characteristics and behavior. I have no reason to doubt the veracity of my own observations. I hope this information is helpful to you in your investigation. Please let me know if you require any clarification or have additional questions.
Sincerely,
