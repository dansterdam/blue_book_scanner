The enclosed report is forwarded for your information. The following is a suggested reply:

The enclosed fact sheet is provided as general information on the results of Project Blue Book. This document contains the results of our investigations since its inception in 1947.

On Oct 7 and Oct 8 do much toward piecing this unusual phenomenon. The results were not of a nature to be of interest to the general public. Photographs of UFOs are submitted to the Air Force for analysis. These reports and those received from Hamilton Air Force Base during the period 1 May to 30 Aug 55, compiled and evaluated. The cumulative data was such as to establish the existence of this aerial phenomena and various observations of stars and planets. These sightings, and Venus were the major astronomical bodies observed.

Photographs of UFOs are submitted to the Air Force for technical analysis. When permission is obtained, these prints and pictures may be used for briefings. As of this date, no photographs have been submitted that have passed the careful technical analysis. Unidentified targets, such as balloons, stars, et cetera, which include lights, objects, reflections, etc., witnessed in the camera, film, aerial photography, and telescope images, are recorded in the files. Since the Air Force never claims a case solved unless the evidence clearly and unmistakably discloses the identity of the object, the name is regarded in the field of public domain and can be used in accordance with UFO reports.
