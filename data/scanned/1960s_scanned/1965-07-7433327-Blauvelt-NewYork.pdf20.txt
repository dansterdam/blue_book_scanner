The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch shows a saucer-shaped object with a dome-like structure on top. The text accompanying the sketch describes the witness's observation of the UFO, stating that it was sighted drifting south and east on the west side of a house. The witness mentions that the object made a humming noise and appeared to be about the size of a bushel basket. The text also includes some additional commentary about the appearance and behavior of the observed object.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

Beugt at 9:08 a.m. of the observed flying object. Was sighting south and east on the west side of the house. At drifting in any, I'm thin it made a noise, humming and soft, East. Cost, it moved slowly. And again, almost of its one, and then the second time, it disappeared over the same way you came. I saw it for about 1 minute, but it looked like a bushel basket in size. When it stopped it looked like a ashape, whish was up, and a brush head in the center.
