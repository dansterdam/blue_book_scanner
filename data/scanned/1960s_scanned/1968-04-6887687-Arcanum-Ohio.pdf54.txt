DETAILED SIGHTING ACCOUNT
By - Herbert Eismann

Mrs. Power retired early Friday evening and was awakened at approximately 2:30 A.M. Saturday morning by a noise. She looked out the window and observed a large, round, luminous object in the sky. She could not find words to describe the scene. The object appeared to be hovering about 150 yards away. However, the noise disappeared when the object seemed to move rapidly away, passing behind trees and out of sight. 

The object was moving in a NE direction, drifting slowly and appearing quite large. It was about the size of a small airplane or large helicopter, completely silent, and illuminated with a soft white light. The object passed in front of trees, indicating it was relatively close to the ground. Mrs. Power did not hear any unusual sounds or detect any odor.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:
I. ESTIMATED SIZE OF OBJECT
Assuming that Mrs. Power's estimate that the object was 5 inches in diameter and 200 feet away is correct, then the maximum size of the object would have been about 5"/.24°° = 2Yz" = 12000" - x = 500" or about 40'.

II. SUGGESTED EXPLANATIONS - PROS & CONS
A. German Box Balloon, Hoax
1. Foam
a. Size at arms-length could have been exaggerated or object was much closer than realized.
b. Objec+s configuration somewhat similar to Garment Bag Balloon.
