The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text on the page discusses "Unidentified flying objects" and describes various sightings and reports, including one about a "squadron in Brazil" where "Saucers Are Flying All Around--Even Landing Reported".

A SQUADRON IN BRAZIL 
Saucers Are Flying All Around--Even Landing Reported

Continued from Page 1

Several Austin residents now
residing in Brazil report strange
objects in the skies over that
country. Clyde Lewis, who at
one time lived in Austin and was
known here, says the objects are
seen almost daily and sometimes
at night as well as daytime.

The sighting of the so-called
"flying saucers" in Brazil is not
new, Mr. Lewis says. For the
past several years, he has been
hearing reports from other
American residents there of such
sightings. The objects often are
round and disk-shaped, he says, 
and sometimes appear to land.
Just last month, he says, one of
the Brazilian newspapers carried
a report of the possible landing 
of a flying saucer in a rural area.
Some Austin residents who
have returned from Brazil report
similar experiences.

UNBELIEVABLE ALMOST
Dr. Hynek, director of the
Dearborn Observatory at North-
western University, admits
that reports of flying saucers 
over Brazil are "almost unbelieva-
ble." However, he says, similar
sightings have been reported
from other parts of the world,
including the United States.

DR. HYNEK COMMENTS
"There is no doubt," Dr.
Hynek said, "that many of these
sightings represent genuine
phenomena which have not yet
been satisfactorily explained.
That there is a common pattern 
in these sightings around the
world is quite remarkable."
