The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a blank space with some handwritten notes. The text in the document states:

"WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. MOVE IT BACK AND FORTH UNTIL IT COVERS THE OBJECT, ESTIMATING RELATIVE WHAT FRACTION OF THE OBJECT'S DIAMETER IT COVERS."

The handwritten notes in the image appear to be trying to measure the angular size of some object using the method described, with the numbers "50" written in the margin.
