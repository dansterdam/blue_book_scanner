There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document related to a UFO sighting.

The text in the document reads:

"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 10 July 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

All information on this questionnaire was given to Lt. Col. Tacker over the phone by Capt. Diamond at 20:15 EST, 10 July 1966.

Capt. Diamond stated that he had formerly contacted Lt. Col. Tacker and that the photo which was promised back on 10-10-1965 has still not been received.

Capt. Diamond stated that he would receive a questionnaire to complete."
