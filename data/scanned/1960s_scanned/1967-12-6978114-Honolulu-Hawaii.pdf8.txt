14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
It was a dark night, at 8:15 pm, my attention was drawn to
the object when I was standing in the garden waiting for a friend to pick me up in her car. Clouds obscure the moon somewhat, but I saw a bright circular object approach, which at first I thought was a plane. However, its speed and the way it moved drew my attention. It moved across the sky at a rapid rate, made an approximate 90 degree turn, and then moved to disappear behind some hills in the distance. The observation time was approximately 2 to 3 minutes, with the object clearly visible for an estimated 2 continuous seconds at a time, with approximately 2 second intervals.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It disappeared behind hills known at St. Louis Heights.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
Yes, the object moved behind hills.
