My former lawyer Congressman stated that as an accountant I should know better than to be taken in by the propaganda put out by self-styled UFO organizations.
He contends the whole issue is a mass delusion, that there is no scientific evidence of the existence of flying saucers or interplanetary spacecraft, and that the many so-called sightings can be explained as natural phenomena or man-made objects.
In view of the nature of my former position, I do not wish to become involved in any controversy over this matter. I can only say that I have an open mind on the subject and am not convinced that the reports of reputable observers can be completely dismissed.
