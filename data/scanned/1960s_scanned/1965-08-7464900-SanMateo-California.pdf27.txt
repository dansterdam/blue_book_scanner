Dear Lieutenant-Colonel Spaulding:

Thank you for your letter of July 16, regarding the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). I am very glad the Air Force checks on them.

However, as you will note from the enclosure, which I send in case it may be of interest to you, there would seem to be some Payette civilians who regard these flying saucer identifications as a sort of Freak Show. The enclosed clipping, from an editor, is either more naive than one would think, or having a lot of fun with these incidents. Incidentally, the group was covered by a reporter from the Times, with considerable publicity-and that is usual.

The only UFO's I have seen around these parts are (1) the tall light of a high-flying plane, and (2) a strange light, hovering on the horizon until it moved off rapidly. Neither of these was photographed. It's a pity your scientists cannot identify the ones that have been photographed on the horizon stars. Until identified, I suspect them to be phenomena that are not understandable to the lay mind.

Incidentally, my letter to the NICAP, addressed to Matawan, New Jersey (the best address I could remember) was returned - "Insufficient Address."

Sincerely,
Richard Harris Bumpus
