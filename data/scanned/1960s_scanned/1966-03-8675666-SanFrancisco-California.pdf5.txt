There is no visible photograph in the provided image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document.

Since the image does not contain a human face, I will proceed to produce the text output from the document:

SPECIAL REPORT (CONTINUED)

SPECIAL PHENOMENON CONTINUED
- AT FINAL BREAK-UP TRACK-
MENTS ACROSS SKY NOT LIKE MAIN 
OBJECT - BUT WENT OUT (DISINTEGRATED)
& EXTINGUISHED AFTER APPROX. 
10Â° ARC.

WITNESSES: NONE. (CALLED WIFE
& CHILDREN - BUT THEY DID
NO WANT TO GO OUTSIDE IN QUICK 
SHOWER TIME.)

SOUND & ODORS: - NONE. (NOTHING
HEARD SPECIALLY)

LATER ACTIVITY: NONE. (IT WATCHED
FOR ANOTHER 1/2 HR. THEN "LISTENED"
ALL OVER AREA TO NEIGHBORS OR BLAZE
FOR CRASH, BUT THERE WAS NONE.)

COMMENT: I KNOW THIS WOULD SEEM LIKE A METEORITE AT 
FIRST ANALYSIS; BUT THE OBJECT GLOWED AND SEEMED 
OF THE FINAL ODD BREAK-UP NATURE THAT THE WEATHER 
BUREAU SAYS THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN ON ANYTHING THEY HAVE 
ALSO, IT JUST SEEMED WAY TOO SLOW FOR ANY 
METEORITE FALL.
