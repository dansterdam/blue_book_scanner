There is a sketch or diagram present in the image. The diagram shows an overhead view of an object or objects in the sky, along with some angular measurements and instructions for the observer to draw the path and changes in direction of the object(s).

Text from the image:
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" in the curve of the horizon (skyline) to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass when you first saw it. 
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects move. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during its course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
