The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a detailed description of a UFO sighting.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE
STAND STILL A MOMENT
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY
BREAK UP IN TO PARTS AND EXPLODE
FLUTTER OR JIGGLE
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS
WHAT DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

DOES THE OBJECT MOVE LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
