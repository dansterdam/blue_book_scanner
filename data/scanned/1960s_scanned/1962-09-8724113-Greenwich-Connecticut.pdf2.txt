Dear Sirs:
I would like to report an unidentified flying object observed by
myself and my wife on September 7, 1962 at Greenwich, Connecticut.
At approximately 6:15 P.M. on that date, I was looking out of the
picture window in our home when I noticed a bright object in the sky
moving in a northerly direction. I called my wife's attention to it
and we both watched it for several minutes. The object was round,
silvery in color and larger than a star. It was moving at a high rate
of speed, much faster than any airplane we have ever seen. As it
moved northward, it seemed to change direction slightly, moving in a
northeasterly direction. It continued on this course until it disappeared
from view. The sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes.
The sky was clear at the time and the object was easily visible
against the blue background. It was not a planet, as we have observed
the planets many times, nor was it an airplane, helicopter or any
familiar object.
I am a former Naval officer and have had some experience
with aerial phenomena. This sighting was quite different from anything
I have ever observed before. I would appreciate hearing from you
concerning this report.
Respectfully yours,
