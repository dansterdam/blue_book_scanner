UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS SEEN BY SEVERAL PERSONS
Two Policemen
Among Viewers

RANDOLPH: An unidentified flying object was seen by several persons, including two Randolph policemen, about 8:49 Saturday night by Randolph resident Mrs. Ruth Johnson of 26 Cortland Street. Mrs. Johnson described it as pearl-white in color, oblong in shape and moving erratically in the sky. At times it would appear to stand still and then suddenly dart around at a high rate of speed. 

Randolph police reported receiving numerous telephone calls from citizens reporting the object. Although exact details differ, most of the witnesses described the object as pearl-white, oblong in shape, and traveling swiftly through the sky at times standing still and then darting rapidly away. One resident said he could see the object from the cellar of his house, and "it was as bright as the full moon." 

Three Randolph policemen, Patrolmen Fredrick Connor and Joseph Lank, said they saw the object. Patrolman Connor said the object was "as big as a large transport plane and flew in a northerly direction." Patrolman Lank said he saw the object, but it disappeared behind a building as he watched it. Both men described the object as pearl-white in color, oblong in shape, and traveling swiftly.

Almost all callers, Randolph police said, made the same general description of the object, and they also reported that whatever it was, "it moved very quickly and then disappeared from sight." 

Not investigated. May follow up on this one.
