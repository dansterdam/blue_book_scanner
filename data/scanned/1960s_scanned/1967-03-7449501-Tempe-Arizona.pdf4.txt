Ref. 13-C. After I had been watching the four to a while, one seemed to go out of another look at me as I was watching, and the light seemed to drop under it. watching again with binoculars I could seem to be turning off and on at irregular intervals. At a distance of 13 yards, the total light was diminished again, Glasses again in check with eyes only one and the impression was that the light was going on and off, at shorter intervals and it appears to be down to just one source or noise, and this suddenly went out watching them. This seemed to distinguish a kelving or rillain balloonreflecting light - can't tell by this time the object had drifted further and was at high altitude and was almost lost to view, had been on the NW when first observed.

Decrease in the in the Brighter with Capt. 1) USAF indicates that this was is at low altitude corresponding to bright light accompanied by an object. The effect of motion would be the light glitter that would be the usual clue to look through clear or milky path.
