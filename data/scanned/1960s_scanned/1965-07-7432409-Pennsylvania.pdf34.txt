Dear Maj. Quintanella:

I wonder if you could give me any additional information regarding the object which my neighbor and I saw in the sky north of Athens Monday evening, July 12th? From various newspaper accounts, I gather that it was apparently seen by many people throughout this entire area, yet still how we can't explain any explanation for it.

Several neighbors and I first saw the object about 7:30 P.M. as it moved north of Athens and at a height of about 40-45Â° above the horizon: it was moving very slowly towards the NNE (as near as we could tell from our lineup, it should be about 1/4 to 1/2 mile above the ground). At telephoto lens, and then watched it through field glasses until it finally disappeared as a tiny pin-point of light at about 9:00 P.M.

The most logical explanation, of course, is that it was a high-altitude research balloon, but even that theory leaves many unanswered questions:

1) Where did it come from, and why didn't the FAA know anything about it? An object so big that it can be seen at the same time in places 100 miles apart just can't be launched by some kid in his backyard.

2) Where did it go? It should have revealed itself somewhere over the Dakotas, and it would have been as hard to miss in their skies as it was in ours.

3) Neither observation through field glasses nor the photographs show anything on the instrument package or any kind of marking that I can just imagine would not do to a light-flying device in the middle of the night.

In short, can it be that our multi-billion dollar defense establishment can protect us from enemy bombers, rockets, and missiles--but leaves us wide-open to attack by balloons? Does none the word "never" reaches Havana?

Thank you.
Sincerely yours,
