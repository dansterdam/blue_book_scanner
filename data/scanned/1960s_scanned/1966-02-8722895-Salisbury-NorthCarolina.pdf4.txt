Dear Dr. Hynek:

Enclosed is a copy of a record that I have made of this report that I have received from the General Scientific Studies Division, U.S. Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. 

This report is interesting because of the general skeptical attitude that has been shown in the handling of it. This report seems to indicate that there is something of interest in the area and that this interest has some considerable substance to it.

I do not see that I can add anything further, except to say that I have done what I can to convince myself that there is nothing of interest here. However, I have not been able to do so, and the report in the shape that it is seems to indicate that there is something here that is worth pursuing.

I would appreciate your comments on this matter, if you have the time.

Sincerely yours,
Reginald H. Brown
