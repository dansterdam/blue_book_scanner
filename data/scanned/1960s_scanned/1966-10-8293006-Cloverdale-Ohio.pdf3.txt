Gentlemen:

I wish to report the sighting of a flying object which my Dad and I made on the night of 10-28-65.
It appeared in the southeast at about 7:25 p.m. EDT. It seemed to move north a small distance and then north again, hovering then disappearing completely from the naked eye, and was orange in color. The object appeared to move north a small distance and then north again, hovering then disappearing completely from the naked eye.

Please advise dates & time your maximum is open to the public. Is it true that you have unidentified flying objects? If so, give these objects available for viewing? I am inclosing a self-addressed stamped envelope. Thank you.
