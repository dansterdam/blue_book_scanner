The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing observations or details related to a UFO incident.

Other descriptions to the witness could be included, as written and to the conclusion. 

Could be that a check of the weather might also show the conditions at the time assuming the conditions were significant to the observation. Many lines as good.
