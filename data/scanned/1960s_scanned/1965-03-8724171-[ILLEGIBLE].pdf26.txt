The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document.

Kitchen a plane cut the winter roven a sort of pole, sticking out of the ground in a place where are no holes. A light in the back yard was turned on but did not illuminate the pole any better. (See drawing, attachment 1 for location of sighting). The "pole" disappeared later that evening. Debts called from the bathroom that there was some kind of pole sticking up from the rear corner of the house next door. At first he thought it was the neighbors TV antenna, but a closer look showed the pole to be on the corner of the house but out beyond the corner at approximately the same position as he had seen it earlier.
At this time the witness got a flashlight and went to the rear porch, and played the beam up and down the pole. It looked like a large automobile aerial, chrome-plated, about thirty feet tall. It appeared to have no base, and was topped by a small, gold-colored ball. She then went to call her husband.
It was at this time she decided to lot describe the location of their residuce.
The incidents or the alleged inference and the pole appearance could possibly have been caused by some sort of weather phenomenon and were included in this report only because of the short man of this duration which all things indicate was some brief occurrence.
It was not available for comment on his proposed sighting on 25 March 55. (See basic letter). This too could possibly have been caused by some sort of weather phenomenon.
He confirmed that he, his wife and two neighbors, thoroughly searched the area where the "pole" appeared, with negative results.
No unusual sightings have been seen in that area since that time.
