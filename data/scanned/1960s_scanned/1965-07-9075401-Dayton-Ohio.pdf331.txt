Transcription of the text from the document:

July 9, 1965

This case is an exception in that the sighting was practically "point blank" range. The light seemed to be hovering and was so bright that it was easily visible even in daylight.

At the time I was driving on Ohio route 444, approximately 3 miles north of Dayton, Ohio. The light was hovering over a wooded area to the west of the highway. It seemed to be about 500-1000 feet in the air and about 1/4 mile away from the highway.

The light was brilliant white in color and appeared to be about 15-20 feet in diameter. There was a thin dark line across the center of the light which may have been the edge of the object itself. The light did not seem to be rotating or pulsing, but remained steady.

I observed the light for about 3 to 5 minutes before it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from view. I had the impression that the light was under intelligent control and that it became aware of my observation and quickly departed.

I have no reason to disbelieve the reality of this sighting. The light was so bright and close that it could hardly have been any conventional aircraft or other explainable phenomenon. The suddenness and speed of its departure also seems inconsistent with any known type of aircraft.
