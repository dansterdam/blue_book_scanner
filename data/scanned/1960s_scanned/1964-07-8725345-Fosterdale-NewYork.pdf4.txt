Stewart Air Force Base
Newburgh, New York
Attention: Headquarters 4602nd Air Base Wing

Sir:

As this relates to the conclusion of the two week period I had mentioned previously to the earlier air force investigation, I am very much familiar with the procedures involved in evaluating these reports. Actually, regardless of your or anyone else's personal opinions or desires, I must insist that upon the presentation of these reports, you accept the Air Force position in the subject.

The matter enclosed was presented to me by several witnesses during the period 25 August to 31 August 1964. This is the conclusion I have reached in the logical order.

In conclusion, I would like you and your associates to view my report in a similar and adequate light. Realizing that I would be most pleased to have from you requestor any related interviews with witnesses, to act as a spotteror whatever. I am ready anytime. Just call.

Signature
