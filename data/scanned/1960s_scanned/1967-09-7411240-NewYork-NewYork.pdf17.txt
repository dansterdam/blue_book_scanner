FLUSHING, NEW YORK

IN REPLY
REFER TO: OCTOBER 20, 1967

Col. James C. Manatt, USAF
Director of Technology and Subsystems
Department of the Air Force
Headquarters Foreign Technology Division (AFSC)
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Colonel Manatt:

With reference to your memorandum of October 10, 1967 forwarded this office by Mr. Edward Ingemann, you indicated that at the time in question, 0220Z, September 9, 1967, without further research we can advise that the view of the favorable weather of that date, the normal air traffic generated by the four Metropolitan-area airports (LaGuardia, Kennedy, Newark, and Teterboro) would have incorporated the simultaneous airborne on approach or departure to these airports and either over or visible from the Queens, New York area.

Hence, it would be impossible for us to ascertain not only as of this date, but even as it occurred, that the observed "bright white light" was not an aircraft. In any event, even had identification as a UFO been possible, the object obviously chose the least course, departing an already crowded airspace within thirty seconds after arrival.

Sincerely,

B. D. McKenzie
Acting Chief, LaGuardia Tower
