The Treasure State

The historical and geographical background of the Treasure State - Montana - is here presented in panoramic view. Pictures record scenes taken from the region known as the Big Sky Country which was first seen by white men - the Verendryes, French Canadian traders, in 1743. 

In 1805 the Lewis and Clark expedition crossed the state, and in 1807 Manuel Lisa, a fur-trader, built Montana's first permanent settlement at Stevensville, founded in 1841. 
Mining, cattle raising and farming were the state's early economic activities. Today, Montana ranks among the leaders in copper, silver, building stone, oil and gas production. Products include cement, plywood, pulp and paper, meat packing, grain elevators and a wide variety of manufactures. Most of the power in the state is generated hydro-electrically by the Federal Power Commission and three private companies. The two largest producing companies, the Montana Power Company and the Montana-Dakota Utilities Company, operate under Federal Power Commission licenses.

Historically, the open range of eastern Montana and the valleys of the 50's and 70's Custer's Last Stand occurred in this region where the Indians, buffalo and traders once met. About 140 mountain peaks of Montana crown the Treasure State, one of the highest states in the Union, towering from 12,000 to 14,155 feet in length and 373 miles in width. The Continental Divide traverses the entire western portion of the state from north to south.
