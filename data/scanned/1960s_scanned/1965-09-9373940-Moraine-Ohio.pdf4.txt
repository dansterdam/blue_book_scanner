The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch depicts a compass with various compass directions labeled, as well as a curved line that appears to represent the horizon.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown: Place on the curve the line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the compass where you first saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Was there a trail or smoke, and how did the object or objects move in flight during the sighting?

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and use an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
