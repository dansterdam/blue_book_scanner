"OVER NEVADA

UFO activity was reported over the Nevada desert next week according to scientific groups or sightings of objects at altitudes of 50 to 75 miles. 

Astronomical cameras have been scheduled for 3:10 p.m. Friday, Tuesday and Wednesday to photograph the sightings. 

Meteorological rockets letoff from the Tonopah Test Range here will carry payloads of instrumentation which should be visible for as much as two minutes after they are fired into the upper atmosphere."
