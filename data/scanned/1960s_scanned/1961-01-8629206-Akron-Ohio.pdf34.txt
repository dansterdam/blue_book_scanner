SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (Akron, Ohio, 21 January 1961)

TO: SAFOI-3a (Major Coleman)

1. During March 1961 your office forwarded a tape recording to ATIC which was prepared by Mr. ____ concerning the unidentified flying objects sighting in Akron, Ohio, on the night of 21 January 1961. We have forwarded a copy of this tape to the Directorate of Information Services, ACS/Intelligence, United States Air Force except through me on 31 March 1961.

2. On 31 March 1961 two officers were dispatched from ATIC to Akron for the purpose of interviewing the individuals involved in the 21 January 1961 sighting. It was determined that the UFO sighting resulted from the misidentification of the setting sun.

3. The Air Force investigators interviewed Mr. ____ and Mr. ____ tape recordings. Mr. ____'s sighting was discounted as probable misidentification of the setting sun by Mr. ____ and Mrs. ____ and her eleven years old daughter, whose testimony was consistent: the object being sighted between 2230 and 2300, appearing as a red-orange object about the size of the horizon. The object was observed about 10 to 15 minutes, during which time the object remained stationary, the top cut off and approximately five times the diameter of the moon. The sighting was estimated to have lasted approximately fifteen minutes.

4. On 31 January 1961 at 2250 the weather at the Akron-Canton Airport was a 2000 foot overcast composed of stratocumulus clouds, the visibility was 7 miles, and the temperature was 29 degrees F. The visibility was somewhat reduced due to haze and the sighting occurred at a time when the sun was setting. The significant point is the presence of stratiform clouds which are indicative of stable conditions (inversions).

5. On 21 January 1961 official moonset at Akron was 2301. This time, of course, can deviate due to topographical conditions; however, these deviations are normally insignificant.
