The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram illustrating a question about an unidentified flying object (UFO). The diagram shows the horizon line and has a compass rose in the corner. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine a high object above the horizon and draw a picture showing its motion and any changes in direction.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" at the highest point of the objec? shown on the horizon skyline. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "X" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
