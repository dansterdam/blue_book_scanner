Dear Sir:

On December 11th at approximately 5:30, I saw a brilliant flash, flames, and sparks descending from a low altitude to the ground. At that time, I reported this incident to the New York State Police. However since that time I have been in contact with Dr. ___ of Wilton, Connecticut, who witnessed the same incident and reported it to the Air Force and advised we do the same. 

If this information is at all helpful (direction, etc.) I shall be most happy to cooperate.

Yours truly,
