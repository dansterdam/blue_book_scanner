Text from the document:

Second UFO
Sighted Here
in Two Weeks

According to Devers, the object
was circular in shape and was bright
orange in color.

When asked what he thought
of the sighting, Devers said he did
not know what it was. He said that 
he had never seen anything like it
before.

Mrs Devers, 31, had also spotted 
the object. According to her, the
object had glowed brightly for several
minutes, then faded from view.

"My husband is ill, and I had turned
in soon after midnight Saturday", she
said. "Shortly after midnight I was awakened
by a bright light in the room. I looked out
the window and saw the object hovering
over the house. After seeing that he was
awake, I awakened my husband."

Devers said that since the object
had been sighted he had telephoned 
the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to
see if they have any explanations.

According to Devers, the object
was hovering over the house just 
above the treetops for several minutes,
then seemed to descend slowly and 
finally disappear in the distance.
