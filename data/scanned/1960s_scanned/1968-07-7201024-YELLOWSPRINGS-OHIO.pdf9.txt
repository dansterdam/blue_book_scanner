IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS ON RADAR. THIS IS NOT TRUE. MANY UNIDENTIFIED TARGETS HAVE BEEN DETECTED AND TRACKED ON RADAR AND SOME OF THESE HAVE APPEARED AS A POINT AT THE SAME RANGE AS THE RADAR OPERATOR WAS USING FOR GROUND CLUTTER. THESE TARGETS HAVE SOMETIMES APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG PATHS AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE ANALYSIS SYSTEM.
