Text extracted from the document:

"I got a white cigar shaped craft, started to climb and hover above the trees, then shot straight up and disappeared. It was absolutely silent and about 60 feet long, rounded at each end and about 18 feet thick in the middle. As it shot straight up it seemed to go out of sight instantly, with no trail or noise. I called my wife out to see it but it had already disappeared.

I wrote Mrs Ethyl Culver of 244 East St. and Capt. Baxter of the local police regarding this incident, my little cousin Dorothy Thornton was with me at the time and we both saw the same thing."
