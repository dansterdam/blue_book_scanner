The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page contains various questions and instructions related to describing an observed object or phenomenon. The questions cover topics such as the motion and appearance of the object, its angular size, and whether it disappeared while being observed.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed using an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) process:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The text appears to be part of a questionnaire or survey related to the observation of unidentified aerial phenomena.
