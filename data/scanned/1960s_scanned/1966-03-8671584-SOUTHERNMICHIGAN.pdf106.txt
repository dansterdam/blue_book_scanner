They're Up in the Air
Over What's in the Air

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) â€” Dexter Police Chief Robert Taylor, who was accompanied by Patrolman N.G. Lee, said there may be something in the air over southern Michigan.

The two policemen looked like it was down in a swamp. They saw the red glow and trail beginning through the night air.

The latest sightings were made in the Dexter area last Thursday, and pictures made at the time failed to develop. A rush of pictures was reported in the Coldwater, Mich., area recently, but "their was nothing there," said a farmer who investigated.

"It got within 500 yards of that and what looked to be a diamond-shaped object, it had a light here and there, and what looked to be a vehicle," said Patrolman Dexter.

Airmen at Selfridge Air Force base have reported seeing strange lighted objects over the Dexter area during the latest sightings, it said a report of the matter had been sent to higher commands for study.

When it rose again, said Patrolman Lee, it was joined by a similar object.

Flashing Lights

Manner said he was indoors when he noticed flashing lights through a window. His son, Robert, 19, and his wife, Leone, also saw the object.

"It wasn't like the pictures of a flying saucer and it had a control-tower effect, it's the first time I've seen anything like it," Manner said.

3 deputies in seven patrol cars went to the area to investigate, Manner's report said.

He said he and Deputy Dave Fitzpatrick tried to watch the object by walking up to it but that it flew off as they approached.
