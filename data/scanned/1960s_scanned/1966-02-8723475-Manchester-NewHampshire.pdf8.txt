Dear Sir:
George P. Freeman, Jr.
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

Office of Information
This is in reference to your letter of August 12, 1966 from Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in reference to an unidentified flying object observed in the atmosphere at an altitude of 600 ft. The camera was a 35mm press type and it was taken on the 14th of August, 1966. The film has been obtained, with some difficulty, and indeed Lucky Regnitz was the man who sold me the camera has been consulted, to no satisfaction. A negative will be sent to you and you can make all the measurements you want from it. However, when you are finished with please return it as one print due to the fact that they were supposed to make only one print from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base-they were unable to due to the quality of the film and they have not been able to obtain any satisfactory further prints. We find that we are unable to be of more assistance, but feel that we have done all that we can and don't wish to be blamed for unfulfillable promises.

P.S. I have decided to forward the original negative in this letter. And good luck on anything else.
