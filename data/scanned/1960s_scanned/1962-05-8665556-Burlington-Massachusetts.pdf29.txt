The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document using OCR:

TOPIC: Your letter concerning new investigation of old case which we discussed in our previous letter.

This is in reference to your letter of April 6, 1962 which referred to the incident which took place in Burlington, Massachusetts on November 29, 1961. As I indicated in my previous letter, this case has been thoroughly investigated and the facts established. The interrogation and investigation show that the object observed was in all probability a star, planet or other normal celestial phenomenon which was the subject of a distorted and exaggerated description due to the normal difficulties encountered in observing such objects at night.

The photographs that were taken by the witness (interrogatee) were also investigated by me on May 25, 1962. Enclosed are the photographs that were taken during the encounter. As you will note, the photographs do not show anything unusual or remarkable. It is my conclusion, based on the photographs and the details of the interrogation, that this case can be satisfactorily explained as a misidentification of a normal celestial object.

Sincerely and Cordially
