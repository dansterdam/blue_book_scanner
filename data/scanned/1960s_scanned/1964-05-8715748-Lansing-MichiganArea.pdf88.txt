considerable credence to this report. Further evaluation is delayed to the end of this report.

On 13 June, 1954, at about 2:15 A.M., two fifteen year old girls, Grand Rapids, Michigan, and two their younger sisters, Grand Rapids, both sixteen years old, were at a party on Sycamore Road about fifteen miles from Grand Rapids. After leaving the party, and Miss ______ was driving, with Miss ______ beside her, in the front seat. The car had just pulled out of the driveway and was about to head toward Grand Rapids when both girls saw something which they thought at first was a star.

The light came closer, and it was apparent that it was not a star, but a large glowing shape which filled the road from side to side. Miss ______ stopped the car, and they watched the object for a few seconds, glowing considerably, but smoothly, and then rose again to maximum brightness for several seconds. It then disappeared, without sound, to the east, as if it was climbing, as the girls were unable to follow it, according to the girls. They could not see the road through it, or cars passing by on Saginaw Road through the small opening that was visible. A visible glow remained, as well as a neon sign on a distant bowling alley.

Investigators visited the scene with the girls and Miss ______ parents. The girls showed the investigators where the car was stopped, and they indicated a spot on the ground where the object had been hovering. The girls, who were very frightened, had not looked closely at the object, and it was dark at the time, so the boys said they had not been able to make out any details.

The location on the driving course was found to be about 350 feet in about 250 to 300 degrees, depending on whether one was going by the place where the car was stopped or the spot indicated on the ground. The location was about a half-mile from the party site.
