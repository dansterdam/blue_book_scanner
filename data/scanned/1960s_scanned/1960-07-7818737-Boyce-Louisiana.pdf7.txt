Analysis and Conclusions: It is quite possible that the object described was a natural phenomenon of some kind that was not identified. The description does not seem to indicate an aircraft, satellite, or astronomical object. The object was apparently stationary and changing in size, which could be consistent with a natural atmospheric phenomenon. However, without more information, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion.
