There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The basic description and the drawings of the first three reports are two good to evaluate. The objects were described as being about the size of toilet attached. The apparent size in the first three reports was but was also described as being relatively small.

Although there is some conflict between the reports, I do not see the conflict arising from faulty memory, and a sloppy filling out of the second report.

My evaluation for an evaluation would be "insufficient and somewhat conflicting data" since the insufficiency can be removed only by further, and perhaps, additional observation. The weight of the evidence is so nearly balanced that I cannot assign this particular object to a category. The object was described as giving off smoke or changing brightness, and the duration for more than 10 minutes with no sound nor motion. This might be allowed in a routine entry.

Nevertheless, an interpretation scene and we must ask once again, what was the stimulus that gave rise to the report?
