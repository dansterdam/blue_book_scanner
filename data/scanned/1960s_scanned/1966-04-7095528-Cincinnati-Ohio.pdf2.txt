The image does not contain any photograph, it contains a sketch or diagram illustrating instructions for an observer to report UFO sightings. The sketch shows an angle compass with degrees marked, and instructions on how to describe the location and motion of an observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the compass where the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place on "B" on the compass to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place on "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
