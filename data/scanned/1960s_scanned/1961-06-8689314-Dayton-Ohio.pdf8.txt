The image appears to contain two sketches or diagrams, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and an object above the horizon line, with instructions to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when first seen. The second sketch shows two different perspectives, one with a person standing on a road with mountains in the background, and another smaller inset sketch with a curved horizon line.

Text extracted from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) later.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" or its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch on an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
