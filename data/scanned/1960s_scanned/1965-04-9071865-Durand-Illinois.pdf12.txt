Mrs Hunt/SAFCICC/73212/10 Jun 65

Dear Mrs. ******,

Regret to advise you that your report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object on 17 April 1965 which you submitted to this office has been investigated. It has been determined that the sighting was not of a definite and authenticated nature, and we consider it unlikely that further investigation would produce any additional information which would substantiate it. Your report is therefore filed closed as completely as possible and returned to this office.

Sincerely,
