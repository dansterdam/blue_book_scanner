BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: While returning from Westville, Indiana to LaPorte, Indiana at approximately 10:00 PM, a bright silvery object was observed in the south western sky. The object appeared very large, and moved rapidly. It was visible for approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of 1,000 feet and was moving at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately 1,000 miles per hour. The object appeared to be emitting some type of bright light. It disappeared suddenly into the distant sky. Observation was made visually.
COMMENTS: Possibly an aircraft of some kind. However, the observed speed and size of the object would be far in excess of normal aircraft performance. The speed and size of the object may be impossible or difficult to determine accurately from ground observation. The object was not observed on radar or by air intercept radar.
