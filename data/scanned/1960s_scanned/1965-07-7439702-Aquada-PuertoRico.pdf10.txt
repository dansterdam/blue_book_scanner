1. Reference the attached unidentified object report from
Wash D C 20330. The sighting as depicted in his letter was noted on the film.

2. The duration of the flight, within the immediate vicinity of his observations, was approximately 2 to 3 minutes. No duration for that portion of the flight which was observed beyond his line of sight was indicated. It is possible that a helicopter from Ramey AFB was operating in the area at the time. No data was presented to indicate that the sighting could not have been an aircraft (helicopter).
