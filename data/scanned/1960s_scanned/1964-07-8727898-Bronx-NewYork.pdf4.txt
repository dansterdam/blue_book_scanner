July 24: Bounder, S.C. After careful examination of the area of this town, it was found that there is no definite evidence that any aircraft of any kind was ever in the area. The grease can not be identified with any known aircraft at this time. The evidence seems to indicate that it is not readily due to any aircraft, and there is no evidence of where the grease was formed. The origin of this grease remains unknown except for the indications evenly spread about the area and the characteristic time of its deposit suggestive of the character of the case. The terrestrial time of the case points to unsure solution.
