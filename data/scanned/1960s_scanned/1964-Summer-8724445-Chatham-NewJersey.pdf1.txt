13. Adequate time for jet to go past the final path of the object. Object disappeared suddenly after reaching about 1/3 to 1/2 the way to horizon. Was not closing the distance, seemed to stay at a constant distance. Looked like a blue light with a slight trail that was pulsating and not steady. Could have been a jet but its movements were strange.
