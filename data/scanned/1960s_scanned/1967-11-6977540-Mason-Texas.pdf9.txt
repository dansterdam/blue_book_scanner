At 5:15 I saw two lights in the sky going from west to east. The objects appeared simultaneously. When my attention was held out and way, a car passed and the index fingers were about 1/2 inches apart when each object was at its closest to the other. When it stopped, the object came to a stop from the regular motion. Then it started up again and seemed to be an erratic motion and then back to a blue white. The other object kept on going. The one I saw seemed to be travelling about 25 mph in the direction that is southeast to the west. The motion of the objects seemed to be erratic and appeared to be maneuvering. This is about the only information I can give you. The object was sighted by military observers and they were noting down the changes in color and some flashing lights and the approach would be in their favor if such a positioning was to be ascertained. I thought I saw it in place on Sunday evening and Tuesday cover forming so this is a factor to be considered a continuing sighting.
