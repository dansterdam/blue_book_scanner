The image contains two diagrams. The first diagram appears to be a compass or directional circle, with various labels and abbreviations around the outside. The second diagram shows a silhouetted figure standing in a landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

Now, as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. YOU ARE AN OBSERVER OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH HAS JUST BEEN SEEN. PLACE A + ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE WHERE THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN, AND WRITE IN NUMBERS THE APPROXIMATE DEGREES AZIMUTH FROM NORTH THAT THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST OBSERVED. INDICATE WITH AN ARROW THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT IF THE PHENOMENON MOVED ACROSS THE SKY.
 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU INDICATE ON THE COMPASS DIAGRAM THE EXACT POSITION WHERE THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN, AND THE APPROXIMATE DEGREES AZIMUTH FROM NORTH THAT IT WAS FIRST OBSERVED. THIS IS CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR ANALYSIS OF THE REPORT.
