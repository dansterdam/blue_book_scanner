Thousands See Meteor's Flight; Authorities Besieged With Calls
Numerous witnesses in Northeastern U.S., the Police station, press and radio have reported the sighting of a bright luminous object streaking across the sky. The object was observed generally to the north and east and was described as a bright greenish-white, brilliantly luminous object, possibly a meteor or a satellite, which has been the source of hundreds of telephone calls to the police, sheriff's office and other civil authorities in the area.
The Utica Police Department reported numerous sightings, and the Sheriff's Department said that Dr. Thomas A. Nicholson, director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, said that the object was "undoubtedly a meteor" and that it was a multi-colored slow-moving luminous object. 
The object reportedly changed color several times and it left a bright trail behind it. Hundreds of people in several communities were reported to have witnessed the object, and many were said to be "astounded viewers." 
There was no clear agreement on the size, shape or altitude of the object. Some callers described it as being as large as a house, while others said it was no larger than an automobile. Reports said the object was so bright that it illuminated the landscape. 
The object prompted hundreds of phone calls to local police stations and news media offices. At Plattsburgh Air Force Base, a spokesman said the object was difficult to identify, and added that "if one was flying that fast, it sure would be in trouble."
