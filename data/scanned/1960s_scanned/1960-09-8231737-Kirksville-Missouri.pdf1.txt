11. COMMENTS
There is the possibility that this sighting could have been caused by air mixing with cold dry air, as some sightings were reported from the same radar station and were not on the same equipment. No reports from other stations in the area were received which might have confirmed or denied this explanation, and weather conditions probably caused this radar effect.
