OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

OCT 27 1966

Dear Mrs. ------,

Please excuse the delay in replying to your letter regarding your photographs of unidentified flying objects. A heavy backlog of correspondence and reports has precluded a prompt response to your letter.

As requested, however, we will need the original negatives and pertinent data. Without this information, copies of the camera shutters speeds, etc., it is not possible for an adequate analysis of the report. If the negatives and other pertinent data are provided, the report will be returned to you.

It is requested that the attached FTD Form 164 be completed as fully as possible and returned with the negatives.

Your interest in Air Force matters is appreciated.

Sincerely,

George F. Freeman, Jr.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
