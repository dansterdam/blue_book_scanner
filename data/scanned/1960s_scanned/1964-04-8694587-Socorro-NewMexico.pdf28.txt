USA UNDERGOES UFO AVALANCHE!
According to press dispatches from western sources, a wave of UFO activity of unprecedented magnitude has been in progress in August, as this is being written. Sightings, encounters, and "landings" have been reported from the Western U.S., the Ohio Valley, and the Pennsylvania-New Jersey region.

A number of newspaper clippings dealing with UFO sightings were enclosed. These enable us to confirm the major sightings and reports originating in the areas mentioned above.

Soccoro (sic) (New Mexico) Police Chief Zamora spotted an egg-shaped metallic object descending and landing near a remote area of the city, according to New Mexico press reports.

Right next to the object were two figures, rather small in size. One of the figures turned and apparently saw him. We will not release the exact details on this sighting, as the observer's identity must be protected. More than 50 newsmen descended on the location shortly after the Soccoro (sic) sighting, more landing in Soccoro (sic) than have ever been known to cover such an incident there before.

However, full coverage to all '64 sightings will be given in subsequent issues, through our own researchers' detailed reports.
