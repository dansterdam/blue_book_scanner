TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:
STATEMENT OF INCIDENT

1. On 7 August 1965, at approximately 1810 hours, this observer, a Lt Col in the USAF, observed an unusual aerial phenomenon over Whiteman AFB, Missouri. While standing in the open on the west ramp of the base, I observed a white, disc-shaped object moving in a horizontal direction from north to south approximately 5 miles west of the field at an estimated altitude of 6,000 to 7,000 feet. The object appeared stationary for approximately 30 seconds, then accelerated at a very high rate of speed, and disappeared from sight within a matter of seconds.

2. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes. Weather conditions were clear. The object was definitely not an aircraft, missile, or bird. It appeared to be under intelligent control and its departure from the area was abrupt and rapid. I have no explanation for what I observed.

3. I have discussed this incident with several other personnel at this base, and they confirm that they also observed the same object at the same time and place.
