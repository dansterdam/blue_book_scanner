The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically a questionnaire filled out by the witness.

The text from the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 29 Dec
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:  

There were 5 or 6 of these objects. The objects were silvery and seemed to be glowing. They were moving fast and erratic. They seemed to be catching fire. They were moving through the sky at a very high altitude.

Report completed by Capt. E.S. Reinert.
