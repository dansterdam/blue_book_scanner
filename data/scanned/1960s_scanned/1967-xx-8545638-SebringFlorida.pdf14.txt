Proposed reply to letter from , May 24, 1967

Dear 

This replips to your recent correspondence of May 24, 1967 in which you requested information on your unidentified sighting of January 23, 1967.

The delay in reporting your observation prevents a comprehensive investigation, since air activity records are normally destroyed after thirty days.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified object, please contact the USO Investigator at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, area code 513, 257-0315.

Included is information on the Air Force's program on UFOs.
