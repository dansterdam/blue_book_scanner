The base 2260 section, under the supervision of 1/Lt Francis G Proctor and S/Sgt John L Bowen, observed an object that appeared to be an aircraft with equipment which was designed as an attempt to identify the object. No missiles, rockets or other equipment were fired at the object.

The tube like containes aluminum strips which resumed was used. The tubing or the other attached equipment. The center section was protected from possible shock by very light material taped and bralled to the tube. Other than positive analysis of the object seemed to have been one of no consequence. The main objects is believed to still be handled very carefully until contents of the center section is known.
