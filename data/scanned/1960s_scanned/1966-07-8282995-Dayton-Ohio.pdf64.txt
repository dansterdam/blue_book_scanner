The image does not contain any photographs, it only shows a form with text. As an OCR system, I will extract the text from the form:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
A. Irregular flying white object, moving erratic at high speed and low level. It seemed from the manner of flight that it was under control. Its flight was quite different from conventional aircraft.
