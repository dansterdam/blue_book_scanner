The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

HEADQUARTERS 
FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION
AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

EVALUATION OF UFO AT MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, 29 APR 64

Propagation anomalies and equipment malfunction can be ruled out since the target was observed both visually and by the radar.

The description of the target given in the air-visual report places it in the proximity of Minot International Airport, also, its speed and altitude are compatible with aircraft.

It appears that the most likely cause of the radar return would be an aircraft, possibly a small private or military aircraft in the area. This seems reasonable since altitude and maneuvers performed are considered. The lights observed could be attributed to a civilian aircraft, which would not be unexpected in this area and for some reason did not produce a radar return.
