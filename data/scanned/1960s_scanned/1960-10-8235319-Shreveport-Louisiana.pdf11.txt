THE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE OBSERVED OBJECT WAS A LUMINOUS MASS OF LIGHT APPEAR TO BE HOVERING IN THE AIR ABOUT 30 to 45 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND APPROX. 150 to 200 YARDS FROM THE OBSERVER'S POSITION. IT WAS ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE, APPROX. 15 to 20 FEET IN DIAMETER. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE BRILLIANT WHITE IN COLOR, PULSATING AT THE EDGE, AND REMAINED STATIONARY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE MOVING AWAY AT A RAPID SPEED.

CONCLUDED ANALYSIS OF THE CASE SHOWS IT CLEARLY INDICATES A REAL OBJECT OF SOME KIND, HOVERING OR POISED IN THE AIR AT A CONSIDERABLE ALTITUDE, AND CAPABLE OF CONTROLLED AND DIRECTED MOTION, AS INDICATED BY THE SUDDEN AND RAPID DEPARTURE. THE OBSERVER'S ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO IT BY A LIGHT PULSATING IN CHARACTER, YET ON ALL OCCASIONS THEY APPEAR DUE TO SIGHT THINGS BETWEEN PERSONS AND OBJECT, PERHAPS DUE TO RAIN, MIST, OR OTHER ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE ACTED AS A MEDIA BETWEEN THE OBSERVER AND THE OBJECT. THE OBJECT APPEARED DEFINITELY SOLID, OR SEMI-SOLID IN NATURE.
