Gentlemen:

I wish to report the sighting of a flying object which my Dad and I made on the evening of Oct. 20, 1965. The object was in the west in about the 7:30 position. It made no sound at all and was orange in color. The object appeared to move north a distance of about 50 miles and then it just disappeared.

Please advise dates & time your museum is open to the public. Is it true that you have understood flight objects? If so, please give me information including a self addressed stamped envelope. Thank you.
