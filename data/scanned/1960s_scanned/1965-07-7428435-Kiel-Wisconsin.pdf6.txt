October 25, 1955

Mrs. [redacted]
Kiel, Wisconsin

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

I forgot to ask one important point in talking to you the other night. Which of the objects, both or the light you saw, closest to the earth? A careful eyewitness points, and in many cases, how close to the earth.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
