The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document discussing inflatable structures in space, including a table with "Boost Weight Data" and details about various space stations and launch capabilities.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
Our studies have shown that the problem of gravity simulation, if this is that area of concern, can probably be best handled with a toroidal arrangement and that this type of structure, using some of the principles that Dr. Ross explained, can be made a minimum weight for the desired volume. The research work that we are presenting with the Langley Research Center is being directed at getting more accurate information on the problems he has enumerated.

On Figure 10, we show a comparison of some of the expendable space stations comparisons that we have been investigating. 

The first is a one-man 21-foot diameter configuration, identified that configuration that Mr. Huffman described and as represented by our model which I want to describe a little later.
