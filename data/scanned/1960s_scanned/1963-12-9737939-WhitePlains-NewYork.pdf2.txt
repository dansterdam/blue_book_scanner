The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

Text transcribed from the document:

My report and observations are as follows:

It was approximately 8:20 P.M. E.S.T. on the evening of December 6, 1963 when I observed a bright light in the sky over White Plains, New York. The object appeared to be round or circular in shape, and was extremely bright, much brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen. It was moving slowly from north to south, and was at an estimated altitude of about 3,000 to 4,000 feet. After observing the object for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, it simply disappeared from view. I am unable to account for this disappearance. It did not seem to fade away or move out of sight, but just vanished as if it had been turned off. I am a meteorologist by profession and have observed many celestial objects, both natural and man-made, but I have never seen anything like this before. I can offer no explanation for what I observed.

Respectfully,
S. Davis Childs, M.D.
