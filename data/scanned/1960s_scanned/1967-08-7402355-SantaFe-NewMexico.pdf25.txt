Dear Sir,

I wrote a letter to you a long time ago. I received no reply. 

Again I must apologize for this delay. I have been ill and out of the country for some time, and this should explain my tardiness in answering your C.P. Book.

Regarding your small sketch of the "saucers" - these shapes do remind me of those I have seen myself over the years. I have a small sketch of these myself - very simple in detail, but rather interesting. However, I have noticed that these "saucer" configurations come in a number of shapes and sizes, and I would be cautious about any claims of exact identification from a sketch alone.

Personally, I don't wish to make any rash statements or commitments on this matter until I have had the chance to discuss it with you again. My views on these subjects tend to be rather complex and difficult to summarize briefly. I would like to go over this with you in more detail when you have the opportunity.

Thank you for your interest and patience. I look forward to hearing from you again.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
