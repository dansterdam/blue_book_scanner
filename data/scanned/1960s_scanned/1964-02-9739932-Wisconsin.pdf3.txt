Text transcribed from the document:

"It would then seem to corroborate his story, were it not for the fact that I had some doubts about his reliability and was not quite certain that in this case he had not been stretching the facts a bit. Naturally he claimed he could substantiate his story and was quite willing to have it investigated further."

"I backfired did not receive the report from him promptly, and am now recollecting some secondary details. At any rate I dispatched a brief phone call to those people within a day or so, but they did not seem to recall the incident clearly."

"Those people, whenever I talk to them again, I would be inclined to get a total recount of the incident from their own fresh memory if possible. A copy of a report made at or about the time of this incident, If such a report exists, would be of considerable value in evaluating the entire question."

"It is apparent from the location and timing, etc. that this incident could be tied in with other possible sightings that might be on the record, but I have not been able to trace any further connections. If a more detailed investigation can be made, I would appreciate being kept informed of any significant developments."
