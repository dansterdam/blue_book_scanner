(1) 3 yrs. ago saw brilliant white object "like a pin-wheel racing across the sky" very fast.

(2) 4 yrs. ago saw a light in the sky approaching from a distance. As it came closer it spread out and looked like a luminous boomerang. The light was so bright that it hurt the eyes to look at it.

(3) 10 mo. ago saw a white object in the sky. It was "translucent" and seemed to move in a jerky motion.

(4) Has been convinced that a white pinpoint of light off and on during the evening. Thinks it might be a "barn light".
