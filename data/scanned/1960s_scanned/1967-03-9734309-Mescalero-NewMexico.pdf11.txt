"Information which you feel is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. The object was about 2 feet in diameter with a red bottom and white top, and seemed to hover about 10 feet above the ground. It made no sound and did not move for about 2 minutes before it suddenly shot off straight up and disappeared in seconds."
