INCIDENT: 1965-09-08 TACOMA, WASHINGTON

MAN OBSERVES UFO WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY NORTH OF TACOMA, WASHINGTON

SUMMARY: On 1965-09-08, at approximately 2050 hours, a male witness was driving north on Highway 5, approximately 10 miles north of Tacoma, Washington, when he observed a bright light in the sky. The light was stationary at first, then moved rapidly across the sky from west to east, and finally hovered in the eastern sky. The witness stopped his automobile to observe the object, which appeared to be circular in shape and was illuminated with a bright pulsating light. The object remained in view for about 10 minutes, then rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The witness was unable to determine the size, altitude, or speed of the object. No physical traces were found at the site.
