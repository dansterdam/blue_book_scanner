Object was much bigger at first. It was about the size of a full moon. It was oblong in shape and seemed to be metallic. It was brighter at first like a light reflecting from something metallic. From one of the sources we have determined, it was giving off a steady blue light. The object was oval in a straight line approximately 100 kilometers. The object did not approach within distance or thousands of feet, it hovered and remained stationary. The night was cloudy.

C. Glt Truck Driver. He saw it from 1700 to 1730. It was oblong in shape. It seemed to get closer to the earth. It seemed to be at least 1/3 the size of the full moon. The object remained stationary. It seemed to be like a star at first that grew bigger. 

Here are some more details and rumors, according to my interpreter. There was a report of a U.F.O. on Akurey radio. This may have been what the object was. There is no confirmation of this. These same rumors were circulating Northunberland. Another witness reported that on the evening of December 11, (the day this object was seen) he observed what he believed to be lights in the sky. These same lights were briefly observed for 2 to 3 minutes. He is the only witness to this.

6. Evaluation. My evaluation of the sighting is that the people of Thorshofn actually saw an Unidentified Object in the sky. This object does not fit the description of any known aircraft.

Very, respectfully
