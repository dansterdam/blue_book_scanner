Abstract:
The October 6th events began at 8:00 PM with the visual sighting that continued for over 3/4 hour of an object over the ocean at a bearing of 290° and an elevation of 10 to 15°. The object displayed no appreciable motion. The missile-tracking radars were, at 2045, asked to go into a search mode and look for the object sighted visually. The result was that objects - many objects - were quickly picked up and tracked. There were no known aircraft in the area at this time. A series of remarkable events then ensued, of which the most important are the following:

1. Observations of radar targets continued for a period of over four hours.
2. The targets exhibited velocities of from 0 to 80 knots; some of the returns were very strong - up to 80 db at reduced instrument gain.
3. The objects characteristically, but not always, permitted radar lock-on.
4. Most of the observations were made over the sea, but there were some seen to the east and north - over the land.
