There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document related to a UFO sighting report.

Over the Utah Lake Canal in a matter of one or two seconds. It was moving rapidly and seemed to come to a stop quite suddenly and yet there didn't seem to be any jerk or jolt to it at all. It was a very small object, like a very small airplane it seemed to me.

When this object disappeared, which direction would that be? It was going toward the west. I would say at about a 245 or 250 heading.

And did it disappear gradually or suddenly? Just faded out. It didn't disappear suddenly. It just faded out. I kept my eyes on it and I was looking at it as it was fading away and I wanted to see just how long it would take and it was just a gradual fading, nothing jerky about it. It was just getting smaller and smaller all the time.

It was climbing all the time? Yes, it was climbing. At a less sharp angle than it went at first. It was probably no more than a 30 degree angle and maybe less than that.

What do you estimate the length of time it was under observation? 5-7 minutes.

Was that the time you first sighted it or when you saw it within 5 miles? Well, that was from the time I first sighted it. My eyes were on it practically the whole time, except for the brief moment that I had to look away to register or get at a pencil and paper. I didn't think it was anything more than an airplane at first, but that impression changed pretty quickly. I will admit I didn't think it was anything more than an airplane crossing. I didn't see a trail or anything on it. It just seemed to me like it was just coming. Rather like an airplane in fact, except that it was so small and it climbed away so fast.

They reported that they couldn't see it. They said they had the field glasses and were looking exactly where I told them it was but couldn't see anything. I don't know if the light was bad or what the score was.

With regard to your own aircraft, what type is it? I don't know. I don't fly aircraft.
