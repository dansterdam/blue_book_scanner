Gentlemen:

This letter is to advise you that on August 10, 1965 at about 10:15 P.M. I was the witness of what appeared to be a U.F.O.

The point of observation was in the community of Far Rockaway, a suburban district of New York. I saw an object, generally disk-shaped, but my impression was one of intensity and luminousness. It was under no apparent control any any visible means of propulsion.

It was like a bright, light, without contours, silhouette or definitive shape that seemed to be hovering almost motionless in the sky and then suddenly began to move in an upward direction, gathering speed, but not disappearing from sight abruptly. I feel that this information should be reported to your agency, in the event that it can be of any assistance.

I have seen "shooting stars" or many occasions but never one like this. It moved so swiftly and was so distinctly different from the usual type of aircraft in the sky that it made a deep impression upon me.

Because of the urgency for such observations, I trust that this report will receive your immediate attention.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
