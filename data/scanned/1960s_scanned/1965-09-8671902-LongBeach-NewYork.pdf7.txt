35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: 

I again sighted a similar light on Sep. 9, 1965 over the city area of North Little Rock, Arkansas. The first sighting occurred on Aug. 5, 1965 and was of a light similar to the first in brightness and maneuver. The light on Sep. 9 appeared about 10:30 P.M. and was observed for about 10-15 minutes. I was called outdoors to observe this light along with several other people. The light appeared to stop and hover, then moved off rapidly to the northeast and disappeared from sight. I called Saline County ARC, but no one else had reported seeing the light.

It is my belief that what I saw on both occasions was a satellite. However, the satellite could not have been a normal satellite because of its brightness and maneuver. Perhaps experimental or more advanced type of satellite, possibly launched by the USSR. Two program news articles which were with me at the time have recently been confiscated from me at the Cape. Maybe they contained some information on this satellite but I do not know.
