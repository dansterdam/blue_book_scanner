The image does not appear to contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

the other coming towards it
from a distance. The first object
appeared to be like a large star,
only many times brighter. As
the second object approached
the first, the first appeared to
start revolving and suddenly
shot straight up into the sky
at a terrific speed and disap-
peared. The second object
then seemed to stop in its
tracks and just hung there
for a few minutes before it
too shot straight up and dis-
appeared.
