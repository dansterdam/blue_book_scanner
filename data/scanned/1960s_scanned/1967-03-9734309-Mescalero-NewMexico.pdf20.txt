The unidentified flying object reported to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, most likely was caused by an accidental radar chaff drop from an aircraft. The chaff had aircraft returning from a training chaft drop mission in the vicinity of the sighting at the same time.

Officers assigned to investigate the report said their conclusions were based on reported movement patterns of the unidentified flying object and supporting data from surveillance radars.

The chaff consists of long, narrow metallic strips dropped from aircraft to confuse ground radar, attempting to improperly an aircraft as a target. The chaff has a falling and wind movement pattern and moves similar to the direction and velocity reported for the unidentified flying object. In addition, the chaff was observed on surveillance radars at the White Sands Missile Range in the same area at the same time as the unidentified flying object sighting.

Several of these targets were confirmed by two radars. An auto track was obtained by one of the radars. Shortly after the target video faded and the radar remained locked on noise, the operator thought he still could see week returns, indicating the Azimuth Servo System on the radar had a slight imbalance which caused the antenna with noise as its input to begin a clockwise drift. The range Servo remained balanced. The resultant clockwise Azimuth movement with no range change, resulted in a circular plot.

Initially, this was interpreted to be a valid track of an object traveling in a circle over Holloman AFB with an approximate radius of 37 miles. This interpretation was later proven incorrect.
