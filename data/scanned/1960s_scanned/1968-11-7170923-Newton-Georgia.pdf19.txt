said, difficult by the power brakes, the power steering not being 
functionally. The impression that I got was that the outside beam, you 
know, the headlight, went out too, but under this situation, looking back, 
i don't know how I knew this. If the road was lit up, I don't know how 
I knew that my lights went out, but in the preliminary report I stated 
the lights did go out and radio did completely cut off.
That you are certain of, the radio did actually, completely cut out. 
Yes. After I stopped the car, I didn't make any motion to get out of the 
car and leave. I guess I was just frozen from fright, and it was a most 
harrowing experience. I sat there and observed no change in the light 
for approximately two to three minutes; this is just a wild guess, just an 
estimate.
It was still, you estimate, what did you say, 50 or 75 feet above the 
road?
Yes, and approximately the same distance in front of the car at the time 
I was stopped.
So that you would have been looking up then, at about a 45 degree angle.
Yes. I was actually leaning forward a little bit to look up at it.
And after sitting there, for approximately two or three minutes, the object 
changed color and the beam visibly receded, slowly back up into the main 
body of light.
You mean, you could see the bottom , I don't want to put words in your 
Mouth here.
It seemed like, yes, sort of like withdrawing a gangplank or something. 
It seemed like that you could actually see the bottom of the light, the 
end of the beam itself, going back up into the main body of light.
