SUBJECT: Evaluation of UFO Sighting (Lt Col [redacted])

TO: HQ USAF SAC-OITS (Mrs Geiser)
WASH 25 D C

The following information is provided to assist you in preparing a letter to Lt Colonel [redacted], Asheville, Virginia:

a. The observation of Colonel [redacted] was discussed with Doctor J. Allen Hynek, professor of astronomy at Northwestern University, member of Deparment of Defense Observatory and USAF consultant.

b. Dr Hynek is of the opinion that the sighting was probably caused by a meteor. While unusual, vapor trails do appear to oscillate and diminish as observed. A meteor trail is not on common as a steady or continuous trail and can be masked at times by glare from the setting sun.

c. The speed of this meteor as estimated by the duration of 2 seconds and 20 degrees of arc distance is consistent with this analysis.
