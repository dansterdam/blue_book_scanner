Gentlemen:

Last July 30, at about 10:00 p.m. EDT, my wife and I observed a luminous object which I believe to have been a UFO. It was hovering silently just above the treetops some distance away, and then suddenly it shot off rapidly at an unbelievable speed and that with a PA flashing down the middle. 

Becoming I authorize a Universes on occasions I am requested to recognize interested UFO sightings, and that if you might be able to send these illustrations to me, I would be determined in a position to assist in a determination OF the Y-shaped trace.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
