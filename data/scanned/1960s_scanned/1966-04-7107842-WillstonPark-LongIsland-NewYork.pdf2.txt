The provided image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten text describing an object sighting. The text discusses the pattern of regularity observed in the object's movement, its distance of about 1/2 mile, its size, and the duration and behavior of the lights associated with it. The text also mentions that the lights were flashing in a sequence with a definite breath or rhythm, and that the object appeared to be larger than a spacecraft. The text provides a detailed description of the sighting, but does not identify any individuals.

As an OCR system, I will now output the full text found in the document:

As it changed the distance of about
1/2 mile the object appeared was
throwing just to my left and
at an altitude of about 1000-1500 feet.
At this time the lights were

definite breath after 8 lights
than a break of a space than
the 8 lights giving an off and on same
appearance. The lights where definitely
indicating. At a point so (?) alone
the changing lights there was one
light which remained constant.
