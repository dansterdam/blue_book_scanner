The letter describes an observation of an unidentified object in the sky over the surrounding National Forests in Craig, Colorado. The observer, Craig Colorado, believed the object to be a satellite in orbit and provided details about its flashing lights and movement.

CRAIG COLORADO.
JULY 29, 1963. 
BOX 132,
CRAIG COLORADO.

SIRS:
I, AM A CITY PATROLMAN HERE IN CRAIG, COLORADO IN THE COUNTY OF MOFFAT, AND WAS COMING HOME FROM DUTY AT ABOUT 11:45 PM ON THE MORNING OF JULY 29, 1963 AND SEEN AN OBJECT BURN UP UPON ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE, WHILE TRAVELING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. THE OBJECT WAS REDDISH IN COLOR AND SEEMED TO BURN UP IN A FLASH. IT MADE NO SOUND AND WAS VISIBLE FOR ONLY ABOUT 2 SECONDS. AFTER THE FLASH, IT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE SURROUNDING NATIONAL FORESTS. - OR IN THE EVENT OF A MISSING OR CRASHED SATELLITES, IT WAS PUT OUT IN ITS ENTIRETY. 

I BELIEVE THE OBJECT TO BE A SATELLITE IN ORBIT, AS IT LOOKS MUCH LIKE THOSE SAME SATELLITE SIGHTINGS ONE HEARS ABOUT SO MUCH. IT FLASHES QUITE BRILLIANTLY ABOUT EVERY 5 SECONDS OR SO AND BREAKS THE DARKNESS EVERY 5 SECONDS OR SO AND IS APPARANTLY BLUE IN COLOR. 

IN GOING OVER THIS REPORT TO BE HELPFUL AND DONT WANT IT TO BE TAKEN AS A FLYING SAUCER OR HOAX REPORTS. AT SAME TIME I CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR THIS LIGHT AND MAKE NOTE OF THE TIME AND CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR IT. WHILE I HEAR FROM YOU.

SINCERELY.
