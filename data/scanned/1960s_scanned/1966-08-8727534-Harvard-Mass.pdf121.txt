AIRGRAM

A-402 UNCLASSIFIED

TO: Department of State
FROM: AMEMBASSY RIO DE JANEIRO
SUBJECT: UFO sighting in the state of Sergipe, October 8, 1966

1. A summary of the reporting is as follows: In the evening of Oct. 8, at 10:20 p.m., a luminous object in the sky in the form of a saucer, which seemed to rotate around its own axis, was observed from a region between Aracaju and Nossa Senhora da Gloria, Sergipe. The object was of the size of the full moon, showing sometimes a beautiful blue coloration, and perfectly silent. At times it emitted red-orange rays, and after a certain time was observed to move upwards and vanish.

2. The Department may wish to bring the above to the attention of the University of Colorado's study group, as well as to USAF.
