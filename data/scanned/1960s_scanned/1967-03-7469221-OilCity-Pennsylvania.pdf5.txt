The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

"Dear sir, could such as that be they way seen about here in our country? I know close to the earth, but i could not get it for about two on hours, just shiny like its light and it kept around for three, too. 
It came so close to the earth, i would think so, that i coulcn't look at it for about so many seconds, and i don't know how to very explain it for you. All of the information which i have this letter is true.
Sincerely,"
