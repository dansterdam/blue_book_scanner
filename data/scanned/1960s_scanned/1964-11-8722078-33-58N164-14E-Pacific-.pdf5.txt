There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains only typed text.

television screen reflects them by small dots and lines, as often happens
due to some interference caused by household electric gadgets. Well this is not getting to the end of the story. You can either disbelieve everything I have told you or send someone to see these things personally.
You may wonder why all of these UFO sightings occur in Savona. These unidentified aircraft seem strangely interested in the activities of large SAC boys who fly over our heads will already have reported something along these lines.
Kind regards (please do not give out my name, I do not want to become a
subject of discussion by the general public.)
