Dear M.....

Your letter to the International Airport at Corpus Christi, Texas, has been referred to this office for reply.

We are unable to specifically identify the aircraft which you observed on August 16, 1966. In the Texas area, there are many conventional and experimental aircraft of various types which could be responsible for the observation. For example, it is not uncommon for aircraft engaged in aerospace research to exhibit unusual maneuvers or flight characteristics.

We feel you observed the ECHO II satellite on August 28 which was heading in a southeasterly direction at 2257 CDT. ECHO II is a 135-foot diameter inflatable satellite which is readily visible on a clear night.

Your interest is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.
