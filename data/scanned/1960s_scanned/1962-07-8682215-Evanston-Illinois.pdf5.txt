The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains handwritten text describing an observation of an unidentified flying object. The text states that the object was observed while the witness was approaching an outdoor concert, and that the object appeared to move to the right of the trees, hover, and then disappear. The text also mentions that the craft appeared to be about the size of the trees and that the witness observed it for several minutes.

Text extracted from the document:

We saw the object while attending an outdoor concert in Daly's fairmont park. The evening was clear. the fact that the object made no noise we discussed because our experience was that unusual sights the distant but cleatly audible.

the craft appeared about the size of the trees to the left right of the stage. however, there was no noise or distortion made into this distance. reappeared and hovered for several minutes.
