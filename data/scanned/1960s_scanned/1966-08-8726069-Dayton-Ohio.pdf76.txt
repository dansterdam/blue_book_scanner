The image contains a page from an old UFO report document. There is a compass diagram and a sketch showing the motion of the observed object(s). The text indicates that there were 4 objects observed, arranged in a certain direction.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the place where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 4
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.
The single one was in the western sky and wasn't visible only to follow the other three.
