Analysis and Conclusions: The investigating officer and other persons visited the site where the object was first reported. They photographed the object and transits to track the object. The photographs and measurements are reported to show nothing that could be identified as the object reported. The object was observed moving in a straight line across the sky and it appeared much closer than it actually is. The observations and the photographs were carefully analyzed and it is evident that no unusual or unidentified object was present, but rather some ordinary weather phenomenon mistaken for a UFO.
