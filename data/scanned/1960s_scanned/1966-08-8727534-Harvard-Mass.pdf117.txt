Dear Mr. Decker:

Under separate cover we are forwarding a balloon (made of inelastic plastic), solar cells and printed circuits for identification and disposition.

As indicated by the Defense Attache Office, this balloon and related package were picked up about 7 Aug 1966 in the town of Fitchburg.

Request that you furnish the Defense Attache your findings in order that the picture of Fitchburg be informed as to disposition of items. A copy of your correspondence with the Defense Attache is sincerely furnished a copy.
