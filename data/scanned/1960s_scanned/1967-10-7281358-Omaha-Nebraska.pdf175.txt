Dear Bill,

I've read your March 1957 edition about U.F.O.'s and found it very interesting. All though I may not be an intellectual genius, I'm no dummy.

If the letter is still in your hands, and no wastepapar basket, I'll tell you the reason why I wrote you. Tonight, at about 7:25, I went to look out of my window and saw three white objects that were about on the horizon or the north star. They were drawn to my attention by one and I want to clearly something, "the objects looked like masses and they were not moving, but eventually did disappear, as I will explain later." the same happened with the north star, I determined this because in the 12" now, I used an astrolabe to show the earth. 

These masses that I mentioned were about 3 deg. wide, and as they faded away, got larger and larger. They grew to about 5 or 6 inches while I was observing this phenomena. I was missing this phenomenon (I detected them at the last) . The first mass to go smallest, and the large one lasted 7:40. The two other's, within the period of twenty minutes to disappear.
