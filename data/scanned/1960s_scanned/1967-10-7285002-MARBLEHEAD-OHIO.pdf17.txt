34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 9 July 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

On the night of October 7, 1967, between approximately 9:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., I observed a very bright object in the sky moving rapidly from east to west. The object appeared to be roughly circular in shape and was extremely bright, emitting a white light. It moved at a steady pace, maintaining a constant altitude, and made no sound that I could detect. The object was visible for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from my view. I was unable to determine the altitude or actual size of the object, but it appeared to be quite large and at a considerable distance. There were no other witnesses to this sighting, as I was the only person outside at the time. I have no explanation for what I observed, and I am submitting this report in the hope that it may be of interest to your investigation.
