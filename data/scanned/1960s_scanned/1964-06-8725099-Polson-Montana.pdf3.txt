Dear Mr. Wood: 
This is in reply to your letter of 17 December 1964 regarding an unidentified aerial object observed in Chine on 12 June 1964.
We wish to inform you that one of the objects was likely USAF-AFSC MI-10 BJ-10 II and we have no conclusive evidence of the time of your reported observation. The information which you presented did not include the initial direction of the object's movement, which the objects moved, altitude at which the object's altitude was high altitude, and the apparent abrupt turn of the object. it was the aircraft's making a normal ascent. 
A copy of your letter is being forwarded to Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern University. Should Dr. Hynek have comments to discuss your observation with him as may be desired.

If the duration of the satellite-like object was in excess of 2 to 3 minutes and its object seemed to change direction, it could be a reflection high in the sky and therefore the aircraft's normal ascent. Since you already have additional data we would appreciate having this information forwarded to us in the attached envelope in order that a more fine evaluation of the sighting can be made.
