1. This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Mrs. —— of Kemah, Texas, Spring 1961. Please accept our apologies for the delay in replying.

2. The object she observed in the spring of 1961 was described as a spider-like material was in a probability spider webs from migratory or ballooning spiders. For an actual description, the observer read that these webs were quite similar to those observed by Boyd and Menzel. There are quite a few reports of these observations on file at Project Blue Book.

3. We have screened the files at Project Blue Book and apparently her report was not forwarded to us for evaluation. This letter is our findings.

4. The object or phenomena which she observed is similar to an observation of the motion and disappearance over the horizon. If the object appeared stationary, disappeared to reappear again, if the general location, size, and direction was the same, then the disappearance over the horizon was a matter of seconds, then the object was all probability a sun dog. Sun dogs appear between twenty and twenty-five degrees from the sun; reports show this phenomenon quite often.

5. In summary, the observer's description indicates the observed object to be a sun dog, evaluated as a sun dog, if not, we are unable to explain the object/phenomena which she observed.
