ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTING
16 September 1965

The following additional information was secured from Mr. over the phone on the night of 13 September 1965, regarding his sighting of a round, indefinite object in the southern part of Houston.

Mr. and I observed a round, resiling object between 7:10 and 7:15 p.m. on the night of 13 September 1965, about 1000' high and traveling slow (estimated between 80 and 100 mph). The object was traveling in a southerly direction. It did not hover and there was no noise associated with its flight.

I added more information to the incident because it was of interest to me and I am sure that it was not an aircraft from the airport because I was used to seeing them. There was no description of the object, because the light was so bright that it almost hurt my eyes to look at it. There were no lights on the object that I could distinguish. The object appeared at approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. The object disappeared shortly after the sun went off an aircraft. Soon after losing sight of this object, another aircraft passed over the house in that vicinity. No one else, to my wife's and myself's knowledge, observed this object other than us.

INVESTIGATION:
The statement contained in paragraph "Other Information" on the UFO Information Sheet indicates that the sighting was made by an uninvited guest or visitors at the witness' house. A check with the Houston International Airport tower revealed no information on their records indicating such a sighting, nor did they have any information on an object in the vicinity as described. A check with the Southern Air Defense Command also revealed negative results. No further investigation of this incident appears warranted.
