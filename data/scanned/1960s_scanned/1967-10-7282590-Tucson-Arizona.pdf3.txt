d. The strength of these dry soils is in their natural uncompacted state. The modulus of subgrade reaction is on the order of 100 lbs per inch. This measure of soil strength is significant because of the way in which test values are obtained. The test procedure involves applying a static load to a 30-inch diameter plate and observing the indentation below the ground surface.

e. For convenience in discussion, the Air Force photographs have been assigned the arbitrary numbers A1 through A7.

f. Photographs A1 through A3 show how many footprints indicating sandy material is both dry and loose. The footprints near the impressions indicate a sinkage of about 1/2 inch which implies that material could be easily disturbed by shovelling. Static loading on a circular footing of approximately 22-inch diameter would include a bearing failure including a raised lip outside the footing. However, the cross section of the lip would show a rather sharply peaked shape.

g. Photographs A3 through A6 indicate areas immediately adjacent to the depressions that appear smooth. The smoothness is the result of the loose surface material by a flat board or the back of a shovel.

h. The shape of the raised lip (Photographs A2, A3, and A6) is sharply peaked. This sharp lip is not characteristic of soil failure due either to static surface loads or certain from high-velocity impact.

i. Photographs A2 through A6 reveal disturbances on the inside of the depressions which further rule out static loading. These disturbances are aligned along a diameter of the depressions.
