The image contains two main elements:

1. A compass-like diagram in the upper portion of the image, with various cardinal directions and labels.

2. Two landscape sketches in the lower portion of the image, depicting a person standing between two panoramic views of a hilly or mountainous landscape.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLEASE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTIONS TO WHICH THE PERSON IN THIS CASE MOVED OR TURNED IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THE OBSERVATIONS WHEN COMPARING ONE SKETCH WITH ANOTHER. 

TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WITH A FIRST SKETCH, AND A SECOND AT THE NEXT POSITION, WHEN LAST SEEN. MARK WITH AN X THE ESTIMATED DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT AS SHOWN BY THE CHANGING POSITION BETWEEN TWO SKETCHES.
