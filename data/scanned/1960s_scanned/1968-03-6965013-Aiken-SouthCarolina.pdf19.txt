INCOMING MESSAGE

AFIN: 24660

A DC-9 FLIGHT FROM COLUMBIA TO ATLANTA. DUE TO THE HI OVERCAST AND HAZY CONDITIONS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE AIRCRAFT MIGHT HAVE STRAYED OFF COURSE SOME. THE OBSERVER DID NOT SEE TO BE SURE OF HIMSELF AS HE GAVE THE INFORMATION. CONCLUSIONS DO TO SMALL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION GIVEN.
I CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS NOT A VALID UFO SIGHTING, ALTHOUGH THE OBSERVER DID SEE SOMETHING. HE HAD BEEN IN THE AIR FORCE AS A RADAR OPERATOR AT SHAW AFB, SO HE IS RELIABLE. I FEEL NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IF REQUIRED.
