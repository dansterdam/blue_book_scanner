The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The diagram shows the observer's perspective on the sighting of an object in the sky, with instructions for drawing the motion and direction of the object.

The text present in the image is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the line high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the line to show how high the object got above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the dotted line to show where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" or point, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they moved.
