There are two photographs present in this page of the UFO report document.

The first photograph is a compass rose diagram with various directional labels such as N, NNW, NE, etc. This diagram is used to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when it was last seen.

The second and third photographs appear to be sketches or illustrations depicting a person standing on a road or path with hills or mountains in the background. The larger sketch shows a wider view, while the smaller sketch shows a closer view of the person on the road.
