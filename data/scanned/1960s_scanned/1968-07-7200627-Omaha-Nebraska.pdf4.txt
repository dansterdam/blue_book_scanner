Text from the document:

"As interviewed both boys separately, I allowed each to tell his story without questioning until he was through. The questions of both boys and their answers were the same.

On a country road near Hooper (5 miles SE of Hooper), the two boys sa a country road near Harri's junk yard. They were looking at the headlights of a car on the hill. They believed it was a car at first but as they watched, the object rose up from behind the hill obscures the valley from view. At first they did not remember seeing it as they did not see it again. 

It is only later as the hill line, they do not remember more than a few seconds. It appeared as two bright lights in the distance and gradually became illuminated by these white lights in the front and two red lights in the center, and soon the entire object was dark until the time and then again appeared to lift off the ground.

To ground disturbance, noise, or smell was detected. The object was dark until that time and then again appeared to lift off the ground.

After approximately three minutes it accelerated rapidly upward and disappeared in the direction of the city of Omaha.

The boys were 13 years old and were out driving around on Saturday night in hopes of seeing the main bus, but it was not seen. The boys were interviewed by Sgt. Kenneth L. Godfroy, USAF, Information Division."
