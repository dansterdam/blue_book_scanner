BOSTON - The mystery of a parachute-like object that came down over the city this morning was solved when the Coast Guard identified it as a small weather balloon.
The Coast Guard search teams said the weather balloon was released from a testing station at Hanscom Field, 15 miles west of Boston, at 5:55 a.m. the time the sonic blast was heard.
Residents, police, and fire officials say they heard a loud blast, almost louder than usual, so an aircraft was reporting as down. But it was later identified as the parachute-like object descending slowly.
When the object came down, a man jumped from a passing car to try to catch it. He assumed it might be a parachute. But when he reached the deflated balloon, police said, he was disappointed.
A Coast Guard spokesman said the weather balloon was not considered a hazard or danger to the community, nor did it result in any reports of injuries or damage.
