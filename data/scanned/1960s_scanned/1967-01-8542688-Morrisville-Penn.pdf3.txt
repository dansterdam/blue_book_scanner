I was driving home from work about 10:00 p.m. on July 5, 1957 traveling north on Route 13 near Morrisville, Pa. I noticed a strange object in the sky. It appeared to be oval shaped and giving off a strange glow. I called to my companion to look at it. She agreed that it was very strange. We rode for a few miles trying to get closer to it. It remained over the same area but seemed to be moving higher. It was giving off a bright light. It looked almost like it was floating. We continued to watch it for 15 to 20 minutes. Finally it just seemed to disappear into the sky. I wish I could give you more details but that is about all I can remember. The whole experience was very strange and something I had never seen before. My companion and I were both amazed at what we saw.
