The letter states that the images show the moon and sky conditions at the time.

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Mr. Robert Hattrich, of Covington, Indiana, has asked me to forward to you a set of 4 prints to confirm that his image of an unusual phenomenon observed on the evening of 20 July 1966, is real. 

On the morning of 12 July 1966, I had a new type of Polaroid film and loaded it in a Polaroid camera and mounted it on a tripod. Seeing and sky conditions were excellent in azimuth (a 5 degree series of 4 prints), and the 7/8 moon and nearby stars could be clearly seen under the excellent conditions.

I am enclosing the four prints showing the moon and sky conditions very clearly. It is my opinion that these prints will be of some use to you in studying this report.

I trust these prints will be of some use to you in studying this report.

Very truly yours,

[Project Manager]

Enclosures: 4 prints
