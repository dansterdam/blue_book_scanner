SAF-OIC/Miss Turnure/T6335/Jan. 30, 1968

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

Your letter of January 4, 1968, to the President of the United States has been referred to this office for reply.

The Air Force is responsible for investigating reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFO's) to determine if they pose a threat to the United States. After investigating some 12,000 sightings in the past twenty years, no evidence has been presented to prove that they do.

We do not have a record of the sighting you mention of August 1967. However, if you care to complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it in the envelope we are providing, we will endeavor to analyze your observations.

In the meantime, we are sending you some further information on unidentified flying objects. We hope you find it interesting and informative.

Sincerely,

[Redacted]
Colonel, USAF
Chief, SAF-OIC
