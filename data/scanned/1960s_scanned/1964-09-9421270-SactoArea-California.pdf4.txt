Text transcribed from the document:

On Sept. 4th. I received another telephone call from a young lady who said she was at my home and apparently connected from there with my other telephone, together with his brother. They brought along a long distance message that was given in conjunction with a direct telephone call.

I told them that the Air Force may want to investigate this matter. I do not plan to discuss publically, and gave assurances that confidentiality was attached to it.

If you desire to have the material investigated by an individual or organization you consider proper and rational, The carefully attentive military personnel have no story. They told me that I did give the report and cooperate without success. I have a certain degree of regretability, and sincerity. 

You desire to have this matter privately and confidentially, and your family will continue without the public and public disclouse. 

Yours very truly,
Victor W. Killick
