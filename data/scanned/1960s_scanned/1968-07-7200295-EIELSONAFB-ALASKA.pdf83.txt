EIELSON AIR FORCE BASE, ALASKA
7 JULY 1968

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. AT APPROXIMATELY 0300 HOURS, 7 JULY 1968, I OBSERVED A RED LIGHT SHAPED LIKE A SAUCER MOVING ACROSS THE SKY IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. IT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET IN DIAMETER. AS I WATCHED, IT SUDDENLY STOPPED AND HOVERED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE MOVING AWAY IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN JUST A FEW SECONDS.

2. I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED SECURITY CONTROL AND OTHER PERSONNEL ON BASE. WE ALL OBSERVED THE OBJECT AND REPORTED IT TO THE COMMAND POST.

3. WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CLEAR AND CALM AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION.

4. ENCLOSED IS A DIAGRAM OF THE OBJECT AS I SAW IT.
