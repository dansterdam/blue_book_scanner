Text extracted from the document:

SOCORRO (UPI) - It was shiny and stood on four girders like a land-landing craft. 
But when he moved closer to the object Friday evening, patrolman Lonnie Zamora said it took off with a tremendous roar, leaving scorched grass and brush where it had been.
Zamora said he didn't know what it was, but officials at Kirtland Air Force Base said they would investigate the sighting.
Zamora, 31, and State Police said they saw the mysterious object about 5:45 p.m. Friday on a seldom used dirt road about six miles southwest of Socorro. They took six others to the sight, but the object had disappeared.
Zamora said the object was oval-shaped, about 12-15 feet long. It appeared to be about 10 feet off the ground and 500 yards from the patrol car when first sighted.
The patrolman said the object took off at a tremendous speed, leaving a blue flame and smoke in its wake.
