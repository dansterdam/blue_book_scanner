This sighting lasted about 10-12 minutes and the object was hovering over a treetop. At first it seemed to be a helicopter and one of the objects appeared to be a search-light. The lights on the object were very bright and seemed to change color from blue, green, and red. The object then moved very rapidly away and was soon out of sight."
