There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document with text describing a UFO sighting.

If you have any information on UFO's send it to me and I'll try to help. My friend and I were in my yard the other night when we saw a light over the farm. We watched it for a while. It seemed to just hover, then moved slowly and erratically. I'd like to get up a sighting report if I can. Have you had any other UFO sightings in this area? Let me know what you think.

The sketch in the image appears to be a diagram or sketch related to the UFO sighting, but does not seem to show a photograph.
