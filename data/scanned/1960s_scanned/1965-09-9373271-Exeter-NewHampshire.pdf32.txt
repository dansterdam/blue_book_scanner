"Flying saucer" Before the call could be put all the stores selling newspapers in Portsmouth told me the leader newspaper which carried an account of the incident of the previous night. I was particularly interested in the report as I had been informed immediately after the incident by a friend that he had seen these strange objects, it is of interest to note that descriptions given by various persons were consistent as to size color and shape of the objects. One merchant told me that several callers had inquired about these objects after they had seen some mention of them in the Portsmouth HERALD. I found that an Air Force Officer had already interviewed a number of persons who had sighted the UFO's. Along intensive investigation of the incidents is being conducted by the Air Force. It is understood that a full report has been submitted to headquarters. I shall be most grateful if you could let me have a copy of your report on this case as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
