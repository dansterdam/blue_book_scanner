Text from the document:

Dear Sirs,
March 7, 1967 at 9:15 p.m. a U.F.O. was coming from the Northwest heading the Housatonic Reading.  I went out to the airport. It stood still, then started to move upwards and vanished. It was a brilliant white color, and it was pulsating. 

WHITE GLOWING
BLUISH
WHITE PULSATING

Please investigate. 
Sincerely,

P.S. Will give serial number in motion.
