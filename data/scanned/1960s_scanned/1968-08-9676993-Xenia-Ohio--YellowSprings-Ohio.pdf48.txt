WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?

MY WIFE AND I FIRST SPOTED THE OBJECT OUT WINDOW ON AUG 9 1968 ABOUT 10:15 PM. IT WAS CLEAR SKY AND THE OBJECT WAS WHITE LIGHT AND SLOWLY MOVING. IT MOVED BACK AND FORTH IN V SHAPE PATTERN AND THEN IT SEEMED TO STAND STILL. IT THEN BEGAN MOVING IN 3 DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS UNTIL IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT. THE OBJECT DID NOT MAKE ANY NOISE AT ALL AND THERE WERE NO FLASHING LIGHTS. AND IT MOVED VERY SLOWLY.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Slowly, object became smaller and smaller.

Q. PICTURE THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
