Report of Sighting
August 3, 1966
Waukesha, Wisconsin

Witness: Mr. Telephons, Brookfield, Wisconsin 53005
Pilot, back seat, two boys in back seat.

The Report: Mr. Telephons was flying back to Waukesha from St. Louis on a straight-in course, 5000 feet heading 5500 ft. altitude. At 1035 the object was first seen as similar to the full moon. Boys in back exclaimed "Hey, what's that?" Mr. Telephons asked them to turn off flashlight he was reading map with, thinking it was a reflection. Object did not disappear. The apparent size of the object was that of a silver dollar projected onto the windshield; witness was aware at the time of need for such a measurement. His recollection is that it would have been the size of the full moon.

The pilot then turned the airplane directly toward the object to obtain a bearing, which was 350Â° magnetic. He also took a reading on the omni from a nearby station and determined that his own position was 20 miles from Waukesha on the line from St. Louis to Waukesha. He then turned back to his course.

The object became larger, comparable to a saucer on the windshield, and at the same time appeared to become more tenuous. The pilot reported this to the Milwaukee Flight Service Station. The object then changed to a vertical shape and disappeared by fading away. The pilot guesses that it was 35 miles distant. He did not get the impression that it was approaching him. It seemed to be at the same altitude as the airplane.
