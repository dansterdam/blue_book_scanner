TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion or the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? The objects that I saw would about the size of an object between a pin and a pen at arms length.

22. Can you estimate the angular size? Hold a known object such as a pencil at arms length. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment at the time, about how much of the known object would have been covered by the match head? The match head would cover about the same amount that I used to estimate the size of the object.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes. The object gradually became smaller and disappeared.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. The only common objects that I could use to describe the size and appearance of the object I saw would be something like a satellite such as Sputnik I or about the size of our largest satellites.
