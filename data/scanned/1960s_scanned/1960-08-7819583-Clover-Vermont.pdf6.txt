DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

Dear Senator Prouty:

Your letter of 15 August 1960 to the Secretary of Defense, in behalf of Mr. C. F. Foster for Clover, Vermont, has been forwarded to this office for appropriate consideration as an unidentified flying object by Mr. Foster.

Mr. Foster's letter does not contain sufficient information on which to arrive at valid conclusions. The standard procedure would require a more detailed and comprehensive report to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for their analysis and final determination.

Please convey to Mr. Foster our appreciation for bringing this matter to our attention.

Sincerely yours,

Enclosure:
Honorable Winston L. Prouty
United States Senate
