The image contains two diagrams.

The top diagram appears to be a radar or direction-finding sketch with various directional indicators labeled.

The two lower diagrams depict a person standing in a landscape, presumably representing an approximate movement or perspective.

Transcribing the text in the image:

IN THIS SKETCH BELOW IS A VIEW OF WHAT THE WITNESS SAID HE SAW. IT SEEMED TO BE SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR AND MADE NO SOUND. IT WAS ABOUT 50 FEET LONG AND 15 FEET THICK AT THE CENTER. IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING RAPIDLY AND SILENTLY TO THE SOUTHWEST. THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME LIGHTS OR PORTHOLES AROUND THE RIM AND IT GAVE OFF A BRIGHT GLOW. IT WAS VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS.
