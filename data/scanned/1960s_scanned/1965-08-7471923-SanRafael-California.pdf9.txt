Dear Mr.
Recently you requested information on an unidentified flying
objects report on behalf of Bruce Henderson.
The information of the Genesee Air Force Station on the Keweenaw
Peninsula in Michigan has stated that he was on duty on 5 August
1965, the date of the alleged incident, and that no unidentified
flying objects were tracked on radar, where was no report made
to this office.
I am happy to be of assistance in providing this information
to you.

Sincerely,
