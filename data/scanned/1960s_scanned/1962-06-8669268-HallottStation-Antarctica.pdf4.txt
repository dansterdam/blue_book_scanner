WAPD-3-50

1. On 7 June 1962 at 0152 witnesses at Hallett Station, 72-20 S and 170-00 E observed an object sighted and identified as "something like a first magnitude star". This object was sighted at an apparent hearing of 360 degrees and an elevation angle of 20 degrees. The time of observation was for more than five minutes. This sighting is probably resulted from the misidentification of the planet Jupiter, which was very near the station at this time and date. At the time of the sighting Jupiter was making a near south-easterly direction in the sky and less than fifteen degrees from the horizon.

2. On 22 June 1962 at 0303 Z an object leaving a smoke or vapor trail was observed from Hallett Antarctic Station. The object was reported to be brighter than a flare, white in color and to have an apparent size larger than a standard star. The object was observed for approximately 1-2 minutes. There was no noise associated with this object. The object was initially described as a very bright meteor or a fireball but further evaluation indicated that this was probably a man-made space vehicle. No other details concerning the object or the observation are known.
