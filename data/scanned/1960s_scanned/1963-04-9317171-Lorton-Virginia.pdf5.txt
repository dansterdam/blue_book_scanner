Major William Coleman and I visited Mrs. ______ in Virginia on 13 June 1963 to interrogate her on the UFO sighting she had reported to have occurred on Both Major Coleman and I talked with her.

As a witness, Mrs. ______ did not impress me as unsure and unreliable in her facts. While in no sense a disturbed person, still she seemed to me more emotional than intellectually critical or objective. I asked her to go over her original observation: the most significant new item occurred when I asked her point simultaneously--one arm to the position of the object relative to the position of the sun at that time. The mean of several repetitions indicated strongly that the angle was 20 and 30 degrees and, hence, that the phenomenon she saw have been a sun dog. She stated that during the observation, the object did not move relative to the sun which was contrary to her original testimony. She also stated that when a cloud passed over the object, the object turned red, at the edges.

In view of the above scanty and generally uncritical variations, it seems entirely possible that Mrs. ______ observed a typical sun dog.
