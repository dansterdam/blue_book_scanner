Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of December 10 to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in which you requested information regarding the material which you included.

The "fireball" which was reported by Lapeer County resident [redacted] in Imlay City, Michigan and Pennsylvania. There is no connection between the fireball and the material which you submitted for analysis. This material is disposed of after being returned from analysis.

Your interest in the Air Force is appreciated and we sincerely regret the delay in answering your letter.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FURMAN, JR.
