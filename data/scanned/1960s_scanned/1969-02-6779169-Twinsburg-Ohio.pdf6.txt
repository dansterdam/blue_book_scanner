"Way- I would appreciate an answer on the U.F.O. reporting our case and a radar contact, since if any fiction was made. 

About the group, I would be willing to correspond, and all letters pertaining to the subject. 

I was thought of writing the Air Force Base, and asking form an organization of young people who are interested in this field, as to if we could start a club to investigate sightings without being outside our legal rights, or being off as assy teens.

Thank you in advance, and I hope to hear from you in near future. I will greatly appreciate your time.

Thank you"
