DEAR COLONEL FREEMAN:

I was your recent letter in which you stated that the recorded position of the object conformed to the tracitor's blanks.

IN THIS EXPLANATION, YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS UFO WAS OBSERVED VISUALLY AS WELL AS BY RADAR. COULD YOU PLEASE FURNISH ME WITH ADDITIONAL DETAILS CONCERNING THIS OBSERVATION AND THE CALCULATIONS YOU MADE TO DETERMINE THE OBJECT'S POSITION?

FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT WERE THE EXACT LOCATION, ALTITUDE, SPEED, AND COURSE OF THE OBJECT AS DETERMINED FROM THE VISUAL AND RADAR OBSERVATIONS?

ALSO, WHAT WERE THE IDENTITIES AND LOCATIONS OF THE OBSERVERS AND WHAT WERE THEIR QUALIFICATIONS?

I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE ME WITH THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO ENABLE ME TO MAKE A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THIS INCIDENT.

YOURS SINCERELY,
COLONAL JOHN
