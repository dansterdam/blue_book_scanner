Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

Reference your letter of 15 February 1967 regarding your observation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) on 13 February 1967. You mentioned that the sightings were very brief and you were unable to obtain a photograph, but you felt that the sightings were an attempt to determine the stimulus responsible for the sightings.

You mentioned seeing several bright lights in the sky, resembling balloons, etc. as being a UFO. At first, Mrs. [REDACTED] wondered if these could have been weather balloons, but according to your description you felt it to be a UFO. Our UFO investigators throughout the country have had persons from all walks of life, including scientists and officers in the armed forces, report similar sightings that they could not identify and considered to be a proven fact.

The scientific data does exist that extraterrestrial life can be found in other parts of the universe; however, there has been no evidence to substantiate this phenomenon visiting our planet. As far as the alleged UFOs being a result of classified military projects, I can assure you that the Air Force does not test new weapon systems over populated areas.

We do not have explanations for all of the sightings; however, you must remember that our investigative data and information is impossible to duplicate in the laboratory.

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

VICTOR CUSTAFALLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
