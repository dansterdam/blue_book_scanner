The image appears to be a black and white photograph that shows a close-up view of a tangled mass of branches, twigs, and other vegetation. The image has a high contrast and abstract quality, making it difficult to discern any clear shapes or recognizable objects beyond the intricate web of organic elements.

DATE OF SIGHTING: April 8, 1964

LOCATION: Canyon Ferry Reservoir, Montana

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 4:45 P.M. on April 8, 1964, a resident of the Canyon Ferry Reservoir area observed a metallic, disc-shaped object hovering over the reservoir.

CONCLUSION: The investigation was unable to determine the nature of the object observed over the Canyon Ferry Reservoir. The case remains unresolved.
