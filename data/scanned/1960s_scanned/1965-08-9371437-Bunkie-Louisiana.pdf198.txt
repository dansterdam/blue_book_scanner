The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a report from a New York reporter named Marty Uram about a UFO sighting in the Midwest, and a report from Mary Joe Nelson, a reporter for the Oklahoma City Times, about a UFO sighting over Oklahoma City.

MARTY URAM REPORTER FROM NEW YORK CALLED ON 3 AUG 65...
Gave him the basic information on current UFO flap in the midwest.

MARY JOE NELSON REPORTER ON THE OKLAHOMA CITY TIMES CALLED on 4 AUG 65...
Tinker "PB had a clip on their radar." They had a stationary object for forty minutes. Do not know the exact date. This probably has no correlation with other objects. From telephone conversation with Tinker it appears to be a stationary object. Miss Nelson said like a tower.

Also explained to her that the explanation for the Oklahoma sightings could not be made until we had received the official reports. Tinker is making the reports to us. Explanations as for stars that the Air Force says was in sightings cover in daylight and sunset occurring between 0100 hours and 0330 hours. "The reports the astronomer at the planetarium in Oklahoma was correct when he said that the stars were on the other side of the earth at the time of the Oklahoma sightings."

How soon we get the reports depends on how fast Tinker is able to get the reports, investigative data, typing etc all takes time and especially since there has been such a rush of them.
