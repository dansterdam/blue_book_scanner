Dear Mr. _____,

This is in reference to an Unidentified Flying Object reported to the Air Force.

Evaluation of the information you submitted indicates that the duration of the incident and the description of the object observed were too indefinite and fragmentary for proper evaluation. More specific details would be required for adequate analysis.

The observation, which is described as a luminous type of phenomenon, possibly fits the general description of those of satellite decays. It can be noted that the duration was short and the color was white and yellow. The speeds are commonly known and relatively high. 

Thank you for reporting this observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
MAJOR D. E. JACKS
Deputy Chief
Public Information Division

Ansted, West Virginia
