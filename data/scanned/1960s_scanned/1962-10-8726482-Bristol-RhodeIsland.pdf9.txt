BRISTOL, RHODE ISLAND 20 October 1962 PLASTIC

TWO youths, 14 and 11, informed their science teacher at school that they had observed a dark colored, flat, circular object in the sky while on their way from school. It was observed for about 5 minutes and landed in a field nearby. It was warm, so he did not pick it up. The teacher suggested that they bring the object in, but they declined due to the warmth of the object. The object was identified as being similar to US Nylon, number 66, a brown sample was identified as being polyvinyl chloride material which was found throughout the residue. The object had a "end-of-run" from extrusion machines producing plastic forms or foils. Such "end-of-run" material could contain unusual forms and characteristics and have indicated that some of the samples have been exposed to a space environment.

The material was compared with known waste material from extrusion processes or industries and found to be of a similar nature. The material was examined for any unusual properties or radioactivity which were not detected.
