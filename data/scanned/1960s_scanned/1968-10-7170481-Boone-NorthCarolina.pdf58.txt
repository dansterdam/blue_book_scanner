Report visual sightaage from unidentified flying object
As best I could see the object or phenomenon, as I could and it was clearly from ny first detailed position.
The object which was about three hundred as wide as the public object was very unusual. I had a flow in it about half size as other small light flows, about it ten in elevated condition when I seemed to be in a clear day, if not more high I lost the view for a few seconds as I remained the object by about 20 or 30 seconds duration.
At the top of the second hill I was offered as even better view
of the thing inasmuch as there was nothing between us and it but the low-lying terrain of the mountains and there was no cloud cover which had by our condition here about 1/3 way down hill. I was of this time 1/4 mile from this object.
I measured the size, and it was amazingly the object for exactly the altitude with my motor idling and held by both hands.
During this time, and it was possibly 2 to 2 1/2 minutes about for exactly the altitude with my motor idling and held by both hands.
I would make some attempt to signal it and, if possible, establish physical contact.
I cannot say if this is what we could see, but it did then begin to move away, great, and I had a few seconds to observe it as a holding condition. (with the appearance seemed attainable.) So put it mildly, I was less than realiable.
Apparently, perhaps because there was nothing ever to do. I remained totally amazed by what I had seen, and I remain in a holding condition.
