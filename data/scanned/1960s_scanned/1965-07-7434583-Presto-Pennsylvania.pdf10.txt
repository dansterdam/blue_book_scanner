Text extracted from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something or at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - fairly audible, sort of hissing sound, and it came closer

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object is covered by the match. How many times would the length of the match cover the length of the object?
Constant to cover the length of the light - that the width of the neon liiLHTS that appear on II'.
