Pursuant to the directive contained in DAFM 200-2, the following information is submitted:
On 9-29-65 at approximately 1:40 p.m., this writer and Miss _______ were driving in the vicinity of Rio Vista in Solano County, California. We observed what appeared to be a flame suspended in the air approximately 100 to 150 feet above the ground in an area known by the designation indicated above. This flame was circular in shape, and appeared to hover or float in the air. It remained stationary for approximately 4 to 5 minutes, then suddenly began to move rapidly in a zig-zag pattern, disappearing into the distance. The object had a definitely defined outline, and was surrounded by a faint blue halo, which seemed to pulsate and vary in intensity as the object moved. It was a clear, sunny day, and conditions were ideal for visual observations.  No other unusual phenomena were noted in the sky at the time.
GO! REPORT TO LT. COL. R.J. DORGER TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION.
