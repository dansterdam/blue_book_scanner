Congressional Hearings (UFO)
17 May 1961

AFOIN-4B (Colonel Evans)
1. On 17 May 1961 Major Coleman, SAFOI-3, called and informed me that the pressure case was on for a congressional hearing on unidentified flying objects. He indicated that it was the opinion of SAFLI that we would be before Congress prior to December 1961.
2. Major Coleman stated that most of the present pressure was from Congressmen Downing of Virginia, as evidenced by a nine page letter from the Congressman which requires a paragraph by paragraph answer.
