The image does not contain a photograph, only text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

To what was the angular size? hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street light or the moon. Note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match; now if you had an object of that angular size, how large would it be at the time of the sighting. Estimate what fraction of the angular size of the watch.
