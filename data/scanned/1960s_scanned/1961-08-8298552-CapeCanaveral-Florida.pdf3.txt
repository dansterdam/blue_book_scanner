A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ELIMINATING THE
POSSIBILITY OF WEATHER BALLOONS, TEST AIRCRAFT, HELICOPTERS
AND OTHER PHENOMENA WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS SIGHTING. ALL
RESULTS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE. THE ONLY POSSIBILITY WHICH HAS NOT
BEEN ELIMINATED IS THAT OF THE OBJECT BEING A METEORITE IN VIEW.
