Gentlemen: I have just finished watching out for some celestial program on my Colorado TV on which he interviewed a man who seems to be an authority on flying saucers.  This reminded me of an experience I had 4 or 5 years ago in late December about thanks-giving time - around 3 o'clock in the morning - I happened to be up and looked out of my upstairs window at our several bright objects moving silently and swiftly over my neighbors house - the first one was about the size of the moon - the second was smaller. Each succeeding one smaller than the one preceding it. There were 5 of them in a straight line, at intervals of roughly 5 seconds between each. It was most spectacular and to me and my family and friends who witnessed such a scene it was indeed privileged to witness such a scene. I can only wish that we had a newspaper and write the city.
