PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 17/0331, 2. LOCATION: Crittenden, Virginia
3. SOURCE: Civilian 
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 90 - 120 Seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual
7. COURSE: Overhead visual movement, then hovered, and then slowed down motion except when it made a left banking turn.
8. PHOTO: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The observer was awakened by a sound similar to the hum of a electric motor that was in the process of starting. Upon looking out the bedroom window the observer spotted several bright lights approaching in an elliptical fashion at a slow speed. The object seemed to hover and then slowed down motion except when it made a left banking turn. The most likely stimulus was a helicopter with an unusual lighting system, however, the observer stated that the lights were unusual and the other had destroyed flight records for that night, as activity originated from their airfield that night. It is possible that a light aircraft such as an aerial experiment may have been involved.
