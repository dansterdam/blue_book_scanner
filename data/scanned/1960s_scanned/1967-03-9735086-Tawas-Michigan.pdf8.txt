The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document that describes the sighting of a UFO in Tawas, Michigan in 1967.

Here is the text output from the document:

of light shone straight down from the bottom of the object, for two or three seconds, and then shut off again. This column of light was about 3/4 the diameter of the object, and its sides were parallel and normal to the ground and the level bottom of the object. The bottom of the beam was cut off by trees. The light was white, and I likened it to a ray of sunlight shining from between clouds. After the light shut off, the object continued to the horizon. It disappeared at 0436, having taken 10 minutes between the overhead position and disappearance.

The top of the object appeared to be white, and sparkled like salt crystals on a road when headlights shine on them, although the headlights (which were on) were not aimed toward the object. At the top was a circular (apparently) area which seemed to have a dome of transparent material set into it, but inverted - going inward rather than outward. Surrounding the whole object at all times was a bluish-white haze, like a halo around the moon, or like the scattered light around a spotlight beam.

Height above the ground was such that his horizon would be about 7 miles away; if the object were 200 feet in the air, another 14 miles would be added, making 21 miles from overhead to the northwest horizon. The object travelled this distance in 10 minutes, and seemed to speed up during the last minutes. Assuming a constant speed, we can calculate the airspeed as about two miles per minute, or 120 statute miles per hour. The speed would be proportional to the square root of the height above the ground, so that at a 100 foot altitude, the speed would be 85 mph, and at 1000 feet it would be 265 mph. I estimated the speed at 300 mph, and was not able to estimate altitude.
