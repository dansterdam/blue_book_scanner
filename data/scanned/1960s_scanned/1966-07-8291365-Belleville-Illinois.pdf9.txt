The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, likely from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation into unidentified flying objects.

Text extracted from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
5 day 21 month 66 year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative supplement of your sighting.

Dear Sir, I am sorry about the letter I wrote but little did I realize the U.S.O. was just trying to gather information about a sighting. I will never tell anyone about a sighting I did and if I did I would not remember it very well trying to go by memory. To get information might be embarrassing and I would not want to bother the U.S.O. Again I am sorry for the letter.
