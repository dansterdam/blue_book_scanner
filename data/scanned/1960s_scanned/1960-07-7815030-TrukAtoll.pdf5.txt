Reference is made to a telephone conversation today between Mr. and Mrs. --------- and this office.

The information given verbally in this conversation is confirmed as follows:

On July 22, Mrs. --------- reported having observed a "strange object" hovering over her home for approximately 10 minutes at about 1900 hours. The object was described as circular in shape, bright orange in color, and about the size of a large automobile.

Investigation by the District Administrator in this area indicates that no unusual aerial activity was observed by any other resident, and no other reports of such sightings have been received.

Very truly yours,

REDACTED
