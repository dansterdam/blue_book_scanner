Alaska Lights Stump AF
On the 27th of January, multi-colored, flickering lights were reported authorities at a  City, 35 12 s. degrees snores the horizon. 
One bright light hung due south of the city, 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon. Through a telescope, the object appeared to some like the landing light of a large jet, but it had no explanation for the light. Professor St. L. Conrad of the University of Alaska, examined the object through a 100-power telescope and described it as "like a ship's running lights moving at constant speed and with no visible means of propulsion."
Several other "multi-colored, flickering lights" appeared in the sky. Dr. Chang Kim and Ross Shield of the University's Geophysical Institute said a large circular, satellite or a star—possibly Venus—could have been the source, but the Air Force claimed they had no flights in the area.
