Text extracted from the document:

I was not very near this craft and did not get a very clear view of it. I was about 1000 yards away when I first saw it. The craft was saucer-shaped, about 50 feet in diameter, and appeared to be metallic in color. It hovered silently in the sky for about 5 minutes, then accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I was able to clearly see the outline and shape of the craft, but was not close enough to make out any details of the surface or note any identifying markings. I have no explanation for what I saw, but it clearly was not an ordinary aircraft.
