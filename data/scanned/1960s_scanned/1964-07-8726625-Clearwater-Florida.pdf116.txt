Observed 3 or 4 objects in the night sky over Clearwater. They were about 5 times larger than an ordinary star and very bright. They appeared to be circling in a peculiar manner, a steady speed and following a straight course, then disappearing and reappearing at another point. The objects did not blink and appeared to be solid. There was no vapor trail. I cannot explain their source or identity.

At around 8 p.m. on the evening of July 8, 1964, I observed three or four unidentified bright objects in the night sky over Clearwater, Florida. The objects appeared to be about five times the size of an ordinary star and were very bright, circling in a peculiar manner at a steady speed and following a straight course, then disappearing and reappearing at another point. The objects did not blink and appeared to be solid, with no visible vapor trail. I am unable to explain the source or identity of these objects.
