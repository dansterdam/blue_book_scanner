DID YOU ORDINARILY WEAR GLASSES? [YES] [NO]
DID YOU USE READING GLASSES FOR THE OBSERVATION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE PHENOMENON? [YES] [NO]

I started to watch a satellite while standing on the patio. The object appeared to be very high in the sky and was proceeding on a constant course, going from east to west. At first I thought it might be a satellite until it suddenly stopped and then reversed direction, going back to the east for a very short distance and then stopped again. It then continued on in its original westward direction but was not following a straight course, rather it was zigzagging back and forth. The object was very bright and had a tail behind it. It seemed to be a solid object, not just a light. I watched it for several minutes until it disappeared from my view. It did not seem to be an aircraft, helicopter or a satellite in the normal sense of the word.
DO YOU NOTICE ANY ODOR, NOISE OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, ANIMALS OR MACHINERY IN THE VICINITY? [YES] [NO] IF YES, DESCRIBE.
DOES THE PHENOMENON DISTURB THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? [YES] [NO]
