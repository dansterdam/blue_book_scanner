1. The objects in the attached four photos cannot be explained at present. 

2. The letter is quite lacking in detail regarding the situation under which the photos were taken.

3. It seems probable that the photographer and the color photos which she mentions as well as information concerning the camera designations, exposure details and date that each photo was taken it is possible that an explanation could be made.
