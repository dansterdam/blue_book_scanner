Dear Sir,

On Sunday July 31st /66 at 1:30 a.m. at a point in southwestern Ontario (longitude approx 80 - 20') an object was sighted travelling from South to North at approximately incredible speed (13 an angle of approximately 5 minutes) for approximately 30 seconds and disappeared towards the North. The object appeared to be metallic and change of shape rapidly. North star (Polaris) when eye approached to slow down and disappear completely. Brightness was observed to have a reddish tinge. The size of the object was tiny compared to the full moon as observed under the same conditions. The trajectory of the object was along the bright path as the object was observed to follow a seemingly straight course. The brightness diminished to a starlike lustre in the order of magnitude of one-half to a minute. Atmospheric clarity was exceptionally clear that evening, and no audible sound was associated with the observed object. The object possessed no distinguishing features or tail lights. The brightness did not vary and no colored lights were detected.
