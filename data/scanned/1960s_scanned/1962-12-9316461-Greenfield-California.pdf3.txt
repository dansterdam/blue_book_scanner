The text reads as follows:

"Civil Defense on Emergency Alert
Air Force Intelligence officers were investigating reports of "unidentified flying objects" over several states. A Civil Defense spokesman said there was "widespread interest" in the reports, as reports of persons on the ground could see them while in sunlight.

The spokesman at Hamilton Air Force Base said a report from the Salinas Naval Air Station indicated the sighting of some large unidentified flying objects, "going back and forth across the skies in the northern part of the state after bright light was observed."
The Salinas police and Civil Defense authorities warned they were ready for any emergency."
