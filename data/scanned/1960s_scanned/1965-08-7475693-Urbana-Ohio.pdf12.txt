Received a call from Sgt. XXXXX, Urbana Sheriff on 16 Aug 65 regarding observations by Deputy Sheriff P. McCullough, Court-House, Urbana and M. XXXXX, Ohio 43078. Forms were sent to them on 17 Aug 65. They had two calls last night and a deputy also observed the objects. Saw five or six objects out of East going West, very bright then headed North. Weren't too high. Objects observed for 1 hour.
Sgt. Moody explained about the low level flights being made from Lockbourne AFB during this period of time. However, we would send them forms to fill out.
Received a call from XXXXX on 17 Aug 65. He has seen flying saucers for the past four straight nights. What happened last night he said he couldn't put on paper. They flew in straight form over the field just night, practically all night, 3 am to daylight. Tried to get up to a height, one had trouble and another one went to his rescue approximately 1hr and held him in tow when she rescue plane came. Snow white objects, four straight nights.
He wanted Major to tell the control tower people about these. Mr.D convinced him that he should go ahead anyway and fill out the forms and then Major Quintanilla would inform the control tower personnel.
Mr. XXXXX seemed very happy after this explanation and said he would fill out the forms right away because he didn't want anything to happen and he would be out looking again tonight.
