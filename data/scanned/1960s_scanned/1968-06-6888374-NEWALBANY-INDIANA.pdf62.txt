The image contains three sketch-like drawings, possibly illustrations of UFO observations. The first drawing appears to show a series of concentric circles labeled "From cigar to sphere". The second drawing depicts an elongated shape labeled "Spacer bar(?)". The third drawing is less clear, but appears to show some kind of geometric shape or pattern.

The text below the drawings states: "I CANNOT GIVE AN ACCURATE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION" in response to a question about the angular size of the observed object.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT, HOUSE, ETC. AND SEE HOW MUCH OF THAT OBJECT THE MATCH COVERS. IF YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

I CANNOT GIVE AN ACCURATE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION.
