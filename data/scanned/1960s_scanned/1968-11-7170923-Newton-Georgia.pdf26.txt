There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

this is impressive, it's very impressive how any light, machine or whatever, can completely stop an automobile and than more or less at will allow this machine to start back functioning.

That does seem, I admit that I have no, nor do I think would any automotive engineer, understand how this could happen.  Who was the first person you told this to?

Well, I first drove the 14 miles to Newton and I stopped there and called the local sheriff, and told him I had something to report, but I didn't know exactly how to report it.  So he said, just tell me about it, so I did, and the only expression he had was, "Damn.  I'm glad it happened to you and not me.  I'm sorry but I can't help you." And he hung up the phone.

Well, at least he wasn't too discourteous.

And so, I saw that I wasn't going to get any help from this guy, so I then drove to Albany and went to the Sheriff's department there and the one feeling that I can recall, was such a feeling of lonliness.  I wanted anybody, I wanted to talk to somebody and tell them what I'd seen.  I mean, this was something that you don't want to just keep to yourself.  You cannot keep it to yourself really.  I mean, I think, if anybody did, witness something like I did and did not say anything to anybody, within a very short while I feel that it drive them more-or-less out of their mind, really.

I think this is what finally makes people report, even if they said that they weren't going to, because they, their own curiosity and their, also, sort of sense of duty in some cases.  I know, I appreciate it when people do talk to me seriously about, because part of my job is to try to find out.
