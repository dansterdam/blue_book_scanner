JUPITER, SATURN SHINE IN AUGUST
The planets Jupiter and Saturn will be bright in the sky next to the moon during August. Saturn is as bright as a first magnitude star, as brighter than any other star.

At the center of the scorpion is a bright red star called Antares, which is a red supergiant star. Antares is near the ecliptic, the path the moon and planets take across the sky.

Just a little northwest of Antares is the planet Saturn, which appears as a first-magnitude star during August. As the month goes on, Saturn moves closer to the bright planet Jupiter. By mid-August, Jupiter and Saturn appear very close together in the sky.

At the western edge of the sky, the bright star Vega, one of the summer triangle stars, is high in the northwest. The constellation of Lyra, the harp, is also high and immediately to the left of Vega.

To the east, the bright and reddish star Arcturus is low in the northwest and the fainter star Spica is in the southeast.
