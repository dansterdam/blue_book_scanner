The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose or navigation compass, with directional labels and instructions for using it to locate a phenomenon that was observed. The smaller sketches appear to show a person standing in a landscape, viewed from different perspectives.

TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. ADD ANY OTHER DATA THAT MAY BE HELPFUL MATHEMATICALLY IN DETERMINING THE DIRECTION, SPEED, AND ALTITUDE OF THE PHENOMENON. IN THE LARGER SKETCH, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON.
