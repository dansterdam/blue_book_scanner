Text extracted from the document:

Although the officers did discover the small, charred matches on the ground around the spot where the object landed on the night of April 21, they did not discover even one of the four holes within six feet of the burned spot. This raises the question of whether those "impressions" were indeed there on the night of April 21, or whether they were created in the pre-dawn hours of April 22.

It is only one of the four holes had been discovered that night, it is probable that all four would have been found. So there were four "impressions" for discovery. Trooper Crawford told me that he and Murphy made a careful search, bending down low over the road, using a 6-cell flashlight. Crawford finds it hard to believe that the holes could have been overlooked.
