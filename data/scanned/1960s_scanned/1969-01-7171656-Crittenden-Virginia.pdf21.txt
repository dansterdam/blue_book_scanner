SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 17 Jan 69 from Crittenden, Virginia

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

In response to your letter of 7 April 1969, I have contacted the flight scheduling clerk, Mrs. Burlene Martin, at Felker Army Airfield here concerning a flight scheduled near Crittenden, Virginia on the night of 17 January 1969.

Mrs. Martin said that there were no Fort Eustis aircraft flying after 2130 hours, 16 January 1969, and flights did not resume until 0630 hours on 17 January 1969. She said that because of poor weather conditions, all scheduled flights were cancelled even earlier in the evening of 15 January 1969.

Thank you for your inquiry, but I am sorry that we can provide so little information concerning a possible UFO sighting. If we can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.
