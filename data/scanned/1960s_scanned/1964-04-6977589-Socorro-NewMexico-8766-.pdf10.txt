SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO, APRIL 24, 1964 

Officer Lonnie Zamora was patrolling a lonely stretch of Highway 85 south of Socorro, New Mexico, when he saw a shiny, egg-shaped object hovering in a gully about 50 yards off the highway. As he approached, a red flash appeared and a loud roar was heard. Zamora stopped his car and got out to investigate. 

He heard a thump and saw a flame briefly appear below the object, which was about 15 to 20 feet long. Two small figures seemed to be standing near it. Zamora moved closer, then retreated and called the state police for assistance. When other officers arrived, the object had disappeared, leaving behind scorched bushes and indentations in the soil where it had been. This sighting received nationwide publicity and was one of the most significant UFO incidents on record.
