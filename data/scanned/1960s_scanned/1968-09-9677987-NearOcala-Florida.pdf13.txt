There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document containing text discussing an unidentified object and its movement.

Now, could I break in here to ask, in terms of degrees arc, you
say he went up and down over an arc of any 10 degrees, or what?

There didn't seem to be an arc. Now at night, you can't judge these
things, but if the object directly towards you or directly away from you,
you can't see the arc at night.

No, quite right.

And I assumed this is what it was. But there did not appear to be any
arc, it would go straight up and then straight down and then straight back
up again.

No, wait a second. You say up, then in angle of elevation, if he
started at your own level, how high did you have to look to see him when
he was at the top of his...

I would guess he went a 1000 feet above us.

Well, would that have been 10? Did he come overhead at any time?

No, he never did. He stayed in front of us all the time. I would
guess an up angle of something like probably 10°, not over 15, and about
the same below us.

I see. So a total swing of about 30° perhaps, 20 or 30. And how about
transverse, sideways? Was it always directly in your 12:00 o'clock position?
