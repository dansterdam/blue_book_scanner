Sir:

After years of wondering, I finally, thanks to what you told me, was an Unidentified Flying Object. Of this there is not the slightest doubt in my mind. For this report on Wedl did I see two bright lights in the sky. They were blinking alternately, white-green-white-green like lights blinking. They seemed to be about 1,500 feet up and moving at a terrific speed. What the nature of these objects may have been, others who reported the same thing can hardly imagine. But the lights just disappeared and there was no sound.

Also this object covers a this distance in a very short time. I don't know how long it was in sight - it seemed to me it must have been longer than a few seconds, but it was all over so quickly, that I couldn't have said exactly how long. There just wasn't enough time for me to have heard the sound, enough so that I would have been sure of hearing it, but it was perfectly silent.

Of course there may be some other logical explanation, but to me it seems quite certain that what I saw was not any conventional aircraft. This experience was so strange and so brief that I doubt if I would have been able to tell of it at all if I hadn't happened to be on the alert to observe it. As it was, I did see it, though very briefly, and I am convinced that it was something strange, something not man-made.

Sincerely,
