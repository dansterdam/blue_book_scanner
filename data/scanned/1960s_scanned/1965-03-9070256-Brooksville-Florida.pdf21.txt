Text extracted from the image:

like fiber-glass, I don't know what you call, some kind of stuff it was made of. And the the fellows from the city they were down here now and took pictures of it and they saw us up footprints, a lot of all around in the dirt, and they up went were the holes in the ground where they took pictures of that but they are going to send that away you know, and do they're going to do some more investigating on that.
