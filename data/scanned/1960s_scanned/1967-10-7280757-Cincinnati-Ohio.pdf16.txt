18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with the closest part of the object as observed. If you had performed this sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? All of it would have been covered.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include aspects of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust if Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The response indicates that the observed object expanded or faded away slowly, moved behind a cloud but the witness was unsure, and was white and silent in color. The witness estimated that the entire object would have been covered by a match stick held at arm's length, and provided a hand-drawn sketch showing an oval shape with no other details.
