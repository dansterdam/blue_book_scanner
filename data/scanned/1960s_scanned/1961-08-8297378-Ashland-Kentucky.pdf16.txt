There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document that appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

A UFO witness describes sighting an object that was approximately 15 meters in diameter, moving at a speed of 3,900 miles per hour and at an altitude of 45,000 feet. The object was seen for approximately 16 minutes and was described as having a metallic appearance and emitting a bright glow.

The text appears to be a detailed account of the sighting, including the witness's speed and altitude measurements, as well as the size and appearance of the observed object. There is also a handwritten signature at the bottom of the document.
