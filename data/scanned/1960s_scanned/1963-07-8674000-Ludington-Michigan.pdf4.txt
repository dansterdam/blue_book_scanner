1. Reference the attached letter from Mr. requesting information on unidentified flying objects. This letter is forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. Direction and short duration of this sighting are not consistent with sightings of satellites or possibly an aircraft as the V-103 airway from White Cloud to Muskegon parallels the flight course of the object.

3. Additional information will be necessary if an evaluation is to be made.
