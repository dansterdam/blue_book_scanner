Dear Sir:
Thank you for your inquiry into my UFO.  I must say I am very glad to have the chance to report ing my UFO. I believe I have discovered what it was.  The night I saw it, the sky was very cloudy and foggy.  About 9:30 p.m., there appeared in the same place what looked like an extremely bright star, red in color, as it was before. Only this time it was just a little cloud, very small, and very distinct under the clouds and very dark. I saw was the bottom of the moon, very red, covered by clouds and very dark.
