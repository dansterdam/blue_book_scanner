34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 20 - Aug - 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
The object looked something like an inverted saucer, with lights or other objects or a fuchsia color at the outsides. At first it gave a flash at a plane that was visible. It was moving rapidly, about the speed of a jet plane, which seem to be the flight pattern of the object and its motion was erratic.
As a witness, I watched it move across the sky, I noticed an exit trail that seemed to dissipate quickly, the object was maneuvering and I thought looked like it was moving a lot quicker than the airplane. I compared the size of the object to what the diameter of a dinner plate would be held at arm's length. What was it? What is the explanation for this?
