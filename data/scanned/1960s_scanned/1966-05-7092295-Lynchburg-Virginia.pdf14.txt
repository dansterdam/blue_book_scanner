AUTOEOGRAPHY
I was born 1 May 1933 in Columbia, S.C. , the son of Henry Titus Walker and the late Carrie Earle Walker. I am over 6 feet tall, weigh 250 pounds, and have brown eyes and black hair. I became interested in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) sometime around 1960 when I read the book "Strangers from Space" by Frank Edwards. Since that time I have done considerable research on the subject.
SKETCH: The object was cylindrical in shape, with arms or projections extending from the sides. It hovered very low over the trees just back from the road. As it hovered, the object was illuminated by a very bright light that seemed to bathe the entire surrounding area in brilliant light. I watched the object for about two minutes as it hovered, then suddenly it shot away at tremendous speed and was gone. The diagram is a rough sketch of what I saw.
