This unusual photograph of Comet Lloyd's (1965-ll) was taken by Alan McClure on the night of July 12, 1965. Telescope: 6-inch refractor, focal length 59 inches, exposure 30 seconds. The comet was observed from Anaheim, Ca. The field of view shown is about 1.75 by 2.25 degrees. The photograph was taken by a camera at right angles to the telescope, producing this blank sky image with the comet too faint to be visible.
