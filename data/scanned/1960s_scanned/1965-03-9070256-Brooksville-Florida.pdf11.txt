On 16 March 1965 we placed a call to the above number. He was in a meeting at the time. We spoke to who was familiar with the case. He was out there at the same time the Air Force office actually go out to the sighting. He didn't go out to the sighting. Newspaper quotes them as going out there, and we would like enforcement's opinion. We told him that we said it was pretty soft earth. We told him that we were going out there to the sighting but they had to get a car out of the sand that was stuck. He said it was hard to believe, thought that story. He told him that we needed a motive for doing something of this sort. said he felt that was getting older and wanted his picture in the paper and got his day of glory, like some people get there day in jail, he gets his in glory.
