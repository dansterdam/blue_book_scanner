Dear [redacted],

We have thoroughly investigated your correspondence of July 7 concerning your photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) has already conducted their investigation on this case and has forwarded the information to our office.

We are unable to be of further assistance since you have already provided the necessary information that have not received your negative, but have seen the photographs.

Your interest in this project is appreciated.

Sincerely,

BARRETT E. YOUNG
