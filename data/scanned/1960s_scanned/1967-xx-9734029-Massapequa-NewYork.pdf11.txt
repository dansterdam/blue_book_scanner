The image contains a photograph, which appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The photograph shows a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object or phenomenon.

Text in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
NO

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): YES No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind. A cloud passed over the object, obscuring it for a moment.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of. 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Whistling, high-pitched 
b. Color Bright, silvery

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match or pencil length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the head of the match?
Difficult to determine, cannot remember exact size

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as size, proportions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
