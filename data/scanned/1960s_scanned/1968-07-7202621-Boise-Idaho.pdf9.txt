PLEASE DESCRIBE THE OBJECT IN YOUR OWN WORDS:
The object was spherical in shape, about 100 feet in diameter, and hovered slowly about 200-300 feet off the ground. It had a brilliant white light that appeared to pulse slightly. Two of the bright lights seemed to change from white to red as the object drifted slightly. There was no sound heard during the sighting. The object hovered for about 5 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight.
