Dear Miss ****,

This replies to your recent letter in which you reported that you had an unidentified serial object:

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what (you) reported as an "unidentified" aerial object. However, if you wish, please submit the mailing envelope or our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, can guide us in an investigation of the sighting further.

Should you ever sight another such object, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Each such case is studied carefully by assigned investigators or unidentified flying objects (UFO's). We are in a constant investigation which better position to make an on-the-spot investigation and identification than we are sitting here.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting through the materials we are sending.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AITKEN
Major, USAF
Chief, Community Relations Division
Office of Information
