UFO SIGHTING, 9 JANUARY 1967, MT. CLEMENS, MICHIGAN

1. Reference your request for information on an unidentified flying object sighting of 9 January 1967, Mt. Clemens, Michigan. The report was investigated by Major Nylus, Selfridge AFB, Michigan. Major Nylus has requested the original prints of the photographs taken, on three occasions, but Air Force officials have been reluctant to talk or permit the original prints to be viewed by the Air Force.

2. Analysis of the available photographs failed to provide any definite information pertaining to the identification of the unidentified object. The original photographs were examined by Draftsmen and experts of the Detroit News and provided by a reporter, Mr. [REDACTED], to sharpen the image. 

3. The original photographs would permit a comparison of edges and silhouette between the helicopter and the unidentified object. Witnesses reported that the object was further away from the observer than the helicopter. The measurements provided indicate that the object is smaller than the helicopter, but we do not know if this indication, therefore, ruling out this check on the reported information.

4. Contact was made with Dr. J. Allen Hynek regarding his statements which were carried over the wire service 16 January 1967. Dr. Hynek informed our office that he only told the Associated Press that the photographs appeared to be of an authenticity image. He claimed he has stated the photographs were apparently authentic.
