Dear Sir:
Several saucer-like objects were observed passing overhead. They were spotted and all objects flying in the sky. They say they were flying saucer-like objects. I watched them thru binoculars. Something (had to have been) going faster than anything I have ever seen. It was about the size of a moon and was going towards the north. What looked like a small disc I would say was about 9:30 pm on the evening of October 8, 1966.
