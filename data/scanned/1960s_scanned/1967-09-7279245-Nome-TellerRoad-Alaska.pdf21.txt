The handwritten text in the image states:
The object was moving very slowly, about the speed of a commercial jet, and travelling in a straight line. It was a very bright light, much brighter than any star or planet. It seemed to be about the size of a full moon. It was at an altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet, and appeared to be about 10 miles distant. I observed it for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view. I feel this sighting could not be explained as any conventional aircraft. It seemed to be a very unusual and unexplainable phenomenon.
