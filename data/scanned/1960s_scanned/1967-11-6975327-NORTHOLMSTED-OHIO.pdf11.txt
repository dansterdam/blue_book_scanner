The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document of an official U.S. Air Force UFO report form. 

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: August 2, 1967

32. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: I should like to add that most any light in the sky is noticed but this time it seemed different. It looked well I said to myself"Gee whiz what is it this time"With the bright light it looked like a flying saucer with windows and as it got closer I saw it had a ridge on the side and moved like a jet only much faster and the light days type like the picture in the papers of UFOs but I am no judge on UFOs I am just reporting what I saw some thing that did not belong in the sky at that time and place.
