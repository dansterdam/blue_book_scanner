MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observation; 3 March 1968
The report describes an object that was observed for 5-10 minutes, appearing 40-45 degrees above the horizon and disappearing 5-10 degrees above the horizon. The observers believed it could have been a meteor or satellite breakup, and it had a pretty good glow. The object was reported to the Greater Cincinnati Airport Control Tower.

Mr. [redacted] and Mrs. [redacted] sighted the object, and Mr. [redacted] stated that the object passed over the airport and that he saw it go out at about 70 degrees elevation. Mr. [redacted] saw the object for only about 10 seconds and thought it may have been a little east of its actual position.
