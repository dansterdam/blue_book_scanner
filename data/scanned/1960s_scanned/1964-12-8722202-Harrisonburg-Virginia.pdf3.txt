Text from the document:

On the basis of this reinformation, that such radioactive strength signals have been received, I strongly recommend that a professional investigating team be sent to the area at once to investigate this phenomenon further. The details need to be discussed at the highest levels, and especially the matter of the background radiation, as discussed at the front of this report by Dr. Gehrman. It is vital that this be substantiated immediately.

The matter of radiation constantly lingers in my mind. First, was the strong signal picked up by this team. Second, was their particular instrument, which I have known myself to be highly sensitive and accurate in the past. And the signal was already quite strong - one and a half miles from the highway - rather an unusual circumstance, as I'm sure you will agree.

In this area, as you know, there have been a number of other curious occurrences reported - both in the skies and on the ground. These reports, of course, vary greatly in their degree of reliability. Some appear to be wholly fanciful, while others seem to be rather factual and to the point. Those reported by reliable observers such as police, air traffic controllers, and military personnel, I consider to be of prime importance.

This report contains a number of other such discrepancies. For the details, I refer to the information given in the body of the report itself. I hope that you will find this information of interest, and that it will receive the immediate attention it deserves.

Sincerely yours,
Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla
