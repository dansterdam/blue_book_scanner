Leaves issue to watch
Three witnesses saw a stationary bright light in the sky which suddenly moved rapidly off to the north, then disappeared. Observers were Mrs C. Harland, Mrs C. P. Nash and Mr D. Lloyd, all of the Macclesfield, Cheshire, area, at about 10.30 p.m. on 26 November 1965. The object was kite-shaped, luminous and silent. It approached from the south, slowed down, hovered for a few moments, then accelerated rapidly and vanished. (Credit: Miss A. Winstone and David W. Nash.)
