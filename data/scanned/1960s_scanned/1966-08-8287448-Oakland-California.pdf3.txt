UFTO (LETTER) 
DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433

Mr. 
Oakland, California 94611

Dear Mr. 

Reference your unidentified observation of 25 August 1966. The information which we received from the Duty Officer is quite sketchy. Therefore, could you find time to send us photographs of the object that you observed on that date? Upon completion of our analysis, we would return your negatives along with the following information is necessary: 

a. Type and make of camera
b. Type, focal length, and make of lens
c. Shutter type (leaf, focal plane)
d. Lens opening used; that is, "f" stop 
e. Filter used
f. Was "panning" used
g. Exact direction camera was pointing with relation to the ground

Should this supplemental information be unobtainable, the minimum required data consists of the type of camera, and the shutter and lens details. 

Request you complete the attached FTD Form 164 to aid our analysts in making a final evaluation.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

ROBERT QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
