"First of all my wife and I have not told anyone of these. I thought it better to write to you first.

Secondly, if of you mark had another question or this same night, or can explain why I am hoping you can advise me of this, or I can fact a little more about it.

1. I believe I have seen ufo.
2. I can continue about after this, but I thought I should write you first."
