GROUND METEOR IN 1958 
Since the discovery of the origin of the strange objects that have appeared over 1,200 accounts in various parts of the country during the past 20 months, I have prepared over 100 diagrams and photographs with their descriptions, and I now have those 'photographs ready which were exposed on October 20, 21, 1959 and show precisely what the objects of the Oregon Meteor were between the times of 2:30 and 2:46 a.m., Pacific Standard Time.

On October 20, 1959 one of the objects which crossed the sky over Southern California, was seen by myself and two friends of mine. We took 7 photographs of this object with their descriptions, and I now have ready the first two of these photographs which show this particular object very clearly.
