Transcription of the text in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 18 7 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

On July 8, 1965 at about 10:20 p.m. the witness was standing outside his house when he observed an object in the sky for about 2 to 3 minutes. The object was shaped like an inverted saucer and was about 8 to 10 feet in diameter and 3 to 4 feet thick. It had a glowing red light on one side, and as it moved it appeared to give off a bright light. The object moved in an erratic course at first, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The witness described the object as definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known object. He stated that while the sighting was brief, the object was very close and he had a good view of it. No sound was heard. The witness is a reputable person in the community and apparently is genuinely concerned about his sighting.
