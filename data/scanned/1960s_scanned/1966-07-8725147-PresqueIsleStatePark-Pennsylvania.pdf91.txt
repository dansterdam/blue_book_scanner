AGENTS FOR RELEASE TO SAFOI

1. No correlation can be found to exist between the three facets of consideration: light - indentations - monster-light.

2. No evidence exists to relate the damp sandy areas and the indentation found on the beach to the visual sighting. Considering the terrain and evidence is present to indicate a landing of any type occurred (flight lab, W-PAFB). A chemical analysis of the soil samples was completed was nothing unusual in the sample except using CAF Material.

3. There is no evidence to substantiate the presence of a black monster. No unusual markings were found to indicate such a "thing" was observed in the area. 

4. As yet, there is no explanation of the lights that were observed. Considering observatory film taken of the lights, lasted approximate 3-5 seconds, the possible meteor as the explanation, however, they had no information of any meteors being observed at that time, and plane.s were contacted with the Park Police and nearby U.S. Coast Base for any unusual lights over the area. Negative results were received in both cases.

5. With the existing data no conclusive explanation can be made concerning the lights. It is assumed that no correlation existed between the lights, indentations, and the "alleged black monster".
