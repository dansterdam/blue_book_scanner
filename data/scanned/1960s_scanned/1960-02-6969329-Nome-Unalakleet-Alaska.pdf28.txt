Object Reported Heading In From The Bering Sea
An unidentified object, believed to be a saucer, was reported over Alaska near Nome late yesterday afternoon.
The object was between 2,000 and 5,000 feet high and moving at a high rate of speed. It was headed southeast, where it would be toward Anchorage.
Pete Walsh of Nome told the Anchorage Times that he saw the object and that it was also seen by radar stations, probably the City and borough stations.
WALSH SAID he believed the object to be a clear, lighted object and the object slanted in the direction it was moving, the article stated. THE OBJECT was as fast as a jet plane. The object was reported to headquarters of the Alaska Command, to the Federal Aviation Agency and to the weather bureau at Washington, D.C.
Capt. M.S. Garrett at Washington, D.C. said it would be difficult to ascertain what the object signified from the information available at this time, according to the article.
