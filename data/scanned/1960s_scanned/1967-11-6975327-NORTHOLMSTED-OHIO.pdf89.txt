GETTING AT THE UPDN RTAFX OUTDOOR THEATER, I WAS ATTRACTED TO THE NIGHT OF THE MOVIE SCREEN AWARDS. THE MOVIE SCREEN APPEARED TO BE A FULL MOON IN SIZE AND SHAPE. SUDDENLY AN AIRCRAFT LEAVING A TRAIL OF FIRE, AS THE OBJECT TRAVERSED THE SKY TO A POINT DIRECTLY OVER THE MOVIE SCREEN TO MY PREASURE. ABOUT 5 DEGREES ABOVE THE MOVIE SCREEN I COULD OBSERVE THAT IT WERE INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS ALL TRAVELING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED. EACH OBJECT WAS VERY BRIGHT AND EMITTED A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT ABOUT THE SAME MAGNITUDE AS THE STAR ON THE JET SKY. THE LEAD OBJECT WAS OF A DIFFERENT SIZE: BRILLIANCE WITH THE LEAD OBJECT HE LARGEST AND BRIGHTEST. THAT OBJECT WAS LEAVING A TRAIL OF ABOUT 20 DEGREES OF ARC. DURATION APPROXIMATELY TWO AND ONE-HALF MINUTES. COURSE OF THE SWARM FROM NORTHERN HORIZON TO SOUTHERN HORIZON WAS ABOUT ONE AND HALF TO TWO MINUTES, COURSE OF THE SWARM WAS APPROXIMATELY HORIZONTAL. INCLINATION ABOUT 80 DEGREES.
