The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the text found in the document:

(1) Object sighted approximately 1945 hours, 7 April 1960.
(2) Object was oval in shape, and estimated to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It was grayish in color and appeared to be glowing.
(3) Object was observed for approximately 3 minutes, during which time it ascended to an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.
(4) No sound was associated with the object.
(5) Weather conditions were clear with unlimited visibility.
(1) Sighting was reported by L. S. La Camp, employee of U.S. Forest Service, La Camp, Louisiana.
(2) This is corroborated. (It is one of the reliable sources of information from which further investigation could be undertaken.)
(3) Description of object: Oval in shape, grayish in color, estimated 30 to 40 feet in diameter, appeared to be glowing. Observed for approximately 3 minutes, ascended to 2,000 to 3,000 feet, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. No sound associated with the object.
