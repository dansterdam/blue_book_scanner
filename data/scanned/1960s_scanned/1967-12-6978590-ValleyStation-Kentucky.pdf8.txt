The image contains a compass diagram and two sketches. The compass diagram shows the 16 cardinal directions, with the instructions to place an "A" on the compass to indicate the direction of the phenomenon when it was first seen. The two sketches below the compass diagram appear to be illustrations related to the movement of the phenomenon as described in the text. There is no photograph present in this image.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO MILLER SCALE AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PORTION.
