Dear ---
Your sighting was made on 3 Apr 63. You reported this sighting to the United States Air Force in November 1963 and forwarded the form to the USAF in Feb 1964. Almost one year has passed.
Information in your report was vague and inconsistent. Portions of the data were unrelated, much as the direction and speed estimated at 100 mph is inconsistent with motion described to the object. Your report is appraised as an unconventional object or natural phenomenon.
Sincerely,
