SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) â€” A communique issued at Santiago said a mysterious lens-shaped flying object was observed in the Antarctic area Ja uary 25-27.

The object, it was said, maneuvered at altitude of about 5,000 to 10,000 feet and made no noise. It traveled at a speed estimated at 1,500 to 2,000 miles per hour. The object was seen by scientists at the Chilean, United States and British Antarctic bases, the communique stated.

According to the communique, Commander Pedro Aguirre Cerda of the Chilean Air Force said the object was observed through telescopes and that it would be too much to say that it was a spacecraft.

The scientists in Antarctica see and photograph UFOs on July 3rd. They reported that the object moved around in the sky for nearly minutes, changing colors. The object caused interference in the electronic equipment.
