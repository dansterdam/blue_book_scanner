1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 67-66, submitted by Quintanilla, Jr., requesting analysis of the object in the enclosed prints.
2. ANALYSIS: The object appears to be made up of two shallow dished shapes, circular or spherical, which were coated or painted with a bright or shiny material. There are indications of a central connecting line or column between the two dished shapes. An apparent developed blemish or spot in the center of the object is visible. The object has no projection or other appendages. An optical illusion is possible, therefore, the object should be viewed and analyzed with caution.
