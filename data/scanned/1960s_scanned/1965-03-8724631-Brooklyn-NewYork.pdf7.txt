The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a handwritten document or report describing an observation or sighting of an unidentified aerial object.

Faintly, it oissappeared out of view from my kitchen window, less than a half hour later. Surprisingly so, I spotted another (star?) moving just as slowly, only from another direction this time. 

This time I was perceptive enough to run and get my telescope and tried to focus it before it disappeared. Unfortunately, if it is not a very powerful scope, I was unable to see what looked like a flat-side object, either like a half-moon or a letter 'C'. It was only able to see this for another of seconds at most.

On the very next night(or soon after), approx. March 13, 1965, at 5:49, after waiting patiently for nearly one hour, to perhaps see another such event take place, it was suddenly, if at all.
