The image does not contain any photographs, but rather contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, and instructions for the viewer to imagine that a high object was above the horizon when they first saw it, and to place a marker at two points on the curved line to indicate where the object was. The second sketch shows a larger view of a landscape, with a person standing in the foreground, and a smaller inset sketch showing a curved horizon with a person standing in the distance.

The text found in the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
