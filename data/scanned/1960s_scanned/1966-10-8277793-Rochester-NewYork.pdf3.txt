Dear Mr. —————,
This is in reply to your letter of October 8 to Wright-Patterson AF Base regarding your unidentified observation.
It is felt that you observed the ECHO II satellite, which was passing over the Toronto, Canada area at approximately 2131 hr. ECHO II, an artificial satellite, would have been easily visible to the naked eye. To many observers, the motion of a bright artificial satellite can appear to be that of a distant airplane or other object. This familiar illusion has been ascribed to the fact that we do not observe our own Earth's motion continually, but in little jerks. Fluctuations in light can also cause the illusion of motion.
Thank you for your letter; I hope you will find the above information helpful.
Sincerely,
GEORGE P. FRISMAN, JR. 
Capt, USAF
Coordinator, Unidentified Observation Division
