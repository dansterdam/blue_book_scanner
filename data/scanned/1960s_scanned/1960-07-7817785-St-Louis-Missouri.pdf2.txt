The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a point labeled "A" and a curved object above the horizon line, illustrating how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows a larger scene with a person standing on a road with a curved horizon line. The third sketch shows a smaller scene with a person standing on a hilltop with a curved horizon line.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
