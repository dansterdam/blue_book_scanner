Young Utican's $8 Camera Finds 'Something in the Sky' on Film
By GARY STRANGES
Sometime last night, what with his $8 camera,a Utica freshman took a picture of a fireball in the sky. The youngster, whose identity has not been divulged, says he was shooting pictures of friends when something caught his eye. He snapped a picture - and the film showed something in the sky. 
The picture appeared in today's O-D to the National Investigation Commission (NICAP) and the Air Force. NICAP, a private research group, says the object appears to be a UFO. But some officials say it could be a known astronomical phenomenon and nothing more.
The youth, a student at Utica College, spotted the object at about 8:20 p.m. April 25. A friend with him also saw the brilliant object. They compared notes later and agreed it was not an airplane.
The photo that came out, which has been reproduced nationally by The Associated Press, shows a bright, elongated object in the sky. NICAP says the picture is interesting and shows a bright object that might be a UFO, but without further evidence, there's not enough to identify the object.
The Air Force, which has been inundated with reports of the sighting, told the Observer-Dispatch that the object might have been a meteor, or something atmospheric. But they are interested in the photo and plan to investigate further.
If all this sounds familiar, it's because Dana DeCoursey, 15, of Proctor High School, had a similar experience two weeks earlier. Dana's family released a fireball photo taken by the youth. The Air Force said the object was a meteor and the case was closed. 
Dana's father, Carlton DeCoursey, said last night the new picture taken in Utica is similar to his son's and indicates "there's more going on than anyone realizes."
