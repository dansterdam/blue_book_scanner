The image provided does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with some text and a blank space where additional information or images would typically be included.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  9th Nov. 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
