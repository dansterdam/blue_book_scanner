The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a circular or disk-shaped object. The sketch shows the object's outline and some details within it, but does not identify any specific individuals.

Here is the text from the document, produced by an OCR system:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AS COMING OUT OF THE NORTHEAST AND WAS TRAVELING SOUTHWEST AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE SOUTHWEST.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind;

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of;

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound VERY SILENT, NO SOUND OBSERVED b. Color WHITE GLOW, LIT UP, GLOWING

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure, how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?

OBJECT WAS APPROX. 1/4 OF THE SKY WHEN FIRST OBSERVED AND ONLY APPROX. 1/8 OF THE SKY WHEN LAST OBSERVED. ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SILVER DOLLAR HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and definitely show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.

The sketch shows a circular or disk-shaped object with some details inside, but no identifiable human features.
