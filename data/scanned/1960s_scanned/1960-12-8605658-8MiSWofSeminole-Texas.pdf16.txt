Text from the document:

Her seen double or rather appears to be identical: witnesses accounts do not contain any indication of a translocation or transformation: appear in 12 to 15 seconds - color grey: approximate altitude 12 to 15 feet: extreme rapidity of motion approximately 12 to 15 mph: duration of visibility was [approximately] 8 to 10 seconds: no noises or lights of any kind were observed. Eyewitness states that the object was oval or rounded in shape and appeared to be hovering rather than moving with great speed. Apparently this phenomenon was also seen and reported by other reliable witnesses. Careful investigation should be made to determine if any radar or other electronic tracking data is available. Detailed analysis of all witness accounts should be made, as this sighting appears to be of much evidential importance.
