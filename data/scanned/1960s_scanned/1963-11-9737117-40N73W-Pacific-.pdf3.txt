(Continued from Page One)
They said the object came low over the trees and appeared to be a "fiery object".
As it came, the object seemed to move in a direction, and then it would seem to move in a different direction and then toward the ground. The object flashed its light and then it would go out. Deeny said that this had happened three times.
He said the object came toward them about the height and distance of another object (a city object) and was about one and one-half the size of another object (a city object) which they refer to.
When, as it came closer, they saw that it was larger than it had first appeared to be. Deeny said the the object came closer and they could see that it was shaped like a "fiery object".
He said the light from the object illuminated the area where the trees are. Also, the light caused the trees to appear to be silvery in color.
Deeny said that they watched the object for about 20 minutes. He said at one time the object came closer to them and then it seemed to move away in the direction it had come from.
Deeny said that when the object was first sighted, the light was very bright, but as it got farther away, the light seemed to dim.
