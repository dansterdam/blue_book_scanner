The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter discussing the analysis of some "unusual photographs" that were previously submitted for detailed photographic study. The letter describes the photographic analysis and provides some general observations about the nature of the images, such as possible image artifacts or distortions. It also expresses appreciation for the interest in the Project Blue Book.

Proposed reply to letter from [REDACTED]

Dear [REDACTED],

Reference your unusual photographs which were forwarded to our office for detailed photographic study. Photographic analysis revealed the following: slide #1 is a normally exposed good quality transparency with one water spot or chip in emulsion probably caused in processing. Slide #7 may also be a good transparency, highly magnified. It may also be some object or reflection of some shape other than shown, but made to appear as two lobes with high lights and shadows by the extent of or lack of focus. The higher the magnification, the more focus can alter the image's size and shape. The image on slide #7 could be of an object, a light source, or a reflection of a light source. Any identification of the submitted photographs would be only speculation.

Your interest in Project Blue Book is appreciated. Darn retaining your slides. Thank you for submitting them to the Air Force for evaluation.
