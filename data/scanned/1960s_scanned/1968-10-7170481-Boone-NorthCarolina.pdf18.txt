"FILED FOR THE RECORD 14 OCTOBER 1968

Subj: Alleged UFO Report, 10 of 13 October 1958
The UFO Command Post notified this office at approximately 0930 hours that an unidentified object had created an explosion, mushroom cloud and crater in the vicinity of Tamaland, Florida. The notification came from an AP news release #59 of the 13th. This release called Marshall AFB, Florida, Lt Kline ext 3739 and requested that he find out any available information on this. Marshall AFB had not received any reports, however, he could not recall having had a call on this incident. Lt Kline called the Aerial Phenomena Office back at 1329. He said there was no problem with the unidentified object. The explosion had been caused by dynamite and the AP news release was inaccurate, It Kline said he had contacted the Florida Police Department and the Lakeland Ledger and they said the report was erroneous and the report had originated from a dynamite explosion.

Lt Marano had also called Orland AFB. They are a Navy Base and do not have a UFO investigating officer. Suggested that he call McCoy AFB. Lt Marano called McCoy AFB, Florida, Major Murphy. They did not have any reports."
