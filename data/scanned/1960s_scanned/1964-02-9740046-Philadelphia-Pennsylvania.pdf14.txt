"It was about 8:00 pm February 9, 1964 that I observed what appeared to be a strange object in the sky. It was about 100 feet in diameter and about 500 feet above the ground. It appeared to be circular in shape and had a reddish orange color. It seemed to be hovering in one spot and then would dart rapidly from one position to another. I observed it for about 15 minutes and then it disappeared from view. I have never seen anything like it before. Could you please investigate this incident and let me know what you find out? 

1. What was it?
2. How far away was it? 
3. How high was it?
4. What were the details of its movement?
5. What was the duration of the sighting?
6. Are there any other witnesses?
7. Were there any other unusual phenomena observed?
8. Have you had other similar reports from this area?

Please let me know the results of your investigation. I would be most interested in knowing what you determine this object to have been.

Sincerely,
[Signature]"
