NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN 'X' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION YOUR WITNESS SAW THE UFO WHEN IT WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A 'U' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE UFO MOVED WHEN LAST SEEN.

(In the sketch below, place an 'X' at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a 'U' at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Connect the 'X' and 'U' with a line to approximate the movement of the phenomenon. This will graphically illustrate and show whether the movement conformed to any logical pattern. It is an example of how to complete the larger sketch.)
