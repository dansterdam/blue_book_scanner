UFO REPORT
Subject: Obect sighted by witness at 12:33 PM. Witness's name: GERALD GRAPPERS. Witness's address: 742 Pearl St., Lowell, Michigan.
Witness's account: At 12:33 PM on 24 September 1967, I was standing in my backyard and looked up into the sky. I saw a round, metallic object hovering in the air. It appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter and was silver in color. The object was moving slowly from west to east at a constant speed. After observing it for about 2 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and shot straight up into the sky at a tremendous speed, disappearing from view within seconds.
Investigator's comments: The witness appears to be credible and provided a consistent account of the sighting. There were no other known objects or activities in the sky at the time that could explain what the witness observed. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object is consistent with other UFO reports. The case is classified as unidentified.
