Gentlemen,

I hesitated to write because of some of the explanations the Air Force has been giving for 'reports, but I feel the facts in this case are worth submitting to you.

On the evening of March 30, 1967, at approximately 8:30 p.m., I was out on my back porch. It was a clear, cool evening. As I was walking home I saw a star-like object in the sky moving rapidly across the eastern horizon. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it was traveling much too fast for that. I watched it through my binoculars and it appeared to be a solid object, definitely not an airplane or satellite. It was brilliantly lit, almost like a star, and seemed to be revolving or spinning. After traveling a considerable distance, it suddenly made a sharp turn and headed north at an even greater speed, then it was gone. I have observed several such objects through binoculars on one night as a gift was possessed - the lights seem to appear and disappear.
