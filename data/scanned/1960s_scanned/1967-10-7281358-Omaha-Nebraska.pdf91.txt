ATTN OF: BCXI(Capt. Cunningham/402-294-4050)  1 November 1967
SUBJECT: UFO Observation of 8 Oct 67

TO: DET/UF0

Hq Foreign Technology Div (AFSC)
1. Reference to your letter of 17 October 1967 in regard to your
report, I am enclosing the photos of the UFO so that photo analysis
can be performed.

2. I stated in the initial message that a T-29 landed at 0445 hrs,
while the UFO appeared at 0410 hrs. It was impossible for the T-29 to
have been hovering near the landing area at the time of the incident.
The aircraft passed over Omaha at 0330 and an instrument pass would
place the aircraft in the landing pattern. I have no details on the
T-29 as you since it was not an Air Force aircraft. The aircrew of
the T-29 did not see any UFO's and the report was piloted by Captain
Donald D. Emond. The sighting was Captain D.J. Marksberry, Aircraft
Commander, and the co-pilot was Captain James A. Karker.

3. Mr. Griffin of the FAA reports that only three aircraft were in the
area at the time of the sighting. One was the T-29 landing, one was a
Cessna at 10,000 feet arriving at Eppley Airfield, Omaha, and the third
was a DC-3 at 8,000 feet just south of Offutt AFB. This would pin down
the area of the sighting time also. 

4. There were two other sightings near that area. DC-6 passing
Omaha at 0930/31 at 10,000 feet descending to 8,000 feet over Lincoln
on a flight path approximately 3 miles north of the T-29 flight, and
a United Airlines Convair 580 from Denver, Colorado, passed over Omaha
at 0330/27 on a path approximately 10 miles south of the sighting area.

5. The DC-6 and the Convair 580 appear to both have passed the
area too early and at too high an altitude to be a factor, but
mention them in case they are of any importance to you. I have
enclosed a map showing the flight paths.

6. If I can be of any other assistance please let me know.
