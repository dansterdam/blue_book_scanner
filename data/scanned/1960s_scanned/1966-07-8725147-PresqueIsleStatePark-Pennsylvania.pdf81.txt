ANALYSIS TEST REPORT
SUBJECT: TEST NO:
SUBMITTED BY: DATE RECEIVED: 
PURPOSE:
FACTUAL DATA: The organic resin that was identified came from the investigations and photo casts of the indentations. This is a good opportunity to emphasize the importance of taking a portion of the sand in the box which appeared to be the uncontaminated by acrylic resin. The chloroform was used to extract small residue remains which was identified by infrared spectroscopy as an acrylic resin. It is not unusual to find esters in the soil. 
CONCLUSIONS: The sand sample submitted in the plastic vials contained resin. However, this was not considered to be unusual. The acrylic resin originated from the investigator when the plastic mold of Paris casts of the indentations.
