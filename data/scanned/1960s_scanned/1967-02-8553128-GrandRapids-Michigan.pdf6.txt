The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which includes a handwritten narrative describing a UFO sighting.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 22 MARCH 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questions or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
BEING A RATIONAL PERSON, AND NOT GIVEN TO HALLUCINATIONS, AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THE NOISE ABOUT ME COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ELECTRICAL WIRES OVER HEAD GOING INTO THE GARAGE. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WILL SING OR MAKE A NOISE IN VERY COLD AND CRISP WEATHER.
THE OBJECT THAT I SAW AS I WALKED OUT AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE GARAGE, THE GLOWING NOISE ALSO FADED AWAY. TOO.
THE SKY WAS VERY BLACK AND EACH STAR SEEMED LIKE VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS. THERE WERE NO CLOUDS AND NOTICED THE ABSENCE OF THE MOON, AT MY LOCATION OF THE SIGHTING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAW, BUT I'LL SURELY REMEMBER THAT NIGHT THE REST OF MY LIFE. THEY WERE QUITE UNIQUE.
THANK YOU.
