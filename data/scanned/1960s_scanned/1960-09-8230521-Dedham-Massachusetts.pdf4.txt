The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text.

Color: Did it explode, disintegrate, or suddenly vanish?
Any tail or trail? 
Did any sound accompany the object?
If sound followed later, give time interval.
Was it associated with binoculars or telescope or photographed?
Give position of telescopic or binocular for at least two points with regard to the object.
The graphic portion of the text is redacted, but the remaining handwritten text is as follows:

"Did it explode, disintegrate, or suddenly vanish?

Did any sound accompany the object?
If sound followed later, give time interval.
Was it associated with binoculars or telescope or photographed?
Give position of telescopic or binocular for at least two points with regard to the object.
The object moved in a descending straight line at a slow speed, observed for about 4 minutes, then it just disappeared. No sound was heard, and it was not associated with any optical instrument. I was not photographed."
