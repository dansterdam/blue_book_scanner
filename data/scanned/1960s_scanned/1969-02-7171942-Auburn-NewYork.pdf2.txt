Dear Sirs:
I would like to report a UFO sighting on the 7th of February 1969. It was a circular, blinking object (the size of a volleyball) which appeared to be 1500 ft. or less in altitude. It was at 8:15 PM moving northwest when I was on my way to do some personal business. It was watched for about 3 minutes and it disappeared towards the Buffalo area. I was not able to take a picture of it since I was driving. I was about 11 miles northwest of Auburn, New York.

Sincerely,
[redacted]
