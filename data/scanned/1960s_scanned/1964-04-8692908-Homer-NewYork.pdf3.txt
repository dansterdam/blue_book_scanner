DATE: APRIL 8, 1964

On 8 April 1964, at approximately 1930 hours, a civilian observer reported observing an unidentified flying object over the town of Homer, New York. The observer, whose name has been withheld, stated that he was outdoors observing the sky through binoculars when he noticed a small, bright object moving rapidly in the sky. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and was emitting a reddish-orange glow. 

The observer continued to track the object through his binoculars, noting that it made several erratic maneuvers, including abrupt changes in direction and speed. At one point, the object appeared to hover briefly before accelerating and disappearing from view. 

The observer immediately reported the sighting to the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force. An investigation was launched, and the incident was documented as part of Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official study of unidentified flying objects.

The accompanying photograph was taken by the observer during the incident and shows the view through his binoculars. A small, bright object can be seen in the close-up inset of the image. The quality of the photograph is poor, but it provides a visual record of the event as described by the observer.

This report has been filed as part of the official Project Blue Book archives, and the details of the incident have been duly noted for further investigation and analysis by the Air Force.
