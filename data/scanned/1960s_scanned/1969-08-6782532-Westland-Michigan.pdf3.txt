Sir:

Up to the night of this report, I have taken little stock in reports of unidentified flying objects. The fact that many military officers, who I know were not mistaken, and the officers from my own department who have sighted objects in the sky, leads me to consider these objects well worth investigating.

I would appreciate any information you might have or acquire relative to these flying objects.

Respectfully,

Garrison E. Clayton
Chief of Police
