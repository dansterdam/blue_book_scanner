UFO SIGHTING, COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO, 19 AUG 64
VFO 31428/64 (Mrs Hust)
CASE 0 - 5390
This office is in receipt of a UFO report from the Household
Finance Corporation, Colorado Springs, Colorado.
The following information is provided in order that a possible
investigation can be made:
Photo analysis and photo processing personnel visited the
subject site and several negatives were exposed. They were
to all appearances normal and could not be identified as to
the object seen. The film was processed and returned
to the witness.
The photo analysis on the film failed to reveal any photographic
anomalies. The film consisted of neighborhood scenes and the
family residence. The film consisted of slides taken with and
internal 35mm camera. Several frames showed silhouetted objects
which apparently were persons or vehicles passing in front of the
camera. No unusual lighting effects or objects were noted in
these frames. An individual frame by frame analysis did not
reveal any evidence that an image outside the normal neighborhood
scene was recorded on the film.
While the transmission lines are in sharp focus, indicating the
camera was properly focused, the object observed at the time of
the sighting is not shown. This suggests that the object may
have been beyond the field of view and/or the distance at which
the camera focused.
This statement is based on the reported distance from the observer
to the object as 75-100 yards, and on the fact that the size of the
object as reported would normally exceed the size of the image
expected on the film at that range.
Therefore, the image causing the object is probably "out of
focus".
