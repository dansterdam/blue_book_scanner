11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observer watched a reach colored object in the western sky that appeared to be about one mile away and bri1liant object. Just like a shooting star, the object was in sight for about 5 minutes and made no sound. The object had a 4.5 degree elevation above the horizon. The object was in sight until it disappeared beneath the horizon.
The description is consistent with that of an astronomer's observation of a satellite which would account for the observed location of the unknown and could explain the observation.
