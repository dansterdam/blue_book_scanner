The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing questions and responses related to a reported UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? There was no 25-30 minutes.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One:)    Yes   No   Don't Know.     If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound ___ 
b. Color _Blue white_

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you observed as wings, projections, etc. and especially about lights or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Careful estimate of object shape
