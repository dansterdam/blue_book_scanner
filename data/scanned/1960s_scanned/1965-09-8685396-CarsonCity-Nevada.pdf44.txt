Many Report 
Flying Objects

Despite Air Force claims above the horizon southwest 
of Ponca City, Okla., numerous residents in and around 
that area reported seeing unidentified flying objects Tuesday night, according to the Oklahoma Cit-- s Times.'

The Times said the obiect ap- 
peared to be moving at a rapid 
rate both southwest and northeast. Several persons reported seeing the objects at different times 
Tuesday, even high-altitude 
jets could be seen during most of 
the hours of darkness. 

Other reports had green ob- 
jects with bright red and blue 
flashing lights and streaming 
tails observed in the south and 
southwest.

Hundreds of reports were re- 
ceived by the U.S. Weather Bu- 
reau and the Tulsa international Airport, the Times said.

Still, the Weather Bureau an- 
nounced no unusual meteorologi- 
cal activity for the area during 
the period of the sightings.

The Air Force statement said 
that no unidentified flying ob- 
jects were tracked on radar 
screens in the area and that it 
was checking to determine the 
cause of the sightings.

However, the Times said sever- 
al local law enforcement agen- 
cies reported the sightings.

The article went on to state that Air Force official said the 
great plains were active in pro- 
ducing unusual atmospheric phenomena which could be mis- taken for UFOs.

Reports still continued to come in, the Times said, indicating that the sightings were still being 
observed.
