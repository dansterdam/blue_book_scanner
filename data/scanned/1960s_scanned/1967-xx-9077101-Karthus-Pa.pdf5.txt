The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the Office of Information at the Community Relations Division of the Civil Branch, addressed to Mr. Dubin in Pennsylvania. The letter discusses the observer's recent correspondence about an unidentified satellite observation on June 4, 1957. The letter provides details about the satellite's estimated stellar magnitude, apparent size, and trajectory, and concludes with the signature of Barnett F. Young, the Lt. Colonel, USAF of the Community Relations Division.

Here is the full text of the document:

Dear Mr. Dubin,

This replies to your recent correspondence on your unidentified observation of June 4, 1957. 

Investigation indicates that you observed ECHO II, this particular satellite, with an estimated stellar magnitude of about 0.0 to approximately 0.5, and an apparent size of from about 1/3 to 1/2 degree. As approximately 0345, EST, June 4, 1957, ECHO II would have been travelling over central Iowa on a southeasterly heading. The satellite would have entered the earth's shadow at approximately 35.5 latitude, which would have accounted for its disappearance in the ISW.

Sincerely,

BARNETT F. YOUNG
Lt. Colonel, USAF
