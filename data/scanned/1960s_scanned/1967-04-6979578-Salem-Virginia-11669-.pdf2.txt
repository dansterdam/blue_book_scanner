CASE  REPORT
DATE OF SIGHTING: 6 APR 1967
LOCATION: SALEM, VIRGINIA
CASE NO: 11669

RESUME OF INVESTIGATION:
On 6 April 1967, between 1600 and 1620 hours, a telephone call was received from Mr. STANLEY FRAZIER, Rt. 1, Box 52, Salem, Virginia, stating that he had observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over his property. 
Mr. FRAZIER stated that the object was first observed from his home and then followed for several miles in his automobile. He described the object as appearing to be "a large round, glowing object".
An investigator was dispatched to the location and interviewed Mr. FRAZIER. During the interview, Mr. FRAZIER stated that the object was first observed hovering over the trees on his property. He then got into his automobile and followed the object for several miles. He stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and had a "halo" or ring of light around it. He further stated that the object moved at a slow speed and made no sound.
The investigator attempted to obtain photographic evidence of the object, but was unsuccessful. No other witnesses were located.

EVALUATION:
This case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The description of the object provided by the witness is consistent with that of a classic "flying saucer" type unidentified flying object. The slow speed, circular shape, and halo or ring of light are all typical characteristics reported in many UFO sightings. The lack of any corroborating witnesses or photographic evidence, however, makes it difficult to provide a more definitive evaluation.
