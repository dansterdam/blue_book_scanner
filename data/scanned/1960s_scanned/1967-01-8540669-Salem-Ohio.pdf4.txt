A fight 2 hours and 20 minutes the time it was seen that night any faster than the times given. the times given was correct. But of course they travel slow in actuality, They seem to travel at a practically a pericentric maneuver similar to a pencil. It is as if they did not want anyone to see them. The thing cannot possibly be aircraft as we know them. It moves farther than I figured at such a rapid burst of speed. It cannot be anything else unless you dispell my thinking that this thing I have seen is that of a small jet perhaps a whole smaller. We just cannot draw any conclusion as to what this thing is except that it is true and correct I have seen this thing before and never again unless something unnatural occurs 5:50 ballsomoly to disappear. But on the time I did detect had quite possibly seen something extremely interesting to watch with the point surface. I have this thing that was could possibly be described the point. 3 others have seen this same thing, but have not a permanent record of it. Concerning this stranger I observed.
