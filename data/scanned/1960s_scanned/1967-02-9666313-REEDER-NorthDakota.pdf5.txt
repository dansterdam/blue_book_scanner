There is no photograph present in this document page. The image appears to be a diagram showing an illustration of an object's path and the use of a compass to describe its movement.

The OCR output of the text on the document page is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Trace the path of the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

"A"_______                        "B"_______

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
