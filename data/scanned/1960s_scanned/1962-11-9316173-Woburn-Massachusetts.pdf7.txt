A band of light around the bottom which came from the hanging object. The project which extended in a arc from the hanging section. Light brighter than the bright sunlight. A sick cool feeling after looking at it. My God, what was it? Very unusual in appearance. With a Peep-Like Sound, and a loud buzzing nature. It was exactly stationary and reflected no radiation. And many other ufo sightings over many years. Burrington denied such sightings. (Also denied a friend's similar account. He has since passed on). With God as my witness, I could evaluate it unlike anything I have ever seen in the human eye. UFO sightings encounter's in the western hemisphere Unique and unidentifiable shape.
