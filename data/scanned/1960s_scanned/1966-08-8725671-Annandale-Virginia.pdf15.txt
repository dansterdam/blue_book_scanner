The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with a handwritten response to question 35 on the questionnaire.

The text in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 9-30-66

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object was observed moving in a south-southwest direction at a rather rapid rate of speed. It appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape and was a bright yellow-orange color as it moved through the sky. It was observed for approximately 1 minute. The object made no sound and appeared to be under intelligent control. At times it appeared to be accelerating and making sudden turns. After moving a distance of several miles, it suddenly diminished in size and appeared to disappear into the distance. The object showed no resemblance to any known aircraft I am familiar with.
