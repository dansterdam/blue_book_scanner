The object appeared to be metallic, silvery grey in color and about 50 feet in diameter. It hovered motionless for about 5 minutes then moved off rapidly to the north and disappeared from sight. There was no sound associated with the sighting.
11. COMMENTS: the sighting was witnessed by two reliable observers, both of whom were USAF officers. The object was initially mistaken for a weather balloon but its metallic appearance and rapid departure indicated it was probably some type of aircraft.
