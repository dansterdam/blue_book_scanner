There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a form with various checkboxes and a space for handwritten notes.

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME? 
SPEED UP OR SLOW DOWN?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS?
FLASH OR FLICKER? 
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
FLUTTER OR WOBBLE?
IN WHAT DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?

The form also contains a section that asks "DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?" with checkboxes for "YES" and "NO".
