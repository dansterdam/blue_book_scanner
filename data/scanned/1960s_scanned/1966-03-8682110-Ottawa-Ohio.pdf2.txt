This document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten questionnaire or report from the Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

Text extracted from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 April 
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a continuation of your sighting. In my opinion, a report on this sighting should have been made to someone in higher authority. The manner in which this sighting developed and was handled is certainly questionable. From the time the object was first observed, until the time it disappeared, the witness was in a constant state of fear and apprehension. I feel the witness should have been interviewed immediately following the sighting and not several months later as was the case. The witness is a mature, responsible individual and does not appear to be the type who would fabricate a story of this nature. I am quite concerned about the lack of immediate investigation and follow-up on this case. S. S. On many occasions I have conducted investigations and made recommendations where I felt the standard methods of investigation and handling were inadequate. I believe the circumstances surrounding this sighting indicate the need for a more thorough and immediate follow-up. Thank you.
