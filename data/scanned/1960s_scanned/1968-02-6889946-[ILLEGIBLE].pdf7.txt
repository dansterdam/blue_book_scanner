There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing only text.

Transcribed text from the document:

Object first reported to me by calling He then went out and looked it thought it. through binoculars it was then a U.S. Air Force Plane but when he looked through thought it.

It disappeared by becoming extremely bright and then went vertically into the sky and was lost among the stars.

Moved in front of a plane blocking it out of our view for a very short time. Passed than one second. Could then tell the difference between the plane and the object.
