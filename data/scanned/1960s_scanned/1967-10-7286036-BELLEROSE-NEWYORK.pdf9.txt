1) This is in reference to your letter dated March 18, 1968 concerning my sighting of 9/22/67.
2) If the sighting was an electrical advertising sign,
a. Wouldn't the sign say something? (something in the order of whatever it was advertising for) . . . not just a definite pattern of flashing lights.
b. Where was the aircraft that was moving the electrical advertising sign at the beginning of the sighting?
c. Was this the electrical advertising sign approx. 1/2 mile behind stated aircraft? (wouldn't that make for hazardous air travel!?)
3) I am not trying to disprove your explanation but only illuminate mine . . . because I am not satisfactorily convinced of the one you submitted.

Thank you very much
