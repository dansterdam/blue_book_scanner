MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
21 June 1968
Subj: UFO Observation & Investigation, 19 June 1968
At 0920 hours Lt Garmon Marano, Aerial Phenomena Office, telephoned Captain Leonard at Clinton Sherman AFB, Oklahoma. Capt Leonard was not in at the time and Lt Marano's call was transferred to extension 6205. 
Sgt Towns. The only thing that Sgt Towns knew about the observation was what was in the TWX. He said that Capt Leonard had done the investigation. Lt Marano asked Sgt Towns to have Capt Leonard call Lt Marano since he, Lt M, needed the following information. What type of radiac instrument was he using? The Register #? If it has been calibrated lately? Was he familiar with the instrument? Were the readings from the background of the area? Did he take the readings from a particular object or from the general area? Lt Marano requested that Sgt Towns return Lt Marano's call if Capt Leonard would be unable to be reached in one and one-half hours. Sgt Towns said he would have Capt Leonard call Lt Marano and that he would return the call if Capt Leonard could not be reached.
