Leitha - 21

anything - that night in the paper and there were people talking about it, then other people in Winona had spotted this flying object too, and they said it had come from across Wabasha over the river you know.
H    That sounds very much to me like a very bright, what we call in astronomy a fireball.
L    Oh
H    And it probably lasted only a few seconds.  That's not a UFO; that we know about.
L    Oh, and then there's - I think it was here, Mrs. - she's from Elmer, she's a school teacher and she did at that time drive down to Fountain City every day which is about 20 miles from where he home is, oh, maybe about 5 or 6 miles above where I saw this thing quite a few mornings she saw a flying object come from in the valleys there and hills, and it came down - and this is early in the morning. She always went to school real early, had to be there I'd say about 7 o'clock, quarter to 7.
H    Do you think you could get her to write me a description of this?
L    I don't know her - that well, but I know other people were talking about it and that she was talking that she had seen it, you know, and I don't whether she would or not, because I haven't talked to her about it, but I know other people told me - this was before I had even, or so, it was right after I had seen mine - then I said something, and they told me, well, she does kind of things.
H    Well, if you can get me any more information on that, I'd appreciate it. 
Now, I think I've taken enough of your time.  You've been very kind and all this, and if I - I would like to think that something will come of
