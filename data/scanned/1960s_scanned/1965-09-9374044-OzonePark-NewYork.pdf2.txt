Dear Mr. 
This is in reply to your request for information on your aerial observation of 4 September 1965.
The description, duration, and direction of flight are characteristic of satellite. On 4 September Echo II was traveling in an east to west direction at an average altitude of 700 miles. It would have been visible to the naked eye.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
Sincerely,
