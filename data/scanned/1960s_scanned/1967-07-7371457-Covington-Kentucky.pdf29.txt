On 13 July the Detroit News carried an article on an object which the dimensions are as follows: 2' wide x 1 1/2' high x 2" thick. The object was a black band. One half of the item was window made of plexiglass surrounded by aluminum. 
The calling signal indicates APA, TC, Cinnamon, Michigan, and others.
Major Ward, who is the OD relative to UFOB, (AD-33-11570-3115)
I relayed to him our interest in the object, and requested that he contact Mr. Ralph Riley (313-222-2142) of the Detroit News, who now has physical possession of the item, and do the following:
a. Secure or take photos of the item for shipment to us.
b. Ascertain the nature of the item.
c. Assure the item if it appeared to be foreign in nature.

On 24 July, I called Major Ward, and he said that an investigation was made on our behalf, and that the object was an escape hatch from a private airplane, probably of North American manufacture. Major Ward is sending us a copy of the photographs as info, and will contact the FAA in that area to lend his assistance in the case. These photos will be examined upon arrival and then sent to FDTI/TF for their information.
