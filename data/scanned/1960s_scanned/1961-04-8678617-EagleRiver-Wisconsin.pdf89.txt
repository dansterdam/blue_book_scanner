He took it to the basement where he had a pump and filled it with water, according to his statement. He apparently tried to get the object to sink, by doing so, he had to get up on tiptoe and put one hand against the craft, he says, and affected the transfer of the jug. He described the interior as essentially bare - - no seats, and noted that there were two men inside. The men he described as extremely clean-shaven, he said very smooth-faced, but dark and short, about 5 feet, he estimated. He said they looked like Italians. Their dress was also black, and he limited that they had turtle-neck sweater-type apparel. From his account, it seemed to me that it was more like the stereotyped picture one sees of Italian opera singers, or as he says, of the speedy set. There was no communication except by sign language between them, and as he backed away from the craft, he said he saw the interior dimly lighted, and that it was apparently beautiful. He said he would love to have a room painted in the same way. He noticed that one of the men was apparently cooking something, and in his attempt to communicate by sign language indicating that they now had water, he made motions with his mouth that they could now drink, but apparently this sign language was misinterpreted as indicating that he wanted some of the stuff they were cooking, and thereupon they handed him three or four of these little panda-like cakes, and as soon as the transfer was effected, the hatch swung down, closed with a clang, and we say they then shot up, apparently up an elevator without any apparent acceleration, except, of course, at the very beginning. And when it reached a height of some 20 feet, it just simply took off at a terrific rate of speed.
