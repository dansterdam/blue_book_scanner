SUBJECT: UFO
ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA - PT SHIEMAN                 DATE: 29 APRIL 1966
This is in reference to your request for analysis of four prints of photographs taken along Route 55 about 9 miles east of Swanlake, New York.
Photographs in question were present at the time of exposure. There is no evidence of double exposure or evidence of any tampering with the film to alter the photograph. This appears to be a legitimate sighting.
However, a detailed analysis cannot be completed without exact focal length and range. On the other hand, the relative size of the object seen in the photographs would indicate that it was at some distance from the observer, which the photographs themselves do not appear to be the sequence in proportion.
