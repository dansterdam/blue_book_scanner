The image does not contain any photographs or images, only text. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object.
a. Sound _Loud saucer shaped objects, fast moving_
b. Color _Yellow color, like very hot metal_

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, pipes, trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

There is a hand-drawn sketch of a saucer-shaped object with a tail.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One): a. Sharply defined c. Other
b. Blurred and indistinct d. Don't remember 

19. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
