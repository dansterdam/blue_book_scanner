Dear sir:

As I don't usually write letters, I couldn't quite decide where to send this. It is a report sighting a "flying saucer", or something that looked a heck of a lot like a flying saucer.

To get down to dress tacks:
All the moment I am staying at my Aunts near Bridgeport Cottage, which is near Three Lakes. Impression: the area is mostly wooded, with it is not as crowded as some areas.
