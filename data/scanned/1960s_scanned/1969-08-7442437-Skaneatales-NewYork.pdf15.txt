The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any photograph or visual element. The page consists solely of text that has been redacted or obscured, likely to protect sensitive information. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output all the visible text found in the document:

the sifta ik"_ this report ___ that on a.n early fall evening, I saw a bright lights in the sky. This was about ___ minutes after sunsot. The object moved rapidly with a weaving motion and finally disappeared behind some trees. It wa: a very bright object that seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed. I did not hear any sound. It was just a bright light that moved through the sky and then disappeared from view.

The witness name and other details have been redacted, so I cannot provide any further information beyond the visible text on this page.
