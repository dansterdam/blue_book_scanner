Winter Constellations Brilliant

Celestial calendar for 1960 holds many interesting events, while Venus and Jupiter shine brightly in early morning.

By JAMES STOKLEY

Dr. JOSEPH ASHBROOK of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles tells us that we will have to get up early in the mornings if we want to see some of the celestial events that will take place during 1960. 

The planet Venus, for example, will be exceedingly bright - the second brightest object in the sky after the moon. It will be shining close to Jupiter, and the pair will make a striking sight during the opening of the year. 

On January 9, Venus and Jupiter will appear to be only about one-half degree apart - that is, the apparent diameter of the full moon - and this will be the closest approach of the two planets all year.

Also in the nighttime sky, the brilliant constellations of winter are shining, as depicted in the accompanying diagram. These include such familiar groupings as Orion, Gemini, and Taurus (the Bull). These are among the finest star groups to be seen any time during the year.

Most conspicuous of these star groups is the great Orion, high in the south at nightfall. Orion, with its striking pattern of three stars in a row, called the Belt, Betelgeuse, a red giant at one shoulder, and Rigel, a blue-white star at the opposite shoulder, is one of the best known of all constellations.

Below Orion is the mighty Canis Major, the Greater Dog. Here we see the brightest star of the entire heavens, Sirius, the Dog Star, shining with a brilliant white light.

Off to the left of Orion is Taurus, the Bull. In the forehead of the Bull we see the beautiful Pleiades star cluster - one of the finest and most famous in the whole sky.

Continuing in an arc from Orion toward the east, we come to the twins Castor and Pollux in Gemini, the Twins. And high overhead is another striking winter scene - the brilliant stars of Auriga, the Charioteer, including the brilliant yellowish star Capella.

Coming back to the west, we see perhaps the most beautiful sight of all - the great red giant star Aldebaran, in the eye of the Bull. Aldebaran rides high in the south as evening falls.

Throughout January with its first quarter on the 6th, at 1:54 p.m., E.S.T. (12:54 p.m. for Pacific standard time), full moon coming on Jan. 14, at 10:01 p.m., E.S.T. (7:01 p.m. P.S.T.), last quarter on the 21st, at 1:16 a.m. E.S.T. (10:16 p.m., 20th, P.S.T.), and new moon on Jan. 29, the beautiful star groups depicted in the diagram will be high and glorious in the evening sky. And, in the early morning, brilliant Venus and Jupiter will continue shining, with their closest approach coming on Jan. 9, at 262,000 miles.
