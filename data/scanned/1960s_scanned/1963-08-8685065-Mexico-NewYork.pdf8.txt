CASE: Flying saucer down - 3-8-63

Walsall saucer

The following account appeared in the Walsall Observer, a local weekly newspaper, on 9 August 1963:

"During a patrol of Walsall, three police officers observed an object projecting a beam of light downwards. The object was estimated to be about 50 feet in diameter and 30 feet high. The officers watched it for about 10 minutes before it shot off at great speed. The object was seen by several other people and was reported to the police for investigation. The Police Superintendent and three other officers attended the scene and the object was sighted again, hovering over Beechdale Road. It was described as 'saucer-shaped' and 'glowing'. After about 5 minutes, it shot off towards Stephenson Avenue, Bloxwich, and disappeared. The object was seen by Mrs. B. Bloxwich, of 43 Stephenson Square, later. She said that while she had been talking to a neighbor on the patio, the object had suddenly appeared and remained stationary for about 5 minutes before shooting off and disappearing."

From here, the report goes on to describe the police investigation, including interviews with multiple witnesses who reported seeing the object. The report concludes by noting that no physical evidence was found, but the police were unable to identify or explain the object that was observed.
