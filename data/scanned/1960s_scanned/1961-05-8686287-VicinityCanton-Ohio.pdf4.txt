3:55P REPORT

I WAS WATCHING T.V. ABOUT 3:55 AND LOOKING OUT OF THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW WHEN I SAW A LIGHT OBJECT MOVING EAST TO WEST AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED ACROSS THE SKY. IT WAS SHAPED LIKE A CIGAR AND SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 3 TO 5 TIMES AS LONG AS IT WAS WIDE. THE LIGHT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT CAUGHT MY EYE AND WHEN I FOCUSSED ON IT I COULD SEE IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE, SATELLITE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT WENT BY VERY FAST AND SEEMED TO LEAVE A GLOWING TRAIL BEHIND IT. I LOST SIGHT OF IT WEST OF THE HOUSE. THE ENTIRE SIGHTING LASTED ONLY A FEW SECONDS.
