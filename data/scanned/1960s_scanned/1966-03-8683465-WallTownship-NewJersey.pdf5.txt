QUALITY Eight negatives, five 3-1/2" x 4-1/2" prints, and eight 8" x 10" prints

1. PURPOSE: This report is written for Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., USAF, in Answer to Work Order 66-66. Additional analysis is performed as to what the unidentified object may be. Results of previous analysis were reported in Photo Analysis Report 66-25.
2. ANALYSIS: Photo Analysis Report 66-25 stated that information necessary for a more detailed analysis would include focal length of the camera and lens data. Due to having only the prints, no focal length or other lens calibration data is available as the original negatives were not available.
3. Assuming an approximate 3 inch focal length, several sizes were computed for selected ranges between 10 feet and 1 mile. The only range available from the observer is found on the back of one of his original prints with comments, annotated #2. The comment is as follows:
"...it said it was about a quarter of a mile up."
The range of 1320 feet implies this was estimated. Photograph #2 was used for these calculations as it is the only one with an estimated range available. The results were as follows:
Observer estimated range of - 1320 feet - diameter 2.56 feet
at range of - 10 feet - diameter 1.28 feet
at range of - 15 feet - diameter 1.90 feet
at range of - 20 feet - diameter 2.52 feet
at range of - 30 feet - diameter 3.78 feet
at range of - 50 feet - diameter 6.30 feet
at range of - 100 feet - diameter 12.60 feet
at range of - 1320 feet - diameter 2.11 feet

4. Further analysis would require reliable estimates of distance from camera to object (range) for each photograph and scale focal length of the camera.
