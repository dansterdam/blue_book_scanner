1. The following is an extract from the Staff Duty Officers Report
1630 - 20 April 66 to 0800 hours - 21 April 1966.

21 April 66 - 0430 hours. Mr. and friend saw a greenish light which appeared in the form of a horseshoe near a hill. The light changed to a round disc-shaped illumination mark.

Location of Observer: North [REDACTED] street near Echo Park.
Direction: North

Observer is a two truck driver and sounded sober.  

Mr initial reaction was that it was a vapor trail from a VAFB launch, but I couldn't see anything unusual from the second floor, Building A.
