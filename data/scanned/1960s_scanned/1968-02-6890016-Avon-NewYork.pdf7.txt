CURTIS BROWN FARM LIMA, N.Y. TO E.KOVEN, N.Y. ON ROUTE 20. ABOUT 1:30 AM ON 3-11-68 WE FELT AND HOUSE SHOOK LIKE SEVERE EARTHQUAKE. IT LASTED ABOUT 2 MINUTES. THAT NIGHT TIMES RECORD SHOW NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS OBSERVED ON RADAR OR REPORTED BY CITIZEN BAND RADIO.
HOWEVER, MY BROTHER-IN-LAW WHO LIVES ABOUT 1/2 MILE FROM IT, IT SHOULD BE ABLE STARTED TO HEAR A BEEPING NOISE FROM HIS CAR - MOTOR EFFECT WHILE HIS CAR WAS PARKED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE. HIS HOUSE AND RADIO MOTOR OFF. AND HE WATCHED IT GROW AWAY AND PASSED OVER HIS HOUSE. HE CLAIMS IT CAUSED SOME STATIC IN HIS HOUSE. ONE NEIGHBOR, CREST OF HILL COULD HEAR IT PASS-BY THERE WERE NO LIGHTS VISIBLE AS IT PASSED HER HOUSE EITHER. 
TRAFFIC ON ROAD BUT NO ONE ELSE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT IT. THEY JUST KEPT GOING AND FAMILY THAT I FELT THEY HAVE SEEN A UFO BUT WE ARE UNABLE TO SAY IT WAS A HELICOPTER.
THERE WERE NO PERMANENT IMPRESSIONS ON MY LAND OR OTHER NEIGHBORS THAT I KNOW OF
