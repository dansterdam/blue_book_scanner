There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text describing a UFO sighting.

We were sitting on the back porch, discussing our first sightings when we noticed something in the sky. It was just as dark as the night, but it seemed to be glowing. It was hovering above the tree line that is to the south of our house. I was surprised at how fast it moved, darting back and forth across the sky in the distance. The color was a reddish orange, like the color of the moon when it is quite low.

We went out in the yard to get a better look. The object came even closer and we could see more details. It seemed to hover for a short time, then suddenly took off at a very high rate of speed. It disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. 

We went back in the house to get the exposure and film. We wanted to try to photograph the object if it returned. As we were discussing the experience, it appeared again, not as close as before, but a little to the right. I managed to get two pictures before it disappeared again. 

The pictures did not turn out very clearly. All we could see was a reddish glow. It seemed the faster the object moved, the more blurred the pictures were. We waited for over an hour but the object did not return.
