AIRCRAFT T r'-J-J'I
ACCELERATED OUT-OF-SIGHT THE BRIGHT LIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE OBJECT SHOWN IN THE ABOVE DRAWING, LOOKED LIKE VERY BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT ANDSLIGHTLY SILVER COMPARED TO THE LIGHT OF THE MOON. THE OBJECT WAS WELL-DEFINED, BLACK IN COLOR AND APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN DIAMETER, WITH NO VISIBLE MARKINGS AND ABOUT 75 FEET OFF THE GROUND. THE OBJECT TOOK OFF VERTICALLY AT TERRIFIC SPEED AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT WITHIN 3 SECONDS. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SEEN IN THE NORTH, 75 FROM THE HORIZON AND WAS LAST SEEN TOWARD THE NORTH AND 10 FROM THE HORIZON. WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME WERE CLEAR WITH LIGHT WIND FROM THE NORTHEAST. THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT ONE MILE AWAY.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE OBSERVER WAS A TRUSTED AND RELIABLE INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT INDULGE IN IMAGINATIVE OR FANCIFUL STORIES, AND WHOSE JUDGEMENT IS ACCEPTED AS BEING SOUND. THE SPEED WAS EXTREMELY FAST, ALTHOUGH WHILE OVER BROOKTON IT SEEMED SLOW IN COMPARISON TO ITS PREVIOUS AND LATER SPEED.
EVALUATION: THE USAF WAS CONTACTED AND FOUND THAT NO AIRCRAFT HAD BEEN IN THE AREA AND NO MILITARY OR COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS WERE SCHEDULED OR KNOWN TO BE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. IT WAS APPARENTLY SOME FORM OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, AS REPORTED.

EVALUATION: THE UFO OBSERVER, MAJOR BROOKS, REPORTED THAT HE HAD SIGHTED AND WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHT, GLOWING LIGHT IN THE NORTH ABOUT 75 FROM THE HORIZON. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE BLACK IN COLOR AND APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT TOOK OFF VERTICALLY AT HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW WITHIN 3 SECONDS. MAJOR BROOKS REPORTED THAT HE HAD CONTACTED THE USAF AND THAT THEY HAD NO AIRCRAFT OR FLIGHTS IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. MAJOR BROOKS WAS DESCRIBED AS A RELIABLE AND CREDIBLE OBSERVER AND HIS REPORT WAS CONSIDERED VALID.
