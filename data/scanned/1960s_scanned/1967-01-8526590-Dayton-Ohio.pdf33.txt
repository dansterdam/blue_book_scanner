PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NUMBER: 69-76
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: Universal Station, Canalilic, California
DATE: Unknown
PHOTOGRAPHY:
AF: IR
QUALITY: Good
1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 68-74 in which Lieutenant Caton requested a photo analysis be made to determine the identity of an object seen in a 35mm motion picture.
2. ANALYSIS: A comprehensive analysis was precluded due to a lack of information by mid-making (source). According to source, the referenced film sequence was made during the object's flight. The data and particularly the date of the photography could not be determined.
3. STUDY: The imagery indicates that the UFO image is probably that of the Moon, the press stated by source that panning was used to the actors' lead, which in this case probably depended upon the movement or describe of this known or actual object (Moon), which is moving in an equally erratic manner.
4. FURTHER ANALYSIS: The analysis is required, it will be necessary to obtain the data and photography in order to confirm or refute the conclusion that the image is that of the Moon.
