The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

Text from the document:

34. Have you completed this questionnaire? 20 June 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The witness described the object that was observed as going very swiftly across the sky in an easterly direction. The object appeared to be oval-shaped and gave off a bright light. The witness feels that some comparison was made to the object by another witness saying it was similar to a fluorescent light, but the witness does not recall the details of this comparison clearly. The witness may have also mentioned that the object appeared to be about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length, but is not certain of this detail.
