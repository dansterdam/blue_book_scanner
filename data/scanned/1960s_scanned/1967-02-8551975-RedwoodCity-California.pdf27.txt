REPORT-1A

14 Feb 67

Major H. H. Quintanilla, Jr.
426 Operation Technology Division
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Request your office analyze the enclosed material and furnish this
office with information on results.

The material was turned in to this office by a local citizen who
reports that it burned holes through leaves and branches of a tree
in his back yard as it fell, and apparently landed on the roof of his
house.

Any information you can provide will hopefully aid this office in
giving the gentleman who turned in the material some logical
explanation.

KENNETH E. BECKER
