The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO-like object. The sketch depicts a saucer-shaped object with appendages or structures on the sides, and a light source at the bottom. The text in the image describes the details of the sighting and investigation, including the direction of motion, intersection location, and size of the object. There is no photograph in this image, only the hand-drawn sketch labeled "Fig A".

The text in the image is as follows:

Startled, said "that's it, but there was a thing, a dome, on top!" This apparently accounted for previous attempts to explain that she was looking up at the bottom, but could see something on top.

The investigators found the two streets described running at 90Â° to the directions described later during the interview, but in correspondence to the directions stated early in the investigation was contrary to the written report. Accordingly, the witness was standing on the southwest corner; the object would then have appeared from the south, and disappeared straight north. Four properties were seen, one on diagonally-opposite corners and two further down the block from Clifford, one north and one south. The intersection was relatively free of trees, giving the effect of a clearing perhaps 100 feet in diameter. All the streets were otherwise lined with mature trees.

EVALUATION is deferred to the end of this report.
