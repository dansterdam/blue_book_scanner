1. Relative flying objects. On June 30th, 1961, this object was observed in the western part of Ohio, as follows:

a. The first object sighted was on June 29th about an hour after sunset. It appeared to be a bright, steady light moving higher in the heavens and then descending. It was observed for about 20 minutes until it disappeared. This was observed by the reporting party at Bucyrus, Ohio.

b. On the night of June 30th, about 9:30 P.M., I also saw another object appear in eastern Ohio above Bellevue. This object appeared to be a bright, steady light moving higher in the heavens and then descending. It was observed for about 15 minutes until it disappeared. This was observed by the reporting party at Bellevue, Ohio.
