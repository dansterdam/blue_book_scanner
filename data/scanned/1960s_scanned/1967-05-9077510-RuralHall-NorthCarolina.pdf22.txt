HOW TO USE IT:
1. YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WITH FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "0" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
2. ESTIMATE THE ANGULAR MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE SKY, AND PLACE A TICK MARK BETWEEN THE "X" AND "0" TO INDICATE THE SPEED AS FAST, MEDIUM, OR SLOW.
3. IF THE PHENOMENON HAS CHANGED DIRECTION WHILE UNDER OBSERVATION, PLACE ADDITIONAL "X'S" AND "0'S" AS APPROPRIATE TO SHOW CHANGES IN DIRECTION.
4. PLEASE INDICATE THE DIRECTIONAL CHANGES BY DRAWING LINES FROM THE CENTRAL POINT TO THE "X'S" AND "0'S". THIS IS MATHEMATICALLY IMPORTANT TO SHOW THE EXACT PATH OF MOVEMENT.
5. PLEASE BE AS CAREFUL AND AS EXACT AS POSSIBLE IN YOUR OBSERVATIONS. THIS IS VITAL TO ACCURATE EVALUATION BY PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS.
