Text from the document:

UNOF-30 (Major Connarn)

1. A report was received of a letter received by a civilian observer describing his observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky near Haverhill, Massachusetts on
22 June 1961. The informant states that he is enclosing a copy of the letter written by the observer concerning this incident.

2. According to the letter, the observer states that while riding in a car with his wife about 10:00 PM on 22 June 1961, he observed a strange object in the sky. The object was described as being about 50 feet in diameter, and it appeared to be a lighted, circular object. The observer states that the object hovered over the car for a few minutes, then shot away at a very high rate of speed. The letter indicates that the observer was quite concerned about this sighting and requested that the Air Force investigate the matter. The observer would appreciate a reply indicating if the Air Force had received the report and if any action would be taken.

3. The letter from the civilian observer is not attached. This report is being submitted for information only. No further action is contemplated by this office at this time.
