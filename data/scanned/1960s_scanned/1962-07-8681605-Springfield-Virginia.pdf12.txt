The image appears to contain no photograph, but rather diagrams and sketches. There are two main sketches on the page.

The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and another curved line labeled "B". The sketch depicts the trajectory of an object as observed above the horizon.

The second sketch shows a road leading to a distant landscape, with a person standing in the foreground. There is also a smaller circular inset sketch showing a landscape with a curved horizon line.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
