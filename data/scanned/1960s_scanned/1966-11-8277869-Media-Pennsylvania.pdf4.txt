The image appears to show a photograph of what looks like a long, dark object or shape against a snowy or white background. The image has a "MEDIA DEC 23 1966" stamp on it, suggesting it is part of a document or report from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:
