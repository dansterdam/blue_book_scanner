The image appears to contain a description of a sighting rather than a photograph. The text in the document reads:

CIGAR ON FACE OF MOON
At about 2:30 A.M. (August 27), 19 year old Dan Besse reports that he saw a large cigar-shaped craft which hovered for about 4 minutes close to the upper right-hand corner of the moon, then pick up speed and vanish in the east. He is night watchman for Neil Greenland, Inc. 2044 on RT. 17 (Lincoln Mills). When he made the report, he said: "I would judge it was 40 to 50 feet in length. A light glowed all around it and it trailed somewhat as it moved across the face of the moon. It seemed very close, far closer than the moon itself." 7 would judge it was far to be a satellite, an undoubtedly a saucer-shaped craft which launches the saucer-shaped craft." There is little to add to this description. It doesn't often get reports as well documented as this one.
