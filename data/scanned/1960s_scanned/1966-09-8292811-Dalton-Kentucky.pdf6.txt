Col. Leon J. Reed
Deputy Director
Division of Civil Defense
Frankfort, Kentucky

Dear Col. Reed:

Inclosed please find a report of a so-called "Saucer", sighted in Caldwell County on "September 9, 1966". It is my understanding that the investigates such reports, and for that reason I have referred this 15 year old boy and his mother call at the office with the statement - I assume you will know to whom, if the report should be sent.

With kind personal regards, I am

Sincerely,
