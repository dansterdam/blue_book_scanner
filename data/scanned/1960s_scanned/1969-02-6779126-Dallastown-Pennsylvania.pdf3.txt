Dear Sir:

I have been interested in UFOs for nearly three years now. I have recorded over 2700 sightings. I find the subject fascinating. They are the works of Valleys, Michial, Boorsnider, Jansen, Adamski, Gillens, manzer, ruppeltt, stanton, keller, the publics answer, hilliar, Marjama e. walli. I do not know who to get to the point just as this evening (Feb 15, 1969) at about 6:30 I spotted a huge, silvery, egg-shaped UFO traveling northwest at about the speed of a jet. I wish I could give you more information on it. But if it was a non-beliving light, there were it. Could it have been meteorite? I wish I could have given you more information for an answer, and furthermore I can you explain it?

Also please give me your opinion regarding the sightings. Where can you do some books or magazines with more factual information on UPOs.

Should I write to PLANESBOOK's carol about theses for reading this.

Yours truly,
