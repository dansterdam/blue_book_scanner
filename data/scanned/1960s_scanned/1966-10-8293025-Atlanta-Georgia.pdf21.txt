Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sir:

I would like to report an object I saw in the sky on Friday, October 7, 1966. It was a large orange light which appeared to be hovering about 300 yards above the house. At first I thought it was a plane but it made no sound and did not move. It seemed to be just suspended in the air. After about 3 minutes it suddenly streaked away at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I have never seen anything like this before and would appreciate any information you can give me on the subject.

Sincerely,
[redacted]
