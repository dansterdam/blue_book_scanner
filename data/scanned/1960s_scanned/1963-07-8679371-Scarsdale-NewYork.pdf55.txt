"Somerset saucer

Witness - Mrs. Edith, Russell, 75 Sunnyhill Avenue, Burnham on Sea, Somerset, England.
August 1, 1963. I wonder what it is! I saw something very strange in the sky above my house. It was saucer-shaped, about 30 ft across, silvery and seemed to be giving off a strong bright light. It moved slowly at first, then it went into a fast jerky motion and then it faded out. This was seen by myself, my husband and my son-in-law, all of Ivy Cottage, West Huntspill. We all stared at it for about 10 minutes. It seemed to flutter as it moved, sometimes it was bright, then it would fade. My son-in-law, who works her husband, came to the door and saw it as well. He said it was a big glowing object that seemed to be moving up and down, then it suddenly shot away at a fast speed and disappeared. We watched it for some time and something seemed to be coming from it, but I could not make out what it was. It seemed to be giving off something like a dark vapor, but this may have been an optical illusion, as it was seen through the glass window. The object then seemed to go higher and higher until it was out of sight. This is the truth, I have never seen anything like it before."
