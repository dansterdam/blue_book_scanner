Columbia River Basin, Washington 

On the 21st and 22nd, sightings were made in the Columbia River Basin in Washington. Franklin County Undersheriff Irvin Monda interviewed 10 people who saw the objects. He said they were glowing objects flying at low altitude north of Ringold. The objects had been seen on Wednesday and Thursday of the two preceeding weeks. Hood said all the reports were similar, describing orange, glowing objects, flying in a group. Some observers said they saw mountains or objects that could not have been planets or satellites. The Othello Radar base confirmed an object's course, saying it might be pointed out that in hilly or mountainous country, radar will not pick up low-flying objects.
