The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

As a text transcription system, here is the text from the document:

As a point of information for your investigations when more than one object is reported, any time motion sequence should be included for each object viewed separately. Consideration the same object.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR
