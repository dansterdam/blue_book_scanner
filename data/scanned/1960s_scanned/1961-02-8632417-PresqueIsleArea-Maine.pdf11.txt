The sighting "may" in Maine last 7th and 8th included several reports of sightings of one or more "flying objects brilliance" which "lit up the whole upper part of the sky."

It was hovering, raising, and darting motions at first, then suddenly shot up and away becoming smaller and smaller like an explosion as the object disappeared below the horizon. No explosion on the object, just a disappearance was noted.
