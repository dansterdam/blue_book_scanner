There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed letter that appears to be a response to a report of an unidentified flying object sighting.

Proposed reply to letter from
Dear
Reference your recent completed UFO Form 16u describing your observation of an alleged unidentified flying object.
A study of the submitted information did not reveal a positive identification. The only explanation that I can offer is that an aircraft was observed; this, of course, being only a possibility.
There is a high speed, low level aircraft training route slightly west of Cairo, Ohio. Aircraft operating on this route fly toward the southwest. Since aircraft records are normally destroyed after 30 days, it would be impossible to check the records at this time for any aircraft activity on the days of your sighting. It is extremely important for one to report his observation as soon as possible so that a meaningful investigation can be made.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
