Transcription of the text:

Meet that came glancing off the morning sky rapidly. The object was about 30 feet in diameter and an intense white light. As it passed over, it made a sound, like steam escaping, and then it was gone. This object was apparently traveling at a very high rate of speed. The morning was clear and bright at the time of sighting. The object was viewed for a matter of seconds only as it passed quickly across the sky from south to north.
