There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have produced the following text from the document:

DESCRIBE SUCH MOVEMENT OR MANEUVER AS FULLY AS POSSIBLE.

HOW MUCH OTHER TRAFFIC WAS THERE?

JUST A GUESS

IF "NO," INDICATE WHETHER THIS IS DUE TO YOUR MOVING AWAY FROM THE PHENOMENON OR WHETHER THE PHENOMENON ITSELF MOVED OUT OF SIGHT. INDICATE CLEARLY.
