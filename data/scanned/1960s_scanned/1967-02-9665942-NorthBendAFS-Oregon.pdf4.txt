(4) TWO.
(5) FOLLOWING IN-LINE, SEPARATED BY A DISTANCE EQUAL TO
APPROX 10-12 TIMES THEIR OWN LENGTH, CO-ALTITUDE.
PAGE 2 RUN:MBDF994 UNCLAS
(6) SEQUENTIAL FLASHING OR BLINKING LIGHTS ON BOTH, AT OR
NEAR THEIR BOTTOM EDGE. LIGHTS WERE NOT CONVENTIONAL AS
WE WOULD CUSTOMARILY THINK OF THEM, BUT APPEARED TO BE A
MUCH BRIGHTER SPOT THAN THE REST OF THE OBJECT. LIGHT SOURCE
APPEARED TO BE WITHIN THE OBJECT AND GAVE MUCH THE SAME EFFECT AS
BLINKING A FLASHLIGHT THROUGH AN ORANGE PLASTIC, WITH THE
FLASHING LIGHT BEING HELD A SLIGHT DISTANCE FROM THE PLASTIC. THE
FLASHING LIGHTS, BELIEVED TO BE EIGHT IN NUMBER FOR EACH OBJECT,
WERE BLINKING IN A 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 SEQUENCE.
OBSERVER IS UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LIGHTS WERE (1) IN ONE
PLANE, BLINKING FIRST IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN REVERSING AND
GOING BACK ON THE SAME PLANE; OR (2) BLINKING AROUND THE PERIMETER
OF A CIRCLE, WHICH, AT A DISTANCE, WOULD GIVE MUCH THE SAME EFFECT.
LIGHTS IN ONE DIRECTION APPEARED TO BE VERY SLIGHTLY DIMMER THAN ONE
DIRECTION. BLINKING COINCIDED TO AN AFTER THE OTHER OF THE TWO ABOVE STATED
POSSIBILITIES.
