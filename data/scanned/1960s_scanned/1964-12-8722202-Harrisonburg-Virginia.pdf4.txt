Huge UFO At Staunton, Va.
Mr. Steve Burns, of Grottoes, Virginia, claims to have seen an 80-foot high UFO from this east of Staunton, Virginia, on March 12, 1964. It was circular in shape, 125 feet in diameter with a band of bluish-white light on the bottom. The object came out of the sky north of the highway, crossed the road about 300 feet in front of the car, hovered for 8 to 10 seconds, then stepped. He said his car seemed to come to an involuntary quick stop. He saw two men in the cockpit of the object, which had no visible portholes, doors or seams. The object then moved up and east at tremendous speed, leaving no trail. About two seconds later, there was a sound of rushing air. 
It ran all night. Professor C. D. Jackson, head of the Physics Department at Eastern Mennonite College, examined the site and was unable to find any evidence of landing. It was 5 days after the UFO had parked, so much physical evidence could be expected to have disappeared. However, no evidence of its having been there was found. 
The population of Staunton is 28,000. This is in conflict with Burns' statement that the object was 80 feet high. With a population of 28,000, this seems unlikely. Some of the testimony seems to conflict with the reports. A series of small holes leading to the woods near Glassboro, New Jersey, were reportedly found in the woods, and it is claimed that this was to the seen of a known UFO enthusiast and NICAP member.
