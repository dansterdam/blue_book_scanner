There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only text.

The text reads as follows:

The officer asked questions similar to those he had asked the first time we talked, and proceeded to fill out the same questionnaire that he had filled out at the time and said he would receive a form to fill out and return.

At 12:30 hrs., 12/10/67, the object was sighted and I arrived at Standford Field and spoke with the man in charge of the weather Bureau. He informed me that the information regarding to the sighting (3/4 mile north of the field). When we sighted a bright distorted in the sky, two witnesses (including a weather balloon had been launched at 06:15 hrs. (They had not been down about four hours, or why it was not reported to us when I asked about it.)

I was told however, that the wind was out of the northwest at 4 knots. This would indicate the balloon would have drifted in a direction from which the object was reported to have come, and at a more rapid rate. Although my conclusion may have been just a calculation, it could not have been that far off.

I went back to my location at the time of the sighting and took along the binoculars and binocular with which I plotted my exact position, that of the object and the sight wind, and returned to the object and marked the sighting to standard field; plus the fact I saw at the air-field and put them on the map.

I have concluded that the object I sighted could not possibly have been the unidentified balloon launched at 00:13 hrs.

Due to a bad accident to my right hand I was unable to get this report returned to you any sooner.
