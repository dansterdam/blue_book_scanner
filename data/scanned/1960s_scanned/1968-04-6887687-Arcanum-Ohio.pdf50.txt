Tiny UFO Floats
By Malden Home

Miniature space travelers riding in a flying 
saucer-no bigger than a doll house were reported
visitors to Malden over the weekend--at least ac-
cording to a report made to police by a Malden
woman.

Shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday, according to
the woman, she was awakened by a strange 
noise. Getting out of bed to look out through her un-
done bedroom window, she saw an object about the 
size of a child's doll house, flying around her home.

The woman said that she object had lights and 
seemed to float through the air, then disappear be-
hind the steeple of Holy Cross Cemetery across from
her house.

It definitely was not a conventional aircraft,
the woman asserted.

Police who responded to the woman's home 
after she reported the sighting, looked around but 
were unable to locate either a flying saucer or a doll 
house.
