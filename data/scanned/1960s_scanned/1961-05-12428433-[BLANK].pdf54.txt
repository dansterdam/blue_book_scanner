The image contains two photographs. The first photograph shows an unusual object that appears to be some kind of inflatable or deployable spacecraft structure. It has an elongated, aerodynamic shape with a pointed nose and fins or appendages protruding from the sides. The second photograph shows a detailed diagram of a "RE-ENTRY MODEL DEPLOYED" vehicle, which appears to be a conceptual or prototype design for a re-entry craft. The diagram labels various components of the vehicle, including the "RUDDER AND ELEVON SERVOS", "GUIDANCE, COMMUNICATION, AND INSTRUMENTATION", "INFLATION SPHERE, HELIUM", and "H2O2 REACTION CONTROL TANK". The text and diagrams appear to be discussing technical details and specifications of inflatable or deployable aerospace structures.
