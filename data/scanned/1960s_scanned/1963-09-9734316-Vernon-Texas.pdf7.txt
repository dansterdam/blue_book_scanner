Dear Mr. [Redacted],

This is in response to your letter of September 23rd in which you reported sighting an unusual aerial phenomena on September 22nd in the Vernon, Texas area.

What you saw was, in all probability, the unusual contrails of an aircraft. A closer look at the reported characteristics of the object - its high altitude, speed, and duration - clearly suggest an aircraft of conventional origin. There was no tangible evidence reported that would indicate this was anything other than a man-made aerial vehicle. 

We want to express our gratitude for your report - this is the kind of information we value in analyzing and evaluating reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. The details you provided are helpful in distinguishing natural or explainable occurrences from those which may warrant further investigation. 

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
