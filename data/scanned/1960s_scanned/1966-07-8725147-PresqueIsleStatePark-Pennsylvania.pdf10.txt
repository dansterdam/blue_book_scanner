The image contains a black and white aerial photograph showing a landscape. The photograph appears to be grainy and indistinct, likely due to its age and the scanning process. There is text at the top of the image that says "FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, AFSC" and at the bottom it says "UNCLASSIFIED".
