DAYTON, OHIO 
6 JAN 1968 

On 6 January 1968, this event was reported to have occurred at approximately 11:30 AM EST. The witness, a Mrs. A. L. Stouffer, was looking out of a window of her home when she observed a very strange cloud formation in the sky. As she watched, the cloud formation appeared to flatten out and become more disc-shaped.

The witness stated that the object remained stationary for several minutes, then slowly moved towards the northwest and disappeared from view. She estimated the object to have been approximately the size of a medium-sized aircraft. 

No sound was heard and the object did not appear to be an aircraft of any kind. The witness was quite certain that what she observed was not a normal cloud formation or any type of aircraft.
