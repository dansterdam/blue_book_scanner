Project Blue Book
Subject: Vallance, Mrs. C.
Date: 7/8/66

On July 8, at about 10:55 p.m., a sighted a bright object in the northwest. The object appeared to be oval-shaped, with red and blue lights flashing, and was observed for about 15 minutes. The object moved from the northwest to the north, following a zigzag course. As it moved, it appeared to get smaller in size. The document states that the witness called the sheriff's office to report the observation.

(P.S. I also believe the object I saw was one. )
