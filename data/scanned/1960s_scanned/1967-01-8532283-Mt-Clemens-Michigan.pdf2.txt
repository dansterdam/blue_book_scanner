The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report discussing the analysis of a photograph. The text describes that the original photography would provide a basis for determining a range of sizes for the object, and that the object appeared to be further away from the observer than the helicopter, but the exact size of the object could not be determined.

The original text from the document is as follows:

The original photography would provide a basis for determining a range of sizes for the object. Knowing the size of the image within the photo format, the focal length of the camera and applying the observers reported range to the object from the camera a gross determination of size can be determined. 

The original photography would permit a comparison of edge sharpness between the helicopter and the unidentified object. It was reported that the object was further away from the observer than the helicopter. If this is true the edges on the object would not be as sharp as those of the helicopter. The measurements provided indicate that the object is nearer than the helicopter but we don't know if the measurements are at the same magnification, thereby ruling out this check on the reported information.
