MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJ: UFO OBSERVATION, 3 Mar 63
Mr. called to collect the Aerial Phenomena Office on 3 Apr 63 regarding his observation of 3 Mar that was most probably satellite decay. 

DATE/TIME: 3 Mar 63, approximately 9:40 p.m. EST
DURATION: Approximately 15 seconds
GV TO NE OF POSSIBLE SATELLITE DECAY OR REENTRY
OBSERVERS LOCATION: Driving west on Rt 6, one mile east of Kane, Pa

GENERAL COMMENTS: The observer was driving west on Rt 6 when he first saw the object. When he first saw it, there were three, well above the horizon. My own estimate from talking to him was 30 to 40 feet in size. The objects were traveling northwest. As the observer drove on, the objects moved in number down to one, and he followed it for less than one-fourth mile (1/4), until he found a parking place. He stopped and got out. During this time of him observing the objects, they disappeared (the observer did not see them disappear). The observer only saw the one object at the last, which seemed to be going at about 30 to 40 deg west of north and disappeared in the NE or NNE at about 30 to 40 deg elevation. The object appeared to slow down just prior to its disappearance. The observer could not give an estimate of how bright the object was, but said the full moon is. As you can see by its light, it will cast shadows, and you know how bright the light is. The observer could only say that it was very bright, like a first-quarter moon or perhaps brighter. The observer did state that as the object passed directly in front of him the observer's visibility seemed much greater than when he first saw the object.

NOTES: An AF Form 117 will be sent to Mr. (as per his request) so he will provide more specific directions and elevations.
