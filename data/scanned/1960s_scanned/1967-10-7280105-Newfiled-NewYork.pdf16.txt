representative. Dr. Hynek requested that Major Quintanilla be informed of this. A bill Donavan of a UFO outfit in White Plains, New York called Dr. Hynek and said that all sorts of things were going on that Hynek ought to come out and investigate them. Hynek pointed out that he wouldn't make a trip especially to investigate this sighting, however he had planned a trip to Auburn which is only about thirty miles away and Mr. Donavan said fine. Hynek said that if something got out about him coming to New York this is probably how it happened, through Donavan. This is the sighting that Hynek had asked Lt Marano about earlier in the week. Hynek got a letter from a ten page later to Look magazine and was highly frustrated because when he called his sighting into Hancock they laughed at him. Hynek said that this was not an official case, and he was not investigating it. Norm Levine of the University of Colorado asked Hynek not to officially investigate it for the University of Colorado but would he please forward any information that he had gotten on it and his results. Hor said that when Hancock laughed at him he called the State Police and they said all they saw was airplanes. Lt Marano will call Hancock and inform them that Dr. Hynek is not to be extended the courtesies of the base since he will be investigating the sighting but not as an Air Force representative. Also, Lt Marano will request Hancock to contact the State Police and request a copy of their incident report, especially the portion that said Mr. Donavan saw aircraft.
