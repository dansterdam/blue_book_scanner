The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten form with instructions and questions related to a UFO sighting. 

Transcription of the text in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match stick. If you had performed this experiment at the time, what would the match stick have covered on the object?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In addition to giving us a clear picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words any common objects or objects which were placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

A shape of a common rod-like object, that was real would look like the most likely object.
