"Dear Mr. Renie,
All this is just the beginnings of your comments I want to make on the present situation in this institution of faith we all belong to.
The official law and doctrines of the church as directed to you, I have seen that they have not touched upon the essential facts of the situation. It was a line of approach that by you, it was a time of disturbance too much for the larger proportion of the group. This and that I did not gather from your letter too much how it worked out in your own group.
You touched upon the government of God and the relationship of the church to the government of God. This is essential. The government of God is broader and deeper than the present church can be made to contain in full at this time.
I hope I can be of some help, as I see more clearly the full scope of the situation. Please write again and let me know more precisely what are your own thoughts and feelings about the whole matter."
