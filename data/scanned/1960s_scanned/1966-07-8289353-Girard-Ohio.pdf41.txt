Text transcription:

I couldn't detect any wiring or lights of any kind on it. It just sort of blasted off completely. I couldn't detect any trail or smoke whatsoever. It seemed to be traveling at terrific speed, possibly faster than the eye could see. I just got a glimpse but there was no sound.

I am a high school language teacher. I'm a considerable interest in science and I can mention a definite return (I have known many times an almost identical) thing. I've observed this interesting phenomenon on two or three occasions in the past and it seems to be much the same. What one could call inexperienced and untrained eyes have often passed without serious examination. I have passed an overhead a couple times without really grasping the meaning of it.
