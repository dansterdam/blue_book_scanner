Dear Sir:

I am in the midst of compiling my high school term theme concerning the theory of flying saucers. I have read numerous articles, books, and magazines on the subject and find the information, or lack of it, quite confusing. I am not asking for your personal opinion, but merely for a fact sheet or any official information your office can provide concerning the objects known as "flying saucers". I am not interested in "sensational" data, but in factual, scientific data, if it is available. 
The information I receive will be used only for my term theme and will not be published under any circumstances. I hope that this request can be met by your office.

Sincerely,
