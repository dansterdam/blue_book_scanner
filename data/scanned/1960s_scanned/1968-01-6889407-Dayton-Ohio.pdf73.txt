SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14 - CASE NO. 10285

1. About 8:00 p.m., March 29, 1958, witness saw a bright light in the sky moving rapidly in the southwest area of Dayton, Ohio.
2. The witness, Mr. Fowler, was driving his car at the time and immediately stopped and got out to observe the UFO. He described it as a very bright light moving in a straight line at high speed. It appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground and was visible for approximately 15-20 seconds before it disappeared.
3. Mr. Fowler stated that the object was much brighter than an aircraft and moved much faster than any aircraft he had ever seen before. He eliminated the possibilities of it being a meteor or a satellite.
4. No further details are available on this sighting. There were no other witnesses reported. The weather was clear at the time of the sighting.
