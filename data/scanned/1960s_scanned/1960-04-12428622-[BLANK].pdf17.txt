Unfortunately, the image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO reports.

The text of the document is as follows:

on those two days, hundreds of reports flooded in. But there was no mechanism whatever to handle them. No scientist would touch this tricky subject, and their official Air Force team began sorting reports by tossing out the "obviously incredible reports." They latched onto those cases in which they could foresee a natural explanation, a most human and understandable reaction.

This French wave of stories is reminiscent of another wave of strange stories that flooded France a century and a half ago--stories of stones that fell from heaven. Persistent stories came in, in waves, from time to time, of stones that fell from the sky. Now, how credulous can one get--stones falling from the sky, indeed!

But in due course the French Academy of Sciences appointed a committee to study the subject, and after a full examination of the stories, reported back to the Academy that there was nothing to it--the stones in question had not fallen from the sky but had been hit by lightning! This despite their much greater density and beauty, obvious as sufficient evidence from surrounding stones.

When a group of people don't want to admit something, there's nothing quite as hard headed as a scientific committee on which each man has his scientific reputation to protect and going out on a limb is certainly not the way to do it.

The great irony of it--and I choose the word irony with care--came just a few years later when the little town of L'Aigle in France was literally peppered with iron meteorites.
