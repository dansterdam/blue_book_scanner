There is no photograph present in this scanned document page from Project Blue Book. The image shows a typed report detailing various telescope and binocular data as well as a description of a "sighting evaluation" related to an observation of unidentified objects.

7/26-27/67 - NEWTON, N.H.

DATE: 27 July 1967
TIME: 2:00 AM EDT
WITNESSESS: 4 Knots
VEHICLE: Automobile

TELESCOPE DATA (Refracting Type)
MANUFACTURER: TASCO, 1075 N.W. 71st St., Miami, Florida 33138
OBJECTIVE DIAMETER: 60 mm
FOCAL LENGTH: 700 mm
OBJECTIVE STRENGTH: 4000 mm
EYEPIECE: H15.5 mm
DIAGONAL PRISM: 45Â° (used during observation, giving up-right image)

BINOCULAR DATA 
MANUFACTURER: TASCO
MAGNIFICATION: 7X (stated)
POWER: 35 mm
PERFORMANCE: 1000 yards/117 Feet

SPECIAL FEATURES IN AREA
"Long stretch of 138KV power lines run in about an East to West direction about 5 miles north of the observers. This shows on the map showing the direction of the sighting in relation to the witnesses. Map shows they run in a NNE to SSW direction."

The nearest Airport, to, the sighters area would be Haverstill Municipal Airport, about 7 miles North of the observers. This airport is not active during the early morning hours.

SIGHTING EVALUATION
Astronomical/Satellite: - Negative
Conventional Aircraft: - Improbable (Overall Data rules such out unless positive observer-observer exists)
No sound was heard and helicopter or plane would have been heard easily in this area - no conventional lighting lights were observed. When jet aircraft approached which would be against regulations that close to the airfield, the objects remained stationary for long periods - the abrupt reversals and erratic behavior and disappearance could not be accounted for by conventional aircraft.

The flashing like an "identification responder" can only be postulated, and the sudden maneuvering observed (up 60 minutes) under the circumstances would indicate a definitely unconventional aerial objects.
