Contact with Sulphur Grove balloon launch center, Dayton, Ohio, about balloons being launched on 2 August 66. There was a balloon released at 1815 3 August 66, however, personnel at Sulphur Grove did not believe their balloon was responsible for the sighting, as the conditions at 1815 would have been not in the Dayton area unless under very unusual conditions.
