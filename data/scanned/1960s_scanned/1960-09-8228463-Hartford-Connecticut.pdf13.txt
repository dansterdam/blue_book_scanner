Preliminary Analysis and Certain Historical Details Relating
to Object which fell at Hartford, Connecticut
Child, Sudden-bright Branch

The following historical summary is by Dr. John T. Wessen,
who interviewed at length with the principal witnesses.

On the night of 4 September 1960, a lady residing in Hartford, "Connecticut, reported seeing a "bright light moving rapidly across the sky, followed by a "blinding flash" and a "hissing noise". Upon looking toward the door, she observed an"object" hovering about 20 feet from the ground near the side of the house. The object attempted to go out the door to investigate, but was driven back by the sound of a motor. 

Another lady, living on the second floor of the apartment house, heard the commotion and looked out her window and saw "glowing embers" on the ground at the site of the disturbance.

At the same time, Mrs. a cafe four houses away, was standing in the kitchen and observing through a window the proceedings going on in the yard. Her attention was caught by a "glowing ember" descending through the air, which she believe d to be a "falling star". However, it was apparently too close to the ground. Mrs. attention was then caught by a noise in the kitchen, her attention drawn to a motion near the stove. There she saw what she described as a "small creature" standing near the stove. This "creature" soon vanished, and Mrs. stated that she apparently did not follow the "object" with her eyes until it left the kitchen.

Back at the apartment house, Mr. the superintendent, was called from his apartment on the second floor. Mr. eyes were drawn to a bright light on the ground, which he described as a "steady, cold, white light" about 2 feet in diameter. This light source then gradually diminished and went out. Mr. stated that a flashlight was the light source.
