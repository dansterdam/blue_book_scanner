August 30, 1964

Dear Mr. -----,

This is in response to your recent letter in which you reported observing an unidentified flying object on August 26, 1964.

As you observed, this observation was undoubtedly an aircraft. You described it as a bright light in the sky which moved rapidly. This is a common observation of aircraft.

While we appreciate your reporting this observation, the Air Force has concluded that the above explanation will most likely account for the sighting.

Sincerely,

M. H. JACOBI
