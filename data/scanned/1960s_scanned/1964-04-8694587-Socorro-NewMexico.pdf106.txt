There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document containing text only.

The text from the document is as follows:

Would you be kind enough to send about ten blank forms to Mr. Ted Raynor, Editor, Socorro El Defensor Chieftain, Socorro, New Mexico, and he can send one of these forms to Mrs. Williams to fill out. The results will be, probably, a meteor. I tried to get in touch with her the next day, but she seemed to be at some sewing circle.

March 9 issue has a story "Film Studies Focus Cooperation Here in Film on UFO's". The letter received from Mr. Michael Mistratta, letter sent to Mayor Holm O. Burgan, stated, "Phenomena 7-7 is now completed. It will be viewed by countless millions of people throughout the world. It will open the door to facts heretofore shrouded in secrecy. It will prepare the entire human race for a better knowledge of the universe and possible neighbors who may have been observing our earth for centuries."

Finally, the March 11, Thursday, issue has a short article on "Zamora Saw a UFO, Not Flying Saucer." This was in response to a request by Zamora to please say in the paper that he never saw a flying saucer land, only a UFO. In part the article states, "Zamora says he was trying to cooperate with persons who asked him about the UFO, which he described as egg-shaped, and he wishes that they would not ask him about a flying saucer which he says he has never seen and cannot describe."
