DEAR ----,
THIS REPLIES TO YOUR RECENT LETTER IN WHICH YOU QUESTIONED (UFO) SIGHTINGS.  
IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE YOUR OBSERVATIONS AS LITTLE DETAIL IS PROVIDED. I HAVE ENCLOSED UFO FORM FOR YOUR USE IN REPORTING FUTURE SIGHTINGS. HOWEVER, I HAVE INCLUDED SOME GENERAL COMMENTS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH NECESSARY INFORMATION.
I HOPE THIS INFORMATION WILL BE HELPFUL AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED INTEREST IN THIS SUBJECT.
SINCERELY,
GEORGE M. FREEMAN, JR.
