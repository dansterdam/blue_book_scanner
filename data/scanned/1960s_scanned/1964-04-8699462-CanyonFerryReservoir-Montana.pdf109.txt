Dear Dr. Hynek:

I have been corresponding with a psychiatrist who is very interested in the sighting of a UFO at Socorro's New Mexico. This man asked me not to get additional information from you of the newspaper report quoting you as saying that the story is without merit. He simply feels that I should continue to keep the matter confidential. 

As I understand it, the psychiatrist who obviously was interested in the report said to beware of cover-up. (As I understand it, this psychiatrist would like to look into the matter further.)

I understand that you made the statement over television that there was no evidence that we were being visited by space ships from outer space. However, a person I know told me confidentially that this statement was not true, and that you were ordered to say Dec. 15, 1964, that it would be wrong to think that they come from saucers. (Sister Barbara Never-Press)

Dear 15, 1964, you would do me the greatest favor if you would confirm the statement in the press-release that this country has contact with superhumans and would be a disgrace to cover the UFO sighting. 

Sincerely,
