Transcribing the text from the document:

DID THE PHENOMENA
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
HOVER OR IS PARTS AND SCALLOP?
CHANGE OF COLOR:
GIVE OFF SMOKE OR DUST?
MAKE A NOISE?
CHANGE SHAPE?
LAST OR DISAPPEAR? 
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
FALL A STRAIGHT OR CURVE COURSE?
WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENA?

Asked me to 
look at it

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
It went out of range for our binoculars

B. DID THE PHENOMENA MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
