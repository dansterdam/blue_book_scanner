Visual                    A bright, metallic-colored object came out of the north and came straight down and got larger as it got closer. Appeared to be disk-shaped and the size of a jet. The object hovered and then made a 90 degree turn and flew off to the northwest. On one occasion the witness saw a faint red light around the object. The air base has received such reports but could not identify the object. According to the witness, an aircraft took off from the nearby Lambert airport at 1355 hrs and the object seemed to be attracted to the aircraft. The air base could not identify the object.
