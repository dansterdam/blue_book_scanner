Transcription of the text:

I called my next door neighbor who is a former officer in the army and he stated that he had observed the object along with several other neighbors. The object appeared to be circular in shape, about 40-50 feet in diameter, and was hovering at an altitude of about 500 feet over the residential area. It was a bright white light and seemed to have a slight bluish hue to it. The object made no sound and appeared to be motionless. After about 10 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. My neighbor and several other witnesses stated that they were amazed at the speed and maneuverability of the object, as it seemed to defy the laws of physics. I have reported this incident to the local authorities and to the Air Force, but have not received any response or explanation for what we observed. I am at a loss to explain what this object was, but I can assure you that it was no conventional aircraft. I am convinced that we witnessed some type of advanced, unidentified aerial vehicle.
