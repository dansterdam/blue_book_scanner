The text of the letter is as follows:

June 4, 1953

Mr. Mr. ----

Though no firm evaluation can be made due to the absence of the exact date of your sighting, your description indicates that the object was probably a satellite. The wavering motion is attributed to atmospheric conditions.

Your interest in Air Force matters is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM J. LOOCKADOO
Lt. Colonel, USAF Division
Office of Information

Mr. Hill ROAD
Cato, New York
