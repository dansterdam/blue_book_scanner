There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire with various questions about the observed UFO object and its behavior.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? BEHIND TREES GOING 40?

15. Did the object move behind something or any cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound RJ WHITE
b. Color WHITE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and measure how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc, and especially about trail or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
