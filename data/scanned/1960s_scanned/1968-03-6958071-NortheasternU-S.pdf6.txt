The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

17. DID YOU OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON THROUGH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING? (INCLUDE INFORMATION ON MODEL, TYPE, ETC. EYE GLASSES----11 1/2 SUNGLASSES----CAMERA VIEWER----BINOCULARS----7 x 35 TELESCOPE----THEODOLITE----OTHER OPTICAL DEVICE----A. DID YOU ORDINARILY WEAR GLASSES?(YES) (NO) B. WHAT WAS THE WEATHER CONDITION AT THE TIME OF THE PHENOMENON? GIVE ESTIMATE OF VISIBILITY IN MILES.
20. DESCRIBE ANY SECONDARY EFFECTS YOU OBSERVED ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHENOMENON, SUCH AS ELECTRICAL OR MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES, ANIMAL REACTIONS, ETC. DESCRIBE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PHENOMENON OBSERVED AND SOMETHING FAMILIAR.

THIS LOOKS LIKE A CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT OF A DULL GREY COLOR WHICH HOVERED MOTIONLESS FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES THEN MOVED OFF RAPIDLY TO THE WEST AT HIGH SPEED. IT WAS ABOUT 350 FEET IN LENGTH AND ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 2 OR 3 MILES DISTANT. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION AND NO SOUND WAS HEARD.

21. DID YOU NOTICE ANY ODOR, NOISE, OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, ANIMALS OR VEGETATION IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA? DESCRIBE.

NO UNUSUAL ODORS, NOISES OR HEAT WERE OBSERVED. MY DOG A COLLIE TYPE DID NOT SEEM DISTURBED BY THE OBJECT. THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE OBSERVABLE EFFECTS ON VEGETATION.

A. DID THE PHENOMENON DISTURB THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? (YES) (NO).

THE ONLY PHYSICAL CHANGE WAS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT.
