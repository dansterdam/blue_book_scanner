EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH, LOUISIANA, FLYING SAUCERS (8-4507)
FLYING SAUCERS, WRITER - ASSOCIATED PRESS, WRITER
NEW YORK, JULY 29, CAPE SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE SEEING STRANGE OBJECTS AND BEINGS. COMMENT FROM ANTARCTICA TO ENGLAND COME REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECTS. DURING THE PAST 20 YEARS NUMEROUS SIGHTINGS HAVE BEEN REPORTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, BUT THESE SIGHTINGS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED.
WHAT AT LEAST FIVE SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, BUT THESE SIGHTINGS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED.
WHAT A. RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA, MARYLAND TURNED OUT TO BE A RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA.
WHAT IS BEING CALLED ABOUT 6,000 SIMILAR REPORTS WHICH HAVE LOOKED INTO BY THE AIR FORCE AND ONLY 647 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED,AND MOST OF THESE ARE FAIRLY CLOSE OBSERVATIONS THAT SHOW SOMETHING WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ITS INVESTIGATORS. THEY CAN'T BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BY AIR FORCE SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS.
MOST OF THESE RECENT SIGHTINGS COULD BE EXPLAINED. AND MAY BE INFORMATION WAS MADE AVAILABLE.
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THE OBJECTS CAME FROM SPACE. SIMILAR SIGHTINGS WERE CAUSED BY ORDINARY OBJECTS IN THE SKY, BUT CANNOT BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE OF LACK OF SUFFICIENT OBSERVATION, ACCORDING TO MAJOR KEYHOE, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE FOR AERIAL PHENOMENA IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE KNOWN SOME ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC OR MILITARY DEVICES OPERATED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY EXISTED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT HAS A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY THAN WE COULD HAVE KNOWN THEM BEFORE. IT APPEARED IN EUROPE JULY 7, 1954, SHE WAS VERY FRIGHTENING," SAID MRS. DORA KOFLOK, WHO, WITH HER DAUGHTER, OBSERVED A LARGE FOOTBALL-SHAPED OBJECT NEAR THEIR SOUTHERN SKY NEAR WARRENTON, VA. 
"THAT SAME NIGHT IN VALENSOLE, FRANCE, MAURICE MASSE SAID HE SAW A DISC-SHAPED OBJECT DESCEND AND TAKE OFF AT HIGH SPEED.
WHEN SOME AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS WERE STUDIED, A LARGE FOOTBALL-SHAPED CHANGE TOOK PLACE, SAID THE ARGENTINE NAVY, REPORTED BY THE ANTARCTIC NEWSPAPER A SHORT TIME LATER.
THESE HAPPENED WITHOUT AFFECTING ANY KNOWN PHYSICAL LAWS, AND CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY ANY ORDINARY MEASURING TECHNIQUE. 
WE SUGGEST THE VILLA DO PORTO WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES SAID A GLOWING 
OBJECTS HOVERED OVER THE ISLANDS AND THAT GLOWING OBJECT STAYED AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND OTHERS APPARENTLY ON THE SEE THAT IT REMAINED VISIBLE FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIR FORCE PLANE WAS SENT TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION.
ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT WEYMOUTH, MASS. SHE SAW A ROUND LIGHT LIKE A STAR, EXCEPT IT KEPT MOVING AND OCCASIONALLY FLASHING BLINKING. IT SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE.
