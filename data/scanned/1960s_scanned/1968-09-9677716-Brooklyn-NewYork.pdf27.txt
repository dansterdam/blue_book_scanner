Observation of Object - Sept. 7, 1968
Time: 10:45 to 10:47 PM, Eastern Daylight Time 
Location: In vertical line below the moon, about 2/3 of the way up to the moon.
First, a yellow ball, stationary, like a bright star. After running upstairs, object, about the same place, was larger, rectangular. It then separated into 3 or 4 parallel yellow lines. Portions dropped off and one nearly reached the ground before disappearing. Other portions fell and extinguished. Finally the source disappeared, then reappeared as a fainter light for one or two seconds. Then it disappeared again.
