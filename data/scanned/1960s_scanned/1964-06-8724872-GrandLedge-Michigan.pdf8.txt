6-8-64 Grimstead
A man by name Grimstead about 65 years old observed the object in the sky on the night of 5-27-64 from approximately 7:00 PM until 7:15 PM. He described the object as round or circular in shape, approximately 15-20 feet in diameter, glowing with a reddish-orange color. It appeared to be hovering in the sky and at times seemed to oscillate or wobble slightly from side to side. It then accelerated at a very rapid rate and disappeared from sight in a southerly direction.
