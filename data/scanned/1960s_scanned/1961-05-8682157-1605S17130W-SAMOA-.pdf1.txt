10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Bright white obj with tail, object was low to horizon and moving at high speed, seeming accelerate and decelerate. After 2-3 minutes, object disappeared over horizon.
11. COMMENTS Space track paper shows no satellites in find at time of sighting. The light could have been a meteor, but the steady course and deceleration/acceleration rule out this possibility. It is feasible that this was an aircraft, but the number of military and civilian air traffic over Pacific Ocean at time is not feasible.
