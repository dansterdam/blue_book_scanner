FROM: PROJECT BLUE BOOK
1969 JULY 6—781985—DENVER, COLORADO
ATTN: CAPT H. C. JENSEN THIS IS IN ANSWER TO YOUR LETTER DATED 
APRIL 27 REQUESTING INFORMATION.
MR. JOHN DOE, 
ATTORNEY AT LAW
615 WEST 58TH STREET
DENVER COLORADO 80216
DEAR MR. DOE:
THIS LETTER IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF YOUR LETTER DATED APRIL 23, 1969 
CONCERNING THE SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT THAT OCCURRED ON 
JULY 6, 1969 IN DENVER, COLORADO.
PROJECT BLUE BOOK HAS CAREFULLY REVIEWED THE DETAILS OF THIS SIGHTING AND
HAS DETERMINED THAT IT FALLS WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF "INADEQUATE 
INFORMATION". THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA AVAILABLE TO PERMIT 
A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED.
WHILE WE REGRET THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A MORE DEFINITIVE ANALYSIS, 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LACK OF COMPLETE INFORMATION IS A COMMON
OCCURRENCE IN MANY UFO REPORTS. UNLESS EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS ARE 
SUPPLEMENTED BY TANGIBLE EVIDENCE SUCH AS PHYSICAL TRACES, PHOTOGRAPHS, OR
RADAR DATA, IT IS OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRIVE AT A FIRM CONCLUSION.
IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT COULD ASSIST IN THE EVALUATION
OF THIS SIGHTING, PLEASE FORWARD IT TO THIS OFFICE AT YOUR EARLIEST 
CONVENIENCE.
SINCERELY,
CAPT. H. C. JENSEN
