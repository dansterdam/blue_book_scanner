"I was standing in my yard studying the North Vest and observed a bright orange object, which I thought ves a plane. As it came nearer, it appeared as a cigar-shaped object about 2 minutes. The body was a single unit and there were no wings or tail. This was around 2115 hours on the 25th of February."
