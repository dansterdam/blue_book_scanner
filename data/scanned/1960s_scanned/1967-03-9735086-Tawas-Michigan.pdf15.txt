The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, describing an incident where a witness observed a "flying boxcar" air cargo plane that had just taken off from a nearby airport and was photographed for comparison. The report provides details about the sighting, including the time, location, and duration of the helicopter flight that was observed in the area. The report also describes the investigator's analysis of the films viewed, including observations about the appearance and movement of the object depicted, as well as the techniques that may have been used to enhance the image.

later that he had been out of film.

After the sighting, Fisher saw a "flying boxcar" air cargo plane which had just taken off from a nearby airport, and photographed it, too (he thought) for comparison. This was reported in newspapers as having sighted a UFO (the size of a "boxcar").

The sighting was from 1:31 to 1:43 p.m.; a helicopter flight was known to be in the area of the sighting, but it departed at 1100 and returned at 1250, thus being out of the area 40 minutes before the sighting.

The investigator viewed the films both at normal rate and at five frames per second a number of times. The sequence was in three parts, separated by windings of the camera, so that the appearance of the object changes abruptly twice, once with a pronounced streak. As the film progresses the object becomes smaller and fainter, showing less contrast with the background. In the first segment the object is large enough on the projection screen to show some detail.

The basic form is a horizontally elongated oval area of white against the blue of the sky. The image shows pronounced image breakup of the type often seen in astronomical images; the shape changes erratically as if being seen through a layer of water with random ripples coming by. There are two highlights, side by side, visible in many of the initial frames, with a surrounding and joining area of light color.

There are many frames in the initial section in which the object is in the same orientation and has the same size; therefore it seems possible to employ a multiple overprinting technique often used in astronomical planetary photography to improve the image. By carefully...
