Warning out for an area about 15 miles to the west; a funnel cloud had been reported.

Immediately after the sighting, according to the account, one witness went to several neighbors' houses to find out if they had seen or heard anything. One neighbor said she had heard something, but thought it was a flock of geese; her mother heard something, too, but thought the children had the television on. Another neighbor said she heard nothing, but the television set was on and the children were making noise.

called the county sheriff's office, and within 15 minutes or so, Lester Rawlings, Jr. was dispatched to the home. Rawlings and he talked with the family for about an hour, trying to convince them that they hadn't seen anything, and came away convinced that they certainly had observed something. He ascertained, however, that the exact time of the sighting, after patrol car 402 had been on the highway one-half mile north of the home, with its "yelp" siren on. These electronic sirens make a sound that is very high-pitched, loud, and that wavers rapidly in pitch and loudness. He feels that this siren accounts adequately for the sound that the family heard.

Investigators knew of this possibility when they went to see the family, and when they had arranged for the county police to have a car go to the appropriate spot at 2:15 P.M. (the interview was set for 2:00 P.M.) and arrive at the scene. At 2:20 P.M., the investigators and the male witness went to the railroad tracks where the boys had been, while the daughter and mother remained at the house. No sound was heard at the house.
