Dear Sir:

Please permit me to divert your attention from a busy schedule, for a few moments, to submit the following "sighting" report. I will keep this as brief as possible and hope you will contact me at my place of residence, as listed above, so that we may discuss this matter further.

The observation took place Monday, September twenty-eighth, at approximately 5:30 P.M. central daylight time. The witness, Mr. -- -- -- ---, who resides at Soudan, Minnesota, observed what appeared to be an unusual object in the sky. There was no wind, and the object was perfectly motionless. The object was shaped like two saucers placed face to face, and it was approximately fifty to sixty feet in diameter. There was a lighted, circular area on the upper surface, which is best described as a "glowing" light. This light appeared to pulse or throb at irregular intervals of from thirty to sixty seconds.

My first impression of the sighting was that it was an "echo" pattern of some sort, such as might be encountered on the scope of a radar set. However, after watching the object for several minutes, I became convinced that this was not the case, as there was no corresponding movement of the object, nor was there any indication of rotation or vibration.

The color of the object was a dull, metallic gray, and it appeared to be suspended in the air at an approximate altitude of one thousand feet. After observing the object for about ten minutes, it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from view.

Sincerely,
