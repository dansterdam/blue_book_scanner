The image contains a hand-drawn diagram with annotations. The diagram appears to depict the movement and trajectory of an unidentified object, possibly a UFO. It includes annotations such as "27 inches - object", "object - star", "object travel as much as 6 inches in cone", and arrows showing the path of the object.

At the arrival of the object, it moved slowly and silently toward the observer, and a part of the moon was not seen.
