WHITE COUNTY PRESS Wednesday 5 August 1959

THEN SUDDENLY, I REMEMBER SEEING THIS LITTLE GREEN OBJECT THAT LOOKED SO STRANGE.

When I said that I did not realize the exciting experience that had occurred, the object would shoot up. 

When I'd slowed down it almost down. My car is built for speeding and can do 120 miles an hour and it
was almost down. 

At first it was on the south side of the road and then it crossed over to the north side. The little green object
would dart back and forth and hover and was attacking my car. 

When we reached my girl's house her sister, Geraldine, said: "Did you see that thing?" And she said it looked
like a flying saucer.

Finally, I had to be home as I made a run for the car. That's when the fun really began.

In closing, as I pulled away from the house the object began to follow me. I had to really press the gas down
to make the car go. The object kept up with me, however, it seemed to stay about 100 feet behind me. I would
stomp the full on the gravel road in an effort to lose it but it stayed right with me. I would never have been able
to shake the object. It followed me all the way home.

IT CAME WITHIN 100 FEET OF ME, said Ronnie Austin, 18, of Carmi, who described his fright after seeing the strange
object in a drive-in movie.

BOY TELLS WHAT HAPPENED

Ronnie Austin, 18, of Carmi, gives the Press the following account of his strange experience with a flying object:

When Phyllis and I went out to the drive-in movie. We saw the show and were coming home about 1 a.m. As we neared the town, I noticed a strange little green object in the sky. It seemed to be following my car.

Phyllis looked out and replied: "No, it's not an airplane, it doesn't have the flashing red and green lights."
