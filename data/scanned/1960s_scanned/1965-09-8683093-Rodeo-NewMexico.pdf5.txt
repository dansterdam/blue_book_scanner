January 13, 1966

Dear Major:

This is to report to you the result of my visit to Holloman Air Force Base at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and on my visit to Deming, New Mexico to interview Mr. and Mrs. 0 who made a report from Deming, New Mexico on 22 September 1965, on a sighting which is currently classified as "unidentified". I was authorized to make the Holloman trip but the Deming, New Mexico trip occurred to me after I got to New Mexico. It turned out that I had to go later than I had hoped while I was there in order to interview the two witnesses concerned. I informed you of my intention to visit Deming by phone from New Mexico, as you will remember.

Gr
