STATEMENT REGARDING SIGHTING OF A FLYING OBJECT ON FEBRUARY 25, 1967

At 21:03 (CST) on the night of February 25, 1967 I sighted from the window of room 355 of the East Chemistry Addition on the University of Illinois campus in Urbana, Illinois what I believed to be an unusual flying object. When this object was first observed it appeared in the eastern sky as a single ball of yellow light moving east at a low rate of speed. The object seemed to be approximately 45 degrees above the western horizon when initially sighted. No compass was on hand so that orientation street in Urbana, Illinois was used as a reference, assuming that this street is a true east-west line (said street is visible from the window mentioned above). No accurate measure of the object's altitude could be made. Qualitatively, it seemed that the object was approximately 1,000 feet above the ground if it were assumed to have the size of a very small single engine aircraft. After making written notes of these features I summoned another employee from my laboratory and together we observed the object until it had progressed so far toward us that it could no longer be viewed from the above mentioned window.

At this point I ran to the street below (Matthews street entrance to a parking lot behind the Chemistry Annex) and was accompanied by another employee. We sighted the object again and noted that no aircraft lights (i.e. no red, green, or white lights) were visible, that no sound was emitted by the object, and that there was no definite structure associated with the yellow ball of light. It appeared to me at that time that the object was slowly turning to a heading of northeast. No change in altitude was noticed and the object maintained its very smooth, slow movement across the sky. The yellow light clearly fluctuated in intensity.
