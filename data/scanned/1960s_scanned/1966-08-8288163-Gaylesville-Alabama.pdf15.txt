The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but there is no photograph present. The sketch includes various annotations and descriptions, such as:

"This picture was drawn by me in the office of the District Commander Air Force, whose permission to reproduce it is requested."
"The sighting is reported to the US Air Force on 22 Aug 1966."
"Overhead view (looking up from ground)"
"Approx 300 yds"

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

-time of first sighting.
