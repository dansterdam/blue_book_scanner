The entire sighting lasted about 1/2 hour. Based on past experience in observing aircraft of all sorts I do not believe this object to be a conventional aircraft. It did not have the outline or projected illumination of any military or commercial aircraft I have seen. The speed of angular movement across the sky was definitely greater than any aircraft I have observed. Its trajectory was essentially from west to east. but did not follow a simple straight line path but rather an erratic course with sudden changes in direction and velocity. The illumination appeared as a steady glow not at all like flashing lights of aircraft. The entire sighting was observed from my home located at 5201 Derry Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19124."
