Essentially there are three incidents, the pale green to begin with, then the bright light that came at you from Ocala, and then the Miami-Palm Beach incident. In this whole thing, which all told must have last lasted, what nearly at hour?

Let's see. Yes, a little over an hour, I guess.

What impressed of the whole, total incident, what things stand out more in your mind now?

Well, mostly the obvious near collision. This was--all the rest of it you know. I could, I don't believe I would have even mentioned the rest of it if we hadn't had that one thing.

And the frightening thing waswhat it was not on Jacksonville, or no one else 'had it on radar. 

Well, I can accept this, because I know of too many cases where radar has been scrambled, even by our own devices.

Now, I don't feel that I will get anything more additional if I call Mr. Rushing...

Mr. I can assure you, you wouldn't.

because I fed, just from his remarks in the transcribed tape. I, when he mentioned he was ready to meet the Lord, I felt that he probably would be a little less than objective. I'd like to ask just for my own curiosity and not for the record at all, but you fly quite a bit, and obviously talk with other pilots. Have you ever had any stories like this, or UFO-type reports from other pilots when you talk among yourselves?

No, very...I don't ever remember another one from another pilot. I've talked to a number of people, maybe a half a dozen, who have obviously had UFO sightings of various kinds, but you never know, but most of these...
