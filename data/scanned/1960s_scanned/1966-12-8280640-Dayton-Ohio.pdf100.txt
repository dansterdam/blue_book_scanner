There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a sketch and instructions for the observer.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass at the point where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass at the point where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
