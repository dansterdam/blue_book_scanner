SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYQJG OB'J'EC'I' Donald estimated to be two or three hundred feet off the ground. The object was extremely brilliant, almost blinding to look at. It appeared to be round or elliptical in shape and seemed to be glowing, emitting a very bright light. The witness declared that his eyes were actually dazzled by the brilliance of the object.

The object seemed to be moving rather slowly, much slower than a jet airplane would travel. After making one pass the object then seemed to maintain a stationary position for a period of approximately five minutes. The witness declared that the object appeared to stop and remained motionless as he watched it. During the entire sighting, the object appeared to be giving off a brilliant bluishwhite light.

Donald estimated the size to be two or three hundred feet in diameter. He said that the object seemed to be about three quarters of a mile from where he was standing. It was then that he noticed that the object seemed to be rocking or oscillating back and forth.

Finally, the object began moving again, gaining speed until it disappeared completely from view in a northerly direction. The entire sighting lasted approximately fifteen minutes.

The sound which accompanied the object was very low, almost a hum, very slight, and could be described as a pulsating sound. The witness stated that he could not detect any exhaust or jet-like sounds.

According to the witness, the ground around the area where the object was seen was illuminated in a bluish tint. This bluish illumination extended for some distance on the ground and the witness stated that the illumination was so bright that one could easily have read a newspaper by it.

The witness was very close to the object and could observe it clearly. He stated that the object appeared to be structured, giving the impression of being composed of several layers or sections. Donald was quite certain that what he saw was definitely an unidentified flying object and not an airplane, satellite, or any other known type of aircraft.
