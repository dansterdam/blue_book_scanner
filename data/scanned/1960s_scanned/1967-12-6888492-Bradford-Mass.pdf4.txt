The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an old document with a list of "Photographic Data" items, which includes the type and make of camera, type and focal length of lens, brand and type of film, shutter speed used, lens opening used, filters used, whether a tripod or solid stand was used, whether "panning" was used, the exact direction the camera was pointing, and estimated distance from observer to object.
