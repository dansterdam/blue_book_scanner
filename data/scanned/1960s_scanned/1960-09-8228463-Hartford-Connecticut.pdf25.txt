TASK ACTIVITY REPORT (Page 2)
PART NO. 13-32102
TASK: 9 (cont.)

1. On 3 December 1959 a meeting was held in the office of 3/Gen Le Ballly. Present at the meeting were the following:
3/Gen Le Ballly, SAFOI 
Col Hall, ATIC
Lt Col Metzger, ATIC 
Dr. J. A. Hynek, ATIC Consultant

At this meeting the problem concerning the requirements of the ad hoc committee were discussed. Col Hall outlined in detail the instructions necessary to implement the UFO project at ATIC with the requirements spelled out by the ad hoc committee.

Wednesday, 7 December 1950: 
Lt Col Fry, USAF, presented a radio program (Broadcast Time 12.30-1.00 CST), "The Air Force Story", which was concerned with the Air Force's investigation of UFO's. This program had been coordinated with Col Odarenko and had no direct bearing on the ad hoc committee's requirements.

Captain Ruppelt gave an interview to Bates Lowery, Newsweek Magazine, concerning the Air Force's investigation of UFO's. This interview had been coordinated with Col Odarenko and Capt Ruppelt was instructed not to discuss details beyond those already made public.

J. A. Hynek contacted Capt. Ruppelt at Wright-Patterson requesting information on the "Minnesota Farmer" case. Commander Liken, ATIC, was also interested in this case. This was apparently an observation reported to ATIC via Project Blue Book channels.
