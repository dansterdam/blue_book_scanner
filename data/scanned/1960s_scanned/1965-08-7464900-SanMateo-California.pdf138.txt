R... .- : think all thin; ; Iopuoned so lon-. .Epo didn't want to send it to .mUi'T I don't want my husband or others to know about my sending this report in.

If you want more information, use my full name (no UFO initials or envelope) and send me some IRE report forms to make it easier.

I have a small boy almost who witnessed this. And I don't have the time or the money to make this into my project activities...

I have one more report - not work is complete (book review 4500) This one is short a-book relight and I was Seen to find out eventually it was reported by a woman in Australia in some or Two magazine a year or two ago.

"So I don't see anything else for years this is too much work....

After putting all this stuff down I sympathize with you too.

Sincerely
