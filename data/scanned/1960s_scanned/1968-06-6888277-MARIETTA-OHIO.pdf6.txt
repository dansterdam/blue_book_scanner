The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass rose that appears to be used to indicate the direction of a UFO sighting. The smaller sketches depict a person standing in a landscape, likely intended to illustrate the perspective of the observer during the UFO sighting.

Now, as an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

19. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO SHOW THE APPARENT DIRECTION OF MOTION. THE LARGER SKETCH SHOULD BE USED TO ILLUSTRATE AND EXPLAIN THE SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PORTION OF THE REPORT.
