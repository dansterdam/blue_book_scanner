2 Hocking Countians Among Heavens
Sighting Big Fireball In Sky Over
A big fireball or meteorite was scene hike last night in parts of Ohio, and at least two Hocking Countians were among those who saw it.
Most of the sightings were in Hocking County, where hundreds of persons reported seeing the phenomenon and area newspapers received hundreds of telephone calls about it.
The fireball was sitting outdoors at 11:55 p.m. when he heard a sizzling or whistling sound and observed what appeared to be about 20 or 30 feet long. He said it was orange or reddish-orange in color and appeared to be dropping down slowly to a point with a white light at the narrow end. Several of those who saw it said it looked similar to a large sparkler and flashed out.
Donald Schultz, city fireman, was returning from Columbus where he had attended a fire school. He said he saw the big fireball near Lancaster at about the same time. Two other people in his car with him also saw it. He described it as brighter than Venus and shooting across the sky. Witnesses from northern Oho and Indiana reported seeing similar objects at approximately the same time. The Hocking County sightings were reported in a dispatch to the United Press International.
