Peoria AFB, Illinois

Sir:

In accordance with your request I enclose one (1) copy of my description of a sighting of an unidentified flying object which I reported on February 25, 1967. I believe that you will find that this is essentially the same as that transmitted to you by telephone on February 27, 1967.

This information is submitted to the United States Air Force with the understanding that the information will remain confidential. I also need to point out that the opinion expressed is not in any way official; they are personal opinions of an individual. I believe that you will find that the conclusions drawn by the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of the University of Illinois are tentative and based upon limited data. We have voluntarily submitted this report to a government agency as a private citizen and not officially as representatives of the University of Illinois.

I hope that my observations will be of use to you. In the event that I may be of further service in this connection please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]
Engineering
