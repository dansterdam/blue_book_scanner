TIME OF SIGHTING: NONE
J. RADS SCHEDULED FROM PEORIA ILLINOIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
000OZ. TRUE BEARING 280 DEGREES, 70 NM.
K- CHIEF, BASE TRAINING DIVISION. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE ACTUAL SIGHTING TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 000Z AND 0015Z. INTERVIEWS WITH OBSERVERS 1,3, AND 4 WERE ALL "FAT" AND APPEARED TO ME SOMEWHAT REHEARSED. OBSERVER 2 WAS ON K-P. AND DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO "REHEARSE" HIS ANSWERS.
