When observed through a spotting telescope (zoom approximately 20X), the object appeared to be round, very bright, and about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length. It remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly disappeared. A noise like that of a jet aircraft was heard nearly simultaneously with the object's disappearance.

The object was first observed at 2256 MST on 1961-03-31 by XXXX XXXXX, a geophysicist employed by The XXXXX Corporation, while driving alone on a road near EUREKA, Utah, in the ROCKY MOUNTAIN area. XXXXX stated that he was looking for an aircraft after being alerted by a radio report of a bright light in the area. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes and 15 seconds.

XXXXX described the object as round, approximately the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length, and very bright - almost blinding to look at directly. It appeared to be hovering stationary approximately 2000 yards distant and at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet. No details of the object's surface could be discerned.

Shortly after the object disappeared, a sound like that of a jet aircraft was heard. XXXXX stated that the sound appeared to originate from the area where the object had been observed.

XXXXX is considered a reliable and competent observer. He is a professional scientist who has had considerable experience in the observation and identification of various types of aircraft. He stated that the object was definitely not an aircraft, satellite, or other known aerial object.
