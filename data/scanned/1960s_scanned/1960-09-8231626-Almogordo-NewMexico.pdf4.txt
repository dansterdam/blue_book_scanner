TEXT OUTPUT:

IN THE FOREGROUND DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE 
FROM A MANEUVERING VEHICLE. ALTHOUGH IN MOST CASES THE OBSERVERS 
WERE CONVINCED THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY CLOSE, IT IS THE OPINION OF 
THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER THAT THE OBJECT WAS AT A SUBSTANTIALLY
GREATER DISTANCE FROM THE OBSERVERS THAN THEY SUSPECTED... AND 
THEREFORE AT A GREATER ALTITUDE AND TRAVELING AT A GREATER SPEED.
THIS IS INDICATED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTS: WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THOSE
OBSERVERS PERSONALLY INTERVIEWED ON THE EXACT LOCATION OF THEIR 
OBSERVATIONS, POINTED IN THE DIRECTION AT WHICH THEY FIRST OBSERVED
THE OBJECT AND IT WAS 10 TO 15 DEGREES TO THE LEFT OF THE NORTH
STAR. THE OBSERVERS INTERVIEWED WERE AT LOCATION OVER A SPAN OF
APPROXIMATELY 55 NAUTICAL MILES BETWEEN ALAMOGORDO AND LAS CRUCES
