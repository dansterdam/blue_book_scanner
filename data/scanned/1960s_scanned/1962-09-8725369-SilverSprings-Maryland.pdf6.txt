The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a handwritten document.

The text from the document is as follows:

The second sighting was at 1:42 in the night, which was an exceptionally clear night and the entire neighborhood was awakened by a strange light. The witness said it was round and bright, about twice the size of the full moon and hovered on the horizon for about 10 minutes. It then shot straight up and disappeared.
