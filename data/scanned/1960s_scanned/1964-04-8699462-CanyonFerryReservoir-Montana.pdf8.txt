Talks With "Martians" Over 2 1/2 Hours - Newark Valley Man Says
Whether or not there is any-thing to flying saucer stories, a new one has popped up that week and because its locale is in Newark Valley, the story is inter-esting. A Newark Valley farmer, Gary T. Wilson, says he was working in his field when he had a visitor.
On April 24, Gary T. Wilson, a Newark Valley farmer, says he was working in his field, when something "looking like a small spaceman" came from the ground near his tractor. Because there was a large refrigerator near the tractor, the reflection came from Gary thought nothing of it. But then the thing started moving around him. So up and close to, he saw that the glint came from an object about 18 by 15 feet long, 15 feet wide by four feet high. The thing seemed to be resting on a tripod type of device that was on the ground and near-by stood two human shaped forms about 4 feet high without necks and their extremities seemed to be enclosed in similar forms to that of the "ship they had seemingly arrived in," according to Mr. Wilson.
He reported to the Democrat reporter that the two held boxes of red and when he approached they turned to be gas tanks holding something believed to be the fuel.
When asked how he, Wilson, reacted, he said: "Without growing, they picked up a bag of fertilizer from the barn and carried it to the top of the small where the ship had been. The next morning the bag was gone."
When asked whether his views on the possibility of beings on other planets had changed since his strange meeting, Mr. Will said he had always believed in beings on Mars but I do know that I talked to two small men in a strange ship.
