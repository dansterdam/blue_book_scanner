The image appears to contain three sketches. The top sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and a curved line labeled "B", with an illustration of what appears to be an object or phenomenon in the sky. The middle sketch shows a landscape scene with a person standing on a road, and the bottom sketch shows a landscape with mountains or hills in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
