The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing only text.

"In view of the only existing OFFICIAL USAF GONTROLLED REVIEW, Vol 3, No 2, Apr 64

At a recent open meeting, National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), received a report that a flying object dropped a self-destructing device over a swamp area. The object was described as a glowing, round object with a projection underneath. The nearest people to the sight of the incident were notified and the object exploded shortly after. Remains and debris were not found. The information was obtained from a reliable source."
