THIS REPORT IS CLASSIFIED AS CONFIDENTIAL. THERE WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THE PILOTS TO "LOCK ON" EACH TIME. HOWEVER, NO VISUAL CONTACT WAS MADE. THE PILOTS STATED THAT THEIR OVERTAKE SPEED INDICATED A TARGET THAT WAS NEARLY STATIONARY, WEATHER BALLOONS RELEASED IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES WOULD HAVE BEEN BORNE BY THE WINDS ALOFT TO THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING. THE WIND VELOCITY WOULD HAVE PLACED THE 90292 RELIEF FROM LOCKHEED AFB, MAINE IN THE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING AT APPROXIMATELY 8530Z. ALTHOUGH PROGRAMMED TO REACH GREATER ALTITUDES, FAULTY INFLATION OR A SLIGHT LEAK COULD RESULT IN A BALLOON LEVELING AT 47,000 FEET. PART OF THE PREPARATION WITH THE PILOTS IS NORMALLY SENIOR CONTROLLED, GOOSE RADAR SECTOR DIRECTION CENTER. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO POSITIVELY DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF THE OBJECT. COMPARING ITS DIRECTION AND VELOCITY WITH THE WINDS, HOWEVER, WOULD CERTAINLY INDICATE IT TO BE A WIND-BORNE, LIGHTER-THAN-AIR OBJECT. THE COUPLED WITH THE TIMING LEADS ONE TO BELIEVE IT TO PROBABLY BE THE 90292 WEATHER BALLOON RELEASED FROM LOCKHEED AFB.
