Text extracted from the document:

School dean to frangolen philadelphia, Tuesday, July 14, 1964. A short one experience to tell. On the evening of this date the following incident occurred. At about 10:30 P.M. I was returning home from downtown lynn. As I crossed the lynnway bridge, I noticed an object hovering in the air, near the bridge and to the north. Initially I thought it was an airplane, but soon realized that it was not. It was a lighted object, distinct in outline, and stationary. I stopped my car and watched it for some time. It remained motionless and silent. After a few minutes, the object began to move slowly in a northerly direction, where it disappeared from my view. The object seemed to be about the size of a small airplane, but was much higher than any aircraft would normally be in that area. It had a distinct outline and was lighted, but I could not make out any details of its configuration. If this incident is of interest, I shall be glad to provide any further information that may be required.
