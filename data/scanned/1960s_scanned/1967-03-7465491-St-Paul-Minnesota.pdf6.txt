MINNEAPOLIS-ST PAUL INTL ARPT, MINNEAPOLIS, MINN 55417

17 April 1967

MEMO TO: DO

SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: DEPT/UFO (Lt Morley)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, Dayton, Ohio 45433

1. The enclosed report from the Minnesota Highway Patrol regarding an unidentified flying object is forwarded for your information and action. I have not contacted the witnesses but have investigated locally and determined a possible explanation for your observations. A check with the Minneapolis Naval Air Station has indicated that there were two USNS Stratotanker aircraft on 23 March 1967 that were conducting routine Air Force operations cn the same date and at approximately the same time that occurred in 1930L (0130Z) when the incident occurred. A time period of over 2 months has elapsed from the date of the incident to the present time and the witnesses are normally conducted throughout Minnesota. The area of observation is approximately 100 miles from the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The aircraft do not appear to have penetrated into the water, for no search or rescue purposes. The aircraft do not provide much closer than it actually was - especially at night, at low altitude opinion the antisubmarine aircraft provides the most reasonable explanation for the sightings which are generally consistent with major jet aircraft operations.

2. I indicated that you would send me a letter in acknowledgement of the receipt of this report and that I would also like an info copy of the response you provide to the Minnesota Highway Patrol. Chief Highway Officer Johnson, 1246 DPS-COURTS BLDG, New Highway Building, St. Paul, Minnesota 55101. Attn: Major Johnson.
