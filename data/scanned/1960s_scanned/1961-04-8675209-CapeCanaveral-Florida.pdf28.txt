PART I. FOR AFCIN MAJ GEN WALSH AND FOR RDY MAJ GEN WATSON
AT 1457 H 21 APR 61 AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED
ON RADAR IN THE VICINITY OF CAPE CANAVERAL PRIOR TO THE
LAUNCHING OF TEST NUMBER 1392, POLARIS MISSILE, SCHEDULED
T 14352. THREE EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS WATCHED THE TARGET
ON AN FPS-8 RADAR FOR 30 MINUTES AND ESTIMATED ITS SPEED AS
RANGING BETWEEN 150 AND 600 KNOTS. THESE OBSERVERS REPORTED
THAT THE OBJECT ORBITED 6 OR 7 TIMES ALONG AN AZIMUTH OF 135
DEGREES FROM CAPE CANAVERAL AND BETWEEN 10 AND 25 MILES FROM
THE CAPE. THE RANGE OBSERVERS' ESTIMATES OF THE HEIGHT OF THE
UFO DID NOT AGREE, REPORTING EITHER THE OBJECT WAS VERY LOW
OR VERY HIGH. A RANGE SURVEILLANCE C-54 WAS VECTORED TO WITHIN
2 1/2 MILES OF THE OBJECT BUT REPORTS FROM THE CREW WERE NEGATIVE.
THE RANGE C-54 IS EQUIPPED WITH AN APS-42 AND AN APS-39 RADARS
BUT UTILIZED ONLY THE APS-42 DURING THIS ATTEMPTED INTERCEPT.
