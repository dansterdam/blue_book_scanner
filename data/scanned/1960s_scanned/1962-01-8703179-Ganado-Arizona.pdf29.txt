The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and the instructions ask the viewer to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the observed object was above the horizon, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the viewer first saw it.

The second image contains two larger sketches. The first larger sketch shows a person walking down a road with trees and buildings in the background. The second larger sketch shows a person standing in a landscape with mountains in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
