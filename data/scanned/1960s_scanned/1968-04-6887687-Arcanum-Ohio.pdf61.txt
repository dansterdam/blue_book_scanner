SIGHTING ACCOUNT:
The witnesses say they were sitting on their porch and looked out the window. She saw a round object carrying a flashing red light on the underside of something passing about 1500 feet away (estimated). She called to her husband to come and look at it but he did not want to be disturbed. After a few minutes the object dropped straight down behind the trees very slowly. A minute later it descended straight up and hovered again.
