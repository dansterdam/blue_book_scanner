Dear Lt. Fritzmann,

I would like to report on the force investigation in reply to your request.

The two cases under investications, while having the threads of similarities, are still rather unclear. The threads of investigation are not yet complete, little is still to be desired in the absence of these facts in order to lead to any conclusions, This is primarily due to the necessity of confirmation of the examination, which are now in process.

There may be available additional information, which I have not been made cognizant of, I await your further directive in this matter.
