AUSTRALIA
Hallam, Australia
12 June 1964

"If went towards Melbourne, it travel from west to east, then straight up into the sky and vanished."

Hallam flying saucer, as an article in the Mountain District News called it, was seen by Mrs. S. Johnson and Mrs. E. Stephenson. Their account follows: "Our people from Berwick, South East of Melbourne, were in two separate parties, but saw the same thing. They were on their way to a Tupperware meeting near Berwick, and about 5.30 p.m. they were in two groups, but saw the same thing. 
"With Mrs. Johnson was her daughter and her son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Keith Sartori, when Mrs. Johnson called out, 'What's that?' They all looked and saw a light in the sky, some distance away, travelling from west to east. It appeared to be round and silvery in color and seemed to be about the size of a football. As they watched, it suddenly changed direction and shot straight up into the sky and disappeared from sight.
"Mrs. Stephenson and her daughter were about a quarter of a mile away, but they also saw the same object. They described it in much the same way - a silvery, round object, about the size of a football, travelling from west to east, then suddenly shooting straight up into the sky and vanishing.
"Neither group heard any noise from the object. Both parties said they had never seen anything like it before. They all agree that it was definitely not an aircraft, satellite, or any other known object in the sky."
