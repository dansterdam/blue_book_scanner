The image contains a sketch that appears to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The sketch shows a compass-like diagram with various angle markings, as well as an instruction to "Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an 'A' at the beginning of the path, a 'B' or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course."

As per the OCR instruction, here is the text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point marked with a "G" and the object you first saw is at the point marked with a "P". Trace the path of the object (whichever path you think it took) when you first saw it. Place a "G" on the compass where you first saw it. Then on "P" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
