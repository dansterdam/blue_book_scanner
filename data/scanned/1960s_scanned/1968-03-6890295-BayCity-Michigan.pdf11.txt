The handwritten text in the image says:
"It was a clear night, beautiful star-filled sky. The object seemed to move rather rapidly, first to the west then straight up vertically at a very high rate of speed, then it would stop and move again in any direction, it seemed to be under positive control. It was a bright white light, not like a star. It was the most remarkable thing I have ever seen. I wish I could explain just what it was, but I can't."
