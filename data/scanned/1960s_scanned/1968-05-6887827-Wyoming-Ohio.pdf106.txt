some danger, ran out of his bedroom; he nearly collided with her, since she was also leaving her bedroom. Together they ran to the garage at the east side of the house and out the back door onto a concrete patio.

- at a 60 degree elevation (indicating an angle quite close to 60 degrees) it was lit up so that the bright light was partly hidden, and he could see the circular outline of the body of the object, dark against the background of light. From the bottom there was what looked like a trailing wing protruding.

The object reached its maximum just after everyone went outside, becoming an already high-pitched scream that was so loud that Duberstein said he had to put his fingers in his ears. The object climbed on a course from north to south that brought it then directly overhead.

As it passed overhead, he then ran back into the garage and out the front (south) door; the object was then just a little south of overhead. This time it appeared as a circular patch of light, much higher.

It paused for a moment, and then, "In less than a second", moved rapidly to the south, disappearing as if the light had been turned off when the object was visible in a gap as a distant flash across the street to the south.

Reckoning the time-sequence on the basis of the taped interview, it would appear that the initial observation from the bedrooms took between 20 seconds; getting outside required about 10 seconds; the observation in the back yard lasted another 15 seconds, and getting to the front door another 15 seconds.
