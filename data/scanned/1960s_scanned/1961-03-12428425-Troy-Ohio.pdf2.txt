Dear Sir:

Last Friday I received a phone call from Dr. J. A. Hynek, Director, Astronomical Observatory, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. We have agreed upon the mutually satisfactory date of April 4th, the earlier date suitable to Dr. Hynek having already been fulfilled.

I earnestly want to convey to you my sincere thanks for your very excellent assistance in arranging for Dr. Hynek's appearance in Troy and, speaking for our entire rotary group, extend to you an invitation to visit us as our guest whenever you are in our area. In fact, if you could advise me before hand of your schedule, we would be most interested in hearing from you about your work or on any other subject of your reference. Should you be in the area on April 4th in particular, I would be most pleased to have you join us.

Thank you again for the discerning interest you have given to our request.

Sincerely yours,
THE GUMMED PRODUCTS COMPANY

H. L. HEISE
Research Director
