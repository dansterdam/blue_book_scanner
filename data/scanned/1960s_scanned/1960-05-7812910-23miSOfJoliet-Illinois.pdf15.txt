This image does not contain any photographs, it is a typed document that appears to be a report on an observation of the planet Jupiter. The text describes the physical characteristics of the observed object, including its circular shape with slight flattening, color, and other details. It also provides information about the angle of elevation and azimuth over a period of time. The report appears to be part of Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.
