THE "CASE" IN NEW JERSEY
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR JAMES G. AYDELOTTE, a resident of Glassboro, New Jersey, a town of 10,000, has in a research project covering the activities of UFOs, made a study of one case which occurred in his area on September 9, 1964 and which, because of its significance, is being reported herein.
The above is an abstractFROM AP UFO HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. to the Commanding General, USAF, Washington, D.C. pertaining to the case.
Glassboro, New Jersey, a town of 10,000, lies in a rural area, approximately 20 miles southeast of Philadelphia. On September 9, 1964, at about 10:15 pm, two young boys, aged 12 and 13, were in the backyard of their home, when they observed a strange light in the sky. This light, which was white and dome-shaped, was located approximately 100-150 feet above the trees and some 1,000 feet distant from their position. The object was hovering, and after observing it for some time, the two boys called their parents to observe the object also. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yoeli, came out and also watched the object for some time.
Mr. Yoeli reported that the object had a dome-shaped top and a metallic underside, and appeared to be luminous. It hovered for some time, then accelerated at a very high rate of speed, going straight up and out of sight. 
Investigators from the New Jersey State Police were dispatched to the scene, but were unable to locate the object or obtain any further evidence. The local newspapers at the time carried stories of the sighting, but no photographs were obtained.
At the request of the Air Force, a detailed report of the incident was prepared by the private investigator, James G. Aydelotte, and forwarded to Air Force Headquarters. The Air Force has officially classified the case as "Unidentified."
