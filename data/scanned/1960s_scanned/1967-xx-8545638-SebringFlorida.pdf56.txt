"This authorities check "fine" sighting.
Onset buzzed by Flying Saucer"

ONSET FLYING SAUCER as recorded from eye-witness reports. The object, which moved very slowly, was reported as being about the size of a telephone pole at a distance of approximately 2,000 feet. It was approximately 150 feet off the ground and traveled in a straight but erratic pattern. It had a metallic silver body and appeared to have portholes or windows. The object emitted a bright white light and changed color from white to red. The movement was slow and erratic with no discernible pattern of flight.
This sighting was investigated by the local police and was considered an authentic UFO sighting. The object was observed for a period of thirty minutes by several independent witnesses, some of whom were trained observers. Its existence and the details of the sighting were confirmed by the authorities.
