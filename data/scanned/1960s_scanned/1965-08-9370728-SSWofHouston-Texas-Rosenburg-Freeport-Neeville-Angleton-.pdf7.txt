2379 AB SQ, ELLINGTON AFB, TEXAS
west of these 6,000 to 10,000 feet no weather balloons were
released from local area. Investigation: Houston Museum of
Natural Science cannot offer any celestial explanation for
observation. Local AGC radar and Houston International Tower
radar reported no unusual sightings. Houston Tower radar reported
minor anonymous propagation indicating the presence of an inversion.
Remarks: This siting caused considerable interest by local news
media. Conclusion: Preliminary investigation failed to uncover
any facts substantiating the presence of an unknown object. There
is no question in my mind that something was seen; however, the
presence of inversion conditions, the fact that object remained
in one location for over an hour, and that similar sightings were
observed in other sections of the area cause me to suspect the
sightings were caused by surface lights being reflected off the
inversion layer.
