Gentlemen:

I am sending you this information about a report of an unidentified flying object. The sighting occurred in the vicinity of Springfield, Ohio on July 16, 1952.

I believe the details of this report may be of interest to you. I could not identify, from the details supplied, the exact nature of the object. The report states that it was metallic in appearance, made a whining sound and disappeared rapidly. It was observed for several minutes and seen by a number of people. 

I would appreciate any information you can provide that might help identify the nature of this object. I have tried to investigate this sighting thoroughly and when I first notified about it, I was under the impression that it might have been some sort of experimental aircraft. However, as it disappeared too rapidly to be an aircraft, I am unable to identify it.

Please let me know if you can provide any assistance or guidance in this matter. This is the only available information I have on this sighting. I hope that you will be able to shed some light on what it may have been. Thank you very much for your consideration.

Yours very truly,
