Dear Sir:
Enclosed is the negative to be checked out. The data on negative is as follows:
The picture was taken on Oct. 31st. at 5:30 P.M.
It was taken with a 2¼ x 3¼ Century Graphic on tripod at 
f 22 with an exposure time of three seconds. The film used was
ILFORD FP-3, a fine grain panchromatic film.
Three other shots were made of the same scene at same
location with slight change in the exposure time.
The other three negatives are closer of foreign objects.
Major, during our phone conversation I forgot to mention 
the fact that the strange objects on the film was not visible
to my eyes or no sound were heard at time of exposure.
Also, sir, I do not want this to be released to the news as
yet is in the process of being copyrighted.
I do hope that it will help you in some way in your work.
If this can be solved it will certainly be a relief to my mind.

P.S. The camera lens was also equipped with a K3 yellow filter.

Sincerely

South Charleston, Ohio.
