Mrs. Hunt/sh/SAFOCRC/72342/9 Feb 66

Gentlemen:

Based on the additional information you submitted to our UFO investigation office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, your report regarding an object observed on September 3, 1965 has been reviewed.

I hope this will help to identify the object you observed over Exeter, New Hampshire.

In 19 years of investigating over 10,000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proven that most sightings are either created and sent aloft by man, generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies or meteoric activity.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force and for your subsequent cooperation regarding the report. Agents may inconvenience you may have suffered as a result.

Sincerely,

JOHN E. SPAULDING
