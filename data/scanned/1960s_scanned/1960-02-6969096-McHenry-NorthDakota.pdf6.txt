Wound free from slip or slide on the retinas one is to make at the approximate rate of 4000 volts per second for a pulse of traction of about .00005 seconds. The case is coda-s a-side wave of pulsive impulse. Good as a passive recording device as its properties imply. The circuit is couched in an array of such similitude as to nearly approximate the natural waveform of the organism. It is conceived to be the quickest of this similitude as is necessary for the purposes intended for the recording.
