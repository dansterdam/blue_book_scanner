At the end of about one minute, the object appeared to be growing fainter or fading which seemed to indicate it was traveling away from the observer. The object went up for about a minute, then disappeared from view. The object moved through the sky in a manner so slow that sometimes I had the impression it was standing still. The object was glowing steadily with a glow of the intensity of a dim star in a clear sky. It did not appear to trail any sparks or exhaust and made no sound whatsoever. When the object disappeared I felt that this was almost like one saw in science fiction movies, something takes off and just sort of fades away without a trace. While the object was still in view, I exclaimed that it appeared to be a Russian satellite simply because of the slowness of its movement and the steady glow without any sounds at that altitude. The object did not appear to be spinning or rotating at any time, it just moved slowly across the sky until it disappeared from view. If it was a satellite it must have been rather low in the atmosphere.
