PROJECT 10673 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 27 Oct. 66 23592
2. LOCATION: Beaver Creek, Ohio
10. CONCLUSION: Insufficient data for evaluation
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer noted a pulsating red and green flashing light in the northeast sky, 30-45 degrees above the horizon. The light appeared to be hovering and then made a rapid acceleration to the northwest and disappeared from view. The observer attempted to contact the object by use of a searchlight, but the object did not disappear from the view. Attempts were made to scramble a helicopter to investigate, but the number was listed in the phone directory. The description is consistent with a typical UFO sighting, but without additional physical evidence, such a conclusion is not warranted.
