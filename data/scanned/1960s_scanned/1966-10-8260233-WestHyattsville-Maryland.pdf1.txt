The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document page from Project 10073 Record. The document provides details about a UFO sighting that occurred on 31 Oct 66 in West Hyattsville, Maryland. The key details are:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 31 Oct 66

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground Visual

The document then provides a brief summary and analysis, stating that the object observed was "like a grayish donut" and that the witness did not report seeing it until 11 Jun 67, at which point he indicated it occurred on 31 Oct 66. The witness could not provide a return on the photo, and the photo was deemed to have insufficient clarity to identify the object.
