The image contains two sketches. The larger one appears to be a compass or direction diagram, with labeled directions around the perimeter. The smaller sketches at the bottom appear to show two different landscape views, with one labeled "Like this" and the other "Not like this".

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. SINCE ANGULAR DIRECTIONS ARE MOST ACCURATELY SHOWN THAN RELATIVE POSITIONS, THE SMALLER SKETCH WILL BE MORE INFORMATIVE THAN THE LARGER SKETCH.
