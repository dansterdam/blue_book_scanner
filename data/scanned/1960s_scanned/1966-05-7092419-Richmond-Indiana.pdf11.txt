34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5 June 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
THE OBJECTS (SIGHTINGS) WERE NOT OF AN AIRPLANE OR HELICOPTER AND WERE NOT CONNECTED TO THE GROUND. I TRIED TO COMPARE THEM TO OBJECT IN THE AREA. AT SOME DISTANCE OR ALTITUDE, COULD BE CONSIDERED "LIGHTS". THESE "LIGHTS" WERE TOO BRIGHT TO BE AN AIRPLANE, THE CORRECT RUNNING LIGHTS DID NOT EXIST. THE "LIGHTS" WERE NOT OF A CUSTOMARY AVIATION NATURE AS THEY HAD NO RELATION TO THE GROUND TO THE WARNING LIGHTS ATTACHED TO THEM AS I TRAVELED OVER 80 MPH ALONG A ROAD. ONCE WE STOPPED, THE "LIGHTS" OR ONE LIGHT FOR OVER 30 MINUTES, WHILE I SAW ONLY THE LAST 5 MINUTES OF ITS MOVEMENT AND WHILE I WAS STOPPED AND MY WINDOW ROLLED DOWN.
