1. The two UFO reports attached are submitted for your information.
2. Reference the report on the completed work sheet. This report has been reviewed by Project Blue Book and no further action is considered necessary.
3. Reference the hand-printed report. This could not be made out entirely. The data is to be supplied as soon as possible. A report will be forwarded as soon as the information is received.
4. As only one report was enclosed, please return this with any additional enclosure to me. Since both reports were so long being received, I was unable to take such action for corroboration, however, I would like to impress upon you the importance of prompt submission of both reports to this office.
5. In the future, please call for any information required about reports to this office. The newspaper inquiries, referred to in the report, were taken care of by this office.
