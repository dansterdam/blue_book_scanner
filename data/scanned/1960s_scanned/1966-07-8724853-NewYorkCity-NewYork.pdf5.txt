"UFO Was Just Copter Flares
NEW YORK (UPI)--Numerous reports of "unidentified flying objects" over the New York City area tuned out to be merely flares from Coast Guard helicopters. The Coast Guard said the flares, used to signal helicopters, had caused much excitement and alarmed many residents who had called the police and reported the sightings. The UFO was believed at first to be space ships from another planet, but the Coast Guard dispelled the alarm. The UFOs were flares from the helicopters and there was no cause for excitement.
