Conclusions

This is a peculiar case, primarily because of the apparently excellent reliability (in the sense of truthfulness) of the principal witness. If one takes the description of events as given by the witness at face value, then the physical evidence follows logically from the position, appearance, and behavior of the object. The object had legs which were left on the ground. The object was larger; the marks on the ground were made by a heavy object settling close to the pavement. The object departed with a blast of very high-temperature flames that splashed off the roadway; the car was ignited by the flames and immediately away; the appearance of the burned area indicates a blast of heat.

On the other hand, if one considered only the physical evidence so far available and so far analyzed, he would be bound to conclude that a hoax was highly probable. The presence of matches suggests that gasoline (not much less than a quart) was used to ignite a patch on the road; a clever and energetic person could have made the holes in the pavement.

The fact that the holes were not discovered until the next day strongly suggests that they were put there after the sighting but before the inspection the following day. The irregular but sharp outlines of the burn and the irregularity of the burn suggest that a downward jet played on the road at one fixed position; the absence of any outwardly directed blast-marks gives similar cause for doubt (although if the heat were applied directly as heat radiation there would be no blast marks).

In other words, the appearance of the physical traces can be used to argue either for or against the reliability of the witness account.
