The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to a UFO report.

Here is the text from the document:

About 1.5 second, or less, I saw four dim lights which were not very distinct. The only conclusion we could come to was that someone had shot off a meteor and these were the remains, but I don't believe this would account for the peculiar appearance. The lights did not seem too bright to enable looking directly at them (which would account for their not being distinct). The breaking up would account for their disappearance. Since none of us had binoculars, we were unable to determine size or other details which would be needed for a fuller description. However, this would indicate some sort of unknown phenomenon, which does not fit any usual occurrences. If this was a meteor it would have been a very unusual one indeed.
