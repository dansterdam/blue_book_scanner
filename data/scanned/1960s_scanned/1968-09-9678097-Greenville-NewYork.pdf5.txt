One might about 11.00P.M. vard out with my telescope or shortly it the moon. It had a small light or fluorescent light along the top. It hovered there and seemed tobe out a bright light. It spent about half a minute or less of a the sky.

Out of the comer of my eye an object appeared some distance away, descended and moved across my field of vision. It had a pale white light and no red or green running lights. It was only visible for a few seconds.

We have this reliably drawn from several witnesses. We have at least 3 or 4 people who observed this object. According to their reports the object was not a satellite or anything of that sort. It was high in the sky and we have attempted to reconstruct the observation but were unable to determine what this object was. Nothing they may have flown before. Perhaps an experimental aircraft from some installation near here. A bit of a puzzle.
