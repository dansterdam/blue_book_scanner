The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document from East Carolina College in Greenville, North Carolina. The text in the document is as follows:

"EAST CAROLINA COLLEGE 
GREENVILLE, N. C. 

The object continued around. We climbed in any kind and it appeared so bright on a day that was 3-4:00 and it seemed so close to us we could hardly believe we saw it. It would disappear and reappear some 50 to 100 yards away from us. It seemed to be lighted from within.
I tried to phone the civil defense office in Greenville, but an hour had elapsed before the observer could get thru. They did not seem much interested. 
The object remained in the sky and we watched it for some 30 minutes, then it suddenly disappeared - just winked out. I believe we may have seen an unidentified object. I feel definite that it was not an aircraft, or satellite, or meteor, or any other natural phenomenon we could name with certainty. In short, it defied all known classifications and identification. We feel quite certain it was something extraordinary, and whatever it was, its behavior was very strange and unusual. I have never seen anything like it before. We were much amazed and intrigued by the object."
