TWO JET AIRLINERS ENCOUNTERING FLYING DISC
The Pan-American report confirms that on the at 2916Z AZT apparently two jet airliners encountered an Unidentified Flying Object.
The Federal Aviation Agency has just confirmed to NICAP the sighting of a strange lighted UFO by TWA and United Air Lines pilots. According to the first reports, these pilots reported that the object was not an ICBM missile. Nor was it a satellite reenterIng the atmosphere. The object was clearly visible, brightly lighted and maneuvering at a high altitude. The un- known device swiftly outdistanced their planes, the pilots reported.
The Associated Press said the BOAC jet was also a witness to the strange pre-dawn sighting.
"Suddenly, we saw this bright ring in the sky," said the co-pilot, Barney Hiller. "It was a perfect circle, a very clear hole in the center. It was traveling so fast that it was on one side of the horizon and then on the other in seven minutes."
