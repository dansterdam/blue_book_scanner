CAPT WALTER FLINT, WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE TEST, NOTIFIED THE LOCAL GCI SITE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE UFO. HOWEVER, NO INTERCEPT ACTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THE GCI FPS-20 RADAR PICKED UP THE UFO ONLY ONCE EACH THREE SWEEPS OVER AN INTERVAL OF 36 SECONDS AND RECEIVED NO TARGET ON WHICH TO VECTOR THE HEIGHT FINDER.

PART II. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE DATA LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TARGET WAS REAL. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE REPORT TO SUGGEST RADAR MALFUNCTION, OR FALSE ECHOES, BECAUSE THE TRACKS WERE APPARENTLY WELL DEFINED AND HAD A DEFINITE PATTERN. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL TARGET DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT CONSISTENTLY FADED AT 44 MILES OUTBOUND IN ITS ORBIT AND REAPPEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 44 MILES INBOUND. THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON FOR THE INABILITY OF THE POWERFUL FPS-20 TO TRACK THE TARGET, UNLESS THIS EQUIPMENT WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AT THIS TIME OR THE TARGET WAS IN A DEAD AREA FOR THE STATION.

PART III. SINCE NO HEIGHT FINDER DATA WAS OBTAINED CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS MUST BE MADE RELATIVE TO THE TARGET HEIGHT. THE MINIMUM REPORTED RANGE OF THE TARGET WAS 10 MILES. SINCE THIS IS SLANT RANGE AND FURTHER SINCE THE MAXIMUM VERTICAL ANGLE COVERAGE OF THE FPS-20 IS 25-30 DEGREE, THE MAXIMUM TARGET HEIGHT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 30,000 FEET WHICH OBVIOUSLY RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UFO.
