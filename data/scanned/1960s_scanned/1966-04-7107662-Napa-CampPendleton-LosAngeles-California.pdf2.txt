awoke the Provost Marshals' Office Duty Officer, Staff SGT R. E. LEE.

They returned outside and at this time the object appeared to have taken
a solid roundish shape, with one trailing edge. The trailing edge was pointing
eastward. They observed the object in this position for a period of approximately 5 to 10 minutes, and while observed, it changed to a "tear drop" shape
and stayed in this shape until approximately 0510 hours, when it could no
longer be seen due to the incoming daylight. This object was sighted by
approximately 7 members of the Duty Section of the MILITARY POLICE COMPANY.
Brief statements were obtained from each of the above individuals.

matter with the Provost Marshals' Office and the Base G-2 Office.
