The image appears to contain a diagram or sketch, but no photograph. The diagram shows a curve representing the motion of an object or objects, along with a compass-like symbol. There are also instructions for the observer to "Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an 'X' at the beginning of the path, a 'Y' at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course." Additionally, there is a question asking "IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling."
