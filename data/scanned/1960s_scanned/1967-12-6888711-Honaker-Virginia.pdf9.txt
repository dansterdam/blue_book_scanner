REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. INTRODUCTION:
On 6 December 1967, SSgt John E. Honaker of the U.S. Air Force Security Police Squadron at Langley AFB, Virginia, contacted the Langley AFB Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and reported that he had observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky over Langley AFB on the evening of 5 December 1967.

2. DETAILS OF SIGHTING:
SSgt Honaker stated that at approximately 2030 hours on 5 December 1967, while on routine patrol, he observed a bright light in the sky to the southeast of Langley AFB. The light appeared to be moving slowly and silently in a northeasterly direction at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. SSgt Honaker watched the object for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared from view. He described the object as circular in shape, approximately the size of a basketball, and emitting a bright white light.

3. INVESTIGATION:
OSI personnel were immediately dispatched to the area of the sighting to conduct an investigation. A thorough search of the area was conducted, but no further evidence of the UFO was found. Interviews with other Langley AFB personnel on duty at the time of the sighting failed to corroborate SSgt Honaker's account.

4. CONCLUSION:
Based on the investigation, the Office of Special Investigations was unable to determine the identity or origin of the object observed by SSgt Honaker. The sighting remains classified as an Unidentified Flying Object.
