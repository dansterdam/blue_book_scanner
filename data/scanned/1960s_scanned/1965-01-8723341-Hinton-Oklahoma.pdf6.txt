This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from one of your field activities. Your field representative requires a picture of these lights. We would like to know if these lights are evenly spaced, which indicates a controlled device, or irregularly spaced, which would suggest they are separate lights.
If the information suggest you send the attached portion of his form.
