The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document discussing a sighting of a light or object that was observed in the sky.

What I wish to offer, is the particularly unusual nature of the image. As I said, the plane appeared as a point of light, and seemed to descend in a gradual controlled manner. It seemed to be that of an incandescent object, which would, in my opinion, be really not possible in the plane.

I would offer as an explanation of the jerking motion, that I was seeing the very limits of visibility, having looked at this object just briefly and at night, it would seem, and that at this level of visibility, the servo loop, so to speak, between retinal signals and directional signals, was rendered somewhat unsteady, reducing stabilization, nearly as though the motion was not really possible in the plane.

The apparent incandescence coupled with a combination of natural illumination at a reflecting body, does not seem to me to be consistent with the illumination of a normal aircraft. The combination of circumstances producing this unusual sighting may not be too unusual and may offer further insight into other sightings that you may make.

Sincerely yours,
