Pathologist Views UFO
Mr. Richard S. Woodruff, Vermont pathologist and part-time Vermont UFO investigator, was driving on Route 107 in Bethel, Vermont on December 26, 1964, and a Vermont state trooper, who was conducting a routine patrol, was riding with him. Around 6:30 p.m. they both sighted a bright light which seemed to be hovering over the tree tops. The Free Press, Rutland, Vermont, carried the first news account of this incident. Woodruff was quoted as stating that the object approached very rapidly and that "it scared the daylights out of me," as he viewed it pass below the level of his car. He estimated the object to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter. It appeared to be a solid round object with a semi-luminous glow around the rim. As it passed, it tilted slightly as if viewing the ground, then it seemed to accelerate and disappear at a great rate of speed. A little later, the trooper and Woodruff saw the object again as it seemed to be following the same line of flight, but at a considerable distance. The object appeared to be found, but they were unable to locate it on their return. Woodruff is quoted as stating that the Unidentified Flying Object appeared to be metallic in nature and was moving with no discernible means of propulsion. He considered it a classic UFO sighting, but he was unable to determine the nature or origin of the object.
