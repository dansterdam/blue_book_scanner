This incident occurred, according to the primary witness, 1930. He was resting, and his attention was attracted by some strange lights in the sky. Investigating further, he observed a large, brilliant object hovering over his home. The object was described as disc-shaped, approximately 70 to 80 feet in diameter, with a brightly lighted underside and slightly domed on top. It remained suspended for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view at a high rate of speed.
