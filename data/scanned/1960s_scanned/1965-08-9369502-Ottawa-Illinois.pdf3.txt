Reference the attached letter from (redacted) regarding observation of a UFO on 17 Aug 65. The time duration of 15 seconds is rather long, however, the object did traverse more than 50 degrees of sky, indicating that the observed characteristics were adequately determined. Also, all known satellites have orbital characteristics not similar to the observations.
