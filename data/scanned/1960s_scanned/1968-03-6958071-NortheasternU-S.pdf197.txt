Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Your letter of July 2 reached me. recently.

Such calculations as the 6:25 of the annual report of the American Meteor Society. Jut I am sorry to say that I do not have copies of the 1968 annual report of the American Meteontical Society. I shall be happy to send you a copy if I can obtain one. This appearance even more keen here. I am sure that I should, though so far I have been very fortunate.

The above informs you can publish this article to the Blue Book for the report which would be distributed to you and others and dated 1936. The actual finished article is in my desk at U- * I will probably not see these until middle or next week. You are prohibited from publishing, circulating or quoting this article in any way until given permission. Please do not use the tabular data for any purpose.

The actual sub-sent point: due to the changing fortunes of this Bureau which E consider so difficult, I am very anxious that we continue to avoid any publication or inquiries from institutions other than our own. Thank you again for all the valuable reports which I return herewith. Please return this letter in conclusion.

Sincerely yours,
