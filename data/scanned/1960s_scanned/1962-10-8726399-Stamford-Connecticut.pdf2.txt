Gentlemen:

I am writing you this letter at the urging of a friend who thought that the information contained herein may be of value to your agency or some other governmental office.

On the evening of October 17, 1962, around 6:30 p.m. I was cleaning the gutter on the roof of my home, and I stopped to rest for a few minutes. As I laid on the roof, looking up at the sky, I noticed a bright shining object moving across the sky from the North-East to the South-West. This object seemed to jump as it moved and I moved approximately 100 ground yards in about two (2) minutes. At this point it started to turn and come back the way it had come originally. At this point I called to my brother-in-law, Mr. [...] of Stamford, who was at the house with his wife, to watch the object also. It was then that I had two (2) more objects, one coming from the North-East, one from the South. They all came together including the first one I saw, more or less forming a triangle. They stayed together for about a half a minute, then they broke off and went in different directions.
