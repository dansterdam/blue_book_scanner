The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, which is a United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

SUBJECT: Request for Photoanalysis

TO: AFCIN-4D4a

1. Attached is a photograph of an alleged UFO with a copy of accompanying letter from "RICHARD R. SHOOP OFFICER, USAF AFCIN-4E2x" dated 22 September 1960.

2. Request photoanalysis be made of these photographs.

1. A positive identification of the objects which appear in these three photo prints is not possible with the limited information furnished.

2. It is suggested that the negatives of these photographs be obtained if possible, and also that more details concerning the conditions under which the pictures were taken be given. Were the pictures taken through a window? Were the inside lights on? Were the photographs taken from an automobile?

3. The two photographs dated 26 Sep 60 show three images which cannot be explained from the analysis. It is stated in the letter dated 22 Sep 60 that the diameter of the object is such as to make it impossible to see more than a small and close to the camera or moving very rapidly. It is possible that the original print could be retouched since the intensity of the dark objects is much greater than the other dark areas on these prints.
