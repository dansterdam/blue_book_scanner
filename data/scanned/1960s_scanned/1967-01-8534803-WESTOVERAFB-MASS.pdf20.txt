1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 67-1417 submitted by Major 
Quintanilla, USAF, to determine the identity of the reported objects photographed at
Westover AFB, Massachusetts, on 13 January 1967.

2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the submitted negative has negated retouching. Source indicated the two "Objects" were not visible when the general outdoor scene was photographed. Both images look unnatural in their sharp portion and a higher degree of 
clarity than any foreground or background detail in the photography. Two additional faint images are located below and are analyzed by source and appear similar in configuration to the subject objects but much smaller in size. Each pair of images appears to have been caused by a light source during exposure or a double exposure. No satisfactory explanation could be given for the imagery.
