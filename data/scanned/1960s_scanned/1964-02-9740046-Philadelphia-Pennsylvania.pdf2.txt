Transcription of the text in the document:

17. There is no information on the object we have observed that we think could be of interest in determining what it may have been.

18. It is our impression to discount this incident as being anything other than a natural phenomenon.

19. When the Air Force Board received the report our action was to get the details filled in and make the report as complete as possible. 

20. Toward the end of the investigation, the object was identified as an aircraft of some kind, probably a commercial airliner. This seems to be the most plausible explanation.

21. No other unusual activity or sightings were reported in the area at the time. There are no other witnesses.

22. In view of the information obtained, the details indicate this was most likely a misidentified aircraft. The source appears to be reliable, but the evidence does not support the conclusion that this was an unidentified flying object.

23. There is no evidence to suggest any investigative interest or unusual situation associated with this report.

24. This appears to be a routine incident, with the information provided indicating this was likely a misidentified aircraft. There is no indication of any unusual activity or phenomenon.

25. How many more must go "unsolved" before the Air Force becomes convinced they cannot explain a good percentage of UFO reports?

26. It is our opinion that the report should be considered closed as a misidentified aircraft.

27. For many years nothing more advanced or unusual has been observed.
