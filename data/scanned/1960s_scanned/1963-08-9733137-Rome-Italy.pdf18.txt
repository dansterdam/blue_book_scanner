REPORT

OBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED 20 AUGUST 1963

On 20 September 1963, the OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CASTILLO called for an investigation on the hunting grounds of the PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CASTILLO. The report states the following:

1) The first impression the witness gave was very favorable. He gave the impression of being a very serious person, sincere and trustworthy. He never contradicted himself. The question which he was asked and the replies which he gave lead one to the conclusion that he is a person of good standing and he gave other particulars which he had not included in the written statement. And in addition to the above mentioned, we should regard that he never attempted to delude or deceive us.

2) The witness has repeated with the same car, that is to say, that he was driving the evening as a unknown object and on the same road all of his actions during the observation. In this manner it was possible to acquire the following data about the transcended time during the phenomenon.

Phase 1: The object continued to advance and passed over the auto making it

Phase 3: The object, because of its altitude, was almost obscured by the roof of the car. There it remained stationary.
