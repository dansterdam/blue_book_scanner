Proposed reply to letter from 
Dear Mr._,
Reference your request for information on three unidentified flying object observations. Without additional information on each sighting, a scientific investigation is not possible. Details such as angular size, lighting characteristics, whether optical aids were utilized, etc., are essential in a comprehensive evaluation.  
In addition, it would be essential to know what instruments were used to determine the speed and altitude of the object.
On one specific sighting you mentioned that the object was traveling at a speed of at least 30,000 mph at an altitude of 25 - 35 miles.  
Even with the additional information at this late date, it would be extremely difficult to locate the exact aircraft in each case. Normally records of any air activity in a particular area are destroyed after 30 days.
Your interest in our program is appreciated. I am sorry that I could not be of more help to you.
