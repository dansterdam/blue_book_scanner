AIRGRAM

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

Washington, June 14, 1962.

SUBJECT: Report on Unidentified Flying Object from Argentina. G-33/635, June 14, 1962.

REPORTING your 1902 Montevideo telegram received in Buenos Aires concerning a report of an unidentified flying object seen over Argentina on June 8, 1962. The object was described as a bright light, round or oval in shape, moving rapidly from north to south, very high and disappearing in the south. Several persons, including some military personnel, reported observing the object. No sound was heard and no shape or structure could be made out. The object was observed for about 2 minutes.

This report is apparently the most recent in a series of sightings of unidentified objects over Argentina in recent years. The Embassy is forwarding details of these previous reports for your information. It is requested that the contents of this airgram be kept in strict confidence and not revealed to unauthorized persons. As you know, reports of this nature are extremely sensitive in Argentina and disclosure could cause considerable embarrassment to the national authorities and space activities. We would appreciate being advised of any additional information which may come to your attention.
