Dear Sir:
During the recent investigation of your report of an unidentified aerial object observed on September 8, 1965, near Leon, New York, the following information was obtained.

The object was comparatively stationary and at an altitude of between 1000 and 2000 feet. It was a fairly-round whitish-yellow color, with a diameter of about 40-50 feet. The object remained in view for about 10-15 minutes before moving rapidly to the northeast and disappearing from sight.

Mr. Walter Brindle, a member of the board of directors of the Chautauqua County UFO Research Group, and a number of other persons also observed the object. We were giving this matter a detailed investigation as it had the appearance of an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

While beginning to form an estimate of the sighting, the subject became one of greater importance when Mr. Brindle advised that on the following day, September 9, 1965, between approximately 11:00 AM and 12:00 noon, he and approximately ten other persons again observed a similar object in the same general area. This sighting reportedly lasted for about 20-30 minutes.

Inasmuch as this case involves a rather lengthy investigation and analysis, I have taken the liberty of preparing the enclosed report to provide you with a summary of the details developed to date.

Please advise if you have any additional information or comments regarding this matter.

Sincerely,
Phillip J. Klass
