The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a report on UFO sightings. The text in the document is as follows:

"Projectile was clearly visible for long distance in air space since there was practically no contrails and the like is characteristic sound and the object apparently give off an occasional light."

"I am unable to give any information on the configuration of this object due to the fact that the entire object seemed slightly lighted, it had no navigation lights, and the object itself or two occasions during observation H4 it changed color going from bright yellow to bright white." 

"In 1944 I observed a weather phenomenon known as "ball lightning" the ball had no resemblance to an aircraft of any type. It was not a celestial body."

"I don't know what this object was but it appeared as a very bright light which seemed to glide along slowly and was nothing like anything I had ever seen before."
