Text output:

Date: 1964 Sept. 9 6.35 G.M.T.
Sighted time at end point: 6:38 p.m. (2:38 p.m. at 93°30' N., 92°10' W.)
Near town of Soudan, Minnesota
Visual range: 100 + km. approximately. 
Luminous object: Approximate angular size 1° diameter.
Projected path length: 11.53 km.
Path length: 9.97 km.
Time of observation: 3 min. Steady rate of travel, approximately 200 m/sec. 
Radiant corrected for curvature and growth and zenith angle: 
2393.7 ± 0.40.
2.62 ± 0.31. 
Parabolic orbit: i = 128°, Ω = 160°, ω = 8°. The motion is the retrograde motion. Hence the object, according to the understanding of the motion, would not belong to the solar system. It has the characteristics of a meteorite, but is much faster than any known meteorite.
In Hoffmann-La Roche tests of Sept. 9, 1964 Sept. 10, and 1965 Sept. 10, have radiants rather near this.
