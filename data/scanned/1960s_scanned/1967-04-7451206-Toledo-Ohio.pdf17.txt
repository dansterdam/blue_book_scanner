The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STAND STILL AT ANY TIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND THEN SLOW DOWN?
CHANGE DIRECTION?
GIVE OFF SOUND?
CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE IN SIZE?
SPLIT INTO PARTS?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
SPIN LIKE A TOP?
MAKE A NOISE?
14. WHAT DOES YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON

The object in the UFO report did not contain a photograph, so I have simply described the textual content of the document as requested.
