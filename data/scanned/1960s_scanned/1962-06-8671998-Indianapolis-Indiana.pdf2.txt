RADIO FOR RECORD:

On 13 July at 1000 my wife called me and said that she and her children had just observed a flying object. 
The time of sighting was verified at about 9:45AM. The object was first observed going in a southwest direction across the sky very high and at a rapid speed.
The interval between the sighting of the various objects was approximately 3 minutes. 
The first object was seen for about 3 seconds, the second object was seen for about 3 minutes. The time lapse between the first and second object was about 1 minute and 30 seconds. 
The second object appeared to be larger and moving at a somewhat slower speed. It appeared to be stationary for about 3 minutes. 
Visual sightings began about 9:45 AM. 
The investigator did not see the object only as it appeared to my wife and children. 
The object appeared to be silver in color, elliptical in shape and larger than the first object seen. It appeared to be descending or gaining altitude rather than remaining stationary. 
Visual sightings lasted approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
The investigator does not feel that this could not be a meteor or satellite as the movement was controlled rather than a straight trajectory, and the object appeared to hover and was larger than a satellite would appear. 
The children, my wife, and I are reliable and responsible persons and we feel that this was no more a meteor or satellite than the first object seen but it was different in nature and unidentified.
