It was real faint. It was surrounding the whole object.
On the bottom, as well as above it?
On the bottom, as well as above it.
How did the color of the object appear to you?
Well, it looked metallic, like steel or something.
Silvery colored?
Was it spinning?
It wasn't spinning. And it was silver colored.
Could you describe the motion that you observed, in close detail, as it came near, as it went past you, and as it went away, coming down and going up?
Did it have any motion, other than the gradual shifting of position?
No, it didn't seem to have any other motion than the changing in position.
Is that the motion? Well, it didn't seem like that at all.
It was almost quite stationary, with slight movement. It was hovering like a well-ballasted balloon and stick. It looked like it landed in the trees. It will hover like a balloon, when it lands, if it should land.
What is this kind of motion? How about noise, did you hear anything?
None whatsoever?
No, sir.
Where is your think attracted your attention to it, Dave?
Well, I just looked up there, and there it was. I can't say that attracted my attention to it, except that it did reflect the sunlight.
Like a mirror. Was it bright to look at?
It wasn't that bright.
