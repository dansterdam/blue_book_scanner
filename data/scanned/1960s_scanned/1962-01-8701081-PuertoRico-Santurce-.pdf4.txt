Sir:
I take pleasure in sending you some information I believe will be of great help to you, as well as a suggestion.
Approximately six months ago I was lying down, resting - and a very clear and sunny day had a beautiful cloud in the sky which was a very strange and unusual shape. It had the shape of a very large star. From it came brilliant rays of light and a red ticket which could be noted as a great distance on the ground. Several livid lights were observed in my eye vision accompanied by no clouds. The sky was clear and brilliant. I am sending you this information.
The suggestion I want to make pertains to how your government can have conclusions or dollars which could be used to notify and prepare your bases and territories. It could suspend the allowance plan to the relatives in time of peace. I am doing this because I love your great country deeply and I would like to say that my husband is military with thirty-three years service.
Respectfully yours,
[Signature]
