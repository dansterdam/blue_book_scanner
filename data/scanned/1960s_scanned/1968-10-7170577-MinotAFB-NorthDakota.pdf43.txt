This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. The text in the document is as follows:

We most saw it 10:23 t0 10:45 ??? one east of us while on routine training. It started moving straight south. We arrived at the site a few minutes later and observed the object from our car. It was unusual in appearance and completely unlike any aircraft we have ever seen or heard of. It came within about one fourth of a mile of us. The sound was that of jet engine. It was in this same area for about 30 minutes. We took no pictures as we had no camera. The object was metallic in color, quite large, and made no sound that we could hear.
