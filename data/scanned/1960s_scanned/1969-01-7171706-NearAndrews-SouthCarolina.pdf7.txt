Dear [redacted],

This replies to your letter of January 22, 1969, in which you indicated that you and some friends have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer a complete explanation of what you may have observed. However, if you will complete the attached envelope, our technical personnel will be able to investigate further and possibly provide an accurate analysis.

Should you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each case is placed in the United States Air Force UFO investigation files, which are periodically reviewed in an attempt to identify the sightings and accumulate accurate data.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects in the Project Blue Book file we are maintaining as a guide.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIKMAN
Major, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
