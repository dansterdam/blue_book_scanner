The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Extracted text from the document:

When we, in discussing these objects in the Newark star ledger-about a year ago, stated that some of the objects to one McGuire Air Force officer seemed to be above the water, he said that he would report this information to you. Therefore, we should report this information to you.

Sincerely yours,
