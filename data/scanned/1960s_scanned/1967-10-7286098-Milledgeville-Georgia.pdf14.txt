When it climbed over the trees over there, I wasn't really looking over there I was, you know, I was just messing around. Kicking up these was objects you first saw me up here, you know. When you first saw the object?
On the road. All right, and where was the object? About right up there; just setting there.
How high was it when you first noticed it? I couldn't get high enough to look high it was because I'm not that good at heights and all that.
But it was off the ground and wasn't landed or anything? It wasn't on the ground.
And how far out did it look to you compared with the trees? It seemed to be above those little trees out there.
Right above them? Maybe a little in back of them, but above them. Maybe a little on the other side of them?
Yes, Sir. How long was it after you first saw the object before you decided to? I suppose maybe a half minute.
Well, I guess it was over there and during that time you did that, in order to arrive here. Well, I walk down that old road looked, and guess. I didn't actually walk exactly where I walked, I guess, 'cause looked like it wouldn't see me or anything.
Was it hovering, or just standing still there? Well, it looked to be hovering when I first saw it, but then I moved and it was moving a little bit.
