Dear Dr. Hynek:

Your letter of 30 April, requesting information about individuals referred to in the letter of April 24, 1964 concerning the sighting of unidentified flying objects on April 24, 1964 was forwarded to my attention.

After considerable searching of the newspaper files during the period of the helpful information, I have come up with some additional information.

The Telegraph-Herald carried a page one story on April 29, 1964 covering the details of the sighting. Two persons from Dubuque were listed in the story as having seen the object in question. The story lists:

Paul Kies, 650 Sunset Ridge, Dubuque, Iowa
and
Larry Kratzer, 1504 Henion, Dubuque, Iowa (now of Lislane Street)

I hope this information will be of value to you in your search for a solution to puzzling phenomenon of unidentified flying objects and trust that the information will be used with discretion.

Sincerely,

Richard C. Dempsey
Director of Public Relations
