NASA Wallops Station
Wallops Island, Va.

Balloons Launched at Wallops
Routinely every morning Monday through Friday at about 8:00 a.m. we release a balloon which is about 6-feet in diameter (buff color), carrying a radiosonde (3" x 8" x 8")
on a 50-ft. string. These balloons rise until they burst (approximately 100,000 ft. altitude). There is a parachute attached to the radiosonde which brings the radiosonde back to earth after the balloon bursts. This is a meteorological balloon which collects information on temperature, pressure, and density of the atmosphere.

Also through the day and night whenever a rocket launching is scheduled, one of these 6-ft. balloons is launched about one hour before launch. Some purpose as above.

In connection with the rocket firings, at about T-3 hours
we launch one of these 6-ft. balloons carrying corner reflectors
covered with silver foil (instead of a radiosonde) to determine
winds aloft. These balloons may catch someone's eye occasionally
due to the bright reflectors.

For special firings such as Nike-Cajuns, Aerobees, and
Scouts, we launch little 3-ft. balloons (some buff color and
some red) as frequently as every 15 minutes during the last hour
of the countdown (no attachment to obtain data on winds
as the 6-ft. balloons). These are launched primarily
during a countdown due to holds, etc. These do not go as high
as the 6-ft. balloons.

About 90 percent of the balloons released from Wallops (and
Norfolk area also) end up over the water due to prevailing winds. 
Sometimes during the summer when prevailing winds are contrary,
a few do end up over land.
