"Reports show that investigation had been conducted. When there reported they had hear the strange sounds which sounded almost like a loud noise, and they went to the airport in the direction of the sound, but found nothing. A man at the airport had seen the complete fade off of object at the airfield. An expert said what we seen was very possibly, the airplane glider. But I can't certain beyond a doubt that what we seen was a glider. What that (not tried., Must have been a U.F.O.) And it was no other. Persons are now keeping watch on the night and if anything happens up they will report it immediately in the right channels. Of that we shall speak."
