Text of the letter:

6 November 1961

Dear Mrs. _____,

It is highly unlikely that the "glittering lights" that you reported could have been the USAF PROJECT BLUE BOOK objects. Scientifically, the most refined and powerful optical and electronic methods have thus far failed to locate these ball-like metallic objects.

However, I would like to thank you for your interest and sense of duty in reporting your observation.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
MAJOR, USAF
Information Project Officer
