In fact interested in UFO Reports and have several books and articles on the subject. I have not yet come to any definite opinion on the subject but I do feel that a great deal of scientific investigation could and should be made on the subject. After reading the February 1957 edition of Science Magazine I decided to send a copy of this report to the Air Force's Project Blue Book.

I realize that this confidential investigation could be of importance to the Air Force's Project Blue Book and I believe that it would be necessary to forward the report for their consideration as evidenced by their request to have any case reports forwarded to them for their evaluation, I am personally exceedingly anxious to be of assistance to you in any way that may be required. My address is as follows:

I know there is nothing very unusual about my report in relation to others you have received, but I think you for your time in reading this report.

Very Respectfully
