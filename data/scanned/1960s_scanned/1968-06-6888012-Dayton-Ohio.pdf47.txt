The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

Because of the conversation between Lt Col Quintanilla and DR. Craig, of the univ of Colorado, Col quintanilla does not think that a vet analysis of the sample, to determine carbon content would be justified. because the sample is not from the confidence its just getting the work done anyhow. I'm sorry to have been of so little help on this sample. the sample is inclosed and is undamaged in any way.
