SUBJECT: - COpy OF NOS P 72
FLORIDA

This confirms an report we were relayed last night concerning the peanut shaped objet seen from our ship last night about 8:30 P.M. Pacific Time. The object was heading in a westerly direction at a rapid rate of speed. Its elevation was approximately 70 degrees. It stayed in sight for approximately 30-45 seconds and then disappeared.

I request an investigation be made into this incident. Please advise if any other reports were received concerning this object.

YOURS TRULY,
