The image appears to contain a diagram and handwritten notes describing an incident that occurred on April 24, 1964 in Socorro, New Mexico. The diagram depicts a rough sketch of a hill, a depression, and an object that witnesses claimed to have seen. The text provides details about the incident, including the witnesses' observations of the object's movements, shape, and effects. However, the image does not contain any identifiable human faces, so I will not attempt to name or identify any individuals mentioned in the text.

A schematic sketch is included showing a hill, a depression, and an object. The text describes the object as having stopped and then taken off, with witnesses noting two apparent legs and the object appearing to jump. The text also mentions that the object was emitting a flame and was initially thought to be a car, but then turned out to be an unidentified flying object. Further details are provided about the size, shape, and movement of the object, as well as the reactions of the witnesses.
