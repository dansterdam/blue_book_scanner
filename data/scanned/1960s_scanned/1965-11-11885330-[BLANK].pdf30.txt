The shared image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a technical document related to Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States.

The text in the document discusses various technical details about cosmic-ray interactions, particle fluxes, and high-energy-particle interactions in the atmosphere. It mentions the use of liquid hydrogen as a target, the expected interaction rates, and the considerations around performing the experiment at balloon altitudes.

for long periods of time with approximately 3.6 K" mesons incident per picture, yielding a particle flux of 35 mn"¡.
We intend this flux to traverse the liquid hydrogen target, chosen because
of the resulting great simplification in experimental interpretation. The target
is two meters long and the probability of interaction is about 20%. We therefore
expect to observe about two interactions per minute or 3,000 per 24-hour flight.
Because of the character of the cosmic-ray spectrum, about 600 of these inter-
actions will involve protons of energy greater than 360 BeV, and about 100 of
them will involve protons of energy greater than 1,000 BeV.
The mean free path for high-energy-particle interactions in the atmosphere is about 50 gm cm"² so it is imperative that the experiment be performed
at "balloon altitudes". The density of liquid hydrogen is .07 gm cm"³ and our
target, therefore, has a surface density of .14 gm cm"². At 100,000 feet altitude, the remaining air mass has a surface density of 9 gm cm"². Comparing
these densities with the atmospheric interaction length of 50 gm cm"², it is
obvious that no useful purpose would be served by going to higher altitudes. For
these reasons, we will consider that the normal balloon altitudes of 85-100,000
feet are adequate for the experiment.
In addition to the proton flux, there is also an alpha particle flux of
about 7% the intensity of the proton flux with about the same energy distribution
in terms of energy per nucleon. (3) Other heavier cosmic-ray components are
well below 1% of the proton flux. All cosmic rays heavier than protons should
be easily identified by the large pulses they produce in counters.
In summary, then, the effective cosmic-ray "beam" can be thought of
as three beams: a 10-per-minute, 100-800 BeV proton beam; and the weaker
alpha particle and 1,000 BeV proton beams. These components of the beam may
be separated and the momentum should be known to 10% or better for most particles. The nature of the beam can be altered in later flights by inserting into
