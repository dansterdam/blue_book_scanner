There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a scanned page from an old UFO report document, with handwritten text answering a questionnaire.

Transcribing the text from the image:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 28 August 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: 

Quite a lot of people were on the expressway at the time. They noticed the object also and it seemed to attract considerable attention among the motorists. The object moved very slightly and slowly up and down, sometimes disappearing behind the interstate highway overpass and then reappearing. They always moved forward slightly but in reverse, no sound was ever heard. It seemed to move in and out of sight somewhat intermittently. At first it appeared to be quite high up in the sky, however, as your investigator flew over the area in a small plane, the sighting area seems to be pretty close to the ground, perhaps not over 300 feet. My friend and I watched it for some time and were very interested in what it might be.
