SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION AT FAIRFIELD:
and   were driving east on Illinois Highway 15 at approximately 05002 hours on 5 August 1963. At this time they noticed a bright object in the sky to the right of their automobile. Observers were traveling in a valley of the road and approximately 30 yards from the highway transformer station. The object remained in a stationary position. Observers were near a Micro-Wave transmitting station. Object now appeared to change course from the right to the left of the car. While observers were still traveling, the object continued at the same elevation of approximately 15 degrees. Observers changed direction and were traveling north, the object appearing in the east at an elevation of 30 degrees. When the object arrived at Milne House, he went inside and stayed for about 15 minutes. From Milne's house, the object appeared in the east at an elevation of 15 degrees. On his way home, he observed the object appear at an elevation of 35 degrees as his car would go. During this time, the car sputtered and the radio started to crackle and stop playing. Almost immediately after it had begun to sputter, the car ran normally again and the radio ceased to crackle. The car was at this time being driven at its maximum speed on a gravel road. Upon reaching home, Mr.  immediately informed his father - the object seemed to hover over some trees which were about two hundred yards from the house. At this time the lights in the house were on.
