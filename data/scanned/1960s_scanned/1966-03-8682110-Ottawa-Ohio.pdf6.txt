11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a oblong shaped object with colored lights travel toward the north. The object started up slow, but increased its speed very rapidly. The object was about the size of a house - the object took off when a back fire occurred.
The description is not consistent with that of conventional (conventional aircraft). It is possible that some type of aircraft was observed, but the information submitted such a conclusion is not supported.
