The image contains two illustrations. The main one is a compass-like diagram with directional arrows pointing in various directions. This diagram is meant to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when it was first seen, as described in the text above it. The smaller illustrations show two landscape scenes, one with an object in the sky and one with a person standing in a landscape.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

CAN YOU IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE A "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.
PLACE A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN AND A "F" AT THE LAST POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "B" AND "F" WITH A LINE TO SCHEMATICALLY SHOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "B" AND "F", THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO WALLER SKETCH AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SECTION.
