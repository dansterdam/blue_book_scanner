UFO GOES TO A MOVIE?
On the night of May 29, 1963, at about 10:30 P.M. a bright light was observed by numerous persons in the vicinity of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. For the most part, the object was described as approximately the size of a basketball, reddish in color, and moving in a horizontal direction at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for several minutes before it suddenly descended vertically and was lost to view.
Various explanations have been suggested for this phenomenon, including that it may have been some type of aircraft. However, one witness, a young woman who was with a student accompanying her, stated that the object appeared to be about the size of a basketball, reddish in color, and moved in a horizontal direction before descending vertically. She also stated that the object maneuvered in a manner which would be difficult for any conventional aircraft. The witness stated that the object resembled the conventional "flying saucer" with domes.
After the minutes, the object moved directly eastward at a high rate of speed, and was lost to view. Neither the witness nor the student accompanying her desires to remain anonymous. The report concludes that while there could be a logical explanation for this sighting, at this time it cannot be determined with certainty.
