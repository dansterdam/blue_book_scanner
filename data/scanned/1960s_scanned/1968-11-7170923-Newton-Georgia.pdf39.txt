TOPT (UFO)
UFO Sighting of 22 November 1968 Near Newton, Georgia

Public Information Office
Fort Rucker, Alabama 36362

The Air Force is in receipt of a UFO report from about 12 miles west of Newton, Georgia on Route 91 (approximately 8 miles W 0 21 h E). The sighting occurred on 22 November 1968, sometime between 2000 and 2100 hours local time (R-6-19-63-0). The observer stated that he saw a light come from the object and ignite the ground in front of his automobile. The sighting has received quite a lot of newspaper publicity and the Air Force would like to determine the stimuli.

Since the description is similar to that of a helicopter with its landing lights on, we would like to know if you had any helicopter activity in the area on the night of the sighting.
