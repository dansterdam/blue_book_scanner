The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to "Major Jack" from someone writing on behalf of "Project Blue Book" at the Pentagon in Washington D.C.

The text in the document reads:

Major Marion Jacks
AF Office of Information
Project Blue Book
Pentagon
Washington D.C.

Dear Major Jacks,
Do you have any information photographs of hollicopters [sic] in the air at night that spew carefully controlled exhaust of 1,000,000 degrees F. If so, please return to Project Blue Book.

Thank you,
