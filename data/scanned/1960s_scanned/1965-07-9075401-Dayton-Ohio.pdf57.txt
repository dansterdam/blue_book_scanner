The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches and diagrams. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an "A" marked on the curve. There are also compass directions and angles labeled. The second sketch shows a circular diagram with a sun-like symbol in the center, likely representing a compass. There are no human faces or identities shown in the image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
