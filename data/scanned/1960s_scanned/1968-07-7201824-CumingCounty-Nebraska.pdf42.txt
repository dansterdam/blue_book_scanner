"SGO 7-2"
PRIORITY NO. 12
JULY 21, 1968

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

This is a photocopy for forwarding your case XXXXX on the sighting of an unidentified flying object reported here.

It seems that there was an unusual sighting (Cumming County, Nebraska) similar to many others, including the shifting colors, a flashing effect and some peculiar maneuvering.

The day observer thought had been reported to Omaha, Kansas, and is assumed that this office may have questioned local law-enforcement agencies concerning the details of the sighting.

However, the more recent response of the local observer indicates that he may not have been fully satisfied with any previously made explanations of the sighting. Additional information or clarification of the investigation would be appreciated.

If any further significant information should come to your attention, we would be glad to receive it. The file on this case will remain open, pending the possible receipt of additional details that would aid in determining the nature of the reported sighting.

Your further cooperation will be most helpful, as the Air Force continues its program of investigating reports of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,
PHILLIP J. KLASS
