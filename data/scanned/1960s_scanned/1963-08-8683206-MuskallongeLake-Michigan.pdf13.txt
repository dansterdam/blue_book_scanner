The image contains a photograph or diagram showing a sketch of an unidentified flying object. The sketch includes details such as the shape and direction of the object's movement.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The answer to this question is not provided in the image.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.
The witness indicated that the object moved behind something, such as a cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: Silver or metallic

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The response suggests the witness attempted to measure the angular size of the object using a match stick, but the details of the measurement are not provided.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
