CONTENTS IN VIEW OF THE CHILDREN'S AGES, THE ABSENCE OF CORROBORATING EVIDENCE AND INSUFFICIENT TIME SPAN, THIS SIGHTING DOES NOT APPEAR TO WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION. I DO NOT WISH TO RESTRICT IN ANY WAY THE CAPABILITY OF THE CHILDREN OR THE CREDIBILITY OF SUCH SIGHTING. HOWEVER, THE FACTS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FORM A DEFINITE EVALUATION.

1. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE
