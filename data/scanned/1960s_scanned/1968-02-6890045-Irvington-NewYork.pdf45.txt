The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

THE UFO WAS ABOUT 200 FEET IN DIAMETER AND APPEARED TO BE METALLIC AND SILVERY IN COLOR. IT MOVED VERY SLOWLY AND SILENTLY MAKING A SLIGHT HUMMING SOUND. WHEN IT WENT BEHIND SOME TREES IT SEEMED TO GLOW LIKE A LIGHT. IT WOULD SOMETIMES STOP AND HOVER FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY. IT WAS SIGHTED FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES. ABOUT 30 PEOPLE WITNESSED THE OBJECT.
