DESCRIPTION: The witness, Mr. Covington, stated that while driving his car on the highway, he noticed a bright object in the sky which he thought at first was a plane. As the object came closer, however, he realized it was not a plane and pulled over to watch it.

The object appeared to be circular in shape and was colored reddish-orange. It moved slowly across the sky for several minutes before disappearing in the distance. Mr. Covington stated that he did not feel frightened during the observation, but was very puzzled by what he had seen.

The witness could not provide any photographs or physical evidence of the sighting.
