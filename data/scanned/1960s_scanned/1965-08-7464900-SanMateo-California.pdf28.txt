Dear Sir: During August 1952 at about 11:30 PM, I observed an unusual object in the sky above San Mateo, California. The object was brightly lighted and moved in a horizontal direction at a relatively slow speed for several minutes. It then appeared to accelerate and move rapidly out of sight.

I have read of similar sightings reported to the Air Force and wondered if you would be interested in this report. If so, I would be glad to give you any further details you may desire.

Sincerely yours,
TED WYLIE
