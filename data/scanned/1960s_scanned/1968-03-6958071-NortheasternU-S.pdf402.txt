AS SOUND SOME VERY STRANGE
10. WE WISH TO KNOW THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH STICK AT ARMS LENGTH IN LINE WITH A KNOWN OBJECT AND NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. IF YOU HAD DESCRIBED THIS EXPERIMENT TO US, COULD YOU KINDLY DO SO AGAIN AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD?
19. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OR COLOR OF THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS. LABEL AND INCLUDE IN YOUR SKETCH ANY UNUSUAL OR EVIDENT CHARACTERISTICS, FOR EXAMPLE, VAPOR TRAILS. PLACE AN ARROW BESIDE THE DRAWING TO SHOW THE DIRECTION THE OBJECT WAS MOVING.
20. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN ESTIMATE THE SPEED OF THE OBJECT? (CIRCLE ONE) YES NO IF YOU ANSWERED YES, THEN WHAT SPEED WOULD YOU ESTIMATE?
21. IS IT STILL YOUR ESTIMATION THAT THE OBJECT WAS (CIRCLE ONE) YES NO IF YOU ANSWERED YES, THEN HOW FAR AWAY WOULD YOU SAY IT WAS?
22. WHAT SIZE OBJECT DID YOU (CIRCLE ONE): A. INSIDE A BUILDING B. IN THE CAR C. OUTSIDE
23. WHERE WERE YOU (CIRCLE ONE): A. IN THE BUSINESS SECTION OF A CITY? B. IN THE RESIDENTIAL SECTION OF A CITY? C. SOME OPEN COUNTRYSIDE (EXPLAIN WHAT A CITY)/D. FLYING OVER OPEN COUNTRY)
24. IF YOU WERE MOVING IN AN AUTOMOBILE OR OTHER VEHICLE AT THE TIME, THEN COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
24.1 WHAT DIRECTION WERE YOU MOVING? (CIRCLE ONE): A. NORTH B. NORTHEAST C. EAST D. SOUTHEAST E. SOUTH
24.2 HOW FAST WERE YOU MOVING? MILES PER HOUR
24.3 DID YOU STOP AT ANY TIME WHILE YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE OBJECT? (CIRCLE ONE) YES NO
25. IN CASE THAT YOU CAN GIVE AS CLEAR A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE OF WHAT YOU SAW, DESCRIBE IN YOUR OWN WORDS A CONCISE SKETCH OR OUTLINE OF THE OBJECT AS YOU SAW IT PLACED ON THE SPACE BELOW.
27. IN THE FOLLOWING SKETCH, IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE AT THE POINT MARKED "YOU" ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW THE PATH OF THE OBJECT. PLACE A "M" ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW THE POINT WHERE YOU FIRST SAW THE OBJECT. THEN PLACE AN "F" ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW THE POINT WHERE YOU LAST SAW THE OBJECT.
