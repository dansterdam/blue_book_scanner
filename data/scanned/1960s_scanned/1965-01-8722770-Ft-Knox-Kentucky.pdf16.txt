Transcription of the text in the document:

Since the report of the observation of the flying object at Ft Knox, Ky, on 8 Jan 65, the observer, M/Sgt (redacted), has been interviewed on two occasions to obtain additional details. The interview was conducted by Capt (redacted) and myself.

The main points developed in the interviews were:

1. Object was first sighted at approx 1845L, 8 Jan 65, as M/Sgt (redacted) was driving his car from Ft Knox to Louisville, Ky. He was about 2 miles SE of Ft Knox on Hwy 31W when he observed the object.

2. Object was first sighted in the south-southwest portion of the sky and was moving in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed.

3. Object was observed for approx 30 seconds during which time it proceeded across the sky in a straight line and disappeared from view in the northern portion of the sky.

4. Object was described as being elongated or cigar-shaped, silver or aluminum in color, and about 20-30 feet in length. No wings, tail, or other appendages were observed.

5. Object did not appear to be an aircraft, balloon, or any other known type of flying object. The speed and manner of flight were not characteristic of conventional aircraft.

6. Weather conditions at the time were clear, and the object was easily visible against the sky.

M/Sgt (redacted) impressed the interviewers as being a credible observer who was very careful in his description of the observed object. He has had several years of experience in aircraft identification, having served as a crew chief on various types of military aircraft.
