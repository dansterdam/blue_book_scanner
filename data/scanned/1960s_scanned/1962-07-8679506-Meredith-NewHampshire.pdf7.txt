I had been preparing to observe Venus and I was setting up my telescope when I noticed this. I immediately turned it on this object as it seemed to be a disc of light hovering over the trees. I immediately began calling it to the attention of other persons to "look at the scene, but unfortunately a few came out and then went back into their homes. The time was approximately 8:00 PM and I continued to watch the object which seemed to be fairly stationary. There were few or no clouds and the visibility was warm and dry. There were few or no stars visible. The object finally went down and disappeared from sight.
