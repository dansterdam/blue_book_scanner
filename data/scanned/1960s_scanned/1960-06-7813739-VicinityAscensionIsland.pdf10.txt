The image does not contain any photographic elements. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

I was copilot of Silver One flying at 3500' MSL. Silver One 2003 MSL had contact with an object traveling above him and in a 65'- 70' state of oscillation. The object was overcast with haze and sea state of 5. The pilot and Silver One's radio operator then proceeded to position course and ELINT the object and in orbit around the object. At this time (approximately 0720Z) when the overcast broke, full Alc it is practically impossible to estimate altitude but further than 100 yards from and either on the surface or very near the surface. The flight intensity was approximately 70 minutes and the light burned for approximately 10 seconds. A immediate negative reply was received. Indicating a positive read when an object had crossed or interfered with the test. I confirmed that neither AIC had dropped any object at any time during the test.
