The field of vision was limited to the actual object as it was observed. This particular object was observeable at a distance of approximately a mile - it was oval in shape and appeared to be a chrome-like or metallic substance. The object remained stationary for about 6-10 minutes, and then suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed - being lost to sight in approximately 2 seconds. No sound was noticeable during the observation, nor were there any lights on the object. The basic color of the object was a dull metallic gray.
