The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and sketches related to a UFO sighting report. The diagram shows a curved line with markings indicating the elevation of the observed object above the horizon, as well as a compass rose showing the direction the object was seen. The instructions in the image ask the reader to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects and to indicate the arrangement and direction of travel if there was more than one object.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

26. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
