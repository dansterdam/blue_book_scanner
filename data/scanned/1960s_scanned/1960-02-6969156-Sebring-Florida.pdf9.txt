Sebring, Florida
2-6-1960

I have not experienced anything really of sufficient importance to call someone's attention to it. I have been seeing some objects, which could be considered unidentified, for a couple of years, but don't attach any particular significance to them.

On the evening of Feb. 6th, about 6:50 p.m., I was driving south on U.S. 27 toward Sebring, Florida, when I saw an object in the sky which appeared to be saucer-shaped and was moving rapidly. It seemed to be at an altitude of around 5,000 feet. The object was traveling in a northerly direction and made a sharp turn or change in direction toward the east, then disappeared from sight. The object was extremely bright and seemed to change colors somewhat during the time I observed it. It was not any known aircraft that I am familiar with. I have seen aircraft of all types practically every day and this was definitely not any type of conventional airplane or helicopter. The object seemed to be under intelligent control.

I am not making any particular report of the incident, as I have seen similar objects before and do not consider them to be of any great significance. However, if you have any information that you would like to furnish me regarding the possible explanation of such objects, I would certainly be glad to have it.

Sincerely,
