Dear Dr. _____,
We read your letter and we are grateful, you took the time to answer. We untill the dirigible for over and looked as we described it the attached letter. We hardly ever gave the saucer reports any more than a passing glance, and hardly ever discussed them. Since we have been exposed to this airship, we started a little research program of our own, to find out about this dirigible. It is interesting what we have come up with, as most of our information has been found in our local library.
We have read where an airship that toured across a dozen states passing over many cities of our country, and this was before the seppiah was local inventors, this look place in 1896 - 1897. The ship we describe fits the description of many of the sightings that I have read, which were made by reliable spotters.
It seems incredible that this aircraft could fly and attached it's self to the Cherry Hill R.C.A as building and cause them to light up the entire plant at once on a early hour on a Sunday morning. And to leave an aware of it's presence or to completely disappear while the security that must exist in an industry doing Government work.
We have not say the while to enlighten this worldly ship, as we have a question that comes up when ever we sit and talk about the matter. The question is "if the ship is really of local origin as the answer to Cape Kennedy and it's efforts to go into space?. If the ship that did we learn from it and what did they learn from us, the night the ship visited R.C.A. Cherry Hill, N.J. If you could give us your own thoughts on these questions we would like to hear them.
Yours truly,
Mr. & Mrs. _____
