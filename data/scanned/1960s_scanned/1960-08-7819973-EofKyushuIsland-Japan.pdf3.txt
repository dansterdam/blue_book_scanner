Analysis and Conclusions: There seem to be no additional reports to be questioned in this case. The initial sighting appears to be an authentic observation of an unidentified object crossing the sky at extremely high speed. The observer's description of the object making a 90 degree turn and disappearing within 4 to 5 seconds suggests the possibility of a meteor passing through the atmosphere.
