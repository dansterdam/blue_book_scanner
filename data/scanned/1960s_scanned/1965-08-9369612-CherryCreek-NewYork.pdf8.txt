To received two report from State Police, Chautauqua County Police Barracks, Fredonia, New York. Object sighted near Cherry Creek, New York.
Object initial seen 2030 EDT (few minutes after sunset). Saucer shaped object, light brown in color like two dinner plates held together, very shiny, 50 ft long, 20 ft thick. Landed in farm field about 400 feet from barn (at least it appeared to land). First observer ******* 25 years old, Aldrich Hill Road, Cherry Creek, New York. Had a radio on in the car and heard unusual interference, went outside to look. When he went outside the object rapidly ascended into the clouds. Clouds turned green (color of tree leaves) shifted and streaked, had unusual odor, like ****. This mixture went straight back, slowed descended into clouds, cloud turned green like grass, it was still insight outside. This observation was made by ******* **********, Fredonia, New York. 15 minutes observer started home towards barn but went back into clouds. Started (direction) 2300 ft. away from barn, moved back into clouds, went to the south-southwest direction, emitting yellow streak, descended and ascended several times. Last time the observation was also made by ******* ****** (brothers) no adults. Parents were in house. Dog described small as white gas burning. Parents confirmed that dog was barking, the cattle were 24 2 mile ordinarily and not what they only came 1 am. They had a bull in the field and he was upset. The State Police impression was that it could be a hoax but he did not feel that it was a hoax as the people were rural people. State Patrolman J.S. Haas was the interviewer. Couldn't see smoke on the ground it was dark when he got there, but clouds in figure area, 1,200 - 3,000 broken overhead. There was a woods behind the object. Thought the kids were stunned by observation. They will send a report.
