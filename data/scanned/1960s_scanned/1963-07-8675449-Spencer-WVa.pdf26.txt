CRATER RIDDLE
ON THE FELLS
Farmers' discovery

Yorkshire farmers discovered what they described as a crater, some 40 feet across and 5 feet deep, on the Fells at Warminster on Saturday. Describing their find, the farmers said they saw a circular depression with the edges of the turf being disturbed as if something heavy had dropped there, crushing the grass and vegetation. Around the rim of the crater, the grass was burnt and smoking. They could see no sign of an impact crater caused by a meteorite or aircraft, and said that tracks of up to 40 sheep were leading to the center of the depression but nowhere away from it. Though unable to account for the crater's appearance, the farmers thought it had some connection with unidentified flying objects reportedly seen in that area in recent months.
