Dear Mr. President,
These words for me to write a great many of them have come, yet I still want to be getting on to my text to tell you about an object that is landing in my backyard, and is going to try to communicate with me.
I have made a few efforts to photograph or study object, but failed. The object is now standing still, and I did not know what to do, for I was not expecting a visit from outer space. My nerves are pretty much upset over this. Can you send me some advice on the procedure? Also, can you arrange for someone competent in such matters to come out and make an investigation? I would be eternally grateful.
I remain as ever,
Steelville, Missouri
