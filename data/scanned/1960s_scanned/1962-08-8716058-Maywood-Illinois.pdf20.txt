THE "ORVILLE" PHOTOS
In the Spring of 1962, the Project Blue Book investigation of a reported UFO sighting in the village of Maywood, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), was made. The community was aroused by a series of UFO sightings over the village.
Maywood UFO Roundtable featured Mr. Earl Neff, of the Cleveland Air Force Base, and was M.C.ed by Reverend James H. Ryburn of KWSO Radio.
It showed a UFO over a cornfield. The stereotyped "flying saucer" has a dome, flat base, and has a metallic shine.
The date of this occurrence was July or August of 1962. The group claimed (1952 Advisory Board) they had found evidence that two were seen in July.
The boys were taking pictures of a new kitten in their backyard, when they noticed something in the sky. A saucer-shaped object hovered over their backyard for about five minutes. The boys estimated the saucer to be about forty feet in diameter (roughly 240 MPII). The object seemed to be of dull metallic color, with no visible signs of propulsion. Attempts to photograph the "flying saucer" were made, but the resulting photos were not very clear or distinct.
