The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with text describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

<T> N/A
H - NONE
I - NOT TAKEN DUE TO OBJECT GREAT ALTITUDE AND SPEED.
J - NONE
K - CHIEF WING INTELLIGENCE, 3 BOMB WG. TRACK AND REGULARITY OF ALTITUDE INDICATE NON-HETEROLOGICAL ORIGIN, AND WOULD PRECLUDE SUCH MAN-MADE OBJECTS AS FLARES. ROCKETS ETC. ALTITUDE AND HIGH SPEED WOULD SUGGEST A SATELLITE TYPE OBJECT IN ORBIT. THIS POSITION IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT AN HOUR AFTER SUNSET, AN EASTWARD TRAVELING OBJECT AT EXTREMELY HIGH ALTITUDE WOULD UNDERGO A CHARACTERISTIC DIMMING WHILE ENTERING INT THE SHADOW OF THE EARTH.
1. NONE
