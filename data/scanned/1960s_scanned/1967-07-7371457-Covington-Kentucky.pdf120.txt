The text in the document states:

THIS IS IN REPLY TO YOUR CORRESPONDENCE ON AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) SIGHTING OF JULY 7, 1967.

WITH THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED, IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO OFFER MUCH IN THE WAY OF EXPLANATION. SUCH CASES MUST BE FILED AS UNIDENTIFIED, AS IN A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION. IF YOU HAD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FURNISH, YOUR CASE COULD BE FURTHER EVALUATED. AN INVESTIGATOR AT YOUR NEAREST MILITARY INSTALLATION IS IN A FAR BETTER POSITION TO CONDUCT SUCH AN INVESTIGATION. YOUR INTEREST IN OUR PROGRAM IS APPRECIATED.
