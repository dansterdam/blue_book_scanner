Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object appeared at roughly 10:15 pm on Aug 6, 1966. It was first visible as a plane with vapor trails going east to west. But it slowed to a stop, hovered, then took off at a high rate of speed to the north, disappearing in a matter of seconds. It seemed to be luminous, and about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It made no sound. We watched it for several minutes as it did these maneuvers. I would appreciate an analysis of my report. Respectfully.
