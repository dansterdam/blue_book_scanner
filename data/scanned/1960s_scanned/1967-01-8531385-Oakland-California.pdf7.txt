FIRST SIGHTING OF UFO'S

Jan. 6 1967 time 9:10 to 9:16 PM Pacific standard time 

I was looking at the stars in the west, spotted a dark place in the sky, with this out any stars. I could just see 2 dim golden stars. There light became brighter, using our binoculars (7x15x35 GRC) I looked at them thinking what a beautiful golden color, when they slowly started to move apart. I put down the binoculars, stared, put on my glasses, and stood with my mouth hanging open. I just could not believe what I was seeing.

first seen in this position west north 

this is approx. distant they went apart

They just disappeared deep into space from the last position.
