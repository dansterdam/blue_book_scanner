TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Giving off a sudden light--went back in the same direction it came from.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:
This was hidden momentarily by a passing cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what: 
Came out of the cloud - it seemed to be to the left or right of the blue-green flame. 

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Some sound like a swishing noise. 
b. Color - Brilliant bluish-green flash of light. 

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
Possibly 1/2

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and exhaust trails or vapor trails. 
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[Handwritten sketch shows an object with a blue-green flame that seemed to be moving to the left.]
