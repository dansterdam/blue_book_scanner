Dear John,

I have received your account of the strange phenomena observed over the Detroit area on the night of Aug. 3rd. The details you provide are very interesting and appear to be a fairly accurate representation of what occurred.

My business associate, whom I have consulted, is of the opinion that this was not an aircraft or any conventional object, but rather a manifestation of the type which has been described in many UFO reports. The sudden appearance, the rapid acceleration, and the abrupt disappearance are all characteristic of the type of aerial phenomena which have been recorded in connection with UFO sightings.

While I do not wish to be too definite in my conclusions, I feel that the incident you describe bears a remarkable similarity to other reports which have come to our attention. The object, whatever its nature, appears to have been under intelligent control and to have exhibited capabilities far beyond those of any known aircraft.

I would be most interested to hear if you have any further information or if there are additional witnesses who can corroborate your account. Please let me know if you learn of any other details which might shed light on the nature and origin of this strange visitation.

With kind regards,
