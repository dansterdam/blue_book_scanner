4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Several minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground visual

9. X PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Yes
10. CONCLUSION: Balloon(hot air)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched a reddish orange colored light in the NE portion of the sky. The object was silent and gave off a funny sound. At first the observers thought the object was a jet, but when the object maintained a constant position, they concluded it must be a hot air balloon. The description is consistent with that of a hot air balloon. There has been a rash of hot air balloon reports from the area.
