REPORT PERTAINS TO: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTED BY PILOT NEAR MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, NORTH DAKOTA

ON 7 OCTOBER 1968, A PILOT FLYING A F-4C PHANTOM AIRCRAFT REPORTED SIGHTING AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT NEAR MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, NORTH DAKOTA. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECT WHILE FLYING AT 35,000 FEET. HE DESCRIBED IT AS BEING APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET IN DIAMETER, CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, AND DISPLAYING A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 2-3 MINUTES BEFORE IT ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THERE WERE NO OTHER VISUAL PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIGHTING. RADAR OPERATORS AT MINOT AFB COULD NOT DETECT THE OBJECT ON RADAR. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE TURBULENCE IN THE AREA DURING THE SIGHTING WHICH MAY HAVE AFFECTED RADAR READINGS. THE PILOT MAINTAINED VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT THE ENTIRE TIME IT WAS IN VIEW. HE STATED IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND VISIBILITY WAS GOOD AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.
