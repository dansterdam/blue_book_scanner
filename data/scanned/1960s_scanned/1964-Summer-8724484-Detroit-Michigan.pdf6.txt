Low Level Flights in Arizona

At 9:43 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 June 1964, Howard Coyne, mine foreman at the Western Mining Company, observed an egg-shaped object near Copper Mountains on the Navajo Indian Reservation and they watched the object for five minutes. The object was moving northwest to south and appeared to be at 500 and 1,000 feet altitude. As disappeared into the distance, a second object, the description of which is similar to the object just described, was seen. The second object appeared to be at the same altitude as the first and was also moving in a northwest to southeast direction. Both objects had a white light at the top and the entire object was surrounded by a red, mist-like glow.
