Transcription of the text in the image:

"tall, reddish and oblong. It came in from the west at a high rate of speed, made a sharp turn and went back the way it came. I called several people out to see it but it was gone before they got out. It was about the size of a large automobile, and was several hundred feet in the air. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds.
