Police, USAF Officials 'Mystified' Here:
Glassboro Scientists Experimenting With Authorities
At Glassboro last night, Sergeant Robert D'Onofrio and representatives of the Gloucester County Sheriff's Office said they were still conducting an investigation of a report like the mysterious holes found in the woods off Delsea Drive near Malaga, which occurred last Saturday.

1. Our investigation showed these holes were actually an average of 3.5 inches in diameter, and 9 to 11 inches deep. (For actual dimensions see Page 2)

2. According to our investigation, figures called "strange visitors" appeared. The holes were not exactly 27 feet apart. (For actual distances see Page 2)

3. Incident-September 1st.

4. Saturday, September 5, 1964.

According to local officials, discovery of the circles or charred areas of corn in the woods at Ward's Lake was reported by Ward Cosbill, Sr., on 30 August 1964. Glassboro Police and the N.J. State Police investigated and found charred circles approximately 27 feet in diameter, in an area adjacent to Ward's Lake. The area affected was apparently an acreage of 2 to 3 acres on Saturday, September 5, 1964. A random 20-year-old youth, questioned at the scene, could give no explanation for the unusual phenomena, other than that he had seen a red flash in the sky just prior to finding the charred areas in the woods. The authorities investigated the warden's report, leading to notification of Glassboro officials that an investigation was being conducted there.
