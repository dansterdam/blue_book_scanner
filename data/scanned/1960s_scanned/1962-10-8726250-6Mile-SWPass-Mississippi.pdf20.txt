The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document discussing "Air-insulated "Balloon" Communications Cable". The text in the document is as follows:

COMMUNICATIONS cable that looks like ordinary telephone cable has been developed by the Navy Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, Calif. and the Bell Telephone Laboratories at Hickory, N. C. and Stopless Wire & Cable Company, Canton, Mass. The technique for manufacturing, installing, and using this cable, which can be transmitted throughout Europe, makes possible "beyond the horizon" communication with modest transmitter power. The cable's insulation strength and anticipated long life make it attractive for many commercial and military applications.
The air-insulated cable is expected to have long life and wear, with high dielectric strength. According to both Simplex and Superior, for VCNG, this type of information transmission should result in reduced maintenance over existing solid dielectric cables. Technical details are not available at this time, but applications for telephonic communication, railroad and utility installations (railroad, community, and military systems) are indicated in the patent claims.
