The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text from an old Project Blue Book report. I will now act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and transcribe the text from the document:

1. Internal surfaces are severely corroded, indicating a more severe condition internally. The lack of corrosion on the outside (even though paint was in poor condition) is indicative that the sphere had not been in a corrosive environment. Products did not provide any clue to the possible contents.

2. The survey for residual alpha, beta or gamma radiation was negative.

3. We have not been able to establish the intended use of this device. The following possible applications were considered but not confirmed:

The design is such that it would sink readily if dumped at sea, and could take every half-hemisphere pressure. However, it would only half (one hemisphere) could be loaded because of the method of closure. Discussions with the normal laboratory indicated that for waste products they are familiar with.

Detonation wave and blast: For example from nuclear explosion, exposure to shock wave and blast could activate surface contaminants. However, the Nova device now under consideration, in support of atomic testing in Nevada, does not provide this high pressure condition according to the information obtained from them.

4. The unit is not suitable for a sensitive test device. Not a likely application since there are no external connections for anything.

5. The sphere is available for pick up if you so desire. No additional tests are contemplated without further instruction from your office.
