The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The larger sketch appears to be a compass with directional labels. The smaller sketches show landscape views, one with a person standing in the foreground and mountains in the background.

TEXT:
AS NEARLY AS I CAN RECALL THIS WAS THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND THIS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE PATH AS NEARLY AS I COULD DETERMINE IT. THE EXACT POSITION AS INDICATED BY THE SKETCH IS NOT TO BE TAKEN AS PRECISE AND ABSOLUTE, BUT MERELY AS APPROXIMATE AND INDICATIVE OF THE GENERAL AREA AND DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY.
