Proposed reply to _____, letter August 3, 1967 (signed April 8, 1967)

Dear Mr. _____,

Reference your latest correspondence of August 3, 1967. We are still have been unable to reach a definite conclusion on your observation because of insufficient information.

A possible explanation would be that of a hot air balloon. The description you submitted is consistent with an evaluation that it was a hot air balloon. There are many individuals who have launched hot air balloons; therefore, it would be impossible to determine whether a hot air balloon was positively in your area at the time of your observation.

The form you completed is a copy of an official Air Force form; however, we normally need additional information on any sighting before reaching a definite conclusion. That is why an individual needs to contact the nearest Air Force base, as they are in a far more desirable position to collect essential data, such as ascertained flight characteristics, angular velocities, weather conditions, and any reports of activity in the area at the time in question. If he is unable to reach a positive identification, the report is then sent to the Office of Special Investigations, Air Force, for further investigation, for a final determination.

Since there was no indication in your report of a threat to the security of the United States, nor was there any indication of any new scientific or technical data, the Air Force does not feel that further investigation into your sighting should be made.
