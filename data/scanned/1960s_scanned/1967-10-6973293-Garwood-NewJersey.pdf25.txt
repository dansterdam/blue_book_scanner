4A. HOW IMAGINE - USE THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS AS A PLACE TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON APPEARS OVER YOUR HEAD. DRAW AN ARROW POINTING TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION.

IN THE REVERSE - PLACE AN X IN THAT POSITION REPRESENTING THE LOCATION ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED FROM OVERHEAD, IF SEEN, AND CONDUCT THE OBSERVATION ACCORDINGLY. PROCEED TO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL WHAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED REGARDING THE MOTION, APPEARANCE, DURATION, AND ANY ASSOCIATED PHENOMENA.
