The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old report document, likely from Project Blue Book, discussing details related to a UFO incident.

pointed to U 'Seal,and the body cross 4ts field. This is take as the distance south to be 1800 yards. The time is servis tivaly, we presume thereso-e about HL Jr Ph.D for the end 2211 at 372, Hubbard, Ohio,------ it extends for the of the path on star mag 8. This is at most at Bootes. This gives H2 as 37.6 km. The average of 5 other officials wrich seem reasonably good taso have H2 as 37.6 km. So we presume H2 is 37.6 Ky.
We are so near the vertical plane of the north that the length in azimuth would be about the height. Some 600 ft. The altitude to be estiin stars, is take the good adjusted path length as 1.8° km.
Due to the excessively small angular size the true length can be a surprise at only 4.8 meters, the size observed 3.69' and the end result is even more 3.1 It is exposed that die to the original tr bodies 'distant remain' into many, to describe effect different diameters to many a different end. However, the 1822 length and the given H1 and H2 still remain the coordinates of the atmospherics path.
As to the velocity in our 7? observed, we have 28 estimated run-ning from 6 min. Curve'ly: range 26 m/sec. Again dropping those of under 26 and over 90 sec. n= 63 m.sec. Using the unusually full reports from 89 55 sec., 340 45 sec., and 270 50 sec., the mean would be 46.2 sec. 'this means the observed velocity would be 23 m/sec, and the greatest is most probable 24 m/sec, an estimate not improbable. The distances are so short that the relio:)ne precision is the rate and most improbable. The criteria are so 3.1° that no doubt the step-tan, the arc cur- tions of over 10 second, estimated directions are a doubt to report.
However, in oeneral 1 report remarkably, noiline that. Some further data south report 3 objects report, to the oldest about mid Boon.
