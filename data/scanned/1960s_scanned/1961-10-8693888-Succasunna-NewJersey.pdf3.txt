(Circle One) Yes No
37.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?
I had noticed strange flying objects on several occasions over the past 6 or 7 years, but this was the first occasion where I had seen one at this close range and under these particular circumstances.

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I could not determine exactly what the object was, but its appearance and flight characteristics led me to believe that it was some type of UFO that did not conform to any known conventional aircraft. The fact that it hovered and then accelerated at a tremendous speed leads me to believe that it was propelled by some means or technology that we do not currently possess.
