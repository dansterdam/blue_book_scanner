RADIO FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING, 11 JULY 1968

I called Officer AFB to talk to Capt. Cunningham, but he was not
in. I talked to Sgt. McCoy. I asked him so talk to Capt. Cunningham
to see if any aircraft had landed at Offutt or Omaha City Airport
as approximately 12:35am. Also, if the city police had received
calls about a UFO at that time or if Officer Tower and anything
unusual in the log that night, and if anything unidentified was
tracked on radar.
