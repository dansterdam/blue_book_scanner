The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an abstract grid-like pattern. The pattern appears to be composed of intersecting lines, creating a complex, textured effect.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

The Utah Air National Guard reported that a single bright white light, approximately 6-8 feet in diameter, was observed hovering at an estimated altitude of 500-1000 feet. The object appeared to accelerate rapidly and then disappear. After three minutes, the object reappeared and repeated the same maneuvers. The object was observed for a total of 10-15 minutes before disappearing.
