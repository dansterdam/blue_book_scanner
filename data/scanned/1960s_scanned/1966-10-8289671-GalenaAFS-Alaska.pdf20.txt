The image provided appears to be a photograph or drawing depicting an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The image shows several dark, blurry shapes or objects against a light background. There is handwritten text surrounding the image, but no identifiable human faces are present.

Exhibit 2. is visible and what appears to be other handwritten notes or descriptions of the observed object(s).

As requested, I will now act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and produce the text found in the document:

Exhibit 2. is visible and after a few more maneuvers it went out of sight, traveling at a high rate of speed.
It moved erratically for several seconds and then sped away into the east.
As Ronald B. Growell reported, it seemed to pause briefly and then suddenly accelerated and sped out of sight.
Exhibit 3: at first approached slowly and then suddenly accelerated and shot away rapidly.
