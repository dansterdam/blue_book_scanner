Dear Mrs. Striamtiner, 

I wish to report a sighting I have observed during the past weekend. On Saturday night, September 2, 1967, at approximately 10:00 p.m. EDT, I was outside in my backyard on Dryden Road, Ithaca, New York, and observed a large, bright, circular object in the sky. It was moving at a high rate of speed and changing in shape, color and size. It was white in color and appeared to emit pulsating lights that changed from white to red and blue. The object was observed for approximately one minute before it disappeared from view. I know that what I observed was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I would be willing to discuss this further if desired. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[Name redacted]
