There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with various questions about the sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color
18. We wish to know the angular size of the object. Could you match it size with anything you are familiar with, such as the size of a match head or the size of a silver dollar at arm's length, or the size of the full moon? (This will help us estimate the size and distance of the object.)
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing the size, proportions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or glowing parts of the object are moving.
