The text extracted from the document is as follows:

Austin, TX 78703

Signal = 5spx 140
Object slowed & dimmed
or cut off 1.5 sec
here. (Can't be sure
if off or on again as
drifting clouds white
off.)

Object hovered & brightened "3X" here as 15-45 sec response to signal.

Observed thru 6X coated lens binoculars here.

NOTE: "OCDY" or "CIRCUIT" WAS ALWAYS "QUIET" (ELECTRICAL)
RELATIVE TO PATH.

DRAWING ON BOTTOM LEFT IS ON DIFFERENT SCALE THAN ONE ON BOTTOM RIGHT

NOTE: Maximum angle above northern horiz may be exaggerated, but you can use Polaris as a reliable index, as it was a few degrees below it.

THIS IS AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE OBSERVATION TO THE BEST OF
