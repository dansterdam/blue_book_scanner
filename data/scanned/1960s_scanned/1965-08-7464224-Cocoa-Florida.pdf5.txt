Transcribing the text from the image:

He has asked me to work with them on these things as an astronomer. 
M: Is this on tapes?
H: No, not on tapes. This is for my own information and for the Air Force. The report I have here is identifying information and observations on these matters: Edward Ruppelt, Charles Maney, James Irvine and B G Scott. These four men are all officers of the Cocoa Police Department and may be contacted at the Police Headquarters Building, 325 Riveredge Avenue, Cocoa Florida.  
M: It's changed -- 300 Beauson Boulevard
H: Now, then let me begin by asking if you have had any thoughts on this subject since - it's been a number of months now - do you still question, or do you have a feeling of what it was you saw? 
M: Oh, yes, in my mind I can still see it. It was my first experience I can think back * right now and I know definitely what we observed - at least what I observed - was fascinating to me and it'll stay * with me the rest of my life. And it was the first time for me. I've heard stories and read, and so forth, some of them, but I never went overboard. You know, 'TILL that particular night.
H: Well, you're the kind of observer I like to talk to because I don't like to talk to people who are firm believers in flying saucers, or something like that. But we get -- and I've been a consultant/for the Air Force now for/fifteen years because this stuff all started way back, you know, just before 1950. And most of the things that we get we can explain very easily as balloons or stars or this and that. But there are each year a number of cases that are really puzzling, and yours is certainly one of them.
