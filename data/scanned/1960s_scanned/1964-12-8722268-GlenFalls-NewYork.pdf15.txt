The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Mr. Denison:
It is my belief that the object
I saw was the same unidentified
object that was witnessed by many
others through Glen Falls on
Dec. to East.
I had thoroughly of course
be certain and only after long
consideration did I determine
this was something from another
world waiting to be discovered.
The object moved swiftly and
in a manner unlike anything
man-made I know of and held
a rapid speed. It then seemed
to disappear in twinkling.
