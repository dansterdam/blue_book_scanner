NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

Another type of colored substance is the "blue rain" that sprinkled a thirty-mile stretch of countryside near London on September 9, 1962. Falling without warning from clear skies, it left a blue stain that wasn't washed off, even in investigation. Almost did the substance remain at Farnborough. The jets were using the blue dye to color their smoke and make a more spectacular display.
