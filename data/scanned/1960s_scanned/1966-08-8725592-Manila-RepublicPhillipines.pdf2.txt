UFO SIGHTING

On the 1st of August 1966, while on a flight to the Philippines, I sighted several lights in the sky which could be logically explained. I saw three evenly spaced lights, stacked similar to a stack of coins. The lights appeared momentarily but then disappeared and reappeared at another location. The several movements of the lights disappeared and reappeared at a new location. This overall phenomenon was the first I saw in my 25 years as a navigator, and slightly forward of our position.
