The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scan of a typewritten document or report.

The text in the document is as follows:

There is a discussion very little in evidence and distraction is the bearing official upon an object. It may in the case of two observations, one close and one distant, not considered to be the same object. If the close and distant observations are considered to be the same object, it is difficult to explain how such change could take place in the object in such a short interval. It would seem that a pilot could appreciate details that would be completely lost from a greater distance. There could be loose or loose on the wings and fuselage.

But if the image were not caused by something on or associated with the aircraft, then it must be considered that some real object was seen. This would pose other problems, such as identification. If it were a real object, it should have been tracked by radar. This poses the question as to why it was not so tracked. Perhaps it was not sufficiently solid or metallic to be tracked. There is the further question as to the nature of the object that could give so little evidence of its presence.

If the object is simply exceptional, then we does not know as much. And we can't even say whether it was due to some natural phenomenon or whether it was something more mysterious.

Under the microscope examination, the image is not a hoax. The resolution is too good. The distortions are reasonable and consistent with a real object at a distance. This could be an interesting case for further investigation. The identity of the object must remain a mystery. Whatever the nature of the object, it poses a problem for our understanding of the airspace around us and we should continue to study it.
