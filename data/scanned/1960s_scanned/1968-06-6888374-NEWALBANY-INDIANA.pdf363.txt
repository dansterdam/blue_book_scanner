The image contains two sketches that appear to be part of a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The larger sketch on the top shows a compass rose with directional labels, likely used to indicate the direction and position of a reported UFO sighting. The two smaller sketches at the bottom appear to depict a person's perspective or view of a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "S" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND PLACE A "S" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE. THIS LINE WILL APPROXIMATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
