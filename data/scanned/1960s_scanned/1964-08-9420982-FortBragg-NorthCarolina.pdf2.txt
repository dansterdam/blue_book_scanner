Dear Sirs:
That recently I became interested in unidentified aerial phenomena and while doing research in this field, I decided to report the one (or many) that I saw. This incident occurred 17 August 1964, approximately just around 2300 hours (local time).

The UFO first appeared to be circular in shape, was brighter than stars, and appeared to be on a steady course. As it drew closer, it appeared to be elliptical in shape, had a sort of luminous 'halo' around it, and was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. The object at one time split into two separate objects, then recombined. Sound: None noted.
Altitude: Several miles (probably).
Speed: The UFO first appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed, then suddenly hovered or became stationary for a few minutes, then resumed its high speed and disappeared from sight.

WMATER: The UFO first appeared almost directly overhead, descending at a sharp angle and then proceeding on a level course. It appeared to be surmounted by a bank or mass of smaller objects, possibly satellites or fragments or receptacles, rotating independently and giving the main object a "pulsating" appearance. It then recombined into a single body and disappeared rapidly with no sound.

COMMENT: The object, in my estimation, was not a natural phenomenon. It was too bright, too large, too fast, and too maneuverable to have been an artificial satellite. I am not familiar with any aircraft or missile which could perform the maneuvers this object exhibited. If there is any additional information concerning this sighting which you could provide, I would appreciate it very much.

Sincerely yours,
