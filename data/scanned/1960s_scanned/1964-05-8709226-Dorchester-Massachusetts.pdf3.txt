DEAR SIRS:
TONIGHT, WHILE WE WERE ON OUR BACK PORCH OBSERVING PLANES COMING INTO AND LEAVING LOGAN AIRPORT, WE SAY A VERY STRANGE OBJECT, AND REPORTED IT. OBSERVED IT VERY SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. IT WAS A VERY PECULIAR WHITE COLOR. ONCE HOWEVER, IT GREW DIM ALMOST TO THE POINT OF GOING OUT. IT MOVED IN A VERY ZIGZAG PATTERN WHICH WAS PRACTICALLY HORIZONTAL HOWEVER, SIGHTING LASTED SIX MINUTES UNTIL 10:01 P.M. UNTIL WE COULD NO LONGER OBSERVE IT. WEATHER WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR WITH MANY STARS VISIBLE. THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE DEBIT MOON AND APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH UP. IT SEEMED TO BE ROUND IN SHAPE.
SINCERELY
