INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE

It. Possible improvements to the aircrart warning system - A study is being mode to obtain operational experience with the HURRICANE WARING System which might be obtained by using meteorological satellite observations. Improvements would enable the warning system to react more promptly to events and to compare the costs of obtaining position data in this manner with the present ground-based warning techniques and to the science of meteorology. 

III. Impact of the "Space Race" on Other Countries
(Current Russian competition is a study of Soviet cold war objectives in space, and the Soviet conception of U.S. objectives and space programs. The impact of this Soviet-U.S. competition may be limited to minor matters, such as satellite tracking, telemetry, and data transmission. Serious impact does not appear to be proposed, on a limited scale, in order to provide an empirical basis for positive contracting activities. while the international implications must of course be considered, the pressure for political action by interested nations could be greatly reduced by the support the United States can provide both technical and political.)

Direct costs:
Overhead at 25.08 percent-----------------------------------------$93,500 
Fabrication----------------------------------------------------114,200
Materials--------------------------------------------------------15,000
Consultants, fees, and travel-------------------------------------68,000
Computing machine rental----------------------------------------5,000
Total estimated cost------------------------------------------$335,700
Fixed fee---------------------------------------------------------20,150

Mr. O'SULLIVAN: In regarci to the question I believe you asked a moment ago, I have some further information: namely, to the effect that in the event it is decided to construct an inflatable structure in space, we feel that it is a very inexpensive way to test out the satellite components in the space environment. 
The CHAIRMAN: $3 million?
Mr. O'SULLIVAN: I think so.
