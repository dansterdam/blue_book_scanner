Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla
-2-                       November 12, 1968

Mr. Massa, of the Columbus dispatch, has called me a couple of times in the last few days. He wishes to write a story based on our paper published in the House Hearings. So, perhaps it will have some good after all, since the reporter seems to be very sensible. I understand that it was to have appeared in the Columbus Dispatch Sunday, November 19.

Sincerely yours,
Donald H. Menzel
