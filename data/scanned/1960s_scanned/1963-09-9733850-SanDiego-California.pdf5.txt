1. The attached correspondence and report was received in this headquarters on 17 October 1963. Due to the lapse of time since the writing of this report, no further investigation or analysis could be made. However, it is believed that the official agencies of the United States Government were apparently notified of this incident and the unusual observations made, and no further action on our part appears to be necessary at this time.

2. If further information is desired concerning this report, an inquiry would appear to be the appropriate action. However, since a more comprehensive inquiry would be performed by higher headquarters, it is suggested that any further action be taken by your office. 

3. A letter has been sent to Mr. "redacted" informing him of the disposition of his report.
