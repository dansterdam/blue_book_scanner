The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

TPPT (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/mbs/31 Aug 63
UFO Observation, 3 August 1959

Mr.  
Jeffersonville, Indiana 47130

1. Reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting of 3 August 1959. The description that you provided on your observation suggests that you have observed what we have classified as plastic target bags, not air balloons. These balloons usually appear as a white or yellow color, and usually lase birthday candles for a heat source. After the candle is burned out, the balloon deflates and disappears from the object. Shortly after the fiery pieces fall, the light disappears.

2. Once again, thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
