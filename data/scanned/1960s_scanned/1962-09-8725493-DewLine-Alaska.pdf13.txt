Low Flying Disc in Washington
The "Wispy Ridge" area east of Marysville, Washington, played host to a strange light in the sky which was observed by many residents in the summer of 1962. A similar but bigger object was seen later in the year. There may be more cases. The most persistent sightings were reported to have been made at low altitude, described as a disc-like shape and glowing. It made no noise and traveled slowly, giving the impression of being under control. More information on this case is being obtained.
