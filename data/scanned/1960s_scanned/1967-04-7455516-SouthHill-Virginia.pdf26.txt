The illumination was exceedingly bright, and appeared to rise, travelling rapidly up the tree. It then went out. The witness was puzzled by this phenomenon, but could not figure further happened, he knew he had seen the light, nor did Crowder know that Martin had seen it. 
This testimony seemed to be in conflict with Crowder's story, for Crowder had said he saw car-headlights turning into the Martin driveway just after the brilliant flash of light, which he could not possibly have seen given this discrepancy. However, Crowder finally suggested that the headlights might have turned into a house just west of the entrance to his farm, so that the location (only about 200 feet farther west) for the Martins' road. That turned out to be the case. Mr. Martin who lived in the house in question, did not see his roadview illuminated at about nine p.m. his wife nor anyone else north-west bedroom in the immediate vicinity) any lights as from a car's headlights turning into their driveway. However, nobody knocked on the door and she assumed that someone had merely turned around in the yard.
