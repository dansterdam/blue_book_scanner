Dear Sir,

A report of an unusual aerial object is attached as requested. This report was received from an observer in Hardinsburg, Kentucky. The object was seen on August 8, 1961 at approximately 10:30 P.M. central standard time. The observer described the object as a bright light that maneuvered and hovered in the sky. He stated that the object emitted a beam of light that pulsed and illuminated the ground below. The observer watched the object for approximately 15 minutes before it departed rapidly out of sight. 

There are no other details or information provided in the document besides this handwritten description of the observed aerial object.
