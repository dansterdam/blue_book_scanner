THE NATIVES WHO OBSERVED THE OBJECT STATED IT CAME
WITHIN 200 FEET OF THEM. SEVERAL OF THE OBSERVERS 
DREW SKETCHES WHICH WERE VERY SIMILAR. WHEN THE
OBJECT ROSE INTO THE AIR, A SUCKING NOISE WAS HEARD
AND GRASS WAS SUCKED UP FROM THE GROUND. ONE OF
THE OBSERVERS, A DEAF-MUTE, POSSIBLY INDICATED THAT
A 5 GALLON CAN WAS SUCKED UP, BUT THIS WAS NOT 
ASCERTAINABLE FOR SURE. IN THE PAST, NATIVES HAVE
OFTEN PROVED TO BE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE OBSERVERS
OF UNUSUAL OCCURANCES IN THE ALASKAN AREA. NO
REASONABLE EXPLANATION OF THE OBJECT IS READILY
APPARENT. REQUEST YOUR OPINION OF WHETHER ON-THESPOT INVESTIGATION AND INTERROGATION OF OBSERVERS
BY THIS OFFICE IS WARRANTED
