Dear Mr. Carpenter,

I have received a letter from a man who claims to have seen a UFO. He wants to know what to do with the information. I also received some photos that may contain evidence of a UFO. Could you please advise me on the proper procedures for handling these types of reports and any photographs that may be included? I would appreciate any guidance you can provide.

Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,
