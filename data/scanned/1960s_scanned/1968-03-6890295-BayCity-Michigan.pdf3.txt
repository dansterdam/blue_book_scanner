There are two photographs present in this scanned document.

The first photograph is a compass rose diagram showing the different cardinal directions. It appears to be an illustration used to instruct readers on how to indicate the direction of a sighting when reporting a UFO or other aerial phenomenon.

The second photograph is a landscape sketch showing a person standing in the foreground with a scenic vista in the background. The illustration appears to be providing an example of how to visually depict a UFO sighting using a smaller sketch within the larger drawing.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

"IF, IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE A 'X' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A T' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE PATH OF THE PHENOMENON. ALSO, DRAW IN THE COMPASS DIRECTIONS AS SHOWN IN THE LARGER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SKETCH."
