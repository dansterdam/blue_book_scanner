The image contains a sketch and a compass image, but no photograph. The text describes instructions for the sketch, including marking the position of an object relative to the horizon and compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object (which you first saw) was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
