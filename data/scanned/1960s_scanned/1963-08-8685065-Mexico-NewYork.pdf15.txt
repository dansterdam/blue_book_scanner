The passage this morning from the Universal News states: The persons who saw the light over Chicago early Sunday say they have never seen anything like it before or since, and they describe it as a long, narrow, orange light that appeared suddenly and then disappeared rapidly."

We are informed that the three witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. Clarence L. Lampe and Mrs. Robert H. Hecker, of near Mt. Prospect, Ill., outside Chicago, testified to the appearance of this light. It is stated that Professor J. Allen Hynek, of the Dearborn Observatory of Northwestern University and director of the University's Astronomical Research Institute, said he had insufficient data to determine the nature of the light.
