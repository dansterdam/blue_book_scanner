Dear Major Henton,
As you know I believe in UFO's. I have seen and reported three times as many as some of my colleagues. Only last night I had a very unusual experience at my home 5 miles from here. On the night of the 14th of March at 11:50 PM my wife was wakened by a sound in the living room. She saw an object hovering about 50 feet above the ground for approximately 5 minutes. It was disc shaped, about 50 feet in diameter, and had a soft blue-white light which illuminated the entire area. It moved slowly across the sky in a straight line and then suddenly disappeared. I would appreciate if you would contact me at your earliest opportunity as I have some further information which I believe will be of interest to you.
Yours very truly,
