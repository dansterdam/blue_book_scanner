Believe me, I wouldn't give it a second thought to call if I had a telephone nearby.

The object has since disappeared for this time. I had stated in the questions that it would appear again and it did. Now from further sightings, I expect it back in August.

I also write this letter because since this object has disappeared during this last sighting, we have seen three more going in different directions even though not in the same night.

One night another neighbor watched very fast. We know they are not stars and airplanes travel at night with a red light. Am I right?

There are people who have told my brother that they had seen the object during this sighting who heard and forty-five minutes later during the same night. They did some arithmetic to see it would not appear as they followed the following night and suddenly disappeared and reappeared. And they have commented on these objects with us but they say they have not written to anybody or given it much attention.

Last night I saw one travel from North to South in a dome-shaped fashion. I am going to write to you because in my belief these objects aren't being given the attention they deserve here in Puerto Rico. I am giving the Air Force my fullest cooperation and yet I see no results.

I know you have a lot of work to cope with but this is a concern of the Air Force.

Perhaps you might like to forward this letter to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. It might help further in the evaluation of questionnaires I should have more information for them.

Forgive me for intruding on your time but I feel it is my duty to supply such information.

Thank you for your time and cooperation.
Cordially yours,
