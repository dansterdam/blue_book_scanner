1. On 6 October 1962, at about 1845 hours, local time, the writer, Lt Col George R. Crowley, observed a luminous object in the sky near Naha AFB, Okinawa.
2. The object was first observed in the western sky at an elevation of approximately 50 degrees. It was a bright yellowish-white light, somewhat larger in diameter than a star. The object remained stationary for 2-3 minutes and then began to slowly move northward, changing its shape and color slightly as it moved.
3. After moving northward for approximately 2 minutes, the object began to diminish in brightness and eventually disappeared from sight at about 1855 hours, local time, at an azimuth of about 330 degrees and an elevation of approximately 20 degrees.
4. During the time the object was observed, the sky was clear with good visibility and the moon was not a factor. There were no aircraft in the immediate vicinity as far as the observer could determine.
5. No sound was heard during the observation of the object.
6. The observer, Lt Col George R. Crowley, is an experienced pilot with over 5,000 hours of flying time, the majority of which is jet aircraft time. He is considered to be a reliable and competent observer.
