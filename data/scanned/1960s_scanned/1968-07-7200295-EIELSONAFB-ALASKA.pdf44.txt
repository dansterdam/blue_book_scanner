This report indicates that the 43rd ATS Squadron at Murphy Dome located 35 km west of Fairbanks, Alaska observed a visual sighting of an object in question. The object was described as a light that appeared to be moving in a southerly direction. It was concluded that the object was probably an astronomical body such as the moon, and no evidence of an unusual aerial vehicle was found.
