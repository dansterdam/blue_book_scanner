14. WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
Partially ended.
Please re-inform me: I notice an extremely bright surface a bit dim sometimes. 

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Flew directly away from me until completely disappeared over the horizon.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
Object moving across sky passed behind occasional thin layers of lower clouds, which gave the impression of a dimming.
