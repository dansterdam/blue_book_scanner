The image contains two sketch-like illustrations. The larger illustration is a compass rose, with markings indicating the cardinal directions and intermediate points. The smaller illustrations depict two landscapes, one showing a person standing in the middle of a road surrounded by hills or mountains, and the other showing a more distant landscape with a person or figure in the foreground.
