The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typewritten letter on the letterhead of "Proctor's Bay Lake Lodge" with the signatures of "ALEC & JACK RUTTER" at the bottom.

Text from the document:

Dear Paul:
This letter is to end the unusual mention of your interest and my own time and opportunities offered as a potential host for a future visitation.

I was and remain active in trying to determine the authenticity and source of "signs" that have been presented me during past years. The character of any further contacts would be wholly dependent on their intent and purpose in making themselves known to me. Certainly no "flying" or display of mechanical devices would be part of any plan I might initiate.

Many of the boys seem preoccupied with matters I do not fully understand. I am not impressed by claims or stories unless there is good evidence to support them.

Thank you for sending the list of personnel concerned. It will receive my attention.

"For Families"
All Mrs. Rutter's "Hya's" Helen Leith, Jonathan Shires, etc.
