The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram. The sketch appears to depict some kind of object in the sky, with the caption "ORANGE IN SKY SURROUNDING" written below it. There is also a capital letter "B" written at the bottom of the image.

As an OCR system, I have processed the text in the document and the output is as follows:

ORANGE IN SKY SURROUNDING
B
