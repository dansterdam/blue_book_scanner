The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed report on a UFO sighting. The report describes the witness seeing a formation of UFOs flying at a speed of around 4,000 miles per hour at an altitude of about 30 miles. The formation was V-shaped and consisted of about six saucers initially, which then joined up with two more, making eight saucers total. The saucers were described as bluish white in color. The report states that the saucers "disappeared into the horizon" after a certain point.

Report on UFO --- February 13, 1965

Today at 4:44 P.M. I saw a formation of UFO at a speed of about 4000 miles per hour flying at an altitude of about 30 miles. The formation was V shaped. The formation consisted of about six saucers. The saucers were moving due north and then met up with two more -- making eight saucers. They were of a bluish white color. They were about 100 feet in diameter but I couldn't tell very well at that altitude, they disappeared into the horizon.
