Texas Boy Gets Photos
Fourteen-year-old Jack Spice, son of Mr. and Mrs. Marvin Spice of El Paso, Texas, on June 25, 1964 when he spotted three circular objects in the northwestern sky about 8:30 p.m. He photographed the objects. The two photographs taken have been forwarded to the proper authorities.

The boy's parents notified the authorities at once. According to the report, the boy claimed he had been photographing the objects with his 35mm camera and when he viewed the film, these two frames were all that showed anything unusual.

Colonel William W. Saunders said that there was nothing that would indicate "something that should not have been there", and that the "objects" were probably caused by processing.

A Pacific electric engineer told Mr. Larsen in a telephone conversation on June 29, 1964 that he had first-hand information that the objects were not unusual and that they appeared to be "something quite easily explained".

This case is still not resolved and the source seems quite confident about the chance in altitude. This case is still not accepted and the source seems quite confident about the chance in altitude. This has not accepted our offer of case analysis.
