The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. 

Transcribed text from the document:

The object did not show any of the usual characteristics of meteors, flares, or conventional aircraft. It appeared to be a well defined, brightly illuminated object, traveling at a high rate of speed. The light from the object appeared to vary in intensity at times. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from sight. 

No! 

This would indicate the sighting was not considered to be a conventional aircraft or other known phenomenon. The handwritten note at the bottom appears to be a signature.
