DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

14 October 1964

Dear Mr. Fowler:

We are in receipt of your report of unidentified flying object sightings on 9 September 1964 in the Boston, Massachusetts area. 
These sightings, as seen with your conclusions on sightings, agree in some detail with your conclusions on 2 August 1964 Boston, Massachusetts sightings. As in the previous case, the information does serve as confirmation of the visual contacts displayed by aircraft with unidentifying characteristics.

The sightings of witnesses one and two cannot be evaluated as the same time. This sighting presents some characteristics of a reflection of ground lights, and does not permit establishment of a cloud or haze layer and the presence of a second object.

The Air Force wishes to thank you for your interest in aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,

MAFTON M. JACKS
