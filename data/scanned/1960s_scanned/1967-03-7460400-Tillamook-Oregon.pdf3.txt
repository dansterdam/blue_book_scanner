1ST LT, 32500P-*, MCCORD AFB, WASH, AREA CODE 206, JU 8-2121, EXT 2904, RE 1-0829. INFORMATION OFFICER, BEAN, FRANK W.,
1ST LT, 325CIO, MCCORD AFB, WASH AREA CODE 206, JU 8-2121, EXT 5639, JU 8-5507. CONCERNING: CORRELATION OF INITIAL SIGHTING INFORMATION FROM CIVILIANS WITH THE TRACK DATA OF 689 RADAR SQ. 
WOULD TEND TO INDICATE A/C ACTIVITY OF SOME SORT. HOWEVER, AT THE TIME, NO KNOWN US AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE VICINITY, NOR WAS ANY RECORDED AIR TRAFFIC, OTHER THAN LIGHT PRIVATE TAKING PLACE. DESCRIBED MOVEMENTS OF "TARGETS" BY CIVILIANS INDICATE THAT THEY MAY HAVE HAD FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF A HELICOPTER. FURTHER CHECK OF ALL HELD ACTIVITIES ON OREGON COAST WERE NEGATIVE.
689 RADAR SQ TRACKING IN MANUAL MODE INDICATED THAT THEY WERE GETTING A DEFINITELY METALLIC RETURN IN ADDITION TO THE "USUAL" WEATHER AND WATER "CLUTTER". THE ECHO TRACK DISAPPEARED FROM SCOPE AT AROUND 30 MILES OUT. FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRACK ARE QUITE UNUSUAL, ESPECIALLY THE RAPID DISTANCE CHANGE FROM 39 TO 48 MILES OUT WITHIN ONE MINUTE. NATIONAL GUARD, ARMY AND AIR FORCE ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CHECKED ALL WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. TO DATE THE OBSERVED MOVING LIGHTS HAVE YET TO BE IDENTIFIED ALONG WITH THE RADAR RETURN ON ME REPORT'S. INVESTIGATION MATERIALS BEING FORWARDED UNDER SEPARATE COVER TO FTD WPAFB, ATTN: TDETA.
