DEAR SIR:

In response to your request in today's Clearwater Times,
carried over clearwater Harbor during the fireworks
display on July 4.

The news story referred to six lights, but it
could only confirm the sighting of one light
which was a reddish-green color at a high
altitude and moving from north to south.
Hundreds of people undoubtedly saw the
display and could have had sightings,
but they did not direct any
official reports to this office.
It was not the custom of
the base to routinely
release such
information

at the top of the bluff facing 
east to get the best view of the fireworks. There were several hundred
people there who could have seen any unusual aerial activity. However,
there was no evidence that any definite sightings were reported
to the police or sheriff's office.

I hope this might add something new to your
investigations.

Sincerely,
