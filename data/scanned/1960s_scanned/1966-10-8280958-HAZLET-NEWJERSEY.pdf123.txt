SIGHTING OF ORANGE LIGHTING
Persons making sighting:
Rushville, Ind. Age 20, employed - International Harvester
Glenwood, Ind. Age 22, employed D-H Co Gernet

Date of sighting: Set. Sept 24, 1966 at approx. 8:20 PM
Sky conditions: Clear, very dark night, no moon, no wind, normal night conditions.
Observed light sources: Approximately 3 brilliant flashes of orange red light, one second duration with approx. one second interval between each flash. The color was similar to the tail of a comet but smaller in size. The center of the flashes emitted a steady light approx. 1/3 that much smaller still. The entire size of the flashes was about 3 times the size of a standard flash of lightning.
Note: The object observed appeared as 3 brilliant flashes of orange red light. There was an approx. 1 second interval between each flash. The entire display lasted 2-3 seconds. The object then disappeared. It did not appear to have a definite shape or size. The witnesses could not determine the distance, direction of motion, or altitude of the object.
Increases were sited, however, on the Orange Pike which is located in Rushville, County. When about 1/2 mile southwest of Glenwood this strange object was observed. The witnesses could not determine if the object was airborne or on the ground. It appeared to be far over a field near the Madison River. On two other occasions they observed, at the same location, a similar flashing of light over a field between 8 and 9 PM and a stationary light which appeared to be on the ground. They reported their sightings to the Porter Field of the Air Force but could obtain no further information.
