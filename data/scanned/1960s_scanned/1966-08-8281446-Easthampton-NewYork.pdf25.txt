The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an official U.S. Air Force UFO reporting form. The form appears to be asking various questions about the UFO sighting, such as whether the object disappeared, moved behind something, or changed in appearance. It also asks the witness to describe the object in terms of its size, color, and other details.
