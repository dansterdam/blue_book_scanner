CHILEAN REPORT, TOO
Argentines See Queer Flying Objects in Sky

BUENOS AIRES, AP - A number of Argentines, who are not known for being excitable, have reported seeing strange objects in the sky in recent weeks and some Uruguayans have had similar experiences, according to Francis B. Kent, a United Press International correspondent in Buenos Aires.

"These things turn up suddenly in the sky, hover for a minute or two and then disappear suddenly," Kent reported. "They seem to be structured craft rather than ordinary aircraft."

The report said the strange objects were seen by members of the crew of a transport plane and truck drivers as well as by residents of rural areas. One truck driver said he and two companions watched one of the objects for 10 minutes before it disappeared.

Kent said the objects did not resemble conventional aircraft or satellites and some observers doubted they were caused by any known natural phenomenon.

He said reports of similar phenomena have come from various parts of South America in the last few months. In neighboring Chile there have been reports of unidentified flying objects, according to Kent.
