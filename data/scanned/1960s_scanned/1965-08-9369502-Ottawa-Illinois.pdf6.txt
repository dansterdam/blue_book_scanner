The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text in an old document. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

This report was received from Ottawa, Illinois on 8-9-65.

10:45 P.M. - Witness sighted an unidentified object in the sky over Ottawa, Illinois. The object was described as round, glowing, and traveling at a high rate of speed. The witness claimed the object hovered for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing.

The document appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book UFO report, detailing the sighting of an unidentified object over Ottawa, Illinois on August 9, 1965.
