The investigator small pieces of metal from the burned spot. When examined under a glass, the metal appeared to be "grooved on the surface, like a walnut." The same UFO was seen in daylight, several hours earlier, by some youths who were on a fishing trip southeast of Rockport, Indiana. It was traveling at treetop level, and when it was within 200 yards of the man, it veered away, going out of sight at the same level. The UFO sound, and appeared to be 10 or 15 yards in diameter. It was visible for ten minutes. An unconfirmed report broadcast by a local radio station indicated that the object hit a farmhouse in the vicinity, causing a tiny blow up.
