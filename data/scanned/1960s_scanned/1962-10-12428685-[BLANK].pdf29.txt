The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which contains detailed instructions and guidelines for observers to follow when reporting UFO sightings. The text on the page outlines various aspects to be documented, such as the angle or elevation and azimuth of the object, the flight path and maneuvers, the manner of observation, the time and date of the sighting, and the location and identification of the observer(s).

(2) Angle or elevation and azimuth of object(s) when first observed.
(3) Angle or elevation and azimuth of object(s) upon disappearance.
(4) Description of flight path and maneuvers of object(s).
(5) How did the object(s) disappear? (Instantaneously to the North, etc.)
(6) How long (were) the object(s) visible? (Be specific, 5 minutes, 1 hour, etc.)
c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Use one or any combination of the following items: Ground-Visual, air-visual, ground-electronic, air-electronic. (If electronic, specify type of radar.)
(2) Statement as to optical aids (telescopes, binoculars, etc.) used and description thereof.
(3) If the sighting occurred while air-borne, give type of air-craft, identification number, altitude, heading, speed, and home station.
d. Time and Date of Sighting:
(1) Zulu time-date group of sighting.
(2) Light conditions. (Use one of the following terms: Night, day, dawn, dusk.)
e. Location of Observer(s). Give exact latitude and longitude of each observer, and/or geographical position. In electrical reports, give a position with reference to a known landmark also, such as "2mi N of Deville"; "3mi SW of Blue Lake." Typographical errors or "garbling" often occur in electrically transmitted messages, making location plots difficult or impossible.
