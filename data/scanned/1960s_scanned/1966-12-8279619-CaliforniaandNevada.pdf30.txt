The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with a questionnaire. The text visible in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 11-12-66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: That the movement of this object was so erratic that it was not a flying saucer nor any kind of known aircraft. I could not take a picture of it.
