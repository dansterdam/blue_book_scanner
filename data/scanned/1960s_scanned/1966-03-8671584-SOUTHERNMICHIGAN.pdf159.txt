The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document that discusses Project Blue Book and UFO sightings in Michigan. 

Text from the document:

In conclusion, it is unfortunate that so much press and public attention
was paid to the Michigan sightings which, as far as UFO reports go, do not
compare in substance or in competent witnesses, to many other cases in the
file which got very little attention. But at least, in the Michigan cases
there was a possible fairly obvious physical explanation at hand; with the
others, which remain unidentified, this does not appear to be the case.
