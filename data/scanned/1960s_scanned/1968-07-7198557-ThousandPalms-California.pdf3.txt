There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

DAY 7 JULY 68 
WIND:VERY LIGHT 
CLOUD COVERAGE:CUMULUS CLOUDS/HAZY 
VISIBILITY:GOOD 
WEATHER:PARTLY CLOUDY
COMPLETELY OVERCAST

EVENTS TOOK PLACE AS FOLLOWS: 
BRIGHT MOONLIGHT, 
MOON
AREA UNDER OBSERVATION WAS IN DAYLIGHT. WAS THE PHENOMENON OBSERVED? YES. HOW WAS IT FIRST DETECTED? BY SIGHT. BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE MAJOR SOURCES OF ILLUMINATION PRESENT DURING THE SIGHTING, SUCH AS THE SUN, HEADLIGHTS ON, LIGHTS IN BUILDINGS, ETC. BRIGHT MOONLIGHT. GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON. DESCRIBE ITS MOTION, DURATION, AND APPEARANCE. ITEM APPEARED AS BRIGHT LIGHT MOVING ERRATICALLY IN ZIGZAG PATTERN, CHANGING DIRECTION ABRUPTLY, THEN DISAPPEARING IN STRAIGHT LINE OVER HOUSE IN DISTANCE. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR ABOUT 10-12 MINUTES. ITEM APPEARED TO BE VERY HIGH IN SKY AND SIZE OF SMALL COIN HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. RUN A CHECK TO SEE IF THE PHENOMENON COULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ANY CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATIONS. PHENOMENON COULD NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ANY KNOWN OR CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION. IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT THE PHENOMENON WAS AFFECTED BY THE WEATHER CONDITIONS? NO.

GENERAL COMMENTS: THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND PUZZLING CASES I HAVE ENCOUNTERED. THE ERRATIC PATH AND ABRUPT CHANGES OF DIRECTION OF THE OBJECT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR METEOR. WE HAVE NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS SIGHTING.
