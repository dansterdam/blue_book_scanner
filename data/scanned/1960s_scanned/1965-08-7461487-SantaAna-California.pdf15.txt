Proceeding with the text extraction from the document:

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
It was reported that a civilian who was entering the vicinity of the UFO, in an attempt to photograph it, was waved away by the military guard. This appeared to be in keeping with standard military security precautions. It turned out that the military would not allow close photography of the UFO.

The sighting of individuals at the location of the landed object was widely observed by numerous people in the area. However, the report indicates these witnesses were apparently not able to approach or photograph the object at close range.

The report mentions that after the sighting, the object "disappeared into the haze". No photographs of the object itself are included in this document.

G. As the end of the working day, Mr D. returned to his office and prepared to depart. He was subsequently interviewed and provided the following information:

On the evening of 7 August 1965, Mr D. received a telephone call from a person who claimed to have seen a landed UFO in the Santa Ana area of California. The caller stated that the object was visible and that he had taken some photographs of it. The caller then asked Mr D. to come to the location to verify the sighting and obtain copies of the photographs.

Mr D. indicated that he was interested in the report and agreed to go to the location. When he arrived, he found a group of individuals who had also responded to the call and were waiting at the site. However, Mr D. was subsequently informed by military personnel that he would not be allowed to approach the UFO or obtain photographs, as the area was under military control and closed to the public.

The report indicates that the photographs taken by the initial caller were eventually forwarded to the main office in New York, but no further details are provided about their contents or disposition.
