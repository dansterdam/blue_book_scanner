as bright and sharp as a "shooting star". Slightly larger than a star seen by the naked eye. But not as bright as a bright planet. Seemed to be a flash of light, similar to a flash of lightning, but to flash slowly, most just a streak.

It shot towards Boone, North Carolina; passed towards Katy Highway and Railroads.

The speed, height above the horizon, and trajectory seem to be very high and fast. If it had been only 30 miles away, it would have been only a few feet above the ground. It was estimated to be 500 miles away at a height of about 50 miles and traveling at incredible speed of about 600 mph at a distance of 700 miles and a height of 130 miles. It would have to have been well within the earth's shadow by that time of night.

Or falling sharp glows in the trajectory seems to rule out a meteor or falling object. It must have been a solid object reflecting the light of the sun in some way. There was no foot, or trailing plume or dust visible such as would have been expected with a meteor or falling object.
