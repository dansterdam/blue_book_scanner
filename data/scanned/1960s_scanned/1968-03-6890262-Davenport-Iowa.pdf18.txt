Enclosed is the text transcribed from the document:

"Explanation of your description of the event as you described would on the face of it seem to indicate a possible physical anomaly. However, it is with much difficulty that I can speculate as to the actual nature of the event when only a cursory description is available. Inasmuch as the normal investigative procedures of this office have not been followed, it is unlikely that any definitive conclusions can be drawn without additional data. I would appreciate if you could furnish any further details you may have available which might assist in a more detailed analysis. Thank you for your cooperation."
