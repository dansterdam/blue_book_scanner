UFO Observations, 31 Jul 67 and 6 Sep 67
See Attached List for Addressees

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of two different unidentified flying object reports from the Indianapolis area.
2. On the evening of 31 July 1967, one observer saw an object that then best described by ordinary objects, looked like two connected white illuminated balls of balloon size. These were connected when descending, and they separated when ascending.
3. We also received a report from the morning of 6 September 1967 in which another observer sighted a white saucer shaped craft that was about the size of a dime at arm's length.
4. If you were in the area on or about these days, or if you know what may have been the cause for the sightings, we would appreciate your letting us know.
5. Thank you for any assistance that you can provide in helping us to solve these two cases.
