16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following about the object:
a. Sound - Noiseless
b. Color - a reddish white

18. We wish to know the angular size, in inches, measured at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match stick held at arm's length. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, please state how much of the object would have been covered.
We were unable to make such a check at the time, as the object was too far to make such an estimate. Its estimated size was approximately 20 feet in diameter from our best estimate.

19. Draw a picture and show that with approximate sizes, labeling and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protuberance, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please do show beside the drawing the direction the object was moving.

The document appears to be a completed questionnaire from a witness regarding a UFO sighting.
