SUBJ: INFORMATION FOR PROJECT FILE 
TYPED: 16 FEB 61
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
T_CARD NO: 55 Incident reported 13 November 1960, and forwarded 1 December 1960. A signature of one of the principals involved in this UFO sighting was made to ARC or other of the witnesses mentioned by number.

2. The information contained in the newspaper account of the sighting called for an on-the-ground investigation. The newspaper indicated that two independent witnesses had reported the incident, and on-the-spot investigation seemed justified.

3. The account by [REDACTED] indicates that 21 October 1960 was during the early phases of the 1960 satellite launching activity. As was the case in many similar incidents reported by Aerospace Defense Command, some of the sightings were likely attributable to satellite launchings at that time.
 
4. it was not possible to obtain any reliable data. This conclusion is based on the distance of the sightings to the witnesses, the brief time the objects were visible, and the absence of corroborative data.
