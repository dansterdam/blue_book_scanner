The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document. It does not contain any photographs, but rather shows a letter from the Federal Aviation Agency to Colonel James C. Manatt discussing the availability of records related to sightings in the area. The text of the letter is as follows:

FEDERAL AVIATION AGENCY
Report Traffic Control Tower 
Philadelphia International Airport
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19153
February 6, 1967

James C. Manatt, Colonel, USAF  
Headquarters Foreign Technology Division (AFSC) 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433

Dear Colonel Manatt:

After a thorough check of the records we have available for September 22, 1966, we can find no evidence to indicate that any individual airplane signals were recorded or observed in this area. Since we cannot keep our daily records and tapes for a period of 15 days, it is impossible to check on individual sightings in the past.

We are forwarding a copy of your letter to Mr. R. Probst, Chief, General Aviation District Office, North Philadelphia Airport, who may be able to furnish you a list of persons issued banner towing authorizations.

(Sincerely)
Leo E. Marshall
Chief Controller
