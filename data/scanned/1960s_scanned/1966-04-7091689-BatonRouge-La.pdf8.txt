The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page includes a sketch with instructions, as well as a compass rose diagram. There is also text describing the observations reported by the witnesses.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
They traveled straight in the same irregular V-shape pattern.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
About 10 or 12
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
They played in this pattern out of sight.
