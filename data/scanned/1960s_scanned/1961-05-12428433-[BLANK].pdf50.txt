Dr. Ross: I think the things that we are going to tell you are as we got up into space. We started to realize there are other problems such as high temperatures. We wanted to find out if we could make these materials that normally go up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, so they can withstand temperatures up to 1,500 or 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. We found that materials like some of the stainless steels or Rene-41 have very good temperature strength curve. Actually, you can get up to 1,500 or 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. So we continued down into fibers so we could weave it into cloths. We found we could do this. We had to draw down until we got some of the fibers to a third of a human hair.

The next problem was to develop an elastomer that would be able to withstand the kind of temperatures that we are going to encounter. We don't feel we have the answer to this problem yet. We do feel we have been making some headway in this particular direction.

Now, since we are not in the space environment, it is very difficult to evaluate some of these materials on Earth. So we have to attempt to simulate conditions as closely as possible. We try to do these in altitude chambers using high temperatures and high pressures, but the problem is you can only do this for a short time over the material itself, so we developed a little hydrogen and oxygen rocket. We did that a little material in the blast of this rocket and try to evaluate what takes place here.

Now, some of the high-temperature material tests - I will now notice that this is the type of material, if you have in your hands, in a frame in a hydrogen-oxygen rocket blast. It will start to glow and it will actually get red hot there. It still retains most of its properties. As I say, it is the type that we are using to try to screen the different kinds of materials that we would need for high-temperature re-entry.
