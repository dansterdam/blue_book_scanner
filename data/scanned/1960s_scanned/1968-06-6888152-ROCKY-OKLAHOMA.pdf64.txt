Yeah, I know. I never heard anything about it and I just figured the doggoned thing probably cared about it.
Hynek: No, we do care about it, but there is a great deal of work to do. You just have my address, don't you, to send this stuff to. I'd appreciate your sending this to very much because we are doing our best to try and make sense out of all of these down.
Well, I'll tell you what, the way the guys acted out here, I thought maybe they had something up they weren't telling us about.
Hynek: No, I don't believe that was the case.
Well, that is the way they acted.
Hynek: You mean the guys from the Air Force?
Yeah.
Hynek: Let me ask you one other thing. How long would you say you were really a frightened by the things you saw? Did it affect your sleep or your dreams or anything like that?
Well, it really shook us up about two weeks. I've been having trouble getting to sleep. I believe in them now.
Hynek: Have you done much reading about UFOs?
Sure have since then. And, I'm going to take some astronomy.
Hynek: Well, that's good, maybe we will see you here at Northwestern sometime, who can tell. Well, fine, keep up your interest in astronomy and please do get that sketch to me as soon as you can.
Okay, you'll be getting it right soon. Thanks for calling.
