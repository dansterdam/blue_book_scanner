The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It does not contain any photographs, only a form filled out with handwritten responses.

The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Vanished

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know.
If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
_________

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. 
If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:
_________

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Noiseless
b. Color: White

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Approximately 3/4 of the size of the object

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the shape, size, color, flight characteristics, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
