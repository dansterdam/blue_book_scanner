34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5 Month May
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or previous questioning:  
At this time a usual bright object was sighted in the sky above my home which was witness by my mother and my sister 1 son-in-law. This object was witnessed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes moving slowly from the northwest to the southeast, changing colors from a bright white to green and back to bright white. At times this object seemed to stop and hover and other times it would pick up speed and dart from one direction to another. After this sighting I requested a copy from the Air Force which I understand is to work. The time, date, information to go with this, I will furnish at a later date as I have misplaced it at this time. When I locate this information, I will forward it to you. I have the original information but do not have it available at this time. I feel that this sighting is very important and should be investigated thoroughly as there were 3 persons who witnessed this object. I would say the object was approximately 100 to 200 feet in the air and about the size of a small automobile. The night was clear with a partial moon and the object was easily visible to the 3 witnesses. At times there were green lights on the object and at other times there were no lights visible. The object seemed to change in size as it moved. There were no sounds emitted from the object. The object seemed to move with ease and without any visible means of propulsion. I would appreciate it very much if you would investigate this sighting and let me know the results of your findings. Thank you kindly for your assistance in this matter.
