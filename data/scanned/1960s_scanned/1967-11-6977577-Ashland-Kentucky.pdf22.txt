Re: TELETYPE (UFOS)

Dear Sir:

Reference your inquiry dated January 2, 1968, concerning any information this department might have relative to a reported UFO sighting in this area the same night. The enclosed newspaper clippings contain about the same type of reports this department received on that particular night.

For your information, this department has not received any other reports since that time concerning people who saw anything unusual in the skies.

Hoping this will be of assistance to you in your investigation, I remain.

Very truly yours,
/s/ David I. Harter
Chief of Police
