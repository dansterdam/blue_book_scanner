The image contains a photograph of a "Re-Entry Model Packaged" which appears to be a schematic diagram or technical illustration. The diagram shows the various components of the re-entry package, including parachute stowage, guidance/communication, electron and rudder servos, reaction control tank, inflation sphere, helium payload, and a 9-inch radius metal nose.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES IN SPACE
Why do we think we can do this now? 
I think if we can go on through the slides, I think I can show you how the entire thing could be packaged into a small package, about 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet,
and in this small package, contained by cylinder and spheres, show the approximate volume of the hard structures, the instrumentation, the gas supply, as they would fit.
The space around here is taken up by the flexible structure. When you get that into space, it opens to this size vehicle.

Figure 22 shows how small it is when it starts and how large it is when opened up. You notice the parts in here are the same where they are needed in the package and how they are distributed to figure 23 is another view of the high-altitude re-entry ship. It has the same aerodynamic structure material is made out of a metal and has the same kind of properties as any hard structure. The slide will show it as clearly as any person we think we can do more things with this approach than with some of the hard structures that we can go to a higher weight vehicle that could fly in the atmosphere at high altitudes.
