First saw it, it was like a giant man hovering in the sky. It was low, maneuver, gave the impression of a big strong fellow just hanging there, just seemed to drift or glide along without any visible means of propulsion. It seemed to make no sound at all. It kind of drifted toward the trees about the tip building we use as a camp, and was just hovering there, maybe a minute. So sudden I didn't think of anything but looking at it. Then it started to drift away. I was watching it and suddenly it stopped over the trees and started to shoot up at an angle very fast and was out of sight in no time. There was certainly no noise that I could hear as it shot away. That is about all I can say. It was like nothing I have ever seen before or since. It was only a short time, maybe a minute, that I saw it. As I looked at it, it seemed so big and close, I could see that it was not an ordinary aircraft, that was my first thought. I looked in the direction it came from, but I could not see anything. The only thing I could tell, it was like a giant man just hanging in the air, no wings or any visible means of propulsion.
