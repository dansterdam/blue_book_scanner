There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten letter describing an observed unidentified flying object.

Dear Sirs,

Sunday night July 4, 1965 at approximately 9:30 P.M. my cousin and I saw an unidentified flying object in the sky. I was visiting my cousin who lives in Ashington, Mass. 02151 when this occurred at 9:30. We were casually observing the eastern sky, when suddenly we spotted the object. I was looking through the telescope when my attention was called to the moving object in the sky. Before we saw the object start to move, it was stationary, forming with other stars an acute isosceles triangle. Then it sped up rapidly and it appeared to be traveling at an approximately 50 thousand miles an hour. It disappeared as it moved through the object moving across the sky and vanished. This object which I observed earlier, this object which was in the eastern sky, began moving.
