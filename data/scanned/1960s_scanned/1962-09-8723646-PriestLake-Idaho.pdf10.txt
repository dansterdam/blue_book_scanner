"NO CASE (Information Only)

3 September 1962
San Juan, Argentina

On the night of September 2nd, a farmer named Juan Sosa was visiting his brood mare in the countryside near San Juan, Argentina. Around 7:30pm, he noticed a strange object in the sky which he described as a luminous, pulsating disc-shaped craft. It was hovering over a nearby hill at an estimated altitude of about 100 yards. The object remained stationary for about 10 minutes, then rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight. Sosa reported that the object did not make any noise and left no trail. All of those who were present at the time, including Sosa, had seen the UFO in the sky."
