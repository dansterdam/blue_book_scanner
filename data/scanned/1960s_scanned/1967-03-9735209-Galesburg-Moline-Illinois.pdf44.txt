Catholic nun, Sacred Heart School, Sister [redacted] was contacted at her quarters on the 16th of March at 2100 hours. An interview was conducted and the following statement was given:

At 11:05 on the 9th of March, I saw a blue jet and a pink object in formation. I don't remember the direction they were traveling but they appeared to be directly overhead. I don't remember the duration but they were about 15,000 feet high. The pink object seemed to shoot up very fast and then spotted the jet. The pink object continued and entered the school's grounds and then exited the school's.
