The Eagle River Incident
A NEW CONTACT CLAIM

A LIEUTENANT and two men, who were sent out, as a special patrol, to investigate a "sighting" of a strange object, at Eagle River, Wisconsin, have filed a rather startling report with Capt. Harold Fletcher, information officer for the 547th AC&W Squadron.

The lieutenant reported as follows: 

"We had just started on our routine patrol when, without warning, we noticed a strange, peculiarly-shaped object hovering in the sky, about 50 feet off the ground. This object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and a dull, metallic color. 

As we approached the object, it began to move away and then suddenly it accelerated with tremendous speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. 

We immediately began an investigation of the area and noticed that a large patch of the ground seemed to have been scorched and a rather unusual depression was found in the center of this scorched area. We were unable to determine the cause of the scorching and depression and have turned the matter over to higher authorities for further investigation."

Ground crews have been sent to the area to make a thorough examination of the site and to determine, if possible, the cause of the scorching and depression in the ground.

This new "contact" claim is being carefully investigated by officials of the 547th AC&W Squadron and we will report any further details that may be obtained.
