Proposed reply to letter from (Sighting: Apr 8, 1967)

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This replies to your recent letter in which you requested information on your unidentified observation of April 3, 1967.

We have been unable to reach a definite conclusion on your observation because of insufficient information. Essential data such as flight characteristics, angular velocities, maneuvers, etc., are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to your nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data base.

If you should ever witness another strange phenomena in our atmosphere, contact the UFO investigator at Stewart AFB, New York.
