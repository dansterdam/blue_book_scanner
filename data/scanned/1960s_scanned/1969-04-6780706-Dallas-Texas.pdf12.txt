The text in the document is as follows:

This replies to your letter of April 30, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we could not attempt to tell you what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it to the address shown, only, will we be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Would you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Such base in the United States is the nearest Air Force installation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the project Blue Book file we are including.

Sincerely,

JAMES W. AIKMAN
