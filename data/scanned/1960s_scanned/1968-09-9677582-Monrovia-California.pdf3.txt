This space is oppd. 3 '-3 1/2 in. and has part hore but appeared to be a disc with gray color - it was hoverimp over a area long about 5 to 10 seconds and mowing at a reasonable speed and appeared to be about 500 ft high. On both side of it there appeared sort of a light hue or glow. The object was visible for 5 to 10 seconds and then it shot straight up and out of sight at a terrific rate of speed.
