AF NR 5: Ektachrome daylight film, Frames 37, 39, 40, 41 submitted by Mr. [redacted], Santa Maria, California
1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-42 submitted by Major R. Quintanilla, Jr., USAF/UFO. The work order requested photo analysis of four photographs of color slides and identification of unidentified objects appearing thereon.
2. ANALYSIS: Frames numbers 37, 39, 40 and 41 of Ektachrome daylight film were received with the work order. The absence of Frame 38, which would normally appear within the sequence exposed, is not explained in the work order.
The images on Frames 39, 40 and 41 were generally similar and consisted of a roughly circular light-toned image. A crescent-shaped portion of the object was less dense than the remainder. On Frame 37, the object consisted of a circular light-toned image with a small darker image in its center. The other three frames contained light-toned images with undefined details. The objects were generally aligned and equally spaced except as noted below:
(1) Frame 37: 3 images present, two in line, the third less distinct and slightly of alignment. The second distance between them greater than the first.
(2) Frame 39: 10 images with a void between the fifth and sixth and between the ninth and tenth images. The voids were of sufficient size to accommodate an added image.
(3) Frame 40: 9 images with voids between the second and third images. The sizes were to accommodate 2 images, between the fifth and sixth to accommodate a single image.
