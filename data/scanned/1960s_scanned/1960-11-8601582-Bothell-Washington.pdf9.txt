Referring to the date of my previous report on the month of OCTOBER 20, 1959 I went to East on a business trip and while traveling on Highway 99 at about 7:30 PM at a point about 10 miles north of Bothell, Washington, I observed a brilliant object in the sky which riveted my attention. It appeared to be circular in shape and was without any markings or lights and was of a brilliant silver color reflecting the light of the sky. Its size appeared to be about 3 times the size of a normal 4 engine jet. It remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then suddenly disappeared without any sound. I request no publicity in this matter as I have no desire to become involved in this subject more than is necessary.
