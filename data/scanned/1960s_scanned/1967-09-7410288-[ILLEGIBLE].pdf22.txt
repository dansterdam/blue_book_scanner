COLONEL MANATT:

I HAVE JUST RECEIVED YOUR LETTER TODAY AND BE GLAD TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. QUESTIONS WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND HER SISTER ALSO SEE THE UFO? ANSWER DEBBIE'S MOTHER WAS SAYING THEY DID THAT AND IF SHE NOTICED SHE PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS A JET. HER SISTERS WERE FOOLING OR PLAYING AROUND IN CAR. THEY DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE IT. WHEN WE SEE THERE'S A CLEAR LIGHT (THAT'S WHAT GARY C'S GIRLFRIEND DOES THE SAME THING). TO YOURS TRULY,
