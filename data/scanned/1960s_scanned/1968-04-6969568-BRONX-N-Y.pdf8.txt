The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass rose with labeled cardinal directions. The bottom illustration depicts a person standing on a road in a landscape with hills or mountains in the background. There is also a small sketch of an irregularly shaped object in the bottom right corner.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from the document is:

6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE DIRECTION , WHEN FIRST SEEN . PLACE A SEE ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE DIRECTION OF THE COMPASS CARD.

BE SURE TO FOLLOW BELOW. PLACE AT THE POSITION OF THE MAIN OBSERVER, WHEN AT POSITION SEEN. USING A LINE INDICATES a SLIGHT UPWARD AND DOWNWARD MOTION. CURVES INDICATE DEFINITE ASCENT OR DESCENT. SMALLER SKETCH SHOWS MOTION OR CHANGE.
