This page does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a typed document from the Department of the Air Force discussing an unidentified flying object that was observed at 1700Z. The document describes the object as appearing as a large circular area of high intensity light with a dark center, similar to an eclipse. It also mentions the object traveling east at orbital speed, leaving a faint glow of light trail, and being sighted by aircraft at the time. The document concludes with a note about advising CIN and OOP-OP at 1605L on 21/19/12 SEP RUHRPH.
