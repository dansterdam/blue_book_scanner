GENTLEMEN:

ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 28 AT 10:00 P.M. I RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM MY CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND, (REDACTED), HE HAD OBSERVED A GROUP OF ABOUT 5 TO 8 OBJECTS PASS OVERHEAD. AS BEST I COULD DETERMINE, THE OBJECTS WERE METALLIC, CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, BLINKED ON AND OFF, AND WERE TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. AFTER OBSERVING THEM FOR SOME TIME, HE CALLED TO ALERT ME TO THEIR PRESENCE. HERE IS THE STORY IN HIS OWN WORDS:

"AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM CHURCH ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 28, AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 P.M., I OBSERVED A GROUP OF WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. I CALLED (REDACTED) TO ALERT HIM. PUT OFF GOING OUT UNTIL ABOUT 10:15 P.M. WHEN I DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE AND OBSERVE THEM FURTHER. WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE, I COULD NO LONGER SEE THEM. I WAITED AROUND FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES HOPING THEY WOULD RETURN, BUT THEY DID NOT. I DECIDED TO GO BACK INSIDE. UPON RETURNING INSIDE, I IMMEDIATELY CALLED (REDACTED) TO REPORT WHAT I HAD SEEN."

I DECIDED TO CALL YOU SINCE I WAS INTERESTED IN THIS REPORT AND WANTED TO GET YOUR COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS. I AWAIT YOUR REPLY.

SINCERELY,
(REDACTED)
