Alaska UFO Probe Under Way
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A bizarre object sighted through Western Alaska skies last Sunday baffled Alaska Air Command and was answered in its wake, they said.
Was it a jet plane? It so, a very mysterious one.
The Alaska Air Command hopes to come up with some of the answers today.
The flame-snitching object was reported by several persons from Nome to St. Michael, about 130 miles away. They said it appeared to be traveling from north to south at a tremendous speed and was hurried southeasterly.
The reports were conflicting, Major Roy E. Haines of Ladd Headquarters Air Force Base here, said yesterday.
Some said it was low and slow, some said it was high and fast, he said.
A Pan Alaska Airways employ at Nome, A. Walsh, said the object was traveling 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the earth. He described it as silvery and tubular, some what like a jet plane, with strange flames shooting from it.
Mrs. Stanley Mollor of Nome said "it had the appearance of a large star and was very, very brilliant white." Neither she nor Walsh could tell whether it had wings.
Observers said the mysterious object curved up and away as it approached them.
Some, as it was manned and controlled.
