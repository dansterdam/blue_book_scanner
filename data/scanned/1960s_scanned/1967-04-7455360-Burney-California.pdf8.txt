A review of our records indicates that no balloon flight was launched on 18 April 1966. However, a balloon flight of 34.8 hours duration was launched on 13 April 1966, and was reported in the full 1966 issue of the Blue Book Summary. A balloon launched from Holloman AFB, New Mexico was in a northeasterly direction with termination performed near Washington, D.C. 15, 1966.
