WITNESS # 4 (Independent)

BLOWN - was in his bedroom when he heard an automobile look to the east and saw there was a light, and the object itself came from the northeast and crossed in front of his house to the west. The boy said the "flying saucer" had come down and picked up a light and took it up again. 

The following is the description of the object:
The shape of the object was oval. The size of the object was that of a "football" or slightly larger. It had a very bright light, stationary, and was also compared with the interior dome light of a car. The object was hovering about 50 feet above the ground.

Copied from sketch on UFO Data Sheet
EVALUATION: After interviews and cross-checking the accounts, the interviewing officer indicated that they were wellmeaning sincere people who seemed to know what they were talking about, and felt that they had actually seen a UFO. The officer said that Littleton Police Station but they had received no UFO reports that officer was taken aware of at the time.

I feel that the size of the objects could have been smaller than described, for this and some differences in their descriptions of the object and its maneuvers, it will be difficult to assess the significance of this information that may be turned up as soon as I receive.
