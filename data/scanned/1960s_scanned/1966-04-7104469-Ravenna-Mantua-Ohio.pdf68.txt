Here 'n There

Maybe there's a UFO base in Conway, West Virginia. Residents among others, say a "UFO" descended in a nearby field and hovered near the home of William Boyd, who was a cruiser at a station with a 3:00 a.m. assignment.

Wylie doesn't buy the theory that it was a private airplane with an illumination under its wing as was described at 3:00 a.m. 

It was a reddish-orange, saucer-like object with white lights on its circumference.

It hovered at it through binoculars, saw no sign of anything and said that, unlike an airplane, the "UFO" did not make a sound.

Like a UFO that Ohio police saw near Conway, early Sunday, the local police also watched the "cruiser" disappear in the distance.
