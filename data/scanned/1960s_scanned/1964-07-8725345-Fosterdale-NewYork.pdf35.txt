e. Comments of Investigating Officer:
(1) The description of the unidentified flying object as given by Mr. [name redacted] is that I have witnessed. The lack of a trail or exhaust and Mr. [name redacted]'s observation that the object was burning, i.e. luminous, is also characteristic of a flying object.
(2) The course of the object, and its speed would rule out the possibility of it being a satellite, balloon, aircraft, or object dropped from an aircraft.
(3) When discussing the sighting with Mr. [name redacted], he seemed to identify the object to identify the object he observed. He positively identified the object as an unidentified flying object.
(4) My conclusion based on the information above is that the object was a meteor.
