The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The diagram depicts a symmetrical shape with various lines, dashes, and labels. The central portion appears to resemble a triangle or boomerang shape, with a dashed line at the top and bottom. The labels indicate "WIND 270°" and the cardinal directions North, East, South, and West.

As an OCR system, I will now extract all the text found in the document:
