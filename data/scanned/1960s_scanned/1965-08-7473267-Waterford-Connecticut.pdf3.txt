Crater surfaces of the moon look light brown in color. That is why I could see this black specs or objects moving across this moon's surface. This object must have been quite large to enable me to see it as a black spec. After looking at the moon for ten minutes I then went back to look at the object. About a half an hour later I looked at the moon again and observed this same object still orbiting the moon, but I noticed that the object reaching the moon's surface stopped for about five minutes than continued on its orbit. I am staying in Niantic, Connecticut with my family for the summer and our house or rather the house that we are renting is on a hill over looking the ocean and at night I lay in bed as my room faces the water looking at the moon thinking about the next day's work. This is the first time that I have ever seen this object crossing the moon. Gentlemen I am not in a habit of making up stories for fun of it just to get my name in the paper. I don't need the publicity. I am 55 years old with two years of college in business with my father, who owns a large furniture store in Norwich, Connecticut called ****** Furniture Company. I am soon going to open my own business and call it Zenith T.V., Hot Point Appliances, ect. and all I am need is people hearing that I am seeing flying saucers, flying objects, ect. Why they might think that I was a nut person the expression and that would be bad for business. How ever I did see this object and whether it is something or not is up to you. I am telling you that I have never seen it crossing the moon before this evening.
