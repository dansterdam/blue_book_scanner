The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and their appeals to Congress regarding the Air Force's handling of the UFO program. The text discusses Mr. Speights' letter and NICAP's publication "UFO Investigator", as well as observations regarding the Air Force's record of attempts to intercept UFOs.

Support to President Kennedy during the final hours. The principal claims of these organizations are that unidentified flying objects are interplanetary space craft and that the Air Force is withholding the information.

The most active and influential of these organizations is the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). This organization is headed by Major Donald E. Keyhoe, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.).

NICAP, through its publication the "UFO Investigator," has made constant appeals to its members to write to their congressmen requesting a hearing to investigate the Air Force's handling of the UFO program. It is our opinion that this appeal prompted Mr. Speights' letter to you.

Mr. Speights, a youth of about 19, has written to us on two previous occasions and has received an answer to each of his two letters. From comparison of the language in his previous letters with that in the letter to you it is obvious that Mr. Speights has had assistance with the majority of the information contained in this most recent letter. It is probable that he copied it from some NICAP publication.

Following are some observations regarding statements in Mr. Speights' letter:

The Air Force has no record of the number of attempts which have been made by our pilots to intercept UFO's; however, such action is not unusual nor does it prove that these objects/phenomena are interplanetary space craft.
