Radar Tie-In Sought To UFO Report
Socorro, N.M. (AP) - Radar operators were investigating yesterday whether a saucer-shaped object they spotted in the skies over Socorro, New Mexico, was the same one reported by police. Col. George L. Higgs, commander of the 29th Air Division, said the radar contact was made at about the same time and place where a policeman said he saw an egg-shaped object land and then depart. The officer, Lonnie Zamora, said the object was about 15 to 20 feet long and 10 to 15 feet high, with red lettering or markings on the side. He said it took off with a roar and a blast of flame, leaving an imprint on the ground. The Air Force said it was investigating the incident. Higgs said the radar contact lasted about 10 minutes.
