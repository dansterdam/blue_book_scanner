The image contains a handwritten sketch of what appears to be a UFO or aircraft. The sketch depicts an object with red lights and some labeling, including "RED" and "BLINKING O". There is no other photograph present in this image.

Around the last week of October, I was walking under the stars. Suddenly, I spotted a satellite (or supposed but this is doubtful) that appeared to stop. This startled me and an objective in my mind: Was it or wasn't it? After that when I looked back with my mother, she spotted a satellite and showed me something extra I had not seen. Then, the satellite (?) started moving, which was lighter than others I had seen. Sirs, I live in the Azores. Since not only I but many of my friends have spotted numerous UFOs, I feel that you may find something extra if you established an observatory here on the Lajes Air Force Base. Any information will be greatly appreciated.

Also, could you please send me some more information on Project Blue Book and how I might help you with any of my ideas possible?

Thank you.
