Appearance - wind as thought a "draft" as they lifted off very straight and strong winds to lift and move the craft. Complete reading - with case drawing. People searched - residential, Redwood City, Calif. Redwood City, Calif. Redwood City, Calif. My home is at Resident City, very near the location where the object was observed may believe one second seen the object for approximately 4-5 minutes and I observed more than I have ever seen before. Hovering motionless in the Redwood City area, 10:00 PM or 12:00 when I first observed the object could well compare to the size of a automobile, brightly lit underneath. An conclusion - not quite positive, just the impression given, that this object could not be classified as a normal aircraft.
