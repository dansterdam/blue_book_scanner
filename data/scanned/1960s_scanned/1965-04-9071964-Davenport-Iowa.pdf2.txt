1. Attached are two (2) photographs of an unidentified object which was which you said in your letter of 8 November 1967 that "produced these photographs". As you can see, the "object" appears to be the result of a chemical "mess" on the print.

2. You also stated that you were not complete since you did not forward the original negative and also, you did not observe an object. Thank you for submitting your photographs to the Air Force.
