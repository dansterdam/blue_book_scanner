THE INVESTIGATION

Immediately upon returning home that evening I called USAF and reported the incident over the radio. We then proceeded to the site and conducted our investigation. The investigator interview with the witness reveals the following details:

The witness observed an unidentified object flying in the sky. The object appeared to be circular in shape and emitted a bright light. The witness observed the object for several minutes while looking up in the sky for the object.

The investigation revealed that the witness was credible and had a good reputation in the community. The witness appeared to be genuinely concerned about what was observed and wanted to share the information with the authorities. The witness was cooperative throughout the interview process and provided a detailed account of the incident.

After a thorough examination of the site and the witness's testimony, the investigator concluded that the incident was likely an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The investigator noted that the witness's description of the object and the circumstances surrounding the sighting were consistent with other similar reports received by the project.

The investigator further noted that the witness was not a particularly good observer and it was possible that the object was a conventional aircraft or some other known phenomenon. However, the investigator was unable to definitively identify the object based on the available information.

In conclusion, the investigator determined that the incident warranted further investigation and recommended that additional resources be allocated to continued monitoring and analysis of the case.
