There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

So that in my belief it has shown up a couple of times during the day before and some time after. The first one appeared at 13:30 pm. Later on, we went to the local police station and reported it as they have their own reports of strange objects seen in the sky. It has been changed to 10:30 pm. The color was bright white and remained stationary most of the time and at times it would move very slowly to the east. It would remain visible for about 15-20 minutes. From 22:30 on it had a reddish hue and moved at a faster rate than before. As far as I can remember, this is the extent of the information that I can give you at this time. I hope this helps in some way.

September 6, 1961 is when this object was observed. The possible reason for the sighting was that there were some nearby maneuver or test flights going on at the time. The object in question was unlike any conventional aircraft that I am familiar with. Its movement and behavior were quite strange and not typical of any known aircraft. I would appreciate any feedback you can provide on this report. Please let me know if you need any clarification or additional details.
