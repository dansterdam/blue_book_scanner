LOCAL FAMILY SEES MYSTERY LIGHTS IN SOUTH PART OF CITY

Five local residents claimed to have observed a strange phenomenon in the sky over the south part of Centralia about 9:15 p.m. Wednesday. They said the lights would brighten and then dim and seemed to move erratically. 

The four other witnesses, in addition to the five initial observers, were members of the Bryant family. They said the lights remained visible for about 10-15 minutes.

Mrs. Bryant said she and her husband first noticed the lights while driving home from their business establishment. They could not imagine what the lights might be.

The lights were reported, in the same general area, by other residents of the south part of Centralia, Illinois. The lights seemed to hover and then move away at high speed. After they had disappeared, the lights would reappear, but it did not follow any regular pattern.

According to Mrs. Bryant, the lights appeared to be about the size of a basketball, and were a very bright white light. She said that she and her husband saw two lights Wednesday night, one of which appeared to split into three separate lights.
