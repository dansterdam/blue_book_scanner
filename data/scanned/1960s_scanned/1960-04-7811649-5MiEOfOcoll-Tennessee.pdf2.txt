There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page of text from an old Project Blue Book document.

The text in the document reads as follows:

The object was moving from approximately North to approximately South at a very fast rate of speed. It was observed that it was traveling diagonally, slow, which would be the impression at the height it must have been traveling. The object did not seem to be falling, but was moving away from us at a great height that caused it to disappear.

I stopped the car on the pavement to watch the show for a minute or so. When I looked up to see if I could still observe it, it was gone. It had just disappeared. I was really just mystified about what I had seen. I immediately felt that it was not the atmosphere and were certainly going to hit the atmosphere and burn up. But also remembered that this was to have been a highly sophisticated and the first maneuver we saw this one as it showed 7:10 P.M.

I got a good look at it through the pavement with cars and trucks passing by it. the other direction I pulled off the Roadside and watched out the window where I had a fine view of it for about 10 minutes, but then it suddenly disappeared behind a black cloud and disappeared behind it. remember the long way and its speed, rapid acceleration and deceleration made for some strange and unexpected behavior as the objet to the time it disappeared over the horizon.

As we turned into the parking area, we saw the object re-appear and then change shape somewhat and disappeared out low on the horizon. It was blinking a dark red instead of the almost white color it had when I first observed it.
