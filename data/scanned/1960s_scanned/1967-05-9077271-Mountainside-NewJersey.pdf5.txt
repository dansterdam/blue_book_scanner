The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that provides detailed photographic data about the camera used to capture the image. The text on the page lists various technical specifications of the camera, such as the type and make of the camera, the focal length and type of lens, the brand and type of film used, the shutter speed, lens opening, filters used, use of tripod or solid stand, use of panning, and the exact direction the camera was pointing.
