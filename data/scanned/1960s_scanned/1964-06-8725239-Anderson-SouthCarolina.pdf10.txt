This is in reply to your letters of recent date
relating to the sighting of Defense and so members
of the Air Force, in further reference to unidentified
flying objects.

The project Blue Book Office at Wright Patterson
Air Force Base has queried the personnel of Anderson
Airport, South Carolina, concerning the report of an
unidentified flying object by Mr.
Mr. Woodcock of the Federal Aviation Agency at Anderson
stated unequivocally that he found no trace of radio-
activity on Mr. when he based it with a
Geiger counter. Mr. Woodcock informed personnel at
Warner Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, of this incident,
and it was investigated by personnel at that Base. The
phenomena was determined to be St. Elmo's fire. The
report was not forwarded to the investigating office at
Wright Patterson since it was evaluated on the same and
there was no need for additional investigation.

The Air Force will continue its investigation of
unidentified flying objects as directed from the Department of Defense. Reports will continue to be analyzed and
evaluated, and releases made to the public when warranted.
