3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NAMES OF OBJECTS: - 
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 to 10 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground visual
7. COURSE: See case
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Case: Probable HOAX

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: 
The observer left his home to go UFO hunting. He stated that he saw photographs that his neighbor had taken of the object. The observer stated that there were heat waves around the object that he could not explain.
Comments: The observer was the only one to see the object and previously stated that he was going UFO hunting. The first photo was taken while the observer was talking on the telephone to the University of Colorado when he saw the object. The second photo was taken about a minute later. It is felt that the photo is a small one that is difficult to interpret as being real because the Air Force has made several previous photographic studies that were also questionable.
