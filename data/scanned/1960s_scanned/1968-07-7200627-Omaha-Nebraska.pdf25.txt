REFERENCE: Your letter of 14 February

TO: LT. COL. HECTOR QUINTANILLA

1. I enclose evaluation cards for all four cases requested, to be added to your current files. The Project Blue Book Office and files should prevent this in the future.

2. I suggest also, that all four cases be evaluated as unidentified.

3. While I concur with the descriptions in the categories, the one at Cocoran, Wisconsin seems the strongest, as would seem to be indicated by the response shown by the launching of a hot air balloon. I will send that information through NORAD.
