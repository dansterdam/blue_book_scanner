Text from the document:

Conder, being a game warden, has had numerous occasions to observe aircraft, both large and small. He has reported several incidents involving a star-like aerial light. The approx area where the sightings occurred was near BOM high school. The light was observed hovering at times, and at other times moving away at a high rate of speed. The witness has been very careful in his observations, and this was not one case of mistaken identity.

I am not disputing this war, although I'm somewhat uncertain because I'm unable to explatn the object in the sky, nonor, are some aspects of it explarable to me

The data reported familiar with weather balloons. This particular light, however, does not conform to the characteristics of weather balloons known to the witness. The phenomena is unlike anything the witness has previously observed and remains unexplained.
