The observer had sighted an object that had four blinking yellow lights on the bottom and two view slits. In her original letter, the observer stated that the UFO was the source. In her 17-page letter, she indicates it was the attention of anyone else. Apparently she sensed the fact that over 30 minutes of observation the object remained stationary.
