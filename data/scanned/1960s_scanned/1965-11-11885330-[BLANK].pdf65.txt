START Cerenkov cutoff do provide a fairly short energy spectrum for the proton. The proton energy could be roughly described as 150 Â± 50 MeV, which would include 65 % of the proton flux. The gain in eliminating the momentum analysis would be the increase in flux from shortening the total length of the apparatus as well as a reduction of the balloon weight through the elimination of a superconducting magnet and spark chambers. The analysis of such events would proceed more quickly, without having to make the emulsion measurements for momentum information. A combination of the above alternatives would lend to a variety of balloon flights of a modest nature in terms of balloon loads, but capable of providing valuable physics data.
