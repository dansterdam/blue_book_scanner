My girlfriend and I were driving back from Dayton, Ohio on the night of August 5, 1968, at approximately 10:30 p.m. We were traveling north on Interstate 75 about ten miles south of Dayton when I noticed a strange object in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but as we drove closer, it became apparent that it was not a star, but a large, brightly lit object. The object appeared to be stationary and was hovering over the highway. As we got closer, the object started to move and it became clear that it was not an ordinary aircraft. 

It had a pearl-like glow and seemed to be about the size of a medium-sized plane. As it moved, it appeared to be spinning or rotating. The object then moved rapidly upwards and to the right, coming to a stop and remaining stationary for several minutes. It then moved downwards and to the left, all the while maintaining its pearl-like glow. We continued to watch the object for approximately 20 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. 

I was very excited by what I had seen and I hope that this report will be helpful and that you can identify what the object was. I would be happy to provide any additional information that may be required. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
