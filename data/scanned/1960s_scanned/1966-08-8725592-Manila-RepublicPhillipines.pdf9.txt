Request for UFO information

5th Weather Reconnasiance Squadron

1. This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Clark Air Force Base FTR-2256 ARDC FLIGHT INFORMATION REPORT dated 11 August 1966. The information which we received was not sufficient for evaluation, therefore additional information is requested and should be forwarded to our office for further consideration.

a. Major H. P. Larscall, Squadron Pilot  
b. Captain M. P. Wasvar, Beacon Pilot
c. 1st Lt R. E. Wasvar, Instructor Navigator
d. 1st Lt R. E. D. Haiman, Weather Observer
e. Capt F. V. Horry, Jr., Flight Planner, Preponds Operator
f. 2nd Lt C. R. Seator, Student Preponds Operator
g. AIG Sr. J. Siguercy, Flight Mechanic

2. This report indicated that Capt. Larsoall had taken 35mm photos of UFO's. He enclosed the negatives but we are unable to evaluate their suitability due to also enclosing the unprocessed negatives for evaluation, and no prints were submitted. Thus, resubmitting the negatives through proper channels would be required for further consideration.
