Captain Wright is of the opinion that the object was not a meteor, It was traveling at about half mile per second. He thinks it could be an experimental missile or some unknown object. He seemed to be quite convinced that the object was not a missile or any known type of aircraft. He described the object as being cigar shaped and greenish in color. It seemed to be surrounded by some type of luminous glow. The object was observed for approximately one minute.
