The text in the document states:
"Project is the look self written offs on 11/7/68. 

The man's name was AC 730, I'm glad my father to him in the car was a little rocked. He said, much damage shows a jet by call which way very dark and very clearly, so it is only a few inches. That it could have been avoided, or some things affected was. Possibly someone drove on. Those that run, are used to have. Even I, why was very high 5 1/3 about let by as a flight star. I do this through a woman. Of about 1:20 I've around it trough as to what are some facts probably was be determined but as is."

This appears to be a handwritten report documenting some kind of UFO or unexplained aerial incident that occurred on November 7, 1968 in North Merrick, New York.
