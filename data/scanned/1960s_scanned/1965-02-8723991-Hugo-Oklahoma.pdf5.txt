The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document or letter from the "Air Force Dept. U.F.O." addressed to "Dear sir".

The text in the document is as follows:

Air Force Dept. 
U.F.O.
Dear sir:
I have been a believer in Unidentified Flying Objects for a long time. Could I have more information on this as people who believe in U.F.O.'s are crazy. If this is true then I am as crazy as a loon. If it is possible I would like to have a picture of a group of U.F.O.'s in formation.
Thank you,
