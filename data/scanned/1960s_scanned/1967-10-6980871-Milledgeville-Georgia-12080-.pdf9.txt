SYNOPSIS: At approximately 2215 hours on 6 October 1967, an oblong,
white light was observed in the sky northeast of Milledgeville,
Georgia, by a civilian man. The object moved in a straight line at
a very high speed and then disappeared. After about 2 to 3 minutes,
it reappeared, hovered briefly, and then disappeared again. No
sound was heard. The observer believes the object was a UFO.
