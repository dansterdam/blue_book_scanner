Referring from Camden M.S. see report 26 355 heading tee in & circular object 1 going fast to a large size then rapidly changing into a long slender shape appearing to a large size then rapidly changing into a long slender shape reappearing at a distance again getting smaller to a pge size & then disappear with different maneuvers seemingly through the center of the field. Its motion was extremely fast with the changing size & shape, it left no trail & I could not hear a sound from it though I was well within possible sound range. It passed over the field perhaps a half mile away & I had a perfect view of its performance.
