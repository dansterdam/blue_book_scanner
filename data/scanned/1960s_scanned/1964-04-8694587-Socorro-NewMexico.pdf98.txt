But realizing all that aside, the things that would seem to indicate sightings a hoax are the fact that no tracks coming to or going from the region were found, again within minutes. Objects and the FBI agent would have to have been placed, perhaps ropes, launching equipment, gas and perhaps a vehicle which would have been difficult to dispose of in a hurry and would have easily been planned to come off as a hoax.

You suggest that when known objects are mistaken for the real, the hoaxers are intrigued and see this as a chance to try and prove their point. I believe this has been the case quite frequently, but I do not believe it was the case here. It would not seem likely to me that a hoax of this magnitude would have been planned to take advantage of a mistake of identification. There simply would not have been time to set up what would have had to have been an elaborate ruse such as this.

By the way, there is no local UFO club. The UFO sightings had no more apparent pattern or evidence than has been evident in many other cases of this type. I cannot recommend to a man that he hold up his ridicule for having "seen things".

I continue also to be persistent that whatever it is thoroughly puzzling to me, I cannot recommend a man who in good faith wants to report something that he honestly doesn't understand to be ridiculed, criticized and even made to feel he is somehow a fool who has been taken in by a hoax.... I honestly don't think a small town patrolman could have manufactured a hoax of this sophistication and scale. Such efforts would have required far more organization, equipment and personnel than would reasonably have been available for such a rash and impulsive act.
