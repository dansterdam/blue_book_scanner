The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

Proposed reply to letter from:
Dear, 
Reference your recent observation of an unidentified flying object. Although a positive identification has not been made, it appears you probably observed an unusually bright meteor. The description, flight characteristics, etc. are very consistent with that of a meteor observation. Included is some information which should be of interest.
