Re: Sighting of 2 red lights over Gulf near
Miami, Florida

I was jogged on a neighbor's complaints of 2 bright red lights hovering over the Gulf of Mexico, off Miami Beach. It was reported that a bright red light disappeared over sea and a second one faded out in the distance. The lights were brighter than a car light, but not as bright as high intensity search lights. While still daylight, four jets were maneuvering over the area. The lights were unusual and were under observation for some time but faded out before dark. No sounds were heard.
