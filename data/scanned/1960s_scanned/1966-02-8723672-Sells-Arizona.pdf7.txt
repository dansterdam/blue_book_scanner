UFO REPORT - 2/18/66 - Medford, Massachusetts 

EVALUATION: (continued)

An object with the apparent size of 1/4" at an altitude of 10,000 feet was observed for about 30 feet in diameter. A second object similar in appearance to the first one was also observed. It appears to be 1/4" in diameter. The instrument package attached to the object did not appear to look round like a balloon to the witnesses but rather like a parachute. The object appeared to glide quickly, disappearing and reappearing in a matter of seconds. A policeman described it as silent and that it was not a balloon. The object began small, but it suddenly became larger as if it were a parachute unfolding.

The USAF took 5 minutes of prime news time on WNAC TV, Boston 6330 PM demonstrating a weather balloon launch from Hanscom AFB. It was very surprised that they had bothered to take the time and effort to do this. They never done this before in this area to the best of my knowledge.

Based on this information, groups of teenagers at various points around South Hadley, Massachusetts sighted a UFO described as looking like a "falling star" but smaller. There was one huge light, similar to a spotlight in front with strange markings. The sighting began at 10:00 and lasted until 11:00 PM.

CONCLUSION: - "PROBABLE WEATHER BALLOON"

Since the balloon was observed 15 minutes prior to the UFO sighting and since the wind was blowing in the direction that the UFO was headed, it is possible that the balloon in the appropriate observation that the UFO was headed. This have no choice, without further information but to classify this object as a weather balloon.

Interesting sidelights to this conclusion are the facts that the object seemed extremely low in order to have such a large apparent size; the instrument package seemed unusually large for the non-spherical shape; and the "strange markings" APPear to prove that it was not a weather balloon. The sound which was exceptionally loud and no aircraft was seen or heard is puzzling. It is true that the sound is heard while in the Sylvania complex as a training area, but I near this one clearly.

It is unfortunate that more data on the description of the object's size and maneuvers are not available. Both witnesses described a straight non-descending flight path.
