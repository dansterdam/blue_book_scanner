There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Proposed reply to letter from Mrs. ______, 10 September 1966

Dear Mrs. ______,

Reference your letter of 10 September 1966 in which you stated that you had photographs taken from the surface of the ocean into a sunset.

A photographic analysis of your color transparencies revealed the following: The photography provided indicates central refraction with an undetermined number of secondary refractions or reflections of the iris diaphragm in and on the optical system. The circles within the imagery shapes are defraction patterns.

This is a perfect textbook example of a camera imaging its own lens diaphragm.

We wish to thank you for enabling the Air Force to review the photographs. Please enclose your negatives and four 8 x 10 black & white enlargements.

G.F.
