The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document describing a series of tests using balloon-like objects conducted by NASA's Wallops Island facility. The text describes the key details of the balloons, including their size, materials, and uses for radar tracking and wind velocity measurement. The document is labeled "Memo for the Record" and provides technical details about this experimental project.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

BALLOON:
1. Wallops Island, NASA, is conducting a series of tests, using balloon-like balloons in an experimental project. Balloons are manufactured by the G.T. Schjeldahl Co. (Schill-dahl) of Northfield, Minnesota. The balloons are 14.7 to 15.5 feet long, four inches in diameter, metallized mylar plastic, and the balloons have 3 inflated fins off the tail. Balloon can drift for several hundred miles, depending on winds. Balloons have serial numbers, and Design Release Numbers.
2. The G.T. Schjeldahl Co. also manufactures another type balloon. This balloon is approximately two meters in diameter (about 6 feet), pressurized mylar plastic, and has 3" high projection horns, spikes, reflectors for radar tracking. Used to measure wind velocity before a launch. Have supplied 1500 of these balloons to the Marshall Space Center.
