There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The image appears to be a questionnaire or form containing a series of questions to be answered by the observer.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. Were the object's size. Hold a match or a man's length in line with it and estimate its size in relation to the match or man's length. If you had performed this experiment, what was the apparent size of the object compared to the match or man's length?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
