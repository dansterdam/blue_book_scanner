There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text from the document is as follows:

"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 25 July 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object I sighted might have been a very extremely bright flashing light. It only had Bright flashing lights.

Please reply and tell me what conclusion you can to or what you think the object was. Thank you."
