This is a call to Wichita, Kansas, Wichita Weather Station, Municipal Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209. Observer was John Bockley on 2 Aug 65 supervisor was Tillie Pike.

John Bockley, radar technician was on duty. Could be correlated with something on ground. Same direction as object which were observed. Motion seen near motion was too erratic movement, aid to side. Never able to observe a speed greater than 50 mph. Film had been sent to Ashville North Carolina.  This IGT 6526, Roll IGT 6557 is in camera now but will take it out and mail it anyway.  They would appreciate a copy of this when we request it from Ashville.  

Observed objects from about 20 minutes till 2 am (1:30 am) last one spotted from the ground 530 am, 2 Aug, in the South quadrant, from Caldwell, 135 degrees to Vinfield, 1435 degrees. 

The object was sighted in daylight at 5:00 am by police officers. Four or five were in the area. It was in the east or southeast, radar was on 50. Had one or more from 35 early in the morning. There might be something on the film. It has the tendency towards an incoherent echo but they were coherent. Never had any returns like this before. Had been on this radar since 1950. These objects appeared different than ground targets. Outran had object. This aircraft, between 3 - 9,000 ft., looked like a/c target moving northward. Passed just like a/c traveled northward, did not plot a speed, but it was moving rapid, estimate speed at 40 - 50 mph, had 38 knots.
