The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

THE FIRST TIME THE PHENOMENON WAS SIGHTED THE OBS ESSION LASTED FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS.
THE SECOND TIME THE PHENOMENON WAS SIGHTED THE OBSERVATION LASTED FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES.
BOTH TIMES THE DISK MOVED TO A PARTICULAR POSITION AND A PROBE OR CRANE-LIKE EXTENSION CAME OUT.
MANY OTHER DETAILS WHICH THE OBSERVER FELT WERE IMPORTANT WERE MENTIONED, BUT APPARENTLY NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.
