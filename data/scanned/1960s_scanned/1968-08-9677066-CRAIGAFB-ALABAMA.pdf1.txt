10. CONCLUSION OTHER ROCKET LAUNCH
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS Approximately 20 flight line personnel sighted a white light that seemed to be emitting blue-green waves. These waves got brighter and the waves progresser outward in a spiral. The light was observed at approximately 2 to 3 degrees above the horizon for approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes. The light remained in relatively the same position and after about three minutes suddenly blinked out. COMMENTS: The sighting was almost undoubtedly caused by a rocket launch from Cape Kennedy.
