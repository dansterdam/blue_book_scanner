The text in the document reads as follows:

When I saw it first, it was angled at about 45° angle, and I spotted it because it was reflecting sunlight. I watched it for a few minutes then it straightened out to the edge on, and I could get about see the edges. After another 2 or 3 minutes it took off, not straight up but at a 70° or 80° angle and was gone from sight quickly at incredible no sound. I could hear or no vapor trail. I am convinced I saw a flying saucer. The same police official or an authority on aircraft, may say I saw an ordinary aircraft taking off for landing, but I never heard of a commercial airplane that can hover, take off straight up, and disappear at incredible speed with no sound.
