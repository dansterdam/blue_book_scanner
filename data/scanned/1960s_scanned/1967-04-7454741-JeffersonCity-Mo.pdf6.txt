next to mine here - he, if there's anything seen why he'd be the one to see it, and yet, the Patrol has sort of an 'official-unofficial' attitude of "Don't see them", you know? But these guys would tell me, and if anything comes up, you'd never hear about it otherwise.
Yes, that's it. The only way we can get information is essentially from private sources.
That's about right. The state will not cooperate.
Now that's quite right.
I wonder if the Air Force even would if it came to somebody seeing one in their ranks.
Well, this is problematical, alright. Say, I do want to thank you for taking this time, and again, let me say that I'm sorry that something slipped up and we didn't get together.
Well, I honestly - on my honor I did not receive word. If I had I would have been there, as in fact Jack & I, the patrolman and I were ready to meet you . .
Golly that's a shame.
When I didn't hear from you I though, well this gentleman is obviously run into some consequences which could not be helped and he didn't let me know exactly when you would be coming in - you did, but I didn't receive it.
Well, I'm glad I called for several reasons, tonight. One of them is certainly that we got that straightened out. I was really looking around for you at the airport and wondering - I thought that something had gone wrong in your plans had suddenly changed.
Oh no, when I tell someone I'll be someplace, I'll be there unless something like this happens where I'm either not notified when to be there
