Citation in connection with his election to the corresponding membership of the Academy of Sciences and award of the Lenin prize it is stated that he is in charge of a large theoretical and experimental section of the CAGS. Members of this section carry out astrophysical investigations utilizing the largest optical and radio telescopes, cosmic rockets, and artificial satellites ("Zemlya i Vselennaya," 1966, Nr 5, p 3).

Research at the GAISH of interest in the present connection is carried out by N.S. Kardashev, G.B. Shklomskiy and other associates of Shklovsky. They are observing radio galaxies of the quasar type with radio instruments of FIAN (Physical Institute of the Academy of Sciences) on the wavelength 32.5 cm with a view of locating artificial sources.

Quasars are very small objects appearing like stars but with masses approaching those of galaxies. All this is not certain at all and there is no agreement in the interpretation of the observations. The smallness of the apparent size of quasars, which is of the order of 1", is according to Kardashev, a good indication of the possibility of their artificial origin.

It is impossible to say just what practical results of a program like this could be. Kardashev's attempt to explain the periodic fluctuations in the radio emission of source STA-102.
