GIVEN ANY INDICATION OF THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY; (2) THERE HAS BEEN
NO EVIDENCE SUBMITTED TO OR DISCOVERED BY THE AIR FORCE THAT SIGHTINGS
CATEGORIZED AS UNIDENTIFIED REPRESENT TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OR PRINCIPLES
BEYOND THE RANGE OF PRESENT DAY SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE; AND (3) THERE HAS BEEN
NO EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT SIGHTINGS CATEGORIZED AS UNIDENTIFIED ARE
EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLES.
"THE AIR FORCE WILL CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE ALL REPORTS OF UNUSUAL
AERIAL PHENOMENA OVER THE UNITED STATES. THE SERVICES OF QUALIFIED SCIENTISTS
AND TECHNICIANS WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED TO INVESTIGATE AND ANALYZE THESE
REPORTS, AND PERIODIC REPORTS ON THE SUBJECT WILL BE MADE.
"THE AIR FORCE TAKES NO STAND ON WHETHER OR NOT EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE
COULD OR DOES EXIST. SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT
THE UNIVERSE CONTAINS LIFE ON PLANETS OTHER THAN OUR OWN. THE AIR FORCE
CONTINUES TO EXTEND AN OPEN INVITATION TO ANYONE WHO FEELS THAT HE POSSESSES
ANY EVIDENCE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL VEHICLES OPERATING WITHIN THE EARTH'S NEAR
SPACE ENVELOPE TO SUBMIT HIS EVIDENCE FOR ANALYSIS."
