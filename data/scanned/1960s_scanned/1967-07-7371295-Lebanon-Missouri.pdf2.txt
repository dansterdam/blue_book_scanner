1. This replies to your recent letter which was unanswered. We appreciated learning of your unusual experience of 10 July 1967, and will add this information to our current files.

2. It is important that a witness report his observation as soon as possible to enable Air Force investigators to make an evaluation of the sighting and determine if it has significant scientific data. At this late date, however, little additional information can be obtained.

3. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

G. VICTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
