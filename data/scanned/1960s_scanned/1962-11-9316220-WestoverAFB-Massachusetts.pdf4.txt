PART ELEVEN: R. SAULTER, INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 99 BOMB WING (SAC): AT FIRST ANALYSIS, THE DESCRIPTION SEEMS TO FIT A STORY USING AN AFTERBURNER; HOWEVER, A CHECK OF ALL LOCAL FIGHTER UNITS IN THE VICINITY INDICATES THAT NO SUCH AIRCRAFT WERE AIRBORNE AT THE TIME. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A FIGHTER FROM AN AIRFIELD OUTSIDE THE LOCAL AREA WAS OPERATION HERE. HOWEVER, THE CLOUD COVER WOULD INDICATE THAT HE WAS VERY LOW AND THIS WOULD NOT BE A NORMAL ACTIVITY FOR THIS TIME OF NIGHT. PART TWELVE: L. NONE.
