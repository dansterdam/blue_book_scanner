10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
The object was one to four inches in diameter. It was seen traveling in a straight line and it disappeared by simply blinking out. There was no trail and no sound. The object or objects were seen by several people, but no one could determine what they were.

11. COMMENTS:
Due to the lack of incorporating witness testimony and the questionable elements involved, this case does not warrant a detailed investigation or analysis. To attempt anything else would be unwise as there is insufficient data for evaluation.
