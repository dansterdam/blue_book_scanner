There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a scanned page from a document, which appears to be a Project Blue Book report. As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text from the document:

REEORT 2-3
UFO REPORT 23 OCT 64
WITNESSES:
Mrs. Carney and her daughter Barbara, age 23.

SIGHTING:
Mrs. Carney and her daughter Barbara were in the family car on Old Lowell Road in Westford, Massachusetts on Tuesday, October 13, 1964, when they saw an object approximately 2-3000 feet high. They got out of the car and observed the object for about 45 minutes. They saw four lights, white, orange, and blue-green in color, which appeared to be on the side of the object. The object moved slowly at a constant speed and then accelerated rapidly up and out of sight.

EVALUATION:
Mrs. Carney and her neighbors have had a little share of UFO sightings before. They have reported 1-2 sightings within the past year.

CONCLUSIONS:
The observer's credibility in this case appears to be good. The object described does not conform to any known aircraft and cannot be explained as a result of natural phenomena. This case remains unexplained.
