6 June 1961

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

I have your letter of June 1st in hand. 

The object sighted near Wisconsin "saucer" landing was investigated by a member of this office from the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories, who is an experienced astronomer and astrophysicist.

We obtained two pieces of the so-called "space cake" and had specific analysis of these cases made in our laboratories. This information will be made available for any subsequent investigations or interested parties.

I hope this information will be helpful.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.
