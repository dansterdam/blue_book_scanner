The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document, but it does not contain any photograph. Instead, it shows a form with handwritten text and a redacted signature.

The form contains the following text:
"Please continue mention it was reported only city, where.

This appears to be a continuation of a UFO sighting report, with details about the duration and time of the sighting. The text does not identify any individuals and only provides a general description of the sighting.
