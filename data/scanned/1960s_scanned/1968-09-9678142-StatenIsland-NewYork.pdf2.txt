The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate UFO sightings.

Text from the document:

Dear Mr. -:

This replies to your letter of September 30, 1968, in which you reported that you had seen some unidentified flying objects.

Without additional information, I cannot offer an explanation of what you observed. However, if you are still interested in this matter, the staff at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, will be able to discuss it with you.

Should you have other sightings of unidentified flying objects, please report them to the Chief of Staff, Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, as such reports are essential to the on-going UFO investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking into the sightings of others reported to USAF in the area. I hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. DIXON
MAJOR, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Directorate of Information Division
Office of Information
