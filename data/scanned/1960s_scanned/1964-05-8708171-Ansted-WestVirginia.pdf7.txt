"May 25, 1964
Ansted, W. Va.

To whom it may concern,
Dear Sir:

At approximately 9:30 P.M. on the evening of May 25, 1964, to the northwest of the City of Ansted, I saw a falling object. It was a ball of fire and seemed to be 2 to 3 feet in diameter with a tail of approximately 50 feet. My object was traveling southeast.

Shortly, before a jet had passed was humming of a high pitch because it was as bright as a welding arc, a glow may have been more the description. I did not see if there was a trail in the sky.

This falling object could have been a rocket, a satellite, or a meteorite. In all probability, it was too bright to be a satellite, and it moves too slow to be a meteor. I have seen some strange things in my many years but this was the most spectacular.

Sincerely,
[Signature]"
