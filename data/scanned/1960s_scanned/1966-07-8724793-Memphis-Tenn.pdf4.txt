Airforce Traffic Control Tower
Memphis, Tennessee

Mr. * * * *
Metairie, Louisiana

Dear Mr. * * * *

This is in reply to your letter of August 19, 1966, concerning an unidentified flying object observed by you in the vicinity of Memphis, Tennessee.

The established procedure for handling UFO reports is to refer them to the Project Blue Book office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. I feel the circumstances warrant forwarding your personal account of this observation directly to the appropriate authorities, and I am doing so.

In your letter you described what appeared to be a brilliantly lighted aircraft at a considerable distance. This is consistent with the information reported by the control tower personnel. They reported seeing an extremely bright lighted object at a high altitude moving rapidly from west to east across the sky. It was viewed as almost directly overhead for a brief period. So far as I have been able to determine, there were no aircraft known to be in the area at that time which could account for the observation.

Viewed from the angle at which you observed it, I believe it would have appeared as described. I have this assumption on the fact that the first sighting is reported in Memphis the control tower alone reported a sighting at about 10:30 PM CST the same evening, of an extremely bright light at high altitude moving rapidly from west to east.

Since I cannot be sure that this was the object you observed, I am forwarding a copy of your report to the appropriate military authorities for further investigation and processing. In view of your officer, I would appreciate it if you would make a copy of your report available to me for my own records.
