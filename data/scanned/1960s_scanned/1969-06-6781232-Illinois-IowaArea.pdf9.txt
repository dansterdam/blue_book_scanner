DEAR SIRS:

I am man-old and live in Nelsonville, Ohio. Just recently I had an experience I would like to share with you. It happened on May 24, 1964 on my way home from South Carolina. I was traveling northward.

As I approached Nelsonville, Ohio, I noticed something very strange in the sky. At first I thought it was a commercial airplane, but as it drew closer I could see that it was not. It was a huge, circular, disk-shaped object that seemed to be hovering or floating in the air. It had a large dome on top and was giving off a brilliant white light. The object appeared to be about 200 to 300 feet in diameter. 

As I continued to watch, the object began to move slowly in a northeasterly direction. It continued on this course for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated to an unbelievable speed and disappeared from sight. I was absolutely amazed and dumbfounded by what I had witnessed. 

I have thought about this experience many times since then, and I am convinced that what I saw was some kind of unidentified flying object. I would appreciate any information you could provide about similar sightings in this area.

Sincerely,
[Signature]
