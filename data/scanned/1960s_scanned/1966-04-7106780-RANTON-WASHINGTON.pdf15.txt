26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common subject or object which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The object appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape, silver or white in color, and appeared to be fluttering or moving in a rapid, erratic manner. It appeared to be moving much faster than any commercial aircraft and would occasionally stop and appear to hover for a few seconds before resuming its rapid movements. It seemed to be reflecting the sunlight and was easily visible despite the hazy overcast sky conditions at the time.
