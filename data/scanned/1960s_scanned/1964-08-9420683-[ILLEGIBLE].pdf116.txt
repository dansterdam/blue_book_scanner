Transcription of the text in the document:

During the past few months I have received three different UFO reports which struck out at me somewhat vividly because of the detailed plots and description of the characters. The first was a "UFO(?)" this advertizing plot and description of characters was handed to me by a man named Richard P. watch, who, in his sketch of times given me by the pilot, saw approximately the advertising plot in this case going by at various stations as flight altitude was checked and I have found little resemblance to the actual facts.

If the times and flight path given me by the witness were correct, I would have had to believe that this object was travelling at a very high rate of speed about 3 minutes from the time it was first sighted until it disappeared. Richard watched the UFO however for about three minutes and the object shown in his sketch was clearly seen.

CONCLUSION: After examining the witness and checking out the approximate landing or near landing site personally, I do not think that this sighting or observation can be classified as an actual UFO. The such of the information, the descriptions, and the identification all tend to suggest that this sighting was of a conventional aircraft rather than an identified flying object. It was dusk when this was observed, as suggested by the witness and the details lead me to conclude that this sighting was of a conventional aircraft or some other identification. I am confident that this sighting was not that of an unidentified flying object.
